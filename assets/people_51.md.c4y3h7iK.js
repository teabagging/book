But I would recommend that you read it on the page, it is a compelling journey into the dark side of an American family, and I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"The great bulk of Eugene O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933, a period which saw him win Pulitzer Prizes for Beyond The Horizon, Anna Christie, and Strange Interlude as well as create The Emperor Jones, The Hairy Ape, Desire Under the Elms, The Great God Brown, and Mourning Becomes Electra. But around 1933 O'Neill--who struggled against physical ailments, alcoholism, and a host of personal demons--fell silent.Although O'Neill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, he would remain silent for some ten years, leaving most to believe he had written himself out, was burned out, that his career was over. But in spite of tremendous personal issues, O'Neill continued to write in private, and during this period he would generate a string of powerful plays, many of which would not be released for performance until after his death in 1953. The legendary Long Day's Journey Into Night, closely based on his own family life, was written in the early 1940s. It was first performed in 1956--some three years after his death--at which time it too won the Pulitzer Prize.The play presents the story of the Tyrone family. James Tyrone is a famous stage actor, now aging; his wife Mary is a delicately beautiful but sadly worn woman named Mary. Their two sons are studies in contrast: Jamie, in his late 30s, is wild--fond of wine, women, and song--and seen as a bad influence on younger Edmund, who is physically frail but intellectually sharp. The action takes place at their summer home, and begins in the morning; the family seems happy enough--but clearly there is something we do not know, something working under the surface that gives an unnatural quality to their interaction.Over the four acts and next four hours the morning passes into afternoon, the afternoon into night. And we will learn the truth: the history of money grubbing, the alcoholism, the drugs, the personal failures, the seemingly endless cycle of self-defeating, self-destructive behavior in which the four are locked beyond hope of redemption. And as it progresses the play gathers itself into an almost unendurable scream of agony, a scream of truly cosmic proportions.Why, you might ask, would someone wish to read--much less sit through--such a play? A work so painful that it often becomes difficult to continue reading or to look at the stage? I myself asked this question when I first encountered it. Over the years I have done quite a bit of theatre. In the early 1980s I played the role of Edmund; in the late 1990s I played the role of Jamie. On both occasions I found the play horrifically painful to perform. On both occasions I wondered if such a painful play could find an audience in small-town America. On both occasions Long Day's Journey Into Night sold out and not a person left the theatre before each performance ended.Because, I think, the play taps into something that is universal but which is extremely difficult to express in simple terms. As O'Neill might say himself, it has a touch of the poet--but of a failed poet. Somehow, in some unique way, it speaks to the self-knowledge we all have of the hidden dreams that never came true, the little accommodations, the big and small failures that have stung us and changed us and over time made us--for better or worse--the beings that we are. It has humanity. It makes us see our own humanity. It makes us acknowledge the humanity of those around us.Many, myself among them, regard this as O'Neill's finest play--and considering the great power that many of his works have, that is saying a great deal. It is also in some respects one of his most accessible plays: shorn of the experimentalism to which O'Neill was frequently drawn and beautifully simple, beautifully direct, even those unaccustomed to reading playscripts will find it a rapid and powerful read. For this reason it is really the only O'Neill script I recommend to casual readers. And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed. A great drama, both on the page and on the stage.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Long Day's Journey into Night is the play in which Eugene O'Neill, as he says in the dedication, had to &quot;face [his] dead at last&quot; by writing about the tragic dysfunctions of James, Mary, Jamie, and Edmund Tyrone, characters based respectively on O'Neill's father, mother, and brother, and O'Neill himself. It is set entirely at the O'Neill residence and takes place over the course of the day on which the family doctor confirms that 23 year-old Edmund has tuberculosis and must go to a sanatorium. There is relatively little action in the play aside from that; most of the dialogue relates to the other members of the Tyrone family facing the various problems that haunt them every day of their lives: Mary is addicted to morphine; Jamie is an alcoholic and at 33 seems unlikely to amount to anything; and James also has an alcohol problem but more importantly is still bitter about his childhood, which was cut short when he was obliged to go to work at a machine shop at the age of 10 because of the departure of his father.The whole Tyrone family is in a state of despair, and it's hard to think of an author better at capturing despair than O'Neill (in no small part, one suspects, because he came of age in the sort of environment depicted in this play). O'Neill was certainly bitter about his past, but, importantly, he doesn't lose perspective. Although the way the Tyrones treat each other ranges from neutral to downright cruel, O'Neill does a splendid job of balancing this against the fact that they all love each other deeply and feel very unnerved whenever they realize that they're treating each other unfairly. Despite all the problems he faced as a young adult, O'Neill always viewed his family with a good deal of love and reverence, and that comes through in the play. As Mary puts it, &quot;None of us can help the things life has done to us. They're done before you realize it, and once they're done they make you do other things until at last everything comes between you and what you'd like to be, and you've lost your true self forever.&quot; The tragedy of Long Day's Journey into Night lies in the fact that these great individuals have lost their true selves due to the various demons that haunt their lives.Some of O'Neill's works could reasonably be criticized for featuring relatively one-dimensional characters and formulaic plots. In the case of Long Day's Journey, though, because O'Neill was able to rely on his own experiences, all four main characters are exceptionally deep and balanced, and the plot is distinctly unpredictable. Though I've very much enjoyed all the O'Neill plays I've read, it seems that in Long Day's Journey he finally put together all his talents and produced his crowning achievement."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"I read the play when I was 19. I stumbled upon it on a dime rack at the library. One day, I was moving and had some time on my hands until the movers arrived to haul away my stuff. I pulled out my copy and was never the same again. I sat on the floor and read from the late morning to dusk--when the light was no longer sufficient to read by. I hadn't noticed that my shoulder had begun to ache or that my throat was screaming for water, I was absorbed in the play as if I was receiving a vision. Anyone who claims that the play is not well-written doesn't understand literature, nor have they seen the staged production. (I'd highly recommend the movie with Katherine Hepburn). The honesty of the playwright will put you through an emotional ringer that is difficult to detach yourself from long after the reading is done. The fog horn, the deception, the cutting words of the players all haunt your dreams. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"It's a gloom play with conversations full of anger, rage and sarcasm, grief and sorrow. It's the story of a family whose members have lost every connections between each other, four characters that desperately seek a last vestige of love to be confronted only with disappointment in the end. It's an autobiographical play, too. I read the book late at night, sometime after midnight had passed, along with a couple of cigarettes and some wine. And it really got me. The feeling of being detached from everything else, to be utterly alone with yourself and the thoughts of your mind, it crept more and more on me with every page I turned. These are genuine wounds that bloom before our eyes like the flowers of torment and sometimes I meant to even hear the echo of the cries of the hurt when my heart beat faster. But if one doesn't want to open up to the sinister and absolutely melancholic atmosphere of the book I can well understand that..."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"If one needs the ultimate example of a classic American play, I would have to say the play about the most un-classic, untypical (or is it?) American family...Eugene O'Neill's \\"Long Days Journey Into Night.\\" Set in the chlostrophobic New England summer house of the Tyrone's, and spanning over the course of one day, the Tyrone family--the stingy, retired actor James, the lonely opium addicted wife Mary, drunken Jamie, and sensitive, ill Edmund--avoids, denys, confronts and retreats from all their demons, until it is finally night, and they no longer can.Depressing, huh? Well, of course it is...but within it is something so powerful, so strangely beautiful, that the reader (or viewer) is enthralled. One sees seemingly strong James, ashamed of himself for selling out his acting abilities for financial security. Mary, lonely from James' years of touring, has turned to an opium addiction that she can not seem to confront. Jamie, from hate of his father's stinginess and his own self-blame, loses himself in alcohol and whores. And sweet, artistic, tubulcular Edmund (O'Neill's alter ego) plays witness in the deteration of his family's web of pain, denial and lies. All they want is for morning to come, another day to let the fog come in around them so they can forget again.In a way, isn't that what we all want to do sometimes? Just forget what's going on around us, even for a while. I would recommend this play as absolutly essential to read--for the fan of the theatre, literature, or a layman. Anyone can relate to the pure, raw emotion and guilt O'Neill conveys. Buy it now, you'll thank me later."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"I haven't actually read a play since college and I picked this up because I am going to see the Broadway production of &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot;, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Dennhey,and I always find that I appreciate shows like that more if I am familiar with the play itself. It was an enjoyable genre change for me!What makes this play particularly interesting is the autobiographical nature of the plot (so disturbingly autobiographical, in fact, that O'Neill would not allow its publication and production until after his death!). O'Neill dedicated the play to his wife, basically stating that writing this was his way of coming to grips with his own past and the \\"4 haunted Tryrones\\" of his life. I imagine that when this first appeared in the theaters in the 1950s, it struck a sensitive and somewhat controversial chord amongst the public since issues such as drug addiction and alcoholism were not common topics in popular entertainment at the time. I also enjoyed all the literary references to the likes of Shakespeare, Baudelaire and Swineburne (and so forth!). It made me want to acquaint myself with such literary talents once again!This is another example of a piece of literature that reaches across the decades with timeless themes such as familial love, loyalty, jealousy, guilt and betrayal, as well as depression, addiction and greed. While I pitied and even despised some of the qualities I saw in these characters, I couldn't help empathizing with Mary's nervous addiction as well as James' feeling of disappointment in his past failures. In other words, these characters are all so human, that I couldn't help being drawn into the realistic pathos of their lives."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"There's a good reason O'Neill insisted that Random House not publish this play until 25 years after his death, which would have prevented its production until 1978. The characters and the story are painfully drawn from O'Neill's own family life. Even though his immediate family members had all died, he surely was concerned about the hurt it could cause his surviving relatives and the impact of memories shared by his close friends. Random House ultimately honored the agreement but, fortunately for the history of drama, O'Neill's wife allowed the play to be published by Yale University Press and produced on Broadway in 1956, only three years after his death.The volume is labeled here as a \\"second edition\\" but in truth it's simply a corrected edition that fixes relatively minor errors that were introduced in the 1956 publication. (Due to a production error, the first printing dropped a single line. The 61st printing in 1989 restored four lines that were dropped by the typist who retyped O'Neill's edited manuscript. Otherwise, it's the same play that was originally published fifty years ago.)The play's power comes not from its plot; there is hardly any action at all. Instead, one sees O'Neill's family living out a single and typical day. James Tyrone, Sr., has spent his entire life playing one role in a nationally popular play, much like James O'Neill (Eugene's father), who starred in an adaptation of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\\" appearing in some 4,000 performances between 1883 and 1912. Early in the play, Tyrone realizes that his wife, Mary, has suffered a relapse into her longtime morphine addiction. Similarly, just before he turned 13, Eugene O'Neill had learned of his own mother's morphine addiction (when she attempted to drown herself). The addiction, which lasted for more than a quarter of a century, resulted from the difficulties of Eugene's birth.The two sons are modeled on Eugene and his brother. The older Jamie is an amiable, shiftless loafer and an alcoholic in training. (The real Jamie entered a sanatorium after a bout of alcohol poisoning and died soon thereafter.) And the younger Edmund, of course, is Eugene himself, who worked as a seaman on various freighters, attempted to commit suicide in a Manhattan saloon soon after his return to the States, and returned home to learn he has tuberculosis.The play is set on a specific day in this family's life: the day Edmund finds out his diagnosis (which in Eugene's life would be in November 1912, only months before O'Neill began to write his first dramatic sketch). And it is certainly a long day's journey. O'Neill portrays his family brutally and lovingly: his mother is a ghost wandering the house in her dreamy universe; his father is a cheapskate concerned more about acquiring real estate than about spending a cent on his son's medical recovery; the brother begins drinking early in the morning and stumbles home nearly 24 hours later. Edmund is lost in his poetic musings.And all four of them manage constantly to get on each other's nerves with well-practiced rituals of selfishness, denial, argument, insult, and forgiveness. Their incessant banter and taxing squabbles don't always read well on the page; that professional performances of the play don't wear on the audience is a testimony to O'Neill's mastery of the dramatic form. It is, I think, O'Neill's best work."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Before dysfunctional families became talk show circus acts, they were used as morality tales to warn us about the wages of sin. When that dysfunctional family is a playwright's own, and when that playwright is as gifted as Eugene O'Neill, we get a work of genius that makes other morality plays look like cartoons.Firstly, a warning: this is an utterly depressing work. It doesn't contain anything upbeat. The characters start at bleak and chart a passage to despairing. If you are the kind of person who can't stand angst, then this play is not for you. Long Day's Journey works on countless levels and addresses themes of surpassing worth, but pretty it is not. I can understand why some people would hate it. What I don't understand is why they would read it in the first place.Now for the good stuff. This is a play that addresses sins like vanity, pride and self-deceit, but in a way that does not preach, beat its breast, or feel contrived. How characters of such obvious intelligence come to such a pass is what fascinates. Through the course of the play, we come to see that talent, brains and social standing are insufficient to life's sustenance; the vital ingredient is sternness of character, and each of the protagonists in Long Day's Journey suffer from failings of character to a greater or lesser degree.The title is a poetic metaphor that echoes the course of the family's lives. Substitute 'suffering' for 'day' and 'hell' for 'night' and you will get a clear picture of the play's progression. It observes not only the classical unities of time, action and place, but strives for the Shakespearean in its elocution. O'Neill's language is magnificent--he achieves a spare eloquence that meets the tenets of open verse. This re-infusion of poetry back into the playwright's craft is not the least of his achievements.Many existential plays achieve their thematic objectives by indulging in theatricality. Even good plays like \\"Death of a Salesman\\" or \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" suffer from a sense of artifice. But \\"Long Day's Journey\\" feels genuine to its core. This is not a product of the imagination, but a story from a master storyteller who is baring his own soul. These are his own demons on display and the pain we feel stems from the fact that two of those demons are his mother and his father.I don't know what it took for him to write this work. This is more a confession than a catharsis and one suspects that O'Neill derived no comfort or spiritual release from giving us this gift. We are the sole beneficiaries of his largesse, and this knowledge imparts a special sense of poignancy to the sympathy we already feel for its bent and wounded incumbents."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"As professor Harold Bloom asserts in his excellent forward: &quot;Eugene O'Neill is single handidly responsible for creating a vibrant and important American Theatre&quot;.LONG DAY'S JOURNEY caps a brilliant artistic life with an autobiographical work that is difficult, complex, tragic, heartbreaking and filled with stunning poetry.O'Neill's greatest gift was, arguably, his uncanny knack for spinning a poetic phrase. In a bold stroke, he populates the family Tyrone with a menagerie of fragile beings who find strength in language and discourse. It is little wonder that O'Neill demanded that LONG DAY's remain unproduced until after his death. He his boldly facing every personal and familial demon. With crashing honesty and a touch of jet-black humor, he leaves no stone uncovered as he weaves a horrifying tale of the ultimate dysfunctional family.LONG DAY'S JOURNEY into night is not for the weak of back or the faint of heart. It is depressing to be sure. But among the rubble of these tortured lives, O'Neill finds the spiritual strength in these flawed and fallen angels and creates true linguistic magic. A certain must own for any theatre fan or practitoner. Simply suberb theatre."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"There are many themes in this story - drug addiction, alcoholism, depression, egoism, and blame. What makes the play so powerful is its ability to show us a family with horrible problems and horrible habits, but still make that family likeable. We still hope for them. A heroin-addicted mother torments herself with the past. Her egomaniac husband, a washed-up actor, postures and struts to cover his feelings of responsibility. Their sons battle depression and alcoholism, and neither ever feel good about themselves. A cycle of blame makes its way continually through the house, a run-down affair often shrouded in fog. This fantastic (if depressing) play is a meaty, moody work that is almost as good to read as it is to watch."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Many, if not all, critics and English Lit professors consider this America's greatest play. And, having read and seen many American plays, it is. I recommend this to all with one caveat. Don't expect the night's end to bring a happy ending. Depression is a more likely reaction. O'Neill takes you, step by step, into the family's despair. As reader you will accept and believe every word.If you aren't aware, the play is largely autobiographical with each member of the Tyrones representing a member of the O'Neills. Each of the characters are representative of their real-life counterparts.Be prepared for an unusual amount of stage directions. Little is left for the director, set designer and the actors. All is spelled out. But how the actors make use of the instructions can make a performance, individually or overall, range from good to magnificent.On a slightly different note my favorite O'Neill and American play is \\"The Iceman Cometh\\"."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"This probably is my favorite play ever written -- so brutally honest and so emotionally draining that it just forces attention throughout."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"When Eugene O'Neill wrote this play in 1940, it was so autobiographical that O'Neill requested it not be published until twenty-five years after his death. When he died in 1953, all the other characters in the play had also died, however, and his wife allowed the play's publication in 1956. Despite O'Neill's three previous Pulitzer Prizes and his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, it is this play (also a Pulitzer winner) that he regarded as his most important work, an assessment with which historians and theatre-goers universally agree. Many (and I am one) also believe it is the greatest American play ever written.Long Day's Journey Into Night is a complete theatrical experience, satisfying on every level. Recreating his own family and its interactions, O'Neill's emotional connection with the characters is obvious in the roundness of their characterizations: there are no villains or heroes here. James Tyrone, modeled on his father, is an actor who found the \\"perfect play,\\" resulting in years of travel performing the same role. Permanently typecast and by now bored, James has earned a substantial salary but is considered a tightwad, unable to escape his memories of poverty. Mary Tyrone, his wife, to whom he is devoted, traveled with him when he performed, often leaving the children with family members. When her youngest child died in her absence, she blamed everyone for this accident. Edmund, modeled on O'Neill himself, was born after this, but Mary never recovered, and when an incompetent doctor prescribed drugs, she became blissfully addicted.The two sons, Jamie and Edmund, observe the interactions of their parents, their father losing himself in alcohol, their mother constantly re-addicting herself so she can live in a world without hurt, and they interact both with both parents and with each other. Jamie, considerably older than Edmund, regards himself as Edmund's protector, both from the outside world and from the sometimes hurtful relationships both have with their parents, who regard Jamie as a failure because of his drinking, and Edmund as a baby. Edmund, however, has traveled the world before returning home recently with a \\"bad summer cold,\\" obviously the early stages of tuberculosis, a reality his mother refuses to recognize. As he awaits an official diagnosis from a cut-rate doctor, Edmund tries to channel his feelings and his fears into the poems he writes.Though many gifted dramatists can make one or two characters come alive in a play, O'Neill does it here for all four characters, each of whom rings completely true. Their actions and conflicts arise from within, and the viewer becomes completely caught up in the dialogue and events on stage because they are so natural, so life-like. Though the play is about three and a half hours long, these are hours that fly by, the intensity of the family's internal conflicts totally involving, as the love underlying these conflicts and the hidden resentments which ignite them emerge at odd moments and create poignant scenes. Ironic humor, much more obvious in the hands of outstanding stage actors than in the written script, provides relief from the powerful tensions and keeps the play from ever appearing sentimental or melodramatic. The most moving theatrical experience I have ever had, this play is breathtaking, heart-rending, and utterly overwhelming.

I have noted there that Iceman Cometh is my favorite for a variety of reasons, some of them political. Journey, however, may be O'Neill best play and not only because it is somewhat autobiographical. The trials and tribulations of a dysfunctional family that is ultimately clueless about solutions to what ails each of the four characters (father, mother and two very unlike sons)is very much the stuff of modern drama. The intervention of the gods would seem out of place here.In O'Neill hands the tensions, misunderstandings and illusions presented are recognizable to today's audiences, even those who may themselves be troubled about finding solutions to some very disturbing problems. Althought this is a difficult play to read (and more difficult to watch performed)virtually everyone I know who has read and/or watch it has survived to the end. And was glad of it.

The characters have affection for each other, and express dreams and can recall successes as well as face their current, probably insurmountable problems.The addition of the background: having an autobiographical basis, published post-humously, from one of the leading American playwrights of his day, should make it required reading for a literate citizen. Frankly, I'm embarrassed I didn't read it until this year, when I'm nearly 50."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Eugene O'Neill saw success as an author during his lifetime. O'Neill was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes between 1920-1925. However, O'Neill's final and poignant piece Long Day's Journey into Night was first published in 1956-three years following his death. O'Neill requested that Long Day's Journey into Night be published twenty-five years following his death, due to its autobiographical nature, but his wife, Carlotta, never followed his request. Long Day's Journey into Night earned O'Neill his fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1957 posthumously.Long Day's Journey into Night is organized into four acts-morning, afternoon, evening, and night of a pivotal and difficult day for the Tyrone family. The characters Mary, James, Jamie and Edmund are seen as a typical family: loving and supportive, but also separate and unique. However, as the day progresses, O'Neill continuously alludes to severe problems within the family unit including drug addiction, depression, alcoholism, and a serious infectious disease, with increasing detail.Throughout the entirety of Long Day's Journey into Night the characters would further explain a past problem, through coded speech. For the Tyrone family, the past is never to be spoken of, but is always hanging around the next corner.I found that O'Neill's talent is shown through his ability to portray the complexities and the sensitive nature of his characters through their interactions. He is able to contrasts the powerful love they feel for one another with the unique bitter resentment they feel as a result of their difficult, emotionally draining lives. The ending of Long Day's Journey into Night ends with each character emotionally drained by the other members of the Tyrone family. Long Day's Journey into Night shows the Tyrone family continuously snapping at one another, making hurtful remarks and then recognizing the pain they have inflicted upon their love one, trying to lovingly make reparations. The interactions of the Tyrone family, remind me of a typical American/Canadian family.While O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night is a play to be witnessed through performance, O'Neill's eloquent writing style and knowledge of the stage allows the reader to create a picturesque portrait of the Tyrone family. While Long Day's Journey into Night is a purely honest recount of how the O'Neill family interacted with one another; it can be emotionally draining to read, due to the character's frequent emotional roller coaster. Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night offers its readers a better understanding of their own personal family life."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"In Long Day's Journey Into Night, O'Neill gives readers a tragic/comedic/suspenseful play which portrays a loving family experiencing the hardships that some family's must face throughout their lives. The play takes place during one August day in the 1900's in the Tyrone's summer home. A day that's outcome would change everything.One of the main reasons I believe the play was written so well is because of the connection to O'Neill's real life experiences. All of the characters in the play actually reflect O'Neill's real family, with the exception of Edmund who is really Eugene himself.Although the play is clearly meant to be dramatic, O'Neill offers some comedic relief to lighten up the mood at times, mostly from the 2 brothers (James and Edmund). I found it also very suspenseful the way O'Neill led on that something was wrong with the mother (Mary) but the reader doesn't receive any information on what exactly it is until one of the last acts, which for me made the play very interesting because I wanted to keep reading to learn exactly what was going on. I found the play very easy to read also because of the scene description at the beginning of every Act therefore, in the unfortunate event that you have not seen the play (like myself) the description helps you imagine exactly what the scene would look like.I also found the play very refreshing in the sense that it was not completely full of happiness and love, the family did not sail off into the sunset and live happily ever after.O'Neill delivers a very heartfelt tragedy, the play was written to be dramatic, with the mother's morphine addiction and her fall from rehabilitation, and also Edmund's sickness. However, with all of these obstacles the family must overcome the family clearly continues to love one another unconditionally. The reader can see how obvious this love is between the parents and the children, husband and wife and the boys to one another. Readers can see this because O'Neill wrote about something he knew much about, and wrote it from his heart. In his dedication to his wife O'Neill writes, \\"I mean it as a tribute to your love and tenderness which gave me the faith in love and enabled me to face my dead at last and write this play write it wish deep pity and understanding and forgiveness for all the four haunted Tyrones.\\" So it would seem as if O'Neill forgave his family which gave him the strength and courage to write one of the best stories I have ever read."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Mary says: \\"None of us can help the things life has done to us.

And it's just a shame that the entirety of the rest of the play is pure unadulterated banality. Frankly, I'm amazed at all the positive reviews. Dr. Big Balls hates it because the characters are so argumentative. Which is a good reason to hate it but not the best reason. I hate it because the characters are cartoon bores who insisted on boring me to tears with all of that painfully boring dialog. Have I mentioned that it's boring?. And how about that ludicrous shtick where Mary falls into a dope-fiend trance at the drop of a hat. I suppose it works as unintentional comedy.

He had actually wanted to block the book publication and stage production for 25 years after his death, due to its personal content. The play is presumed autobiographical, about his parents and brother and himself. Wife Carlotta overruled that time restriction. Maybe the man had verbally agreed. No matter now.This is one of his best. A family in dissolution. Father and two sons alcoholics, mother a junkie. Plus the youngest is consumptive. Facing truths is not everybody's cup of tea. Lies, suspicions and accusations damage a day. A good memory can be a burden.Deeply pessimistic, with a fatalism that might be typical for addicts who can't break the habit.The past is the present, isn't it?

I suggest you read it slowly."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Starting in the 1600s, America was known as the place to make it big, where one could make a decent and happy living if one just worked hard. Whether contrasted to the chaos of Revolutionary France, the abject urban poverty of Dickens' England, the abject rural poverty of Ireland, the militarization of German society or the civil strife of Russia; America was heaven on Earth, a place where one could live the life they wanted. This image gradually wore away by the early 1900's, and this disillusionment was captured in work after work of American literature. The Great Gatsby unveiled the decay of the super-rich, The Grapes of Wrath showed the pitfalls of the rural farmer, Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" revealed the horrors of industrialized society, and To Kill a Mockingbird forced us to confront the horror of Jim Crowe laws. But no work so fully and so subtly attacked the everyday failings and desperation of middle class America until this short classic by Eugene O'Neill. This story has no true protagonist or antagonist. Instead, it examines one middle-class family, the Tyrones, over the course of one day. The Tyrones live in their own house, and are financially independent. The parents are middle-aged. The husband is past his prime earning years, and his wife, Mary, is addicted to snuff. One son is an alcoholic womanizer, and the other is frail and probably a nervous wreck. Nobody is in danger of starvation or eviction, but the family as a whole has problems, with depression probably being universal. Everyone has personal failings that weigh on their souls, and each day is a struggle to get through without damaging relationships with each other. Hence the title of the book, a long day's journey into night. Night probably means death here, as noone in the family is going to die soon. The journey is the time they have to spend with each other and put up with each other. This fate, this tragedy probably afflicts more people around the world than any other, and that is to have to live with your failings and those of your loved ones. This book was published at the end of O'Neill's career, and is supposed to represent his family. Regardless of its intention, this is a great book, and of the few American classics that anyone around the world can understand."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"There are four of them. Father, Mother and two sons. This is just one day in their lives. Although there is no way of knowing for sure, you quickly get the impression that this day is not much different than yesterday or tomorrow. It's just another day of being a Tyrone. Trapped in their own mediocrity, the Tyrones do what most unhappy people do: Blame someone else. Mary blames her son Edmond for her addiction to morphine originally administered because of his difficult birth. Edmond and Jamie blame their career failures on their father's miserliness. Papa James sees his children as freeloaders and Mary as weak willed. Despite their angers and finger pointing, each views the family with a good deal of love and reverence. Mary says it best. \\"None of us can help the things life has done to us. They're done before you realize it, and once they're done they make you do other things until at last everything comes between you and what you'd like to be, and you've lost your true self forever.\\" There you have it. Long Day's Journey into Night is a snapshot of how it is to be held prisoner in a house of mirrors. Each mirror, is flashed at you by someone to whom you are bound, someone you love, someone you hate. You can deny all you want. You can argue that mirrors distort, but there is always another mirror. You could escape. Cut the chains. But, then what? This is your family. You're stuck. Bound to them. Trapped. When you are a Tyrone, there's only one solution. Only one thing to do! You get even."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"A Long Day's Journey Into Night by Eugene O'Neill is a short, autobiographical play that acts as a single snapshot into O'Neill's childhood. Focusing on issues rarely addressed in its day, A Long Day's Journey depicts the struggles within a family over alcoholism, drug addictions and the sickness and death of children. These subjects were frequently brought up in O'Neill's childhood, as his father and older brother were both alcoholics and his mother was addicted to drugs. O'Neill, himself, suffered from tuberculosis as did the character Edmund, who closely represents O'Neill in the play. An interesting detail to note would be that within the play, Edmund's mother and father talk about a son, named Eugene, who died years previously. It seems as though O'Neill tried to write himself out of a play he wrote about his childhood.A Long Day's Journey has four main characters: James, the father, Mary, the mother, Jamie, the older brother, and Edmund, the younger brother. The play begins and ends with all four characters conversing together, but the middle of the play focuses on conversations held between only two or three of the family members. This allows the present characters to speak freely about the absent ones and gives the audience a disturbingly real view of how characters feel about each other. This also makes the play, though autobiographical, unbiased in the information it gives its viewers. If the play were written from Edmund's point of view, we would not hear the other characters talking about him. This unbiased view is important in maintaining the realism of the play; every character gets to voice their fears, doubts, and opinions when others are not present, ensuring that the audience gets the raw truth.O'Neill's play is full of the raw truth. His father really was a famous actor and his mother was addicted to drugs. His childhood was spent, as mentioned in the play, traveling from hotel to hotel as his father toured the country. The complaints and arguments within the play were probably exhausted in O'Neill's childhood and he probably had many opinions of his own; but he still managed to leave himself out of his work, allowing his character to be represented without his person beliefs overruling those of his family. By giving each character opportunity to speak without judging what they have to say, and by writing himself in without making himself the star, makes this autobiography truly unique. A Long Day's Journey Into Night is a simple yet elegant snapshot of family life."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"When Eugene O'Neill wrote this play in 1940, it was so autobiographical that O'Neill requested it not be published until twenty-five years after his death. When he died in 1953, all the other characters in the play had also died, however, and his wife allowed the play's publication in 1956. Despite O'Neill's three previous Pulitzer Prizes and his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, it is this play (also a Pulitzer winner) that he regarded as his most important work, an assessment with which historians and theatre-goers universally agree. Many (and I am one) also believe it is the greatest American play ever written.Long Day's Journey Into Night is a complete theatrical experience, satisfying on every level. Recreating his own family and its interactions, O'Neill's emotional connection with the characters is obvious in the roundness of their characterizations: there are no villains or heroes here. James Tyrone, modeled on his father, is an actor who found the \\"perfect play,\\" resulting in years of travel performing the same role. Permanently typecast and by now bored, James has earned a substantial salary but is considered a tightwad, unable to escape his memories of poverty. Mary Tyrone, his wife, to whom he is devoted, traveled with him when he performed, often leaving the children with family members. When her youngest child died in her absence, she blamed everyone for this accident. Edmund, modeled on O'Neill himself, was born after this, but Mary never recovered, and when an incompetent doctor prescribed drugs, she became blissfully addicted.The two sons, Jamie and Edmund, observe the interactions of their parents, their father losing himself in alcohol, their mother constantly re-addicting herself so she can live in a world without hurt, and they interact both with both parents and with each other. Jamie, considerably older than Edmund, regards himself as Edmund's protector, both from the outside world and from the sometimes hurtful relationships both have with their parents, who regard Jamie as a failure because of his drinking, and Edmund as a baby. Edmund, however, has traveled the world before returning home recently with a \\"bad summer cold,\\" obviously the early stages of tuberculosis, a reality his mother refuses to recognize. As he awaits an official diagnosis from a cut-rate doctor, Edmund tries to channel his feelings and his fears into the poems he writes.Though many gifted dramatists can make one or two characters come alive in a play, O'Neill does it here for all four characters, each of whom rings completely true. Their actions and conflicts arise from within, and the viewer becomes completely caught up in the dialogue and events on stage because they are so natural, so life-like. Though the play is about three and a half hours long, these are hours that fly by, the intensity of the family's internal conflicts totally involving, as the love underlying these conflicts and the hidden resentments which ignite them emerge at odd moments and create poignant scenes. Ironic humor, much more obvious in the hands of outstanding stage actors than in the written script, provides relief from the powerful tensions and keeps the play from ever appearing sentimental or melodramatic. The most moving theatrical experience I have ever had, this play is breathtaking, heart-rending, and utterly overwhelming. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Bloom's introduction frames this American masterpiece with precision and insight. In my opinion, O'Neill's best play, Long Day's Journey Into Night is better read than performed as the nuance and poetry of his stage direction and descriptions of gestures are what make this play extraordinary.

The fascinating dramatic play focuses on the life of an addicted, dysfunctional family that suffers greatly with their demons of the past. Eugene O'Neill's 1940 autobiographical story takes place in one long day and proceeds into the brooding night. It is a courageous account of the tortured soul and his haunted family.In a dedication to his wife, O'Neil writes, \\"I give you the original script of this play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\\"The setting is August 1912, at the summer home where the fog lays heavily, foghorns blow loud contrasting with the chime of bells. The mood is somber just like the symbolic recurring fog that impairs vision and obscures reality. The bells are symbolic of the convent where the main character Mary Tyrone was happiest.The focus of the family is Mary, 54, wife, mother of two sons, wife of Tyrone. At the beginning, we are left to imagine and second guess what is bothering Mary and later it is clearly defined that she is addicted to morphine. Mary lives in the past, where she was in a convent and had a dream to be a concert pianist.James Tyrone, 65, an alcoholic known by his family as a miser, and whose real concern was to invest money into property rather then family because of a nagging fear from his childhood days -the threat of the poorhouse. He was considered a handsome stage actor and regrets what he could have been,- a great Shakespearean actor.Jamie Tyrone - the elder 34 year old son, another alcoholic always labeled a loser by his parents. He has a love-hate relationship with his younger brother Edmund as Jamie's confesses that because of his own hatred of himself, his role was to make his younger brother a failure too.Edmund Tyrone - 24-year old son is a reader of great literature and an aspiring poet. He has tuberculosis and with concern wonders whether his miser father will send him to a shabby institution. Eugene O'Neill is the real-life character of Edmund.O'Neill provides readers with more than adequate stage direction; we get a real sense of the way we are to interpret the readings including the shifting moods. This is a book that keeps on going. It is superb. And if you ever want to see this play come alive, see the movie with Katherine Hepburn. Her remarkable portrayal of Mary was memorable! ....Rizzo"},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"It is the best. Read it and you will experience an AMERICAN bearing his soul as only Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Goethe could. For all the genius of Shakespeare's Hamlet and King Lear, none of his plays tore into who he actually was as honestly as O'Neill did in LDJIN. If you read this play, you will see the reality of four human beings as they actually are: free from the facades we put up everyday to make it through our lives, free from artifice. Only Tolstoy writes with this kind of emotional precision and depth.

It is a heartwrenching tale of a pair of brothers who are as different as night and day. When I was in high school a lack of girls required that I play the challenging part of Mary Tyrone, once a youthful beauty revelling in her ability to love and be loved, her body a wonderland as they say nowadays, but now only a shrivelled up hag, left on the shelf who finds solace in her needle full of morphine. Her husband, she thinks, doesn't understand her. The surprise in the play is that she finds out, oh yes he does understand her-only too well.She wears bedraggled clothes of the turn of the century period, which she has pathetically tried to keep clean, ironed and pressed, but which her morphine habit have caused to look wrinkled and generally dishevelled. She knows how she has fallen apart and it is part of her agony that she no longer looks very trig. Poor thing, she is always fussing with her hair (in my case, a long gray wig which my mother attempted to tie up in the middle like an old fashioned chignon. It kept falling out of its ribbon as I attempted to totter across the stage, imitating someone in the last throes of drug addiction, about which I knew very little. I imagined that I would always be seeing invisible people and monsters, like Ray Milland in Billy Wilder's LOST WEEKEND. And I would misplace things like my yarn and my spectacles, dropping them on what I thought was a book shelf but was actually thin air. I feel sorry for my fellow actors, three lovely guys totally upstaged by my antics, but I didn't know any better. The play lasted a considerably long time. We only had three performances though, and for the third we brought on two understudies for my two sons had quit the play and joined the basketball team instead, less stress."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"An alcoholic actor-manque father, an opiated mother, a dying son with TB whose father sends him to quack doctors--this is supposed to be great drama--but to me it seems more like melodrama or soap opera, for that matter. The two film versions I've seen are hard to swallow: harder even than the booze in the play. Ralph Richardson seems out of place as an American father in the earlier production-Kate Hepburn does for that matter too (as the mother, that is). Her hair is actually more riveting than the performance. I bought the two-tape VHS at a library sale for a dollar, so I can't complain in that department (I believe it was in detritus). There's a version with Jack Lemmon that made me cringe. Either the play has such heights of human tragedy that actors can't reach the note, or 3 1/2 hours of one-note angst may be just too much to take; If you've seen the woodcut by E. Munch, \\"The Scream,\\" you will get the basic effect in a more distilled and less clunky format. It has been reported that O'Neil kept crying while he wrote this opus.

The father is stingy, the mother is a dope fiend, one son is an alcoholic and the other is deadly ill. After the stay in the sanatarium, the mother is very sensitive and the other family members try to avoid every conflict with her. But you can' t avoid destiny. Fights start in this family that has never been a unit. Past comes up, old problems come up. Everyone is blaming each other for every little malicious deed they have done once.

This is the story of and Irish American family trying to struggle through thier every day lives and problems. As with most of O'neill's plays, each character struggles to overcome basic human problems and, in character with his style, ultimatly fail. Mary, the mother, can not accept anyything that will corrupt her image of the perfect family and denies any problems that come her way. Tyrone's excessive pride (McWains class, McWains class, Mcwains class) is his down fall. Jamie has given up on life, and Edmunds apathy prevents him from being able to help himself or his family. I personally enjoyed this book, however I hesitate to recomend it to the average reader looking for a new work to enjoy. O'neill has a style that is critcally acclaimed but very...well...boring.

It shows that a lot of times families have a lot of problems, and you can argue and fight over them, but in fact they are very difficult to overcome. This is a family that will be torn apart forever because of what has happened to them, and that's a very tragic thing. BUT. My only complaint is that Eugene O'Neill, despite being very courageous and brilliant in writing this play, gets a little wordy. I think that the whole dialogue between Edmond and Tyrone at the beginning of the final scene is uncomfortably long--some of the dialogue I believe could have been cut. Then again, it's just my opinion. It is, however, a wonderful play."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Long Day's Journey into Night draws a crystal clear picture of what happens when people who love each other try to fix people rather than problems, or when they perceive each other as doing so. Everyone has problems, but the Tyrones' problems, drink, morphine, tuberculosis, are especially difficult. Everyone is afraid to fix them because in fixing them they fear to be blamed for them. They pass blame like a hot potato, and they love each other dearly, and they're miserable. They can't stop hurting each other. Like the People's Front of Judea from Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, they sit around and talk about problems, but the problem never goes away. What the world needs is not the absence of problems but the absence of judgment. Better to light a candle than curse the darkness. The Tyrones continue to curse the darkness throughout the play. The entire play does nothing but curse darkness. It's pitiful. Extremely emotional and well-written."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"...does not exist. That seems to be the message of this dark, depressing -- and yet, enthralling and mysteriously beautiful drama. As bleak as it is, its essential humanity has rendered an immortal classic. O'Neill, of course, was not just the first major figure in American drama: he practically made it, giving it a legitimacy and relevancy for the first time. As with many subsequent American plays -- think of Death of a Salesman or most of Tennessee William's better-known plays -- it centers on a family. In this particular case, the family happens to be a close reflection of O'Neill's own; the character of Edmund is his alter ego. In fact, the play was so autobiographical that O'Neill would not have it performed until after his death. It recounts a day in the life of the family by offering interactions between every possible combination of the four members of the family. The play is stunning and stark in its brutal depiction of the Tyrone family, a series of frightfully honest vignettes that destroys the hallowed ideal image of the close, contented American family. All members of the Tyrone family have their demons and their reasons for the inhumanity that they show toward each other. O'Neill does not judge them: he merely presents them as they are, without pretense or adornment. Hardly even a glimmer of light appears in the play, and the ending comes and goes without leaving even a single shred of hope. With subject matter like this, why, then, has the play remained popular for half a century, and why does it retain its power? For one thing, its sheer, unabated emotion touches a deep, almost primal, human chord. It speaks to us in the brutally honest way that a television sitcom never could. Most people probably see more of themselves in the Tyrone than they would like to admit, even to themselves. Their quarrels are probably not as striking and unfamiliar as most people would like to think. The play touches the heart even as it touches the soul, leaving the reader (or the viewer) drenched in an overwhelming sea of emotion at play's end. It is a stunning play that cuts straight to the core of a large part of the darker side of the American experience. Unlike many great plays, it also reads very well and very smoothly on the page. Anyone interested in classic drama or American literature will find a dark goldmine here."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"O'Neil is an American Master and Long Day's Journey is powerful by its words alone.

From that point on, I never considered anything he had to say very important. He had pretty much revealed his inner workings and I saw him for the ignoramus he is. I have read this play numerous times, seen play versions with Ralph Richardson and Jack Lemmon playing James Tyrone. It's a beautiful play, a funny play, a play that works one over, and leaves one feeling totally satisfied. If you never really understood the idea of catharsis, watch or read this play. I don't see the play as having flaws, although a well-known dramaturg once told me he thought the play needed cutting. Personally, I think the play needs nothing. Cutting would turn it into another play, not the magnificent work it is. The \\"fat,\\" as for as I'm concerned, is as important to it as duck fat is to a delicious confit. Still, there must be those who could like to turn it into a two-act, so the audience can get home by 10:00 to watch reruns of \\"The Golden Girls.\\" If it were cut, the play would not be able to work its magic of making one feel that one has been through a long evening with the characters. These idiot editors would trim a Haiku if you let them. This play is just about as good as it gets in the modern theater we are taught to love."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"A Prison of the Past, by Charlotte ChenLong Day's Journey into Night, a deeply autobiographical play, is a \\"play of old sorrow\\" that is written by Eugene O'Neill in his attempt to come to terms with his past, \\"face my dead at last\\". He is seeking to forgive his family for the painful memories of his past, \\"write it with deep pity and understanding and forgiveness for all the four haunted Tyrones\\". In his opening dedication found at the beginning of the book, O'Neill gives us insight into the purpose of him writing the book and the pains he took to do so, \\"written in tears and blood\\". I strongly recommend this book to people who enjoy reading literary works because Eugene O'Neill effectively uses stage directions, pathos, characterization, metaphors and other literary techniques to portray the highly dysfunctional family of the Tyrones. Their love for each other is transformed into hurt due to their inability to reach out to each other and this eventually leads to the disintegration of the family.The first and most significant use of poetic tool would be the title that Eugene O'Neill has chosen. It is interesting to note that the title \\"Long Day's Journey into Night\\" is in itself a metaphor. The four act play is structured around a single day in the life of the Tyrones and we find that in the mere twenty four hours, the fragile fabric holding the family together gradually breaks down. \\"Long Day\\" refers to a slow paced, endless build-up of the misery of the family. It is almost like a slowly, eroding type of process. This is seen when the care for each other in the family is not sufficient to overcome difficulties which brings us back to the main assertion that they love each other but yet they hurt each other. This is seen in three instanc es. Firstly, when James Tyrone is trying to persuade Mary to give up on morphine, she uses an evasive tone, \\"James! We've loved each other! We always will! Let's remember only that, and not try to understand what we cannot understand, or help things that cannot be helped - the things life has done to use we cannot excuse or explain\\" (85; Act Two Scene two). Although Mary truly loves Tyrone, the love is not enough for her to overcome her morphine addiction and this leaves Tyrone a sad, old man when he replies bitterly, \\"You won't even try?\\" (85; Act Two Scene two)The second instance would be between Jamie and Mary. Jamie loves Mary but Mary blames him for the death of her second child Eugene and thus is unwilling to reciprocate the love. Jamie constantly reaches out to Mary, \\"But you've still got to be careful. You mustn't worry so much about Edmund. He'll be all right\\" (41; Act One). She tries to comfort and reassure her but she rejects him and leaves him \\"rebuffed and hurt\\", \\"All right, Mama. I'm sorry I spoke.\\" (42; Act One)Lastly, there is the relationship between Edmund and Mary where the love between them is requited but because they have different concerns about each other, Edmund worries about Mary's morphine addiction and Mary worries about his consumption, they end up blotting each other out. This is evident in Act Two Scene two when Mary is trying to show her concern for Edmund, \\"How do you feel, dear... You must learn to husband your strength\\" and at the same time he is trying to get through to her, \\"Listen, Mama \\"and he repeats this twice. We begin to feel the frustration when he says, \\"Mama! Please listen! I want to ask you something!\\" but Mary is evasive, \\"Please don't talk about things you don't understand\\" (92) and she goes on to talk about E dmund being ill.The play is structured around the family's journey downwards and the use of image of \`day into night' represents the process of disintegration of the family that is inevitable and that they are resigned to the pattern. Just like how we cannot control the day turning into night, the Tyrones cannot pull themselves out of the family disintegrating. It is a recurring pattern and they are going at a downward speed from which they cannot recover from, in this case, to break free of the situation. The use of the word \\"Night\\" represents darkness; it is almost as if the family is slipping into the abyss. This signifies the degeneration of the family where we find that at the end of the play, Tyrone is broken and like a \\"sad, defeated old man\\" (125; Act Fo ur) while Jamie completely breaks down, \\"He begins to sob, and the horrible part of his weeping is that it appears sober, not the maudlin tears of drunkenness\\" (162; Act Four)Another strong example of O'Neill's use of metaphors would be the use of the image of a fog. The fog is a recurring metaphor in the play. In Act Three, the fog is described as \\"like a white curtain drawn down outside the windows\\" (97; Act Three), as if masking the house. The fog signifies different things for different people. For Mary, the fog represents a refuge from reality. In Act 3 she says, \\"It hides you from the world and the world from you... No one can find or touch you anymore\\" (98; Act Three), in one of those moments when she is lost in her thoughts of the past. She is evasive and does not want to face up to reality. At the same time she expresses her dislike for the foghorn because it is a reminder of real life, something that pulls her back to reality, \\"That foghorn! Isn't it awful, Cathleen?\\" (98; Act Three).For Edmund, the fog serves a means of escape from reality as well as he expresses in Act 4, \\"to be alone in myself in another world, where truth is untrue and life can hide from itself\\" (131). Yet at the same time, the fog is also a metaphor for the confusion of life for Edmund. People lose their way in the fog, just as they do in life. In act 4, Edmund describes the time when he felt like he was one with nature and when it was all over, he was \\"lost in the fog again\\" (153) , and he describes us all as \\"fog people\\" (154).The main reason why the family is trapped in this inescapable journey into darkness is due to their inability to let go of the past. They are trapped in the prison of the past. Eugene O'Neill uses strong characterization to portray this. Mary is the pivotal point of the family and throughout the play, the degradation of Mary's character into her morphine addiction presents a Mary that is so lost in the past that she is oblivious of her surroundings and the men calling out to her, \\"The past is the present, isn't it? It's the future, too\\" (87; Act Two Scene two). As Mary slips to the past where she feels happy and comforted, the contrast in the characterization of the men through the use of stage directions in the beginning and the end strongly pres ents Mary's influence in dragging the family down with her. Mary turns to morphine to dull her senses, away from the reality of the world while the men turn to alcohol. At the end of the night, Jamie is drunk, \\"The Mad Scene. Enter Ophelia\\" (170; Act Four) and he uses literary allusions to mock, to express self-pity, indifference or cynicism, to find company in his sordid behaviour and also to express implicitly his love for his mother.Allusion adds to the tragic structure of the play connecting its actions or characters to a wider area of reference. In Act Four in particular, the cadences of the verses intensify the emotion projected to the audience and help move the play towards the closure. O'Neill, through his use of literary allusions can summon poets from the past to function as a chorus in what remains a rigorously modern play. It helps to connect with the literary audience as we are able to relate the context of the allusion to that of which Jamie is trying to express. These literary allusions also serve to define characters and their relationships. This is seen when Jamie recites sardonically from Rossetti, \\"Look in my face. My name is Might-Have-Been; I am also called No More, Too Late, Farewell.\\" (168; Act Four) and this sh ows Jamie's sense of failure, that all he is looking for is love but all that he is left with is lust, \\"A God-damned hollow shell\\" (158; Act Four). Jamie also uses Shakespeare to mock his father because he is well aware of James Tyrone's love of Shakespeare. In this case, he recites with dramatic emphasis to mock Tyrone's profession as an actor, \\"Clarence is come, false, fleeting, perjure Clarence, That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury. Seize on him, Furies, take him into torment\\" (168; Act Four) to suggest that he sees Tyrone as a traitor and this highlights that there is no possibility of reconciliation between them at the end of the play.Literary allusions do not only serve to define relationships but also characters as stated above. Tyrone uses Shakespeare to dramatise his emotions, \\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sheep\\" while his sons use it to antagonise him, \\"We are such stuff as manure is made on\\" (131; Act Four). The literary allusions help delineate relationships in the play; Tyrone's taste and philosophy are informed by age, whereas Edmund's literary taste signals his youthful need to break with the past and he also has adopted uncritically his brother's taste in literature. Eugene O'Neill further characterizes Edmund and Jamie through their use of literary allusions in Act Four. Their use of literary allusions heightens dramatic para llels; Edmund and Jamie are both pessimistic as seen from their choice of allusions from pessimistic authors such as Dowson and Baudelaire.Therefore, Long Day's Journey Into Night is a book that I would recommend that people who love literature because O'Neill strongly uses words to convey his message and he uses such techniques that would work well to exude strong writing. Although the story revolves around a dysfunctional family, O'Neill manages to write it in a way such that there is a sense of redemption at the end of the play where he achieves his goal of enabling the audience to feel \\"deep pity and understanding and forgiveness\\" for the characters."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"This tale of a tragically dysfunctional family is a must-read for every individual. It is the most accurate portrayal of the real American family available in literature. Long Day's Journey into Night does not skip around the issues, it hits them head on. Eugene O'Neill refuses to flatter us with blankets of false happiness. He does not provide a neat and convenient catharsis. Instead, this play challenges the reader to analyze their own family and the interactions within it. Read this play"},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"O'Neill's play \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" is often considered his best work. The book is highly autobiographical and depicts a highly dysfunctional family where the men are all alcoholics and the mother is a morphine addict. The dialogue is truly intense and the stage direction is extremely relevant to the proper mood and attitude of the dialogue.The most interesting thing about the play is the stigma that is attached to the use of drugs, particularly in comparison to the use of alcohol. Alcohol use and alcoholism is \`socially acceptable' whereas the use of narcotics is relegated to prostitutes and others of low social standing. The intensity of the dialogue rests in its ability to illustrate the torment of the family as it tries to deal with the drug addiction of the mother and the horror of the hold it has on her, while all the time, the alcoholism is just taken as routine. The father often comments about how he never \\"missed a performance\\" because of his alcohol use and therefore, it was not a problem. But in fact, it is a tremendous problem which they cannot shake, even though they are aware that it is consuming them.Perhaps most interesting of all is that the play was published posthumously. O'Neill seems to have been able to write it and face the terror of the dysfunctionality in 1940, but he would not allow publication of the play until he was no longer alive. While it was within his grasp to write about the situation, it was not within him to allow the world to see it within his time.The foreword by Harold Bloom is not surprisingly pedantic and overly academic. Bloom often takes the position that he knows what is appropriate, right and underlying about a written piece, but never assumes that any other person really properly understands what it is all about. He seems to see it as his job to inform others what they do not know; despite other people's potentially valid and illuminating interpretations. The reader may wish to completely skip the forward and go right to the words of O'Neill and make their own interpretation. Truly a marvel of a play, there is no person who would not gain from the reading of this brilliant work of the master playwright of his time."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"The surprising thing about the classic O'Neil tragedy, \\"Long Day's Journery Into Night\\", is that after all the demon revelations -- Mom in the grip of drugs and fear, Dad in the thrall of greed and guilt, offspring awash in bourbon and disease -- the audience can feel anything for the doomed family beyond revulsion, irritation, and cynical detachment.The four Act play takes place entirely in the shabby parlour of a 1912 American home, which serves as a battlefield for the four Tyrones to mark out their respective emotional territory as if not only their own lives but the meaning of life itself depended upon it. This is heavy going. At times the verbal assaults and collisions between family members are so harsh as to suggest a psychic demolition derby -- just as noisy and just as hard to watch. Yet the genius of the playwright lies in an instinctive understanding of when to pull back these combatants, how to keep the blood from actually flowing. We grow to realize, by the habitual restraint and reflexive civility of all involved, that these people are more motivated by love, however oddly or perversely felt, than by hate or any deep desire to dissolve the family. It is O'Neil's skill with keeping the roiling moods and explosions tamped down by love, or the effort at love, which keeps the play working as reality rather than spectacle. The audience, in the hands of a lesser writer, would, with such incendiary material, feel buffeted, exhausted, repelled, and fascinated by turns. In \\"Journey\\" we are kept in the loop of sympathy and compassion by the dogged determination of the characters to relate to each other, to find substance and meaning, to go on loving, or at least, to go on observing the mechanisms and rituals of love -- no matter what.The extraordinary power of this play derives from the interraction of this idea of love, especially the familial variety, with the revelations of truth. Truth, in the context of this play, has a power equal to and at times greater than love, would even deny love the place it needs to survive; there is the constant suggestion that loving human relationships do best in a foggy atmosphere of half-truths. We, the audience, are given a signal to this theme when the first signs of nervousness appear in Mary Tyrone in Act 1, and continue, with increasingly disturbing affect, throughout the play. Mary's truth, which threatens the viable heart of the family as a loving entity, is not only the fact of her drug addiction, but more compellingly the history of selfishness, manipulation, and insensitivity that lurks behind it. As the family sketetons come out, one by one, of their assorted closets, taking form as fact, memory, truth -- love is challenged with increasing ferocity. It is a battle royal, and one of such universal interest that the audience cannot remain detached. The idea of 'love battling truth' underlies every encounter in the play, at once unifying it and at the same time generating tremendous tension. The theme that love as a human need is at odds with truth -- or that love cannot survive without denial of truth, without lies of some sort -- is an uncomfortable suggestion. The spotlight that O'Neil throws on this basic human conundrum gives \\"Journey\\" a unique force that reaches beyond its time and place as a turn of the century American drama, or perhaps it's original purpose as an exorcism of O'Neil family ghosts, to the expression of profound human pain mitigated but not redeemed, by love."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Although Eugene O'Neill saw much success as an author during his lifetime-being awarded three Pulitzer Prizes in 1920, 1921, and 1925, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929-his finest work, Long Day's Journey Into Night, was not published until 1956, three years after his death. This was due to its autobiographical nature, and the painful portrait that it paints of the O'Neill family. It earned him his fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1957.The play is organized into four acts: the morning, afternoon, evening, and night of a pivotal day for the Tyrone family (representative of the O'Neills). The characters of Mary, James, Jamie and Edmund (representing Eugene O'Neill's mother, his father, his brother, and himself, respectively) are seen early in the first act as a loving and supportive family. However, as the day progresses, severe problems such as drug addiction, alcoholism, depression, and infectious disease are alluded to in increasing detail, which causes the play to be captivatingly suspenseful. Throughout the first few acts, each time a character lets a detail about a problem slip, another character is quick to either silence, or dismiss them.I find that O'Neill's talent truly comes through in his ability to portray the complexities of the characters through their interactions. He expertly contrasts their powerful love for one another with the bitter resentment they feel as a result of their very difficult lives. The play seems to fall at a point where all the characters are at the ends of their emotional ropes. They frequently snap at each other, making scathingly hurtful remarks, then, upon realizing their indiscretion, lovingly seek to make reparations. Their emotional interactions seem so genuine that they remind me rather heartbreakingly of my own family (minus the addictions and diseases of course).Though O'Neill's use of dialogue is at times poignant, I find that the source of my great sympathy for the characters comes mostly from their actions. Luckily for those of us who have not had the fortune of seeing the play performed, O'Neill includes detailed and eloquently written stage directions that enable us to picture the action. He includes every important fact, from the characters' facial expressions and voices, to the details of their movements.Though I found the tragic story of O'Neill's family to be painful to read at times, I admire his courage at displaying it to the world, even if he did wait until he had died to do so."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"What is with this other review? &quot;Long Day's Journey into Night&quot; is not a page-turner and it can seem extremely turgid at times but to call these faults would be missing the point.

At least they're honest and free with their feelings about their lives and this gives a remarkable glimpse into the darker and lonlier side of the human condition.O'neil was the master of misery and only he could have possible written this play.

While he had a childhood with poverty , he cannot get rid of the past ghosts . Therefore , miser as he is , he gives the hell to the whole Tyrone family. Yet, one must think, upto which point should we blame our parents for our own failures? That is what Eugene O'Neill has done in this book.

His family believes he is fair game for any piece of property the real estate agent can't unload elsewhere. Tyrone's son, Edmund, has no appetite. Jamie, Edmund's brother, is nearly thirty four years old and is unemployed. His father says he is always sneering. Edmund is ten yers younger than Jamie. Tyrone tells Jamie he wishes he would show gratitude. He says that Jamie had the talent to be a fine actor. Jamie notes that it is an Irish peasant idea that consumption is a fatal malady. Tyrone claims that Jamie was and is a bad influence on Edmund who does not enjoy his brother's strong constitution.Edmund's illness comes at a bad time for him, he has just had some success publishing his pieces in the newspapers, and his mother, Mary Tyrone. Mary Tyrone states it is hard to live in an atmosphere of suspicion. She does admit that it is difficult for the members of her family to forget her long drug dependency. The sons, sneaking drinks before lunch, put water in the whiskey bottle. The sons and father learn that Mary Tyrone has started the desperate cycle of addiction again. The condtion of her eyes and resting in the spare room are signs. Edmund is heartsick and physically ill. Tyrone and Jamie are very disappointed.The Tyrones have been married thirty six years. James Tyrone was a matinee idol. Fog and foghorn are present in the play. Growing up, Jamie had been a likable and brilliant student. Edmund wants to tell his mother the nature of his illness and can't. His father has concluded that Edmund has a morbid poet in him.

When it comes to Eugene O'Neill you can either read his plays or watch them performed to get the impact--and I guarantee you, you will be impacted. When I first read this play ( twenty some years ago) it felt like I'd been punched in the stomach by a heavyweight.

The author takes great pains to explain HOW and WHY he translates the old and peculiar French used by Nostradamus, and the geography of his times (when the U.S.A. didn't even exist yet), to the current day. The author also never denies the difficulty of interpreting.In summary, I liked the book, because it takes translating and interpreting Nostradamus serious.However, do we have the stomach for what lies ahead according to these predictions...?

Among the books: Desert, The Mojave and Death Valley Photographs by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers. I barely had time to read more than a page or two of the text before it made me want to go straight to the photos to see the place she was clearly, and intelligently writing about. And I was not disappointed: It was overwhelmed with joy of at being able to share the keeness of Mr. Dykinga's fine and perceptive photographic vision of that place. This is a more subtle body of work than the previous books based around his photographs.The Sonoran Desert had a similar effect on me years ago and expanded my sense of what ilandscape photography could be. Stone Canyons did not have as great of affect on me as the first bookMore than anything else, the images in this book remind me why the large format camera is such a tremendous aid to seeing something more clearly and perceptively than you can with the naked eye. even more so than a 35mm or medium format or easily portable digital gear can. Some of the photos even have a sense of humor to them and when did you last see that in a photograph of a natural landscape? The reproduction of the images appears to be first rate and the design and typography of the book match its contents in quality.In short there are wonderful things to be found in this book."},{"Title":"Desert: The Mojave and Death Valley","review":"The photographs are stunning of Death Valley, Red Rock Conservaiton Area, and the East Mojave National Scenic Area. This area west of my home in Las Vegas is very large and very beautiful. The photogrpahs are a delight, especially the wildflower photogrpahs taken after the El Nino rains."},{"Title":"Desert: The Mojave and Death Valley","review":"As I went through this book, I kept asking myself, am I looking at the dessert or am I looking at the landscape photographs of Jack Dykinga? I've been to the Mojave and to Death Valley and I don't remember them looking so beautiful.Dykinga's style reminded me of the work of Eliot Porter, with modern film stock. Most of his pictures have the same subtle quality, created by the use of analogous colors, that is, colors near each other on the color wheel, and varying only by tint or small changes in hue. A Dykinga picture almost always has one dominant hue like brown or tan or blue, and the hue rarely feels intense, even if it's a field of California Poppies.It's obvious that Dykinga's work utilizes a large format camera. Everything is in sharp focus from foreground to distant mountains, thanks to small apertures and the ability to twist the light through his camera. This means that the picture is not going to immediately draw your attention to one aspect of the scene by controlled focus. More likely, the viewer will have to work his way through the picture, discovering things along the way.The layout of the book seems to be well considered. Quite often two plates with similar subject matter will face each other and there is a synergistic effect from the comparison. For example, I delighted in examining two facing pictures of desert sunflowers. In both cases the yellow orange flowers have a hilly background, but one group of flowers is pushing up through dried-out, cracked clay, while in the other picture the flowers are growing from a small body of water collected for a brief time from rainfall. The mud and the water are both magenta in color but the textures are completely different. The thoughts that arose from the juxtaposition were not only about the variety of the desert but also about the nature of color and vision.I suppose one reason that I never saw the dessert the photographer portrays is because most of the pictures were taken at the golden hours of sunrise and sunset. To have been that many places in the desert at just those times would have taken me months and months. At the very least, I can be a philistine and thank Dykinga for saving me a lot of time.As to the text in the book, my feeling is that it probably has to be included for marketing purposes. Janice Bowers' essays seemed poetic and show that she loves the desert, but like most such commentaries, they do little to illuminate the photographer's work. I suppose the essays are worth reading once. The pictures on the other hand can bear many, many viewings and add something to the sense of the place each time.I finally concluded that I was looking at the desert through Jack Dykinga's eyes when I viewed this book. I resolved to return to the actual desert again and see if I could continue to see it through his eyes."},{"Title":"Desert: The Mojave and Death Valley","review":"This book shows the stark beauty of the Mojave Desert. It contains spectacular photos of the flowers that bloom after the rains, and the documentation of the moving rocks at the &quot;racetrack&quot; is something you cannot miss."},{"Title":"Desert: The Mojave and Death Valley","review":"DESERT by Jack Dykinga is published by Harry Abrams, Inc., a company that publishes high quality art books and not, for example, vacation tour guide books. DESERT is 143 pages long, and contains 83 full-sized color reproductions. Dykinga uses a 4X5 camera, resulting in a higher quality image.Many of the images are merely of flowers or of pretty scenes. Here, there is no attempt to produce a photograph of artistic merit. However, this slight shortcoming is overwhelmed by a number of novel and creative photographs.For example, JOSHUA TREE AT DAWN AFTER SPRING SNOW discloses a dark cloudy sky, tinged with purple, a shadowy snow-covered desert, and a grove of snow-covered Joshua trees--all cloaked with pre-dawn shadows. It is difficult to tear one's eyes away from this photograph.DAWN ON THE PANAMINT MOUNTAINS and CRYSTALLIZED SALT FORMATIONS are two photographs that continue with the artist's experiments (successful experiments) with pre-dawn photography of the white desert. Here, the whiteness is not from snow, but from white salt.Jack Dykinga has also focused his attention on cracked lakebeds (dried mud). CRACKED CLAY AND THE MESQUITE FLAT reveals a fascinating heart shape in a patio-like area of cracked sand. The cracked mud area abuts a region of desert that is soft sand.Another fine shot, MESQUITE FLAT SAND DUNES AT SUNRISE, features a patio-like area of cracked sand, each pentangle of cracked mud is covered with warty clumps of earth. An open area in the middle of the cracked mud patio contains an open area in the shape of a diamond. At the center of the diamond-shaped open area is a small growing bush. The diamond-shaped area with the little round bush resembles an eye.RACETRACK AT SUNRISE and RACETRACK AT SUNSET are fascinating images--the most unusual in this book. Each shows millions of tiny pentangles of cracked mud, stretching off into the distance. In the foreground are a couple of flattened areas resembling thick ruler-lines. The flattened areas were produced by small boulders, somehow propelled over the mud by the wind. At one end of each ruler-line one finds a boulder.Again, if one is able to tolerate the abundance of conventional \\"pretty\\" scenes of flowers and sunsets, one should purchase this book, if only to view the seven great photographs discussed in this review.Mr.Dykinga's skill as an artist is further demonstrated by his book, STONE CANYONS OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU, also published by Harry Abrams, Inc. STONE CANYONS is especially distinguished by its focus on a park called, Vermilion Cliffs (Paria Canyon, The Wave, Coyote Buttes), a park that is rarely the subject of published photographs. STONE CANYONS also uses the style of depicting scenes just before sunset (or just after sunrise), when all but a thin line of the horizon is steeped in shadow.

Also it focuses quite heavily on David Geffen, whose realy importance does not really come across.

For me the scope was too broad with too many artists featured. The timelines get layered and out of synch. And there is way too much information on the music moguls to be of much interest to anybody but music business insiders. Complex relationships are reduced to the simplist: who slept with who, egos clashing, who was doing what drugs...My biggest complaint was the redundancy: the point that money, drugs and fame corrupts gets beaten to death.. There is really not enough focus on the music..saying all that, the book was chock full information and did a decent effort to capture the LA singer song writer scene of that time.

It does not read as a narrative given from an inside view. It appears to be a montage of info collected from various interviews with the players involved and those around them. The best part is the Laurel Canyon beginnings of the singer-songwriter movement in L.A.It stops rather abruptly in the early 80s, although he occassionally makes mention of happenings in the 90s and 2000s.

It covers all the major players and some minor one you may not have heard about, but were significant influences and collaborators/co-writers (like J.D Souther). It also covers the major producers (particularly David Geffen) and their role in the whole scene. It also includes the drug excesses and sadness of those who let their addictions overcome their genius. If you are a fan of the Byrds, CSNY, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Joni MItchell, the Eagles, Gram Parsons and all the others who were a part of this scene, you will learn things about these artists you didn't know before. The sections about David Crosby, Steven Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young - their life styles, ego clashes and tumultuous relationships - is particularly interesting. 'Some of it's magic, some of it's tragic', but an excellent read overall."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I originally had this as a one-star review but I had to bump it up a star on retrospect. My problem with the book initially was that it seemed to drop the name of every musician or industry person who had anything to do with Los Angeles folk-rock music in the late 60s and 70s without spending more than a couple of pages on most of them. I was particularly annoyed by the first chapter or two which dispensed with most of the careers of the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield in a couple of pages, with little in-depth information. This is a really annoying way to start a book - gets the reader off on the wrong foot. By the time you get about a third of the way through, things do pick up and you get a bit more information on the Eagles, for example (aside from finding out everybody that Joni Mitchell ever slept with). I added a star because some of the info in the middle is good background, particularly if you're planning to read, say, another book on the Eagles or Neil Young, so it has some value as an \\"overview\\" of the times. But my original criticism still stands: most of these artists have had better or more complete books written about them, so why bother with this one?A great amount of time is spent discussing various record executives and managers like David Geffen, Mo Ostin and Irv Azoff, all of whom are frankly much more boring to read about than any of the artists they represented. I'd have rather read a few more pages on one of the musicians within - pretty much ANY one of them - than lengthy discussions of Geffen's personality and motivations. Yawn."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"The writing style is fairly leaden. It is very much the he-said-and-then-she-said-and-then-this-happened style.BUT I really enjoyed reading this book for several reasons. The main one being I grew up with all of this music, loved it, and was keen to learn more about the songs and singer/songwriters involved. The book is a treasure chest of nuggets and bits of information that reveal the stories behind the songs, and some behind the scenes sparring going on at the time they were released. Some big egos were involved! (Looking at you Stephen, Neil and the \\"Lyin' Guys\\", to name just a few) That was fascinating. Oh, and it certainly opened my eyes as to what a decadent era it was alright. Much cross-pollination went on between all these singer/songwriters - in the romantic sense! A few of them (Looking at you JD and Joni) seemed to have gone out with EVERYONE at one point or another.Some reviews mention Graham Nash came off as a weak link in this era. I strongly disagree. I had even more regard for Nash than I did before reading it. He emerged as the Voice of Reason and one of the creative individuals who worked with everyone, rarely falling out with anyone. He must have very good diplomatic skills. The other individual that stands out in this regard is Chris Hillman. He's talented, but was able to work with some of the huge egos that must have made for very choppy waters in the recording sessions and touring - and just about any part of the recording process.Sad stories behind artists such as Gene Clarke and Judee Sills, mentioning just a few, who seemed unable to survive life in general. Others such as Richie Furay, appeared to have been steamrollered in the \\"star maker machinery behind the popular song\\"."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I just came back from Aruba and this book was my choice for reading on the beach.

It's like an endless Rolling Stone article without focus or anything to draw you in.Secondly I don't know how much of this I could believe. I say that since I notice when covering the Rolling Stones involvement with some of these artists, Mr. Hoskyns is niether accurate nor fair. He dives right into the erroneous and slanderous media hype linking the band with devil worship, something the band and it's management have consistantly denied. Even fellow musicians and most music fans realize that \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" was about man's inhumanity to man and not in any way praise for the devil.Mr. Hoskyns adds insult to injury by also raising the details of Altamont with the same venom as the rest of the media, directing most of the blame at the Rolling Stones. He conveniently ignores several details such as the use of Hells Angels as security being a recommendation of the Grateful Dead or as caught in the same film, \\"Gimme Shelter\\", that Meredith Hunter was aiming a gun at the stage when he was stabbed.As you may imagine, I'm well read on the Rolling Stones. I was hoping this book would provide more insight on some of my favorite artists from the California scene. I'm hesitant at this point, however, to buy into any of the information bandied about through this book."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I bought this book because I love the music that came out of California's Laurel Canyon from 1965 to 1975ish. I am also a musician and was looking forward to reading about how these artists influenced each other's music. Instead, the book was filled with ALOT about managers and record companies. It was way more focused on the business side of this time period. I also don't like the way the author portrays the artists and gives his slanted opinion of some of their music - which, by the way, I totally disagree with. I am hugely disappointed and sorry that I spent the money and time to read it. YUK!"},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"That's a question Hoskyns should have asked well into the first few pages of this long-winded and often times boring account of the late 60s and 70s California music scene. While not as bad as some people here claim--and they DO have a valid basis of argument--I found reading about mostly what a creep David Geffen was very tiring.Okay, so these musicians, lots of whom I listen to, had vast egos, partied like--well, rock stars--and slept with anyone that struck their fancy. What a shock, because musicians aren't like that. NOOOOOOO! What I did get out of this book was the basic essence of money corrupting the music business to such an outlandish degree that the damage is clearly written on the wall with today's myriads of largely unentertaining and untalented bunch of posers simply because greed wins the day. I will say this much; whether you liked some of these artists or not, at least they genuinely possessed the talent and charisma to still have their music constantly receiving radio airplay all these years later. Do you honestly believe we will hear Justin Bieber in even as little as 5 years from now? You do the math."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I'm not a great fan of this book, even though it was a page turner. Evaluating the addiction to reading it, I found I was looking for a lot more than the book offered and kept going in the hope that it would deliver. It didn't.I found it more of an expose of the music industry of the time and the people involved in that industry, than about the music and musicians themselves. It's any wonder the industry has turned out with such an emphasis on the moguls, as Hoskyns spends so much time at the periphery, tacitly attempting to convince readers that the real drive was from the executives of the time and not the music.At the end of the read, I knew more about David Geffen and Irving Azoff, than I did about Randy Meisner or Don Felder. Kenny Loggins, Jim Messina and others who had their roots in this time, barely rate a mention when compared to Lenny Waronker, Joe Smith, Barry Freidman and Jac Holzman. Who are these people?In reality the book is more about the creation of Asylum records and its transition to Geffen records, with side comments about the musicians that happen to be involved during that period. Elliot Roberts, an agent, rates 65 page mentions in the index. Steven Stills 34 and The Doobie Brothers, 1. A&M; records, by no means central to the book rates as many page mentions as the Flying Burrito Brothers and is hands-down over Dan Fogelberg, 3.If you were looking for a book about the music and the musicians of this era, there are many better."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"Hoskyns' infatuation with the mythic culture of southern California in the 60s and 70s is evident in his depiction of the people and circumstances that produced much of the best music of those years. He describes an era of magic and gives detailed background to the rise of singer/songwriters, revealing their vulnerability to the evolving culture. Without sounding preachy, Hoskyns details the spiraling abuse of alcohol and drugs, primarily cocaine, and its effect on the creative abilities of the artists. The numerous early deaths are the most obvious casualty, but the reader is left pondering the long term effect of rampant substance abuse within the music industry as well.Hoskyns explores complicated relationship dynamics, both personal and professional. Through extensive interviews he also provides a retrospective look at this infamous time. His writing engages the reader, making Hotel California a valuable addition to any comprehensive collection of books about the musicians and culture of the 60s and 70s.As Hoskyns astutely states on the final page, \\"In selling their souls for fame and riches, the stars of the 1960s and 1970s helped create a world where passive consumerism replaced emotional engagements and political commitment.\\""},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"A superbly involving narrative history of an extraordinarily fertile era for American popular music. Hoskyns examines the tension between creativity and commerce that was beginning to make itself felt big-time in the late 60s and clarifies the relationships - musical, business and personal (and the many and varied permutations thereof) - that existed during this remarkable period. I recognised all the names - Ronstadt, Souther, Mitchell, Browne, Mama Cass, The Byrds, Geffen, Young, Crosby, Stills, Nash etc. - but, until now, wasn't completely aware of how they all fitted in to the bigger musical picture. It's an extraordinary tale of monumental egos and of idealism turning sour: the sunshiny optimism of California in the 60s, when anything seemed possible, giving way to the darker cynicism of the 70s as the LA scene imploded, the Eagles stopped talking to each other, the men-in-suits seized power and punk reared its less-than-pretty head. Next stop for me: Hoskyns' \\"Waiting For The Sun\\"; Richie Unterberger's two books on folk-rock and John Einarson's \\"Desperados: The Roots of Country Rock\\"...and a lot of CDs.NB: The edition I have of this book is a UK paperback (with the somewhat briefer subtitle \\"Singer-Songwriters and Cocaine Cowboys in the LA Canyons, 1967-1976\\" (ISBN: 0007177054)) which contains additional material including an interview with the author and a re-printed newspaper article by Hoskyns on singer Judee Sill"},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I decided to read this book, becuase I love music and like to read anything about music and the industry.

It never moved beyond being one looooong overview of 70's California. The flaw is that Hoskyns tried to cover way too much ground, way too many artists.I grew up on the Eagles; now, I sort of turn up my nose at them. But their story seems damn interesting. Unfortunately, we just get a few scattered pages on them in various parts of the book. I'd rather go read a book on them.And too much is focused on Joni Mitchell-- though thankfully she's painted as the self-obsessed blowhard that she is.Find a different book if you want some good rock criticism."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"One star for some of the photos, nice to see some new ones from that time period, even if they're only in dull black and white. BUT, what a let-down this book otherwise is! He has one of the most fascinating topics to write about but he manages, chapter after tedious chapter, to dull the information with his writing style, trying to cover way too much territory, and I'm just glad that I found this at the local library and didn't waste any money on it.I feel that he went out of his way to take a whack at the entire 1970's southern Cali music scene, the likes of which we'll never know of again. Such a waste of energy this book is because of that."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I understand why it frustrates some people, but this is a decent book. The author has done a ton of research: if you were in Laurel Canyon in 1968-71 and Hoskyns didn't interview you, it probably means you are dead. He has digested the music itself and, in addition to all the milestones, champions several obscure works. His quick portraits are instinctive and convincing. And I like the trajectory he depicts: beginning with a truly vital scene that included the Byrds, Burritos, and Buffalo Springfield, the story moves from the hippie days in the Canyon, when it was about good weed and tail and you slept on someone's couch, to the hard and aloof multi-platinum era, when creativity gave way to cocaine and albums whose productions were as bloated as 'Cleopatra.' \\"The world stopped looking to musicians for answers and instead started to live vicariously through their heroes' hedonism,\\" Hoskyns writes--a withering observation.There are a couple problems here, though. First, Hoskyns has simply taken on too many stories. As if it weren't a tall enough order to treat Joni Mitchell, the Eagles, and CSN&Y; (and all its offshoots) in a single book, the author also feels obliged to keep up with James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits (one of the few native Californians here), Linda Ronstadt, Lowell George, et al, and to salvage the reps of forgotten artists like Judee Sill, Gene Clark, and Jimmy Webb. By the time Gram Parsons shows up, dragging his whole Nudie suits/funeral pyre myth along with him, the book has become hopelessly over-committed. And we haven't even gotten to Fleetwood Mac and Warren Zevon yet. On top of this there is the whole behind-the-scenes component: Doug Weston's Troubadour club down on Santa Monica Boulevard; the Reprise guys and their \\"Burbank sound\\"; David Geffen and the rise of Asylum; Irving Azoff, who stole the Eagles from Geffen and oversaw all those all those records with the horrible Boyd Elder cow skulls on them. You see what I mean, it all gets mighty complicated. The book could sorely use a family-tree diagram to sort out all of the players. (While they're at it, we could use another diagram just to sort out everyone Joni Mitchell and J.D. Souther had sex with.)There are no real hatchet jobs here; several people (Browne, Souther, Geffen, Stills, Crosby, Henley and Frey of the Eagles) are awfully hard to like, but I'm not sure that could be helped. What isn't all right is the way the music itself becomes hard to like. Which brings us to the second serious problem: the deterioration that Hoskyns traces is all too true. In the end it simply isn't a terribly vibrant scene he's writing about--it's the death of the rock'n'roll spirit and the victory of pure product. Not very heroic stuff. As one onlooker remarks in the midst of so much success, \\"I didn't think it was good poetry, and I didn't think it was good show business.\\"Curious thing: while the photo gallery here is unusually good--I particularly enjoy all the shots of people lighting Glenn Frey's cigarettes--the cover art is weirdly bush league; it looks like it belongs on something like 'Bob Stroud's Mellow Guitar for Intermediate Players.'

It brought back memories of days at the Troubador and all the great music that was created by this group of musicians dwelling in Laurel Canyon."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"If you turn your nose up at early-'70s LA music, but really know more about the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac, etc. than you'd like to admit, then \\"Hotel California\\" is a recommended guilty pleasure.On the other hand, if you've grown to admire the craftsmanship and durability of the songs that came out of that era, you probably deserve a more thorough and mature account of the \\"cowboy canyon\\" scene (to use Walter Becker's phrase).Barney Hoskyns deftly covers a lot of historical ground in about 250 pages. But the quick pace leaves more than a few loose ends hanging. Early major players Barry Friedman and Mama Cass fade away fast, while Fleetwood Mac has its meteoric rise crammed into two pages. Disappointingly, Hoskyns spends more time on faves Gene Clark of the Byrds and Lowell George of Little Feat.This leaves the usual chronicling of mega-players David Geffen, Irving Azoff, The Eagles, Linda Rondstadt, CSNY, Jackson Browne, et.al. At least novices will find out why JD Souther was so integral to the scene, even if his solo albums aren't well known.That said, there is some bitchy fun to be had reading less-than-flattering accounts of Joni Mitchell (high-living snob), Gram Parsons (rich-kid hanger on) and even Neil Young (whose mercurial career changes seem less heroic than self-centered). These irreverant portraits are refreshing, if one-dimensional.Wait until this comes out in paperback. Crack open a bottle of Cuervo and a few other refreshments from the era and enjoy a frivolous afternoon."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"The definitive book on the California sound from the Laurel Canyon 60s to the cocaine addled 70s, it's all here. Special emphasis is paid to David Geffen's venture from agent to music record company owner and his specific group of artists, Jackson Browne, Eagles, JD Souther and Linda Ronstadt. The rest of music history also is here like the singer/songwriter hangout, the Troubadour. This is a fascinating period that celebrates political upheaval and the influence of songs written with meaning vs. pop love songs. For anyone with an interest in popular music, American culture or Los Angeles specifically, this is worth the read and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"Hoskyns new book isn't the masterpiece that his previous 'Waiting for the Sun' was but it's a fine job, nonetheless. The Laurel Canyon scene in the '70s is a much-derided smorgasbourg of drugs, sex and oh-so-mellow California rock whose major exponents (The Eagles, Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, Crosy Stills and Nash, etc.) have been forgotten in the past few decades by those who never got past their punk obsessions. While not exactly considered \\"hip\\" in 2006 this music actually has a lot to offer.Joni and Jackson were responsible for a succession of excellent singer songwriter LPs spread out amongst the entire decade. The Eagles were perhaps the biggest selling US band of the time. Linda Ronstadt--the most popular female rocker (if you can call her that) of the second half of the decade, never wrote her own material but recorded some better than average records which were unavoidable on '70s FM radio. Other luminaries such as J.D. Souther, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks and many others get generous coverage.So pick it up. If this kind of music interests you at all you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"It is hard to describe to someone the meaning of serendipity if they have never experienced it. And it happens rarely enough in life. But the purchase and subsequent reading of this book happened at exactly the same time as David Geffen's emergence as a news story presence in the past month.Geffen is a major part of the story of Hotel California. His influence and drive helped to make the emergence of the left coast as the \\"new music capital\\" of America possible. But the story is so huge and involves so many figures that the book would have to be three times as long in order tell more than a cursory overview of the California music scene.I also don't know if the book does particular homage in a good light to certain personalities of the day, especially Joni Mitchell. The rest of the cast of characters are all very familiar to anyone over the age of 45 and this book is a good introduction to the California scene. When combined with several other excellent book that are currently available about The Byrds, Gene Clark, Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young as well as Crosby, Stills and Nash, the picture becomes more focused. Otherwise, this book is like watching the history of a decade or more of music in a two hour special by Ken Burns. It leaves you wanting more.Buy it, read it and then keeping reading other accounts of the time. It can take you back and take you forward... just like the music and the scene in 70's California."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"Having enjoyed Hoskyns' story of L.A. rock's origins and evolution in his Waiting for the Sun, and having read Michael Walker's overlapping (in subject matter, time of study, and time of publication) Laurel Canyon [also reviewed by me], I approached Hotel Cal with anticipation. Although I was still in childhood/adolescence at the time of the early 70s that Hoskyns' new book surveys, and although much of the music was not so much liked by me as simply absorbed from its immensely popular and understandably nearly ubiquitous presence on the local L.A. radio stations at the time, I found myself recalling dozens of songs that I have not heard since three decades ago!Hoskyns's skill in this book, as in his previous Los Angeles music book, is an ability to sift through anecdotes, interviews, his own and others' journalism, and to present a clearly told, accessible, and entertaining read. It's neither too gossipy nor too clinical; he manages, I think, to find pretty much the right balance. Walker and Hoskyns agree that the rise of the early 70s musicians party and pleasure ethos by its hedonism, navel gazing, and focus on self-satisfaction tolled the death knoll for Summer of Love idealism. Figures who bridged these two eras (pre-Woodstock to post-Watergate) such as Crosby and Stills come off the worse for wear after this chemically fueled race to the top of the charts. Those who followed the politicized folk-rock with a complacent ruralized mid-tempo rock soon eclipsed their addled forebears, at least as judging by Henley and Frey! As in Walker's story, the ubiquitous Pamela Des Barres, the enigmatic Joni Mitchell, and the old timer Henry Diltz all recall their own escapades at length. Those talents who were discarded by the side of the fast lane by their more calculating one-time bandmates and pals emerge poignantly. The Brothers Gosdine, Dillard, and Berline all had their supporting roles to play in establishing the bluegrass foundations that younger musicians would adapt into folk-rock and then country-rock in the later 60s. Gene Clark, Chris Hillman (who also is extensively quoted in Walker's book), Ned Doheny, J.D. Souther, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner are among those lesser-known pioneers of the country-rock fusion that the Eagles would take from Doug Weston's Troubadour club within a few years to take it to the stadium tour limit.The escapades of CSNY, Linda Ronstadt's savvy knack for choosing material and her too-little credited level-headedness, Gram Parsons' trust-fund banked decadence, and Jackson Browne's energetic ability (shared with Joni Mitchell) to hook up romantically and musically with celebrity mates all make the characters here (un?)reliably engaging. What is less documented are the roles that the more unsung Lady of the Canyon, Cass Elliot, played as a sort of matchmaking yenta who brought talents together (her complicated but still largely unsung role is slightly increased in Walker's book, but not enough to delve fully into her evident influence), as well as not enough detail to capture on the page what the \\"Warner-Reprise\\" mentality of the \\"Burbank Sound\\" represented. Still -- in an astute observation of Hoskyns-- best of all as the template for the design of the new L.A. starmaking machinery was the blueprint of the little-heralded debut by Little Feat. The author also notes correctly that such talents as Lowell George and crew, as well as Browne or Parsons or Clark, in the current bottom-line record business would not have ever been given the chance by today's WB perhaps to even make a second album.Egregiously, Michael Walker in his book misspelled twice Beachwood Canyon (just below the Hollywood sign and a few canyons to the east of Laurel--neither writer adds that at its end lies a working horse ranch, the last of such among now McMansion-blighted chaparral); Hoskyns misspells it as \\"Beechwood\\" five or six times, three on one page. Since both men have lived in L.A. quite a while, it puzzles me why this persistent yet easily corrected (by anyone who'd claim to know the Hollywood Hills this is like an adopted hipster New Yorker telling us about when he hung out in \\"Greenwitch Village\\") mistake exists in either supposedly thorough chronicle. There's also a sizable street by the punning name that goes down from the canyon into the heart of Hollywood, so it is not an obscure nomenclature. I do not know which author to originally charge this error to; one curious aspect to Walker's book is the complete absence of references to Hoskyns' \\"Waiting for the Sun\\"; perhaps resentment at Hoskyns' new book arriving about neck-and-neck with Walker's own is to blame? True, a minor glitch, but how could it be coincidental to both authors, experts on this musical period and cultural terrain? The country-psych-rock revivalists Beachwood Sparks a few years ago provide a salutory reminder both of the legacy of the time Walker and Hoskyns describe and a helpful mnemonic for how to spell that canyon correctly!!!Actually, given that Waiting for the Sun did hint more at the WB-Reprise-Elektra-Asylum stable's own knack at crossbreeding fine racehorses as well as dobbins like Van Dyke Parks or Warren Zevon, the shortcomings of this longer book disappointed me. I give both Walker and Hoskyns four stars rounded up for their welcome efforts, but the explorations in both cases still lack depth. I wish Hoskyns had interviewed more than the musicians, studio heads, and managers at WB, for example. Why not hear from the graphic designers, photographers, producers, and clever PR marketers who sold millions calling themselves the counterculture on their Burbank-born early 70s brand of anti-capitalist, pro-hedonist anthems? The cultural legacy of WB and its labelmates needs to be investigated at much more length: how they and not, say, Capitol, was able to position their label as the hip proto-alternative deserves space. One used to buy a WB album then based on the label, even if the artist had not yet been familiar to you: customers trusted that label's roster.Hoskyns delves into a lot of oral history and written interviews (although he himself, judging from the endnotes, does not offer his own \\"three decades\\" of interviews but rather mixes his own largely from 1993/4 and 2004/5 with those by other journalists-- contrary to the bookjacket's inside front blurb). However, if you have not heard the actual music under discussion or if you remember it less than precisely now, the quick skims of key album's contents and especially the sound of the records that made these musicians rich or left them poor are insufficient to convey what made the L.A. singer-songwriter and country-rock hybrids so perennial-- at least three decades ago. Hoskyns rushes through the actual songs and the feel of the music in his haste to pile on more stories, list yet another sly move by David Geffen, or how many drugs some twenty-four-year old instant celebrity superstar consumed.Yes, Geffen, coke, cash, groupies, and debauchery belong here. But these, not the musical styles or their development, tend to dominate the results on the page. So, while you will not learn about the wonderful copywriters who on the inner sleeves of WB albums would trumpet bargain-rate label samplers called by such titles as \\"Schlagers!\\", you will gain from this book, especially if read after Waiting for the Sun and Walker's Laurel Canyon account, a better understanding of a type of music that now seems about as far away as the hippie roots from which cocaine cowboys and denim-skirted sirens blossomed."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"This is a guilty pleasure. I loved the music that came out of the LA country rock scene of the early '70's. This book revisits that scene with some \\"beyond the music\\" type perspective. Mr. Hoskins takes us into the legendary Troubador club, the drugged out parties and into the recording sessions of Ronstadt, Browne, the Eagles, CSNY, Joni Mitchell, and the incomparable JD Souther. Mr. Hoskins can cram more names into one paragraph than any writer I know. If you are not familiar with the names it might make for some tough sledding. Most of the material seems to come from interviews (most of which were conducted by Cameron Crowe - he should get co-author credit). It was a fun, easy read that took me back to a time when some of the greatest music ever was created. I found myself needing to listen to JD, Jackson, Linda, etc. while reading this fun book."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"As a self proclaimed rock historian and musician who thought he knew it all, I was pleasantly surprised to find this book at a used book store. When I saw the chapter title, \\"you'll never eat p---- in this town again\\", I knew it was for me! After reading all the criticisms of this book, I have to say, yes, he jumps around in time periods, yes, he distorts some facts, and yes, he covers a lot of territory, but the overall purpose of the book is to capture the Laurel Canyon scene. Being 46, I know all the artists discussed and their music, but I didn't see the big picture of the scene, like for instance, where the artists came from, how they all hooked up with their groups and of course, didn't know all the tales of debauchery and sexual conquest. I would have liked more info on the making of the music--interviews with recording engineers, producers, hired studio pro's, etc. Having many friends in the business who think they can handle the crazy lifestyle and drugs (yes, they are still around and more prevalent than our society likes to admit), they may find a copy of this book in their mailbox! If you are young (40 or below), you probably will give this book a thumbs down because lets face it, you may not respect, like, or even know these artists. If you grew up with these artists, this book will be highly enjoyable and an easy read. I am a big fan of all the artists discussed so, I was in RnR heaven. Many have bagged on BH's writing style, but I found it easy to read, insightful and charming. I plan on reading Waiting For the Sun and maybe the book on The Band.

There were a lot of music people that did not survive the sex drugs and rock and roll. There is something to be said in the old adage \\"Don't wish for something that hard... you might get it\\"After reading this book, I was amazed that any of these artists could write or play any of the memorable tunes that they did considering the amount of illicit substances in their respective systems.Some of the incidents described in the book are scenes that most rock fans know... the chance meeting on Sunset of Richie Furay and Steve Stills with a hearse-driving Neil Young that led to the formation of Buffalo Springfield, but a lot of the inside dynamics and interpersonal relationships described in this book were new to me as an avid rock fan.This book was easy reading, and perhaps eye opening. I recommend it for all music fans."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"When I first started this book it smacked of name dropping, boring and confusing details that seemed disoriented, and I almost packed it up. Problem was-- I was expecting the wrong thing. As I went further I realized that along with the included artists was a fundamental background of the industry itself-- which subsequently became an integral part of the story. The book expertly details relationships of artist to artist---- artist to record company-- and all the chess games that were played to put certain people into certain places--- and also why certain people did not get to certain places. A lot of corporate web-spinning but intriguing none-the less. It also covers the change of musical direction/development morphing from the late 60's to the mid 70's. A nice offering. Believable, interesting, and comfortable.

The author gives you tremendous insight into the many interesting characters that inhabited that time period. There are also a great many photographs which enhance the story.If there is a fault with the book it's that the author spends far to much time talking about Joni Mitchell.

It's pretty well written and will give you the inside scoop on the California music industry and scene of the late 60's and 70's. But it's more a darker version of what you might read in People magazine, than a serious study of the people and times. You aren't going to learn a lot about the actual music - you need to pretty much bring that to the table, but if you grew up in the 60's and 70's you heard much of it on the radio or your own turntable. You'll read a lot about the infighting and free love and, more than anything else, the drugs.I'm not sure I really needed to know how much of a coke head Linda Ronstadt was. Or what pathetic druggies Gene Clark or Gram Parsons were. That cocaine ruined the Eagles. Or that JD Souther slept with just about everyone (ditto Joni Mitchell). In terms of drugs, almost no one comes out looking good. Crosby was a pretty hopeless addict (cocaine and heroin) before his stint in prison. Stills was a major coke head and alcoholic. Nash was also a serious coke user, but \\"had it under control\\" for the most part. Jackson Browne dabbled in cocaine and maybe heroin. In terms of drugs about the only folks who come off fairly well are Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman, Richie Furey, Neil Young (though it turns out he's an ass that many of them hated) and Joni Mitchell. Maybe they just hid it better than the others.There is some good stuff on the music and recording sessions, but not nearly enough. In the end you are kind of depressed. And you wonder how ANY good music got made at all, when in fact a lot of the greatest popular music of our lifetime got created in spite of it all.That's the story that still needs to be told."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"I really liked this book as I knew of most of the people mentioned in the book.I don't know how interesting it would be for someone who wasn't familiar with the artists talked about, but then I guess they would not have a reason to buy it.It was certainly an eye opener about the hedonistic times when these artists exploded onto the world stage, and the difficulties that fame seems to bring to young impressionable minds when confronted with lots of money , and no-one to say \\"NO\\" to them.Overall, I think this book goes into a little bit too much detail, but is a very good read just the same."},{"Title":"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends","review":"While I enjoyed reading the history of some of my favorite musicians and bands, it wasn't quite the page turner I expected.

But Mr. Berry tells it as he lived it and as he remembers it, rough edges and all. I was intrigued by his writing style, as poetic and heartfelt, even obtuse at times, as the lyrics for his songs. One of the attributes I look for in an autobiography is, when I have finished reading it, if I have a better understanding of the person. Why he is like he is, what the forces were and are that shaped his life. In this book, my answer is an unqualified \\"yes.\\" I'm glad he wrote it. I'm even happier I read it."},{"Title":"Chuck Berry: The Autobiography","review":"I love Chuck Berry and was eager to read his memoirs.

Also intriguing were his scrapes with racism, his (many) dalliances with women over the years, and his prison terms in the early-60s and late-70s. Does he reveal everything? Of course not. No autobiography does, but he can be candid.What I didn't like was Chuck's clumsy writing style with run-on sentences, use of arcane words when simpler ones would've sufficed, and weird changes in active/passive voice. His style comes off as pretentious and distracts the reader from what he's trying to say.

His book leaves you thinking: wow, he did that? And, where would music today be without Chuck Berry?Uncovering some of America's darkest truths, this book tells as much about race and America in the mid twentieth century and as it does Chuck and his music.The best surprise in this book is: not only can Chuck sing and play guitar, he can write; and he does it well.Definitely worth reading!

The origin of the famous \\"duck walk\\" is told and Chuck tells about his brushes with the law.I am not alone in my opinion that he is the most important R&R; figure of the twentieth century.

GoldsteinSanta Monica CollegeMy father, a New York lawyer and political liberal of long standing, used to refer to certain airy intellectuals as people who were \\"very smart, but had no brains.\\" This concept kept coming back to me as I read Joe Berry's analysis of the current state of higher education in America. His discussion centers on a workforce transformed in one generation from one of almost exclusively full-time tenure track positions -- the traditional \\"Professor\\" -- to one where such positions are now the minority.Sometime in the mid-90's a majority of college teachers became contingent laborers, as either part-time or full-time temporary -- not counting the routinely abused grad students, or the growing for-profits and non-credits, where contingency comes standard. This new class of professors have fewer benefits (like job security or health insurance) and lesser pay, and are doing the majority of the work.If such a thing happened to auto workers or nurses or elementary school teachers, we'd have seen them permanently weakened as union bargaining units. Rather, this happened to college professors, very smart people who seemingly did not have enough brains to prevent their job positions from eroding before their eyes, effectively disappearing in their working lifetimes.All of this and more is covered eloquently in Joe Berry's new book, which clearly lays out the current situation and focuses in on the largest and most exploited part of this new professoriat, the contingent academic laborer, the part-time teacher, the fabled freeway flyer who is more often in LA a gridlock groaner. Part historical analysis, part organizing handbook, Berry's book places both the problem and the solution on the table.Essentially a market force model has been introduced to the academy, and when that happens, you get a situation like Santa Monica College where I teach, a highly-respected community college which now has 286 full-time teachers, and 995 contingents who teach a little over 50% of FTES's, although state law mandates a 75/25 FT/PT floor for this ratio. Money talks, and market forces have spoken louder than state appropriations, public pressure, or union negotiations in the last three decades. So much for the Master Plan -- this is cheaper.But there are signs of change, and the defeat of Gov. Schwarzenegger's anti-labor initiatives recently may be a turning point. It gives one pause, however, to imagine how that election would have turned out if the firefighters and nurses and grade-school teachers had let happen to them what happened to the professoriat. Fortunately, they had enough brains not to.This new force for this change comes mainly, as would be expected, from the exploited class, which is developing a class consciousness, and good old fashioned labor organizing is shaping it into a movement. Joe Berry is a contingent labor activist of long-standing in California and Chicago, one of the founders of COCAL, the Conference of Contingent Academic Labor, a national coordinating group for the burgeoning movement, as well as a teacher and organizer in the Chicago area. He knows whereof he speaks.The \\"do's\\" and \\"don'ts\\" of organizing on your campus and in your region is the heartof Berry's book, and his decades of experience in the trenches of labor organizing show up in the completeness and the conceptual rigor of his analysis. If you are mad as hell and don't want to take it any more, don't go to a window and shout. Rather, buy this book, read it carefully -- and then do something about it!It's that kind of a book. Berry's clear sense of moral purpose, as evidenced by his title, comes through on every page. This is someone who is not just complaining or explaining, but working to better the world of higher education while doing both those things. It's a truly admirable task, and he has written a truly admirable book about it.MMG"},{"Title":"Reclaiming the Ivory Tower: Organizing Adjuncts to Change Higher Education","review":"\\"If an adult calls you teacher...\\"--buy this book.Feeling isolated teaching in a college?

I have truly learned a lot about assembly programming from this, but I have supplemented it with tutorials on the internet. There are quite a few instances where you think \\"well, what does he mean by this?,\\" yet the author doesn't always clear it up. Generally speaking, the author does a good job of walking you through the code and hardware hookups, which is very helpful.This book surely needs some editing. The author is not a big fan of commas and often phrases things in a slightly awkward way. This is but a minor annoyance as the point is still understandable after a short moment of reflection.I would also like to see an updated version that introduces the PIC16F628 instead of the PIC16F84, which is understood to be obsolete (though still useful) as the 16F628 is more modern, cheaper, and generally perceived to be a replacement of the 16F84.With all of that said, I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn assembly on the PIC.

There is no heavy technical 'jargon' early on which all of my other 5 PIC books are guilty of.

To do so, he presents for instance Oedipus Rex, followed by Hamlet, then reproduces Freud's comments on the Oedipal Complex as well as Frances Fergusson's article on tragedy as the inheritor of the role of ritual sacrifice. This allows a teacher to present differing critical views and contexts for each work. This approach works well, generally, and I've used this book for an Advanced Placement high school literature course for several years. It would be an excellent general anthology for college use.The range of selections is generous to a fault--the book is unusually broad in its inclusiveness, including in its selection of criticism--and several mini-anthologies (a selection of Gary Snyder's poetry, for instance) within the text make for interesting case studies amid the more general assortment.Chapters on poetic devices and prosody are also complemented with chronologically-arranged anthologies of stories and poems, and the selections in drama are both adventurous in their newer titles and safely within the classics. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Literature: The Evolving Canon","review":"Though the selections in this book are excellent and unexpected, Birkerts seems in his analyses to be overly elementary. He draws too many concrete inferences from ambiguous material and situations. I'm quite dissapointed with his analyses..... they seem much better suited as introductory high school texts than college ones. His analyses and writings about his chosen subject seem rather dry. I reccomend this text only for its selection of international authors whom I may not have discovered had it not been for this text. The content of discussion is dismissible, however. As an alternative, I suggest Ciardi's &quot;How Does A Poem Mean?&quot; He covers basically the same territory, but does so with passion and an obvious joy in the unnailable. A much more thoughtful treatment, ultimately leaving the task of determining meaning &amp; appreciation of a piece (or Performance, as he explains) to the reader."},{"Title":"Highs!: Over 150 Ways to Feel Really, Really Good...

A few coincidental meetings and a life altering event seem to have Casey and Alfred on a collision course with fate.Casey and Alfred's relationship has many ups and downs, near misses and threat to life before love conquers all. The secondary characters provide much to the storyline especially Casey's beautician friend &quot;Punkin&quot;. I was a little undecided as to how I would rate this story after I read it but there was enough intrigue though little romantic heat to make it a good read.

Burr is the son of a poor, rural Virginia farmer and is considered low class. However to raise above his social class he reads books and buddies up with the local judge, who tutors him in law. The novel follows Burr's life as he grows up with his friends and the girl next door, Eugenia. Inevitably, there is a bond between the two but as life takes its course she realizes that he is too low class for her. Burr winds up being elected to the assembly and winds up as the governor of Virginia. He is loved and respected by the people despite his enemies' politics and is known as an honest man. However, Eugenia, his childhood sweetheart, had ran out of patience waiting for him to become success and marries someone else. She is in a loveless marriage, but realizes she missed marrying someone with more character. I found the book long-winded. I had a hard time getting any excitement out of the book, until almost 60% of the way through and then it was only a small blip on the radar. However, there were some picturesque descriptions of rural Virginia that were well done (the hard cover edition also includes at least 20 black and white photos). Reading the dialog from the Negro servants was also a battle in translation and most of the time not worth the effort. Nicholas was indeed a heroic character worthy of admiration but I found his treatment rather adumbrated. Like other Glasgow books, Glasgow's main characters always seem to be happy when they get over &quot;the love thing&quot; and wind up alone."},{"Title":"The Voice of the People","review":"Nick Burr is the son of a poor farmer; he is about to apprentice in a law firm when he decides to take a job in a store instead (his family needs the money).

Nick's love is for Eugenia Battle, whom he pursues throughout the novel; she is an upper-class girl who decides to marry within her own class and Nick's loss. Already in this early novel Glasgow is establishing two of her major themes as a writer: the role of race and class in Southern society.

Collins and Collins have identified a monumental problem that faces all of us everyday. They examine both sides of the customer service problem and look at how to fix the problems. I travel every week and can really identify with the topics discussed. This book has made me deal with my customers in a better way and has helped me realize that I am sometimes the person whose expectations are too high- I have been a better, more patient customer and have imporoved on skills when dealing with those not-so-fun situations that arise from my customers. This book should be read by anyone who steps foot out of their house to travel, go to work, eat in restaurants, etc. I am buying a copy for everyone in my team at the office."},{"Title":"Overcoming the Customer Service Syndrome: A Practical Guide to Managing Customer Service","review":"Why are Customers so difficult, so angry, so out of control so often? And why do those serving them sometimes hate to go to work rather than encounter them? How can life be made more pleasant for everyone involved?These are the questions addressed and answered in the book, &quot;Overcoming the Customer Service Syndrome,&quot; which is a practical guide to managing customer service. For every customer service professional, it should be required reading.Not only does this book define the demands and expectations of today's customers, it also examines the feelings, the aggravations, and the demands experienced by those who serve. For years, the saying &quot;the customer is always right,&quot; has crippled the professional who believes that is true. It is not! And customers who are unreasonable and sometimes even insulting must learn that their business is not as important as civility in the marketplace. Servers must be taught and then empowered to deal with people and problems.Professional servers are given insights into handling customers and are given activities in which their skills in doing so can be honed. How to train new employees and how to encourage discouraged veteran employees is also embodied in this practical guide. It is, above all, a carefully researched study about enhancing the workplace and making life pleasant for both customers and those who serve them. The Book provides scenarios through which its readers can deal with specific situations and also keep a written account of what they have learned."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"Olney is acknowledged by the best in the food field (like Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley) as an unimpeachable source of excellence in understanding, tasting, and (by the way) cooking French food. He is, I must acknowledge, opinionated, even arrogant -- he is also almost always right. This book should be read as well as cooked with; absorb it through the skin if you can. My favorites include roasted calf's liver -- absolutely sublime -- and lamb shanks with garlic (unforgettably good). As a european, I acknowledge his view of scrambled eggs as they should be -- soft and creamy, not the overcooked, dried-out buffet eggs of the american breakfast table. And his recipe for poached eggs is perfect -- boil water, turn off the flame, break in eggs, cover, leave.Simple french food doesn't mean simple cooking; it actually takes real work. But this is the best overall treatise I have read (among hundreds). My second copy is falling apart, I have given it to many friends and I will go on buying it until they take me to the great restaurant in the sky. Don't be without it."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"For Americans, Richard Olney is one of the three most influential writers on French cuisine, along with Julia Child and Elizabeth David, although these three all approach their subject from a different direction. Child is the great popularizer who succeeded in communicating \`la cuisine Bourgeoise' without compromising on the techniques used by housewives in Paris and Lyon and Provence. David was the \`culinary anthropologist', possibly less interested in culinary technique as in rustic culinary traditions and thinkings. Olney is the ambassador of haute cuisine to American restaurant kitchens. He was a colleague of James Beard, who recommended Olney to Time Life to edit their popular series on world food. The California gang, Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower also cite him as the ultimate authority on French cuisine.Olney's notion of \`simple' is quite different from what you may expect from modern fast home cooking proponents such as Rachael Ray and Sandra Lee. His explanation of \`simple food' requires a rather closely reasoned seven pages in his Preface. Olney's position is like my favorite anecdote of Mario Batali commenting on a trainee's \`rustic' dice job, he says \`No dude, that's just lazy'. Olney recognizes that what many people call simple is really an excuse for the lazy cook. At the other extreme, Olney dismisses fancy architectural constructions on the dinner plate. This is certainly not lazy, but it is not simple either. Although Olney does not dismiss expensive ingredients like truffles and foie gras, he does indict them as crutches used to replace imagination in the kitchen.Some people may promote being true to simple tastes as being the hallmark of simplicity. Olney rules this out by citing the many rustic methods used to transform base, inexpensive ingredients such as many vegetables into \`something transcendental'. Here, he identifies the source of perceived complexity not in the kitchens of the Sun King (Louis XIV) or even in the Lyon three star kitchen, but in the efforts of peasants to turn marginally tasting ingredients into good food. Olney quotes Curnonsky's statement that \`In cooking, as in all arts, simplicity is the sign of perfection.' Olney adduces from this the notion that the value of simplicity is not in the method but in the outcome. He is definitely opposed to efforts to make a leg of lamb imitate venison. One of his primary concerns is that we have respect for our materials.In a nutshell, he says \`Simplicity-no doubt-is a complex thing' and finally arrives at what he considers the essence of the issue of simplicity and, irony of ironies, ends up sounding like Alton Brown, that glib satirist of the doctrines of French cooks. Olney says that understanding your ingredients and understanding the logic of your procedures is the thing which turns disasters resulting from blindly following recipes into great results. Olney says that like all art, cooking rules can be broken, but they can only be broken to good effect if you know them in the first place and know why they are the rules! This, then lays down the basis for how Olney presents his material. Unlike most books, certainly unlike those by Child and David, Olney addresses a culinary subject very much like Alton Brown in giving a roadmap to a general subject such as terrines, gratins, and egg dishes.This is not to say Olney would disagree with Child or David. In fact, I almost fell over when I ran into Olney's introduction to making an omelet where he says that \`no method is better than any other'. This comes straight out of the mouth of Elizabeth David who says that the best omelet recipe is the one which works for you. One must be fair and say that both authors still have a pretty clear idea of what an omelet is and how it is different, for example, from scrambled eggs, for which, by the way, Olney gives an excellent recipe.Olney's book is like many of David's books in that you can read it from cover to cover and feel much richer for it without having made a single recipe. But, unlike David, Olney's recipes are as finely detailed as Childs, with the added attraction that he explains what is going on and why. One of my favorite examples is his explanation of why finely sieved hard boiled egg yolks go so well with bitter greens, as they perform a function very similar to salt in balancing the bitter with the fatty and making the combination that much more worthy to eat.Olney is a great fan of vegetables. His discussions and recipes for vegetables are some of the best and this must be one of the things which attract Ms. Waters to his writings.This book is a classic and easily high on the list of choices for my ten best. The Preface summarized above is a bit tough but if you have any interest in food other than something you need to keep you alive, this book will reward you."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"This is a modern classic, and regularly acknowledged as such. Its charm is in several parts. First, there is Olney's distinctive prose, which is a literary pleasure in itself, then there is the way he avoids as much as possible set recipes (though there are lots of splendid recipes here): his idea being rather to communicate an attitude towards preparing good food, illustrated with possibilities (if you happen to have some of this to hand, do this, if you have that, then do the other, alternatively, try something else entirely).It also says something about his definition of simplicity that while he is, to put it mildly, uncompromising in his attitude to food, it is possible for someone living in a shared student flat to learn a lot from him (as I did). I'm currently on my second copy, the first having deteriorated, in the course of years, into a bundle of loose sheets."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"I am a true devotee of Olney's food and wine writing and place &quot;Simple French Food&quot; at the top of his list of books, even over &quot;The French Menu Cookbook.&quot; No, the word &quot;simple&quot; in the title does not mean that the book contains recipes that are necessarily quick and easy, although there are some. Instead, &quot;simple&quot; refers to the food itself. It's the food (historically, at least) found in french country restaurant and home kitchens - soul satisfying food that has little if anything to do with showy &quot;eye-candy&quot; found in the famed three star establishments. Wonderful gratins, terrines, roasts, daubes ... that truly maximize the flavor of the ingredients listed in the recipes. Olney was an American artist who lived in France for decades and over the years became an expert on French food and wine. Indeed, he was widely respected by the French for his expertise (no mean accomplishment!). He is often cited by now famous American chefs for his influence on their careers (for example, Alice Waters, Mark Miller, James Peterson, Jeremiah Tower). While some might think his writing style verbose, I consider it to be uniquely informative and entertaining. I only wish he had written more books before his untimely death. (This review is based on the hardbound volume printed in 1974)"},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"I always enjoy reading this book. The author comes across with a real and tangible point of view on every page. Some books on cooking micromanage the reader into producing really good meals; others might succeed in conveying some sort of grasp of the the overall philospohies imbedded in a given cuisine or dining tradition. In my opinion, this book is all about attitude. Open up to any random page of Simple French Food, read a paragraph or so, and you'll get the gist of this book. I'll always end up reading through a whole section or two, just for enjoyment. In addition, I find that the text usually inspires me to work harder at my improving my grasp of French cuisine.As for SFF being a cookbook: I have tried about half a dozen of its recipes and I am still looking for one that causes someone to request that I make the same recipe again. Now, clearly, this may be a comment on my cooking ability: In fact, I don't at all consider myself to be a great cook, but I am an avid cook and I have had my share of good fortune in the kitchen. I just find the recipes in SFF to be sort of exotic in an unappetizing way, and I am jealous of the other, more positive, reviewers here who have had successes with these recipes.In summary: I have given up on it as a source for meal recipes, but it's a legit addition to any cookbook shelf ... there are things to be learned from this book."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"In the 1970s, I picked this up in a San Francisco book store. The table was stacked with what must have been 50 copies and they were on sale for a couple of dollars. Now I wish that I had scooped them all up to give out to friends, as, for a time, it was hard to come by this book. This reissue in hardcover is most welcome.Olney--to me--was an American Elizabeth David, however, his recipes did offer more detail. He was an excellent cook and writer. His menu book is also excellent, as he takes the designing of a menu very seriously.It is this book, however, that I come back to time and again. The first recipe I tried back in 1974 was the Hot Onion Omelet with Vinegar (Omelette a la Lyonnaise) on page 94 of the original. It is pure heaven and I have made it about once a month since then (that makes about 360 omlets). It is a perfect meal with a simple salad of arugala or mesclun and a light vinaigrette.On the subject of vinaigrette Olney states, \\"As I understand it, it is made of salt, freshly ground pepper, good red-wine vinegar, and first cold-pressing olive oil. It is so easy to make that to prepare a quantity in advance to be stored is risibly impractical. Its commonest faults are: An excess of vinegar; poor oil; poor vinegar.\\" He goes on to say that the best olive oil he has found on the American market is James Plagniol. While this is a nice olive oil we have many, many superior choices now available to us in \\"America\\".Several of the recipes reflect the fish and seafood he had readily available to him in the south of France, where he lived. I especially like his vegetables recipes for their diveristy and often interesting treatment.While I have not prepared every single recipe in the book, I can say that I have made most without one loser."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"Many of the reviews posted here bemoan the fact that the recipes in this volume are not \\"simple\\" enough... they require careful selection of raw materials, attention to detail, heightened sensibility, occasionally some difficult technique. But the reference to \\"simple\\" in the title is not, as some might assume, a sort of promise that \\"Anyone Can Cook.\\" It is, instead, an affirmation of Olney's approach -- a relatively short list of ingredients, a few central flavors and textures and not a lot of fuss for the sake of fuss. No complexity for its own sake, and no piling on of flavors and \\"stuff\\" to make it big or showy or \\"ethnic\\" or whatever.His approach is definitely not for the beginner who cannot boil water or doesn't know veal from stewing beef. It isn't for those who are looking for \\"20 minute meals to impress your friends\\" or how to make chef so and so's signature dish. Indeed, while there are recipes, much of the book consists of mere suggestions. Look, for example, at Olney's chapter on salads. He begins with some general ideas about dressings -- how to select a good quality oil, what sort of vinaigrette you might want to make to dress greens and what sort to accompany cold meats, when you might want to consider adding strong mustard and when you might think of something else. Then he describes crudites - no recipe, just a few paragraphs of ideas and things you might consider when you shop and when you begin to put together a platter. Ditto the entry on asparagus -- how to pick the most flavorful, how to peel and steam and cool; and then he will counsel to \\"eat it cold, toss it in butter, throw it into a salad or an omelet, cover it with bechamel and buttered breadcrumbs and gratinee it, puree the stems and mix with the tips into a souffle batter...\\" The entry ends with that ellipsis, I didn't add it. That's the way Olney does things. And the book goes on like this, interspersed with a recipe here and some general observations and advice and ideas there.Every one of the recipes cries out for experimentation, modification, customization to match what's in the market, how much \\"technique\\" you are willing or unwilling to bring to bear to complete the dish. Many a \\"recipe\\" is really just a formula or \\"modele\\" -- some are even called simply \\"impromptu,\\" to let you know this is one day's improvised performance but tomorrow's could and probably should be a variation on the theme. It's jazz in the kitchen.I've had this book since I bought my first paperback copy, copyright 1977. It's covered with sauce, oil, butter, wine, stock. I have a hardback first edition that sits in a place of honor -- the paperback remains the working tool and it can get as sloppy as it wanna be. And it is from this falling from the bone paperback book, along with the Joy of Cooking and the two volumes of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" that I went from a kid who didn't know that bread was something you could make at home with some flour, water, yeast, oil and salt, or that asparagus does not grow in cans, to a young adult confident enough to improvise and good enough to do so with success.To use the book to greatest advantage, look at one of Olney's \\"you could do it this way, or you could do it that way, or you could do it this way and that way\\" recipes, like the \\"Saute-Type\\" formula (you really cannot call it a \\"recipe\\") in the Meats and Poultry chapter. You will begin reading Olney's meditation on \\"Stews (ragouts, daubes, sautes...).\\" That will get your juices flowing. Then thumb through the \\"Saute-modele for 4,\\" which will give you a nearly infinite variety of options for the dish you will compose with Olney's guidance. He isn't giving you a recipe, he is helping you make your own \\"recipe,\\" which you will then repeat, with this modification and that, for the rest of your life. He will tell you what you ought to do should you choose to use lardons in your daube, how to prepare and add various vegetables to add flavor and how to separately prepare vegetables to garnish the final dish, how you might want to use stock or wine or water as a moistening agent and eventual base for a sauce. You could start with veal, or lamb, or beef, or chicken, or rabbit -- and you just take off your training wheels, get up on your bike and go from there. If you fall, it won't hurt too much. You can try again.I recall my first experience with this \\"saute-modele.\\" I found a fresh local rabbit, cut up for braising. Carefully browned it in olive oil and butter, deglazed with wine, gently braised with homemade stock and a mirepoix, added a fresh bouquet garni, some garlic, some this and that and then, as Olney suggests, prepped and butter braised each of the vegetables I would use as a garnish for the final presentation, then strained and reduced the braising liquid, thickened with beurre manie, and assembled all on a large oval platter, ringed with triangles of fresh bread sauteed in foaming butter, the glistening crisp tips of the triangles dipped in finely chopped fresh herbs to make a crown all around, the sauce napped over all. It took a couple of hours or more, this is true, but the whole process was like going on vacation, with breaks to study for exams; and the eating, with a couple of bottles of excellent cru beaujolais and two couples at the table, was like landing in a very good bistro in Burgundy. Every time I have made this dish since then, it has been new, different, easier, never dull. Sometimes veal, sometimes rabbit, sometimes chicken, whatever.Then there are some simple, elegant, \\"country cooking\\" recipes -- pork chops and apples in mustard sauce; fish filets with zucchini; fresh fig and mint salad. Every one of them requiring attention to detail for success, every one of them calling for just a few ingredients carefully chosen for freshness and flavor and amenable to improvisation.Finally, some demanding terrines and charcuterie, or at least I've always thought they are demanding. Others may not.So there you have it. Nothing is fussy, everything is \\"simple,\\" but not undemanding. If you take some time, give it some thought, pay a lot of attention, this book will teach you to teach yourself to select and combine ingredients, to do your mise en place and prepare your meal, to take pleasure in a simple meal well conceived and executed, in a leisurely way, and paired with complementary wines.Now I ask, what more could anyone ask for in a \\"cookbook?\\" No, it ain't a TV show knockoff. It won't tease you with glossy color photos of spreads prepped and lighted by a \\"food stylist\\" and a fashion photographer. There's no perky Rachel Ray on the cover or cutesy \\"yums\\" involved. But I promise you, slow down and listen to this book, work with it, and you will learn to cook and you will take pleasure in cooking and eating for the rest of your life.That's what I call a great food classic. Olney wrote and edited a number of other books. Some are very good, but none of them comes close to this one. Five stars ain't enough."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"Following ANNE95816's glowing review of the Hot Onion Omelet with Vinegar (Omelette a la Lyonnaise) from this book, I gave it a try.Following Mr. Olney's directions in this book, mine was a dismal failure. :)\\"THREE LARGE sweet onions, halved and finely sliced\\" to only THREE eggs? How can this possibly be correct, I wondered?Pulling out the egg volume from the Time-Life series of cookbooks that Mr. Olney edited, I found a recipe for Omelet Lyonnaise and realized what the problem was -- this isn't for my idea of an omelet (light and foldover style) but for a sort of egg/onion flat/thick pancake. (Mr. Olney gives no indication of this whatsoever in the instructions in Simple French Food, but there's a photograph of an omelet in this style in the Time-Life book.)And herein is my only criticism with this book. Mr. Olney can be a little vague in the directions he provides at times.If you want to give this alternative recipe for Omelet Lyonnaise a try, the recipe from the Time-Life books Mr. Olney edited is as follows:1. Heat butter in a large omelet pan over low heat (until bubbling stops but before butter begins to brown).2. Put in onion (THINLY chopped) and some chopped parsley, and season with salt and pepper. (That's all there is -- no idea how many onions, but that's okay, you can use your judgment. One large one should do.) Cook the onions until they are translucent and lightly browned. (The Simple French Food book says to cook them until just before they begin to brown and not to allow them to brown.)3. Pour 3 eggs (presumably stirred with a fork first to break them up) over the onion mixture and heat until the underside is lightly brown and the top side almost set.4. Turn it over (like a pancake) and cook for one minute, then transfer to a serving dish that's been pre-warmed in an oven.5. Heat a bit of butter in the pan and when it stops foaming (but before it browns) drizzle the butter over the omelet. (This step is borrowed from the recipe in Simple French Food and does not appear in the Time-Life instructions.)6. Add white wine vinegar to the hot pan, bring it quickly to a boil, and sprinkle it over the omelet just before serving.Enjoy.____________________Also, because I loved these books so much, but they're little known (and they may appeal to people who like good cooking and things French or Italian), you might want to check out At Home in France by Ann Barry and also Extra Virgin by Annie Hawes.Both are absolutely wonderful and somewhat hidden gems here in the U.S."},{"Title":"Simple French Food","review":"I haven't cooked a single recipe from this book, but I have learned more from it than from every other book on cooking I have read in the last ten years.

Simple here ought not be equated with &quot;easy&quot; (there are native French cooks [as Olney was not] who tell us very well how to cook French classics without the preludes that belong to classic cuisine, and have written cookbooks telling us their secrets for easy French food in a fast hour -- or in fifteen or even ten minutes). Rather Olney's adjective refers to food that is what it is. And all excellence turns on achieving just such simplicity. This simplicty is what Nietzsche meant by his (alas! persistently misunderstood) effort at rehabilitating the basic sense of the German &quot;schlecht&quot; -- &quot;schlechthin,&quot; &quot;schlicht&quot;: as basic or plain in the way that a cru bourgeois is so often the better wine (passed over when the ambitious make a wine purchase to impress friends), and this is the simplicity that the French mean in their utterly non-English way of understatement: qualifying a wine less in confectionist's terms than its basic &quot;drinkability.&quot; Olney addresses the mystery of simplicity by analysing the alchemy of the dish as such: what goes into what is made -- the ingredients, including the countryside but also the tradition, the society, the assumptions, and the range of variation with availability and with the season -- and he caps this off with recipes that provide a heuristic precision (and here the conventional intepretation of a book on &quot;simple French food&quot; coincides with the esoteric one) and the beginner or the experienced cook finds himself/herself captivated by a dish that is exactly what it ought to be. This is a book less for those fond (although Olney was fond) of James Beard than for those who admire the elegance of Claiborne; a book for those who appreciate the preludes (above all) and afterthoughts accompanying the recipes in the &lt;Joy of Cooking&gt; (only the original bears any kind of comparison).

I am troubled that some of the solved problems seem to have glaring errors. If I am wrong, I hope someone will correct me (If I were an expert in this field, there would be no point in buying the publication). On page 84, material is presented that indicates that for an n-channel MOSFET to be active, vgs must be greater than or equal to Vt. Solved problems 4.10 and 4.11 have solutions showing the MOSFET active with vgs &lt; Vt. Solved problem 4.12 appears to have a similar error. I am sympathetic to the difficulties of putting together such a publication and ensuring that it's void of errors. To me the solution is to post an errata sheet on the internet. I have contacted the publisher seeking an errata sheet for another book. Their response was basically, &quot;thank you for bringing the errors to our attention, but no, we can't make the errata sheet available.&quot; It seems to me that posting of errata sheets on the net would enhance the value of McGraw-Hill's products. An alternative may be to sponsor a forum or chat-room for each book, so that users could compare thoughts. On the whole, I rate this publication a B- or C+. I have found this and other Schaum's Outlines to be helpful when used to augment other materials."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Electronic Devices and Circuits, Second Edition","review":"ELECTRONIC DEVICES &amp; CIRCUITS, SECOND EDITION - CATHEYIt's always interesting to see how authors attempts to fill those niches between basic DC/AC circuit analysis with passive components and analog (linear) circuit design/analysis with active electronic circuit devices. Discounting the fact that this is, after all, an outline on the subject written as a supplement to your text, I'd give it a C+.About 75% of the book is dedicated to diodes and transistor (all types) amplifier circuits. This is basic resistor biasing, find a load line, and establish the Q-point, kind of stuff. If you're studying to become an analog circuit designer, it is unlikely that ever, in your life, will you be called upon to design such a discrete transistor amplifier; however, this is a \\"row you'll have to hoe\\". So if you find yourself in the middle of a blizzard of transistor symbols, parameters, models, characteristics &amp; configurations, this may be of some help; it's no silver bullet.It would have been nice to have seen some introduction to 1) semiconductor physics, 2) current source biasing, 3) oscillators, 4) basic power supplies, 5) data conversion and 6) integrated circuits and etc.Best help will be found in 1) DC and small signal examples of BJT and FET transistor design, 2) transistor modeling, 3) better than average SPICE examples, 4) and working with semiconductor parameters. There's a brief introduction to OP Amps and Switching Regulator power supplies. I didn't see a lot of errors and, with most Schaum's Outlines, there are plenty of practice problems.If you are still looking for help, try looking at some of the books written by Thomas L. Floyd. One hardback - \\"Fundamentals of Linear Circuits\\" - now ten or more years old, can be picked up on the used book shelves for about what you will pay for this outline. His books that I've seen are more for the ET than the EE, however if you're looking for another down to earth view of basic analog circuits, I suggest you check it out."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Electronic Devices and Circuits, Second Edition","review":"For both physics and electrical engineering undergraduates alike, the one to two semester courses you take in electronics shall probably be a difficult transition regardless of how well you did in your circuit analysis course. This is largely due to the fact that nobody tells you WHY this subject is important (to produce nonlinear transfer functions & to perform power amplification- neither which can be accomplished with RLC circuits), or bothers to show you sufficient examples so that you can perform designs of your own. This Schaum's outline is an excellent companion to all of those electronics textbooks that are failing miserably. Other reviewers are right- as a practicing engineer you will probably never be called upon to bias a transistor to get a specified gain, or several other of the basic tasks that this outline goes over in detail. However, you won't be able to graduate until you master these techniques. As an example of its usefulness, I got a B in my first semester of electronics years ago, and for years I could not have told you the first thing about what went on in that class. It seemed that the students that really did well were part magician and part TV repairman. I bought this outline to learn what I should have mastered back in 1979, and the book made me understand the circuit design techniques involved plus brought me up-to-date in design and analysis techniques.The outline does not talk about the semiconductor physics of electronic devices. Instead it concentrates on design techniques for circuits that incorporate the diode, BJT, FET, and operational amplifier, which are crafts you must master. Included in this outline is how to define an electronic circuit in PSPICE and the last chapter incorporates all you have learned throughout the book into the analysis and design of a switched mode power supply. I highly recommend this book as a supplement to undergraduate electronics textbooks."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Electronic Devices and Circuits, Second Edition","review":"Concisely written, clear in presentation and all derivations.

Unfortunately, I used my desktop computer to download the ebook, because it is connected to DSL. What I want is to have the ebook on my laptop (not connected to DSL, though), so I can read the ebook at work. The good news is that this ebook didn't cost very much. I also don't think this is Amazon's problem, but they happen to be the messenger.So far I have read one page of the book, which is not neither good nor bad (meaning 2.5 stars).

Gerber. Gerber's book was published in 1961, the same year as William L. Shirer's biography of the Fuhrer, THE RISE AND FALL OF ADOLF HITLER. Alan Bullock's monumental HITLER: A STUDY IN TYRANNY continued to dominate the field as it had since its publication in 1952.At the time of their publication in 1961, there wasn't any biography of Hitler by an American. Walter Charles Langer's 1943 study of Hitler, done for the OSS, hadn't been released for publication yet nor would it be until 1972 when it was published as THE MIND OF ADOLF HITLER.Shirer's book is essentially a summary derived from his epic RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH which was published in 1960. Gerber's biography is more detailed and comprehensive. For example, Gerber's treatment of young Adolf's escalating conflict with his authoritarian father is more complete. He writes that \\"his father was pro-Hapsburg; Adolf leaned toward Germany. His father was a conscientious Catholic; Adolf tried to break away from the Church. One day, forced to take Communion by his father, he spat out the Host in protest.\\" (p. 9).Although trained as a lawyer instead of a historian, Gerber writes well and I found his book easy to read. If you already know about Hitler, you won't find any real revelations in THE LIFE OF ADOLF HITLER, but it's a good summary and I did see details in it that I hadn't noticed anywhere else.Although it doesn't have any discernable collector value, it is interesting to read one of the first biographies of Hitler written by an American author. It's widely available at low prices, as is Shirer's biography. You could get them both for the price of latte.I liked the book and gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Blood Son","review":"This is a gripping adventure speculating on what might have been, or perhaps already is!What if Adolph Hitler had a son? What if he was spirited away as Berlin was falling? What if a powerful group of ex-Nazi officers was gathered in Argentina looking to resurrect the Third Reich? What if Hitler's son fell among these die-hards?The writing draws the reader into the story, but the mood is ambiguous. Do we want the boy to survive to manhood or be put away as U.S. intellicence officers prefer?Strong character delevelopment and well-documented, this is a worthwhile book for any interested in the end of World War II and its aftermath. The feeling of the expatriot Nazi community in South America seems particularly realistic.My only criticism is that I found the ending hard to swallow. Others, however, may find it inevitable. But this makes for a well-told tale that is worth mulling over."},{"Title":"Blood Son","review":"Blood Son is a terrific read. Webster has taken a nightmare,the resurgence of the Third Reich, and made it plausible. He takes the reader right into Hitler's Bunker as the Russians are taking Berlin and aactually engenders empathy for the beleagured Nazis. Hitler has entrusted his and Eva Braun's son, Frederick,to two of his trusted subordinates and wants him taken to safety. Ernst Brunner and Hitler's friend and secretary Greta make a hair-raising trip out of Berlin to South America with the boy. Webster's characterization is so skillfully handled that the reader finds himself rooting forthe trio but, by the end of the novel, ardently hoping for Brunner's defeat. The reader, after the exciting climax, is taken several years into the future and finds out what has become of the characters--to a point. There remains the question of Frederick's future. What will he do next? Webster also retires one of the most likeable sleuths in fiction, Adrian Drum. One can only hope that there willbe a sequel, Adrian will come out of retirement, and there will follow further adventures of Frederick. In addition to being a first-rate story, Blood Son is a pleasure to read in terms of style."},{"Title":"Daybreak into Darkness","review":"Deeply touching story of one man's struggles in the face physical illness, his wife's escalating mental illness, the horror of her disappearance, and the stress of being the prime suspect in the disappearance -- all while caring for two young sons.

It is a tremendously valuable book, but in the end, we all have different strengths upon which we must build our style to maximize our effectiveness in any arena. This book contains many stories illustrating the various styles that have been effective. They are inspirational as well as informative, and may help many to develop their style to achieve even greater success!A good companion book would be the the second in the Gallup series, \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\"."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"Everyone is familiar with the \\"Gallup\\" pole with a + or - margin of error presented on the nightly news, but most can't even fathom all the data Gallup must have accumulated over the years. With an abundance of survey and interview data, they (aka Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman) produced the first model and book (titled \\"First, Break All The Rules\\") based on leveraging employee strengths to drive organizational effectiveness. Since then other books such as \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths,\\" \\"Follow This Path,\\" and, subsequently, \\"Discover Your Sales Strengths\\" have been released. The premise of the model is that if an organization or person focuses on developing their strengths rather than only their \\"weaknesses\\" they will achieve greater success...moving from Good to Great! When you purchase \\"Discover Your Sales Strengths\\" you will be given a code to access a survey which will allow you to see which five of the 34 themes are your areas of strength. The results may be surprising to some. The interesting factor is that your survey data are compared to thousands and probably millions of other normative data points. At that point, it is the reader's responsibility to read the book and learn about their strengths and determine how to apply it to sales situation. Furthermore, managers should take the cumulative strengths of their respective teams and manage to those strengths. Theoretically speaking, this book is similar to the previous three books; however, the difference lies in aspect of sales such as customer engagement and sales management. Overall, the model is familiar, but the application is different. This book should be a must for everyone in sales. Self awareness and social awareness are key factors to succeeding in sales and in life."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"The book is very insightful.

Many salespeople find themselves frustrated in jobs where they don't fit in and can't succeed. Using research by the Gallup organization, authors Benson Smith and Tony Rutigliano explain why many organizations handicap themselves with underperforming sales forces.

I read both, and they are great."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"Most self-help books for the sales field try to pump you up with motivational quotes and stories and give you standard steps to success. This is the first self-help sales book that really made sense. It is based on very solid research but is written in a pleasant and easy to understand manner. I will definitely be re-reading it in more depth.I still would have liked to read more real-life example stories and had more data on what kind of talent combinations tend to correlate with the highest levels of performance in the most common sales roles.One point they did not emphasize enough is that it is not so much the dominant talents that you have, but how you actively apply and adapt them to your job. Two people with very different dominant talent themes can sometimes succeed equally well by applying their unique strengths and managing their weaknesses. Also, it is possible to overwhelm a weakness with a particular strength to make it irrelevant."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"I have been hanging around the Gallup Organization for 20 years, and have seen many significant discoveries bloom.

But nowhere do they give us the real meat of these studies. Instead they dance around it and make us wonder why we just spent our valuable time and money reading a couched advertisement for their services.Nevertheless, the 12 good management points (Q12) do offer an excellent reference tool for a manager who wants to provide improved employee morale and productivity.Please, Gallup, give us the &quot;12 points&quot; for hiring various positions in organizations. Don't keep it a secret."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"Bar none, this is the best book you will ever read about the art of selling. Moreover, this book will change the way you think about hiring, training, managing and motivating anyone who is responsible for bringing new customers to your organization and keeping those customers engaged.See of you can answer this question from the book correctly:What do the top sales and marketing professionals have in common?a. Experience and backgroundb. Education and trainingc. Great presentation skillsd. Aggressive closerse. None of the aboveIf you guessed \\"e\\", you are correct. According Gallup's extensive research spanning 30 years and interviews with 250,000 sales people, over 1 million customers and 25,000 sales managers, this is what the top sales people have in common:* They were in the type of sales job where they were able to use their top talents every day* They developed their own unique selling style based on their top talents* They had a productive relationship with their manager.Since the top 25 % of the sales force accounts for 57% of the sales revenue in most organizations, the more sales people get to use their top talents, the more likely they are to build a sustainable and profitable customer base.So, how do you discover your individual strengths and talents? One of the unique features of this book is that you go to an Internet site and take an assessment that will immediately tell you what your top five strengths are. What I found intriguing is that these strengths are much more practical than the strengths I have seen in any other kind of assessment instruments. You can then use the book to determine how to put these strengths to work for you so they become true talents. (By focusing on these strengths I have increased my own productivity by 100%!!)The other thing I really liked about this book is the easy to read format and the fact that the author includes great real world stories and examples of how top sales people used their talents to excel in their job. The author, Benson Smith, who started his career as a successful salesperson with a Fortune 500 medical device company and eventually became the CEO, writes in clear business language and does not spend a lot of time espousing complicated theories. If anything, the book is too short and leaves you wanting more.The book also talks about the key role that managers play in insuring the success of the sales effort. The chapter on management should be required reading for anyone who is a manager or thinks they want to become one. (You will also find this chapter extremely helpful if your current manager is less than ideal.)I have spent over 20 years in the medical and pharmaceutical industry in sales, management, marketing and training. Over the last 9 years, I have had a successful business focused on performance development consulting and training. This book has inspired me to rethink my approach. I hope it will do the same for others in my profession. Most organizations tie training to \\"improvement opportunities.\\" Gallup's research has found that training will be far more productive if you focus on strengths and how to build them into true talents."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"I will first tell you that I have read thousands of books over the course of my life, many were books on business and sales. This is the first time that I have ever felt compelled to write a review. Also this is the first time I ever read a business book and then felt disappointed when the book was over, I would normally feel that way at the end of a particularly good novel.I'll just have to go and buy all the other books in the series.The information imparted by &quot;Discovering Your Sales Strengths&quot; has had a profound impact on me. Undoubtedly many salespeople that read the book will suddenly understand their own career a whole lot better. And hopefully this will be the beginning of the end of unenlightened and just plain dumb sales management.This book has also greatly improved my overall confidence. I will probably be changing jobs later this year and I'll actually really know what kinds of jobs to aggressively pursue."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"Once again the Gallup organization, specifically Benson Smith and Tony Ruttigliano, deliver a good usable book to help improve your career based on strengths. This book begins with Gallup's common message, based on research, that if you focus on what you are good at; you will get better at it. This book continues on showing you what makes up a these strengths, based on a combination of talents which cluster together and come out as things like Competition, Empathy, and Command. This book will allow you to focus more on how you are wired, and what you have, than what you do not, and will never have.Most importantly this book gives you access to your 'Top Five' strengths, or patterns for success. These strengths, ranging from Harmony to Woo, will show you how you alone are as unique as 1 in 30 million people. The book could have been 5 stars if Gallup would have provided more patterns of strength and how they work in sales careers, they only give you a few morsels from their vault of knowledge and what patterns and combinations of strengths work in sales. They do let you in on the fact that Competition, Command and Empathy were themes commonly found in successful sales-agents.Overall this book is an A-, another great work from Gallup based on research, not just theory.Joseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"DO NOT buy this book if you've already read the Gallup Organization's earlier book, 'Now, Discover Your Strengths' by Buckingham. They're almost identical and you really learn nothing new in 'Sales.' Having taken the StrengthFinders tests for both books, I found that 3 of 5 strengths were the same for me. In addition, I found that 'Sales Strengths' did nothing to tell me what sales environment or type of sales I should be in. The authors did a poor job of applying the theoretical strengths to practical sales environments and telling me that if I have x strength I should seek y sales job.

I could not understand why my sales performance was so poor in a company that I cared so deeply about. My conclusion was that I must be a [lousy] sales guy. WRONG!This book taught me that sales success comes from finding and using my talents. This requires that I work in a role that allows me to fully leverage those talents. This was a wonderful insight for me and I feel a great deal of gratitude to the authors for giving me the direction I was looking for. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who felt success was eluding them in their sales career.However, anyone looking to see the documented research may not be satisfied. Sure, there are some juicy morsels to enjoy along the way, but most often I kept wanting to go deeper into the research. The authors' evangelistic style keeps the reader on the straight and narrow. I would have liked the opportunity to draw some of my own conclusions.The supporting website makes this book an incredible value. The online assessment was excellent. Similar tests cost companies hundreds of dollars. The book, along with the assessment, was exactly what I was looking for while I make my next big career decision."},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"I love the Gallup books. Gallup really takes human capital management to the next level. This is not for HR Departments - managers need to work with their employees directly by learning and absorbing the concepts in the Gallup books. It is definitely not for the closed minded reader. All of the principles of the books need to be engaged and used carefully by both employees and their managers.Just opening a page of the book can shake a person's prior beliefs: for example, the book unequivocally states that experience is NOT the determinant of sales performance. Another example: \\"good\\" salespeople are usually not good at selling all types of products. Of course, the book allows the reader to take the strengths finder via the internet (perhaps for the second time, as was my case). Again, the reader needs to carefully consider the results and use the book as a guide to act accordingly.I like how the authors define talents (generally speaking in the Gallup universe, any repeating pattern of feeling, thought, or behavior that can be productively applied). The reader can then observe which strengths he or she has that fit with a particular sales role (page 90): our motivation, the way we build relationships, the way we gain commitments, the structure we need to get our work done, and our ability to understand and solve customer needs.Overall the book is very comprehensive, though succinct (implying that those who wrote the book and the editors have special talents of their own!). It introduces the Q12, the \\"Manager Effect\\", customer engagement, and a section entitled \\"Advice for the World's Best Sales Managers\\". The Appendix lists and defines the 34 different talents/themes (as mentioned, the internet test will tell you your top five). One caveat: this is very personal information, and in the wrong hands it can be very harmful. Carefully and properly used, the book is probably the best scientific resource available for the business world because it is readily understood and applied yet very sophisticated. Very appropriate for those in sales or thinking about a career in sales. econ"},{"Title":"Discover Your Sales Strengths: How the World's Greatest Salespeople Develop Winning Careers","review":"Our company employs Gallup to do their strengths training and everyone of our sales reps gets this book when they are hired on.

Especially recommended to fans of Susie Bright."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Queen's book is a very bold discussion of our culturally defined notions of the place of sex and sexuality, for both women and men. Her writing challenges many long-held feminist notions of &quot;deviant&quot; sexual practices as supporitng the suppression and devaluation of women. Instead, Queen shows through her own personal trials and errors with sex, that women can control, guide and determine their own sexuality through myriad experiences, even those deemed &quot;deviant&quot; by more repressed social factions. While Queen mentions the existence of violence in the sex industry, I feel she too easily dismisses the prevelance of such. True, many women such as herself choose their own path as sex workers, but many do not. More could be said as to how to make &quot;politically correct&quot; choices in the use of sex products/services to support those who choose to participate, as opposed to supporting those who force participation. Queen's experience as an author of erotica is evident in this writing. Interestingly enough, this may begin to cause the reader to question just how much they are in tune with their own sexuality, when after completing a narrative passage, the reader suddenly wonders, &quot;Wow, did that just turn me on?&quot; Of course, you have to not be afraid to read it first. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Seriously, this is an excellent book. Carol Queen is one of the grand dames of sex-positivity. Much (okay, all) of the book is autobiographical, and Queen uses her own experiences to further her ideas about radical sexuality. Ms. Queen is or has been all of the things other reviewers mentioned, and has also received a PhD from the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (IASHS) -- in other words, she knows her stuff. Though some of her prose is light, the stories of Queen's life are fascinating, and the theories she puts forth and hypotheses she posits are valid. I've read Real Live Nude Girl (which are, incidentally, the section titles) several times and almost always quote from it in my own essays about radical sexuality. Fun AND smart."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Real Live Nude Girl is quite simply one of the best books ever written on the human experience. Carol Queen is an intelligent, witty, and powerful writer whose experience in the sexual fringes of our society constitutes a great storehouse of wisdom. She has been a sex worker in areas that range from the peep show booths to training gynecologists how to give an intelligent and sensitive pelvic exam to speaking at men's gatherings.Her approach is straghtforward and honest. She doesn't pull any punches or mince words. She also does not subscribe to the dogma of any \\"isms,\\" and is genuinely concerned with the rights of all people to explore and experience their lives and sexuality in an atmosphere of open acceptance and even celebration. She is sex-positive and proud of it.The book is divided into chapters dealing with different experiences and ideas, such as experiencing different sexual lifestyles, talking with others about your sexuality, being an exhibitionist, sex work, pornography, politics, and so on. Some of the chapter titles are:Don't Fence Me InBisexual Perverts among the Leather LesbiansSafe Words and Safe SexPornography and the Sensitive New Age GuyHealing and Holy Acts: Sacred WhoredomShe deals with sensitive and controversial issues very well, and her writing is easy and pleasurable to follow. She discusses the history of sexual repression in a variety of ways, using her experiences as points of reference. For example, she uses being onstage with Annie Sprinkle to discuss some of the history of sacred sexuality and why some religions have such a morbid fear of sex.There is so much in this book that is so good, I could go on and on. There are six pages of bibliography for further reading, as well as all the people and books mentioned in the text.If you only read one book ever on sex, culture, religion, and human experience, this should be it."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Carol Queen is (or has been) a sexologist, a bisexual, a peep show stripper, a whore, and a damn good writer.

It's also important in that it acknowledges the polical component of our our sexual lives"},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Spurred on by recommendations at Amazon, I purchased Carol Queen's book. Ms. Queen sees herself as a sex priestess if not goddess and frankly I'm prepared to give her such a title - sight unseen. To say her experience is vast and varied seems an understatement. I'm so happy to hear from a bona fide \\"sex positive\\" that I really enjoyed this book.I was reading at furious clip and ran into page 84 like it was a stone wall. Ms. Queen repeats the horrible comparison made between circumsion and the erroneously named genital mutilation called \\"female circumsion\\". She dismisses the scientific reasons for circumsion as \\"late breaking theories\\" and then substitutes the PC-of-the-moment anti-male screed that this is what is what went wrong with so many men. She apparently had never heard that some adult men get circumcised just to improve their sex lifes. Frankly, if a procedure with the same pain and risks would have led to a 10% reduction in tooth decay, I would hope that my parents would go for it.I have to admit the best parts of this book are when she goes squarely after the MacDworkinites (she doesn't use that word but you know who I mean). She has no problem standing up to those who would rather she kept to a more doctrinaire line. At one point she decides to try prostitution and some former friends refer to speak to her. No matter, this is a very independent woman. I wish I met more like her.One minor point, this book is a collection of essays that were previously published and that means she sometimes repeats herself (yes, I know you have a Ph.D. in Sexuality) and any chronology is pretty well lost."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Carol Queen is obsessed with sex much more than she should be, and I don't say this as a fundamental fanatic. I grew up in NYC and find Queen's analysis of sex and sexual preferences goes far beyond the need to classify a person's feelings toward sex. I skipped roughly 70% of the book's chapters to avoid the author's incessant ramblings. Reading the book made me feel I was sitting through a horrible, post-feminist unending lecture, in which Queen makes lame attempts to identify every single sexual preference under the sun, while poorly and boringly validating every sex industry career move she has ever made.Chronicles of a Sex-Positive Culture only goes to prove how some people try to dismantle the mystical erotic pleasure derived from every exciting form of sex."},{"Title":"Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture","review":"Any author who tries to divide the discussion on porn or the sex industry into \\"sex-positive\\" and \\"sex-negative\\" is working from some very immature definitions of sexuality. Unfortunately it merely mirrors our culture's general sexual ignorance.I have worked for years both with survivors of sexual violence and the sex industry, and those who advocate for them. I know many of the realities (rather than rhetoric or fantasy) involved. Realities that include violence, economic exploitation, drug addiction, and high levels of post-traumatic stress syndrome. Realities that include inescapable misogyny, as is only natural when you set aside one class or gender of people to service another.I know that prostitution in particular is dependent on a division of women into human beings and whores. It plays on the economic and social gulf between men and women. Such a division affects all women, and all men as well.Of course, I realize that there will always be those who project an \\"anti-sex\\" ideology on those of us willing to look honestly at these issues. Which is where the silliness comes in, because it is only by addressing these issues (rather than denying them) that you can begin to create a sexuality that is based on equality and humanity.The attitude of the author is unfortunately based on denial, which does nothing to solve the problem, or even address the issue. It simply perpetuates the myth that it is the \\"liberated\\" vs the \\"repressed.\\" Because of her youth, however, I was willing to give it two stars, rather than one.I was extremely surprised, however, to find this book noted on a \\"witchy, feminist, pagan and proud\\" [...] list. My advice to that list owner: Go back and read Starhawk. You have missed her by a mile if you think this kind of attitude is genuinely connected to the erotic."},{"Title":"The island civilizations of Polynesia (Mentor books)","review":"The book was on time and my wife enjoyes it.The price was fair and the packaging also the right size and protection."},{"Title":"The island civilizations of Polynesia (Mentor books)","review":"The book was on time and my wife enjoyes it.The price was fair and the packaging also the right size and protection."},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Boys as Lieutenants or Serving Old Glory as Line Officers","review":"I highly recommend this whole series.

He demonstrated nature's ability to provide mankind with new foods in almost endless variety, and he developed a method for helping nature to create new plants more quickly.He recognized time as a gift of the Creator which is to be used to the fullest extent; and he lived a happpy life of seventy-seven years because he continually tried to be useful....\\"I recommend this book to all from the ages of around eight years on up."},{"Title":"A Dangerous Garden","review":"This story was very intense. The setting was such a peaceful pleasant mountain valley, I was totally blown by the constant sense of danger and tension that pervaded the entire story. I felt for the main character, Daniel, as he dealt with his family responsibilities and his own sense of honour in a drug-soaked environment. His friends were crazy and believable. This small rural community was both normal and wierd at the same time. I felt torn between loving these people and pitying them in their choice of lifestyle. I never knew what the outcome would be until the final pages. I was very satisfied with the story, but also it made me think. Anyone, no matter what their beliefs or age would find this suspense tale compelling."},{"Title":"The Nutcracker: Complete Ballet in Full Score (Dover Music Scores)","review":"I have long awaited this publication. Shortly after I purchased the Nutcracker Suite from Dover 6 years ago, I wrote them multiple times asking them to consider publishing the complete work, but I was disappointed until now.A reprint of an \\"Authoritative Early [Russian?] Edition,\\" the score is very pleasingly engraved, close-spaced but not overly crowded. In the front, there is a translation of all the Russian notes that occur in the text, and all of the French stage directions are translated in footnotes at the bottom of the pages. Though it is over 500 pages, Dover has used paper thinner than their norm (yet with virtually no bleed-through), so the book is not too thick. It is, however, a little floppier than most of my other Dover scores. That, though, is a very small price to pay finally to own a full score of this most-popular ballet!Finally, I can study the orchestration in some of the gems not found in the suite, such as the Waltz of the Snowflakes, Chocolate (Spanish Dance), and others--in an edition that is both affordable and well-made. I had been able to borrow a copy of the 2-volume paperback Kalmus edition (atrociously expensive for a student's budget) from my college library, and I was shocked at how poorly it was bound. The spine cracked after one or two GENTLE usings and pages were about to fall out. Such will not be the case with this Dover edition. I look forward to many years of pleasant study and enjoyment with this volume."},{"Title":"The Nutcracker: Complete Ballet in Full Score (Dover Music Scores)","review":"I finally broke down and bought this excellent reprint of the full score. It completes my circle of \\"Nutcracker\\" appreciation: first as music (as a kid - two recordings and the piano pieces that drove my parents crazy), then as ballet (as a teen, the first ballet I ever saw), then as orchestration (as the celesta player - \\"I AM Sugar-Plum!\\"), and now I can look at the score with full appreciation, with more than one exclamation of \\"So THAT'S how he did it!\\" Everything from the translated Russian to the French stage directions adds to the value of this highly affordable publication.

This was my own mistake because I failed to realize that it was, in fact, merely the suite in full score. But now, after waiting for years after, Dover has presented us with a wonderful full score of the whole ballet that we all know as the most famous ballet ever written. If you are a great admirer of this magnificent work by Tchaikovsky, I highly suggest purchasing this well-priced score."},{"Title":"The Nutcracker: Complete Ballet in Full Score (Dover Music Scores)","review":"Despite the remarks of a couple of previous reviewers, this Dover score is very much a faithful reprint of the score first issued in September 1892 by P.

It's therefore safe to say that this Dover reprint is a terrific bargain.I can understand the previous reviewers' excitement, though. Having the complete ballet available - with page after page of such glorious music - is a pure delight for music lovers.

There is a general lack of crispness, and a grittiness to lines, text that is a bit fatiguing. Digital cleanup of pages is inconsistent, with some pages looking pretty good, others where all features are thickened and dark, and at least one page thinned and spotty.2) Inconsistency: The French score section headings are translated into English and placed on the bottom margin, whereas the Russian score note translations are put into the introductory section before the score.3) Poor translations occasionally pop up: e.g. when discussing \\"Entre&eacute; des parents en incroyables\\", the term incroyables is translated as dandies or fops. This is incorrect. A brief Parisian fashion fad in post-Bastille France after about 1792, the Incroyables and Merveilleuses were young men and women flamboyantly rebelling against the stuffy courtly manners and decadent clothing fashions of their parents. The parents have arrived in fun costumes of their grandparents' generation.4) I should very much have liked to see the score portion for Act II, 12. Divertissement: d. Gigue (English Dance) orchestration by noted ballet conductor John Lanchbery.

It is BIG. The pages are a normal 9 x 12 (or so) but the book is about 2 inches thick and for a score with only 90 minutes of music that's unusual (I know, that was trivial factoid). The cover and pages are sturdy and have held up well to my numerous readings of the score and flipping pages quickly as I follow along with a recording. It's nice to be able to follow one line, say, the clarinet part (I played clarinet) through the piece and be able to hear it because you're focused in on what an individual instrument's part is during the work (it's amazing to hear some of the little details that you normally don't pay attention to). The binding is strong, the print is easy to read, and it has a very reasonable price. It should be in the collection of anyone who reads music and, I guess, those who don't but want to see what the score looks like."},{"Title":"What Government Can Do: Dealing With Poverty and Inequality (American Politics and Political Economy)","review":"This book is very informative about a whole range of social issues.

Northanger Abbey gives the reader a chance to sample life in another era."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I approached this book somewhat warily, knowing that Northanger Abbey was to some degree a satirical take on the immense popularity of Gothic romances such as Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, a book I dearly love. Happily, Austen's means of poking fun at Gothic horror literature are far from mean-spirited and, as a matter of fact, can be delightfully humorous indeed. Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is by no means the type of heroine to be found in the giant tomes of Radcliffe and her indulgent imitators, as Austen tells her reading audience directly from the very start. \\"Almost attractive\\" on a good day, this unintellectual tomboy has reached her fifteenth year without inspiring a young man's fancy, nor would she be able to delight him with musical skill or even draw his profile in her secret notebooks if she had. Having encountered no strangers who would prove to be a lord or prince in disguise, her heroic ambitions seem stymied at best until fate steps in and grants her a stay of several weeks in the delightful town of Bath. Making her transition from nave girl to equally nave young lady, Catherine almost immediately falls quite in love with young Henry Tilney, while at the same time she becomes intimate friends with an older young lady named Isabella, whose inconstancy as both friend and intended beloved of Catherine's own brother eventually brings her much pain. To her intense delight, however, Catherine is invited by General Tilney, Henry's father, to spend some few weeks in his home, Northanger Abbey. Her joy at spending such private time in the company of her beloved and new best friend Eleanor Tilney is immense, but equally exciting to her is the chance to spend time in a mysterious former abbey of the sort she has read so much about. Such Gothic romances as Udolpho have been the source of her recent heroic training, and she is wildly desirous and fully expectant of discovering hidden passages, dark secrets, frightening circumstances, and possibly even incalcitrant perfidy in the halls of her beloved's family home. Her overactive imagination runs wild in Northanger Abbey, bringing her a fair share of embarrassment, but the very sweet and tender sensibilities that fuel her fire for Gothic mystery make her all the more endearing to me. Catherine is remarkably innocent, and as such she is absolutely delightful in my eyes.Much of the story does fit in with your typical Gothic novel, but the frightening and dismaying things Catherine eventually discovers are of a far from supernatural sort. Ever so gradually, a true monster slowly coalesces from the pages of this remarkable novel. I, like young Catherine, was somewhat overenthusiastic concerning the Gothic qualities of this adventure I feel I shared with her, and the truly despicable thoughts and actions of the book's villain did not immediately strike me as forcefully as they should have; the afterword by Elizabeth Hardwick included in my Signet Classic copy of the book, however, served to make me fully comprehend its import. Greed, selfishness, pride-these are the horrors of Northanger Abbey, and it does deeply hurt a reader of romantic sensitivity to stand idly by, unable to aid and assist a sweet young lady such as Catherine in her time of despair and emotional suffering.Lovers of Gothic horror or literature in general will surely find nothing but delight in the pages of Northanger Abbey. Austen's critique of Gothic literature is quite subdued, and I actually find immense pleasure in the overindulgence the author sometimes employs in her attempts to satirize it. Written by Austen at a tender age (though not published until the year following her death), Northanger Abbey features incredibly human, complex characters full of wit and charm. The hidden motives of seemingly delightful friends is brought to light, teaching young Catherine as well as the reader a painful lesson in real life, yet romance stands at the ready to right the wrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed. I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I used to love Gothic novels. I collected out-of-print Victoria Holt paperbacks, I had stuffed animals named after characters in Charlotte and Emily Bronte novels, but ever since I've read Northanger Abbey, I can't read a Gothic novel with a straight face. Jane Austen does a marvelous job of sending up convoluted scary novels (and melodrama in general) in this book, and creates her most masculine and fascinating hero, Henry Tilney.Don't think that Catherine Morland, the heroine, is just a naive kid. Her naivete is a necessary component of the novel, as it allows her to see the wider world with fresh eyes, provide a foil to the more worldly characters, and ultimately capture the heart of the hero.And then there's Henry...he teases, he teaches, he forgives Catherine's regrettable fancies, knowing that he had a hand in encouraging them. He's witty, he's charming, he's kind of a slob, and he wears his greatcoats so well!As in all her novels, Jane Austen provides a great host of hilarious supporting characters, in particular John and Isabella Thorpe and Mrs. Allen. I defy anyone not to laugh at John Thorpe's nonsensical and contradictory comments. One wonders how many such &quot;rattles&quot; wearied Miss Austen's attention to provide such a character study.Great writing, great story, great characters...come to Northanger Abbey with a sense of humor and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"&quot; &quot;I see what you think of me,&quot; said he gravely--&quot;I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.&quot;&quot;My journal!&quot;&quot;Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings--plain black shoes--appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.&quot;&quot;Indeed I shall say no such thing.&quot;&quot;Shall I tell you what you ought to say?&quot;&quot;If you please.&quot;&quot;I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had a great deal of conversation with him--seems a most extraordinary genius--hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to say.&quot; &quot;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; the first, shortest, most satiric, and least read of Jane Austen's completed novels, is a delightful treasure that will make you quite literally laugh out loud (so beware bringing the book to the airport, as I did, lest you suffer strange glances for your smothered sniggers). Following the journey of the coming-of-age Catherine Morland and her misadventures in Bath to the &quot;horrid&quot; Abbey, Jane Austen presents us with perhaps her funniest sociological book, that proves not only that teens will be teens in any age, but that an overactive imagination is not always a blessing, and that love is often the result of being loved. Readers should keep on the lookout for the commentaries on novels, feminine wiles and homecomings from Austen herself - a technique subdued in her other novels. The cast also includes Jane Austen's wittiest hero, Henry Tilney (a.k.a. &quot;Da Man&quot;), as well as a female foil more duplicitous than &quot;Sense and Sensibility's&quot; Lucy Steele. The Signet Classic edition boasts a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, perhaps better read after the text as a commentary. Best viewed as a comedic parody, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a pleasure to read, whether you are a long-standing member of the JASNA, or just dipping into the boisterous literature of the Regency.Felicitous reading! Yours, &amp;c.,"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"More lighthearted and less polished than Austen's other novels, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is the chronicle of its heroine's adventures in turn-of-the-nineteenth-century British genteel society. Catherine, of marriageable age and reasonably attractive and well bred, goes on holiday to Bath, where she meets the gentlemanly Mr. Tilney and befriends the fickle Isabelle and her callow brother John. Her adventures in Bath and, later, in the home of her new acquaintances comprise the plot of Austen's mocking tale.As usual, Austen is mocking the meeting-and-mating customs of then-contemporary Britain. But she is also mocking the gothic novels of the day: Catherine, influenced by the lowbrow literature she reads, is forever attributing dark motives to her acquaintances and skeletons to their closets. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is unusual among Austen's works in that it attacks not only the society in which its heroine operates, but the heroine herself. Catherine is easily manipulated and slow to learn from her mistakes, and she bumbles into her eventual happy ending completely by accident, none the wiser for her troubles. And Austen makes clear, at the book's opening, that she does not wish to attack the novelists who write the books from which Catherine derives many of her false ideas: the error is Catherine's misapplication of the stories' lessons.Although it was not published until after its author's death, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is clearly a first novel. Its tone is different from the main body of Austen's work, and its quality is lower. While a pleasant read, the book is not particularly compelling and would probably be most enjoyable for Austen aficionados seeking a comprehensive study of her work."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This was the first of Austen's novels to be accepted for publication (although it wasn't actually published for many years after).

Austen wrote this book as a satire & parody of contemporary gothic novels and romances, and much of the humor in it comes from the heroine (a well-meaning, humble, honest, naive, and slightly silly girl) unwisely applying the conventions of gothic novels to real life. I recommend it especially to fans of Austen's wit, as it contains some of her most sharply-pointed writing.Like a lot of Austen's novels, there's an access problem; she presumes you're a member of 18th-century upper crust british society, and thus understand perfectly her references to carriage types, dress fabrics, etc. -- often, looking up precisely what different period terms refer to -- for example, what a \\"curricle\\" and a \\"gig\\" are -- will help explicate the jokes underlying specific passages. For similar reasons, it's often useful to watch a film or TV version of Austen novels before reading them, to help familiarize yourself with the socio-economic environment.Similarly, it'll help when reading this if you've read a lot of contemporary Gothic fiction. The Kindle makes this easy, fortunately -- it may be worthwhile to grab a Kindle version ofThe Mysteries of Udolphofirst (perhaps alsoThe Monk).Still, though, if you like Austen, this is one of her great novels, and you'll enjoy it regardless of whether or not you're familiar with the background she's drawing on. But doing some spadework beforehand will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I approached this book somewhat warily, knowing that Northanger Abbey was to some degree a satirical take on the immense popularity of Gothic romances such as Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, a book I dearly love. Happily, Austen's means of poking fun at Gothic horror literature are far from mean-spirited and, as a matter of fact, can be delightfully humorous indeed. Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is by no means the type of heroine to be found in the giant tomes of Radcliffe and her indulgent imitators, as Austen tells her reading audience directly from the very start. \\"Almost attractive\\" on a good day, this unintellectual tomboy has reached her fifteenth year without inspiring a young man's fancy, nor would she be able to delight him with musical skill or even draw his profile in her secret notebooks if she had. Having encountered no strangers who would prove to be a lord or prince in disguise, her heroic ambitions seem stymied at best until fate steps in and grants her a stay of several weeks in the delightful town of Bath. Making her transition from nave girl to equally nave young lady, Catherine almost immediately falls quite in love with young Henry Tilney, while at the same time she becomes intimate friends with an older young lady named Isabella, whose inconstancy as both friend and intended beloved of Catherine's own brother eventually brings her much pain. To her intense delight, however, Catherine is invited by General Tilney, Henry's father, to spend some few weeks in his home, Northanger Abbey. Her joy at spending such private time in the company of her beloved and new best friend Eleanor Tilney is immense, but equally exciting to her is the chance to spend time in a mysterious former abbey of the sort she has read so much about. Such Gothic romances as Udolpho have been the source of her recent heroic training, and she is wildly desirous and fully expectant of discovering hidden passages, dark secrets, frightening circumstances, and possibly even incalcitrant perfidy in the halls of her beloved's family home. Her overactive imagination runs wild in Northanger Abbey, bringing her a fair share of embarrassment, but the very sweet and tender sensibilities that fuel her fire for Gothic mystery make her all the more endearing to me. Catherine is remarkably innocent, and as such she is absolutely delightful in my eyes.Much of the story does fit in with your typical Gothic novel, but the frightening and dismaying things Catherine eventually discovers are of a far from supernatural sort. Ever so gradually, a true monster slowly coalesces from the pages of this remarkable novel. I, like young Catherine, was somewhat overenthusiastic concerning the Gothic qualities of this adventure I feel I shared with her, and the truly despicable thoughts and actions of the book's villain did not immediately strike me as forcefully as they should have; the afterword by Elizabeth Hardwick included in my Signet Classic copy of the book, however, served to make me fully comprehend its import. Greed, selfishness, pride-these are the horrors of Northanger Abbey, and it does deeply hurt a reader of romantic sensitivity to stand idly by, unable to aid and assist a sweet young lady such as Catherine in her time of despair and emotional suffering.Lovers of Gothic horror or literature in general will surely find nothing but delight in the pages of Northanger Abbey. Austen's critique of Gothic literature is quite subdued, and I actually find immense pleasure in the overindulgence the author sometimes employs in her attempts to satirize it. Written by Austen at a tender age (though not published until the year following her death), Northanger Abbey features incredibly human, complex characters full of wit and charm. The hidden motives of seemingly delightful friends is brought to light, teaching young Catherine as well as the reader a painful lesson in real life, yet romance stands at the ready to right the wrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed. I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is actually one of Austen's first works, she kept it for fifteen years, polishing it. It is her lightest work but it is still very good, we all need something light once in a while.Our heroine is Catherine, she is a rather silly young girl who has read too many gothic romances. &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; in particular has turned her silly head. She seems to see a gothic mystery everywhere she looks. Catherine soon learns that the world is not all melodrama and eventually matures and marries a very sensible man. What keeps Catherine likable is her capacity to learn from her mistakes. She is certainly the least mature of Austen's heroines but she is never boring.This is a marvelous book to start with if you want to get into Jane Austen, it does not have as many characters or subplots as her other works and it is very breezy. I enjoyed it and am now reading Udolpho myself. We'll see what happens. ;-)"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I spent most of the story wishing to dance with the witty Henry Tilney, slap the artful and manipulative Isabella, lose my temper with the deceitful John, and give Catherine Morland a good shake to knock some sense into her.That said, any book that can drag me into the characters' lives as Northanger Abbey did is praiseworthy. It's an easy read once you get the hang of the language.I really enjoyed Austen's tongue-in-cheek lambasting of novelists whose heroines never read novels - &quot;Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ingenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding-joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust.&quot; Her derision for the flights of fancy of the Gothic novelists of the day are readily apparent throughout the novel. Catherine imagines herself in romantic, mysterious situations (found in her favorite novel, Udolpho), as when she first thinks of her upcoming visit to the Abbey: &quot;To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire.&quot; Yet when she arrives she is disappointed in its modernity and normalcy - something that wouldn't be tolerated in a Gothic tale!If the ends of books are like desserts, then the end of Northanger Abbey could be compared to Jell-O rather than Cherries Jubilee, but the readers should focus on the meat and potatoes instead. All in all, an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"While this was one of the last Jane Austen novels published, it was the first one to be written. I read this book before I was familiar with the conventions of the Gothic novel, but this book is a worthy send up of all of those conventions. Even if you are not especially familiar with the works of Anne Radcliffe or Monk Lewis, this novel is worth your time. The opening three pages which describe why Catherine Morland really isn't the heroine type are as funny as anything you'd read today. Other great passages are when Austen defends the reading of fiction in a passionate aside, and when Catherine becomes convinced that General Tilney is keeping his wife locked up in the dungeon of Northanger Abbey.In this book, we have the beginnings of Jane's devastating wit as she tears apart society. We also have the benefit of some witty one liners, flighty characters and hilarious situations. (Of special note is the fact that it would seem that college men have ALWAYS been drinking and swearing type guys... although Austen discretely blanks out the 'dirty' words so as not to offend her readers.)I used to rush home from work to read this book, and was not disappointed in it at all, from beginning to end. This is the best place to start with Austen (well, you could also read her juvenilia if you want... it is more silly than anything, but entertaining nonetheless), and it's definitely a fun read."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen was arguably one of the best writers of her time; however, only she took the bold leap into poking fun at the books of her time. Northanger Abbey brings Catherine, the heroine (on whom, among other things, Austen periodically comments from afar) through the joys and troubles of being an eligible young lady with a probing mind and endearing naivete, acquired from none other than the countless novels she has read. The elegance, and at some points speed, with which Austen plays out and then reconciles her young heroine's difficulties is at the very least extremely amusing. The foolish suspense and embarrassed relief which center around the Abbey are no less entertaining when one considers this book against darker novels where the papers in locked drawers have slightly more bearing. Catherine's friend Isabella, her vain (and in-vain) suitor John, and Mr. and Miss Tilney are brilliant foils for her character's development. Overall, I think this book rates as one of the true gems of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is perhaps the most childish (I mean that in a nice way) of Jane Austen's books. It's good for even teens my age to read and enjoy because it's shorter, with a more obvious side of humor to it than the other novels. (I have never minded reading classics; my friends think I'm weird but...I don't care!) Jane Austen seems to be laughing up her sleeve at her own story and its characters. It's a satire of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels and the stereotype heroes of the age and she often refers to Catherine as \`a heroine' and compares her plights to those of other heroines. It's really very funny and some of the situations Kate finds herself in are highly entertaining.Gone is the restraint and almost painfully polite atmosphere. This is really the only Austen book where you don't feel that suffocating blanket of manners and what's proper all around you. The heroine speaks pretty plainly, and the hero openly teases both her and his sister (and is very cute ^-^). The ending is pretty shocking and totally unexpected. My mom is almost psychic when it comes to guessing plots and their outcomes but even she didn't know what was coming when she read this book.This is also the only Austen book (besides Pride and Prejudice) that got me to laugh out loud. It has a priceless section about how most heroines would never deign to touch a novel; if they picked one up by accident they would be sure to put it back down in disgust. However, Catherine is more than ready to read novels with her friend Isabella; books like The Mysteries of Udolpho, though she wouldn't like to admit it. When the hero-much to her dismay-finds out, he entirely approves. They have the cutest romance, and I really like the nave Catherine as the heroine.The only thing about the book I didn't like was the soppy friendship between Catherine and Isabella. When Catherine is slightly late meeting her friend, Isabella says this sickeningly sweet phrase to her, \\"Where have you been, darling? I have been waiting for you this past hour!\\" (Not an exact quotation, but something along those lines) I much prefer Henry's sister as her friend. There is actually a really god contrast between the beautiful Isabella and the quiet shy sister who turns out to be the better and more deserving friend. And Catherine is such an imaginative heroine, who reminds a bit of Anne of Green Gables with her flights of fancy that end hilariously!I really liked this book and will probably read it again soon along with Emma and Pride and Prejudice. I'd like to see the movie also. Great book, and a great place to start reading Austen's novels. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"So much of the discussion of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; centers on the Gothic send-ups of the second half of the novel, but the primary focus of this wonderful novel is the absolute skewering of the social mores and behaviors of the era. As Catherine, Isabel Thorpe, and the other girls their age frantically pursue wealth and status in the form of a fair-faced husband, Austen provides us with a splendid portrayal of a society. General Tilney's treatment of Catherine is only the most obvious of Austen's criticism's of the &quot;Bath society,&quot; for several other characters also behave selfishly.Read &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; for several reasons. First, it is an entertaining novel--and that alone should give encouragement to a prospective reader! Second, it is a pointed description of a society based only on class and wealth, in which one's happiness depends upon securing &quot;a fortune.&quot; Finally, it is an accessible introduction to Austen's works and may encourage you to read more.Enjoy journeying with Catherine Morland from her small town home to Bath and thence to Northanger Abbey and home again!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Not only does Austen create a gothic environment to haunt the readers and the characters, but she places the character ahead of the overall story. Not the story is bad, but readers tend to read Austen's work for her characters and their heartbreaking fates. This is truely a masterpiece featuring classic decision making from the main protagonist and an incredible and tragic solution that calms the storm of the story."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"First time reading Jane Austen....seen plenty of Jane Austen inspired movies and enjoyed them all but definitely prefer reading the books. Austen did not disappoint...this is a good read and keeps you routing for Catherine while guessing what will happen next."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Come to Bath for the season, 17-year-old Catherine discovers friends who will educate her socially and falls in with the Tilney siblings, who live in an intriguing Gothic abbey. To call Northanger Abbey a Gothic satire (as I was introduced to it) is to overlook over half the book, which concerns itself with the social tableau of Bath and Catherine's evolving role and relationships within; this section draws on predecessors such as Frances Burney, whose work--while not unknown--is not so popular today as Radcliffe's Gothic novels which inspire much else of the book. As such, Northanger Abbey can feel like two books uneasily combined into one; furthermore, it's exceedingly self-aware, which is both its joy and damnation. The book has a shifting focus, its satire is often heavy-handed, it demands self- and genre-awareness from the reader (yet its brevity and tone make it something of a pleasure read), but at its best it distills its genres critically and with great love. Northanger Abbey mocks the expectations of a heroine and the limitation of its own, yet creates an enduring and convincingly adolescent figure in Catherine; its social interactions can be frankly frustrating, but the dialog shines; it revels in the tritest of Gothic clich&eacute;s, then mocks the reader who over-indulges in them, yet embraces the emotional sensitivity that underlies the impulse. To my surprise, this is the most success I've had with Austen. It's too much of a niche taste, and begs too much background knowledge, for me to recommend it outright. But in the end, the best satires require love: love enough to know, and engage, and represent the beloved; to make something of it which is incisive but meaningful. Northanger Abbey has that, and won my love in return."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Catherine Morland succesfully captures the image of a bookish and curious teenager. Although sometimes it was embarassing seeing her faults so amplified...sometimes it was funny.The story is shorter the Austen's other works *happy sigh* and the format of writing it like an adventure with a \\"heroine\\" was entertaining because it was the story of everyday life.So many people have summarized the novel...I just want to add that it was surprisingly relatable considering it was written 200+ yrs ago. An example of this is her parents response to what happens.Her mother's lectures made me chuckle and I was wowed when her mum went to get the essay that would help Catherine deal with her moodiness. Of course it takes a while because of domestic distractions.It was an okay read.

(At least, that's what I got from the writing.) Northanger Abbey is apparently the most cheerful and lighthearted of her novels, dealing with Catherine Morland, a young naive lady, who goes to Bath, and experiences fashionable society for the first time. She meets many new friends: Isabella, who shows her Gothic romances, and Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father's house, Northanger Abbey. \\"There, influenced by novels of horror and intrigue, Catherine comes to imagine terrible crimes committed by General Tilney, risking the loss of Henry's affection, and has to learn the difference between fiction and reality, false friends and true. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, Northanger Abbey is the most youthful and optimistic of Jane Austen's works.\\" (Penguin Books.) I definitely enjoyed the light tone and writing of Austen, but (as I said early), I can definitely imagine how some people would not like it all. She wrote even before Charles Dickens, and yet her style is much less overwritten, with not many adjectives (Dickens is stuffed with them.) Austen's style is a sort gossipy tone; the young ladies talking among themselves about various happenings. Henry Tilney was a really great character, really likable. I liked the book overall a lot; it was quite a contrast from other literature from around that time, is definitely a readable classic for most people.

Some have said that her personality is closest to the Austen herself. Scholars have pointed out similarities which I won't bore you with.It's the shortest of all the finished six Austen novels and as a Janeite (a lover of Austen), I advise my friends (the ones that ask) should they want to read Austen, they should start with Northanger Abbey.It's quick and satirical and you'll love Catherine Morland and Henry Tilney, young romantics. And since it's short, you'll get acclimate yourself with Jane's voice and by the end will be ready to take on more.i won't got into the story, but basically, Catherine has a great imagination which gets her into a bit of trouble; she has a talkative day friend; but Catherine's goodness is clear and shines through."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Old English novels, especially by Bronte sisters, I find fascinating.

Reading her on the Kindle is a great thing to sooth the soul. I have all the books available for the Kindle from her."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This early Jane Austen novel is a satire among other things of the reading tastes of the Romantic Period's young, sending up their near addiction to improbable Gothic \\"horror\\" stories. Despite being grounded in such literary particulars, the novel remains an awfully good read. Contemporary college students in my experience think overwhelmingly that Austen is not just writing about Mrs. Radcliffe et al, but has much to tell them about life and taking one another seriously rather than playing at \\"relationships.\\" Detailing the entrance of her naive, countryside heroine (Catherine) into the splendors and miseries of adulthood, Austen is here fully brimming over with her unmistakable satiric wit, charm, and astonishing worldly wisdom. Catherine, for instance, from the outset has already confounded life and art, so she is disappointed, to our delight, that on her first journey to Bath and grown-up experience, there's \\"not one lucky overturn of the carriage to introduce her to the hero.\\" Austen's women -whether naive (Catherine) or vain and coquettish ( fashion-hungry Mrs. Allen and men-with-money-hungry Isabella Thorpe)- are all well drawn, and equally so are her men, especially the boorish John Thorpe, an early example of the \\"it's all about me\\" guy, and the triumphantly witty, hard-headed, yet kind Henry Tilney. Astonishingly, Austen concluded very early as a novelist that it's only the few genuine individuals in life who follow a civilized code of manners, whereas most other people are in fact mere conformists devoted to the fashionable ways of the world, pursuing vulgar self-interest or greed, while thinking themselves smart for doing so.A few years back, adaptations of Austen for the screen were all the rage. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" had earlier been the subject of an inferior TV adaptation, set in the proper time period but too heavy on the Gothic \\"horror\\" element and largely witless. So far as I know it has never been made into a film. Given the continuing fondness of the young for horror novels (Stephen King's, say) and now scary movies, I'd argue \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a natural for an updated version (like \\"Clueless\\" was of \\"Emma\\") set perhaps among the young who leave home for the first time to attend college. They too might initially expect life to resemble to some degree what they've encountered in their romances, \\"horror\\" novels and slasher films, only to be wittily disabused, but then to discover in fact the real ways life always and everywhere is actually \\"horrid,\\" that is, owing to the timeless prevalence of vanity, self-absorption, and greed."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"In NORTHANGER ABBEY, Jane Austen satirizes what for her and her late 18th century readers was the Gothic novel. Even before Ann Radcliffe published the enormously popular MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO in 1794, the novel of sentiment was all the rage. In such stories the heroine was likely to cry, swoon, and moan at the drop of a hat. Radcliffe in her book added the other Gothic ingredients of fear, ghosts, haunted houses, and other paranormal phenomena. Austen looked down on writers who had their heroines engage in such unseemly behavior even though she was later to treat seriously the same trait of sensibility in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.The heroine of NORTHANGER ABBEY is Catherine Morland, who seems unlike what will later prove to be a typical Austen protagonist. Catherine at the start of the book is much more closely allied to the \\"sense\\" half of the push-pull sense and sensibility dichotomy of all her works. She is the daughter of a prosperous clergyman who travels to a resort named Bath, where she meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney. There are the usual romantic plot complications of an Austen novel which normally allow the heroine to be attracted by her male counterpart and encounter suitable obstacles, all of which are neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which in turn leads to a higher level of moral vision. In this case, Austen has great fun with Catherine by first showing her as full of sense, then later shifting gears by morphing her into a standard \\"sensible\\" female of the Gothic genre, finally whirling Catherine back to a position of reason and logic. It takes half of the book before Austen gets to the Gothic satire for which it is well-known. When Catherine arrives at Northanger Abbey, she inexplicably is affected by the conventional Gothic trappings of the place. Where the earlier Catherine would see an occurrence that might have seemed spooky to other more stereotyped Gothic heroines but not so to her, the newer Catherine now could see that same eerie event and be filled with unfounded terror. It is only now that Austen makes clear the target of her barbed satire. She was plainly disgusted with other writers who purposefully filled the empty heads of their heroines with Gothic terror, but when she did the same, it was excusable since satire, not stereotype, was her aim. Later, Catherine's grasp of sense returns as she is able to exonerate in her own mind General Tilney from the suspected charge of the murder of his wife. By the end of the novel, the reader has been introduced to the theme of sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason. In Catherine Morland, and later for nearly of all of Austen's female protagonists, Austen suggests that in having to choose between the two extremes, one might seek a middle ground so that each one can complement, rather than supplement the other. There are simply too many examples of extremes who end badly in Austen's works for one to ignore her implied advice."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing. It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age. I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the characters are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader. It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged). The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period. Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book. Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"If you have not read Jane Austen before, don't start with this book! (Start with perhaps Pride and Prejudice or Emma.)Northanger Abbey was her earliest written novel, but it did not get published until after she died. This book is meant to be a parody. She is making fun of some of other gothic books that were in circulation at that time. The main character gets a little too obsessed with gothic novel reading, and imagines a sinister plot in the abbey becasue her imagination is out of control.This book is much more juvenille than Austen's other books. I felt like I was reading something for teenagers. (Austen's other books have more depth and maturity to them.)However, it was an enjoyable, easy read... and as an Austen fan, I wanted to read Austen's earliest work."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This early Austen novel about a society girl's coming of age reads easily with its considerable dialogue, despite the presence of extensive historical vocabulary. Definitely of greater interest to girls than boys NORTHANGER ABBEY introduces readers to 17-year old Catherine Morland, a nave but morally-honest well-bred young lady. Invited to the fashionable watering hole of Bath by the Allens--kind neighbors serving as hosts and chaperones, Catherine is delighted at this opportunity to seek Adventure away from her calm country home.Volume I presents Bath in high season where Catherine is formally introduced to and socializes with two families: the Thorpes and the Tilneys, who reveal stark social contrasts among the upper class. Mr. John Thorpe, a friend of her brother's, quickly attaches himself to Catherine, but his vanity, arrogance and deceit soon displease and eventually disgust her. His sister, Isabella, however, proves a dear and immediate friend,at least during most of Catherine's sojourn in Bath. Soon after she meets the distinguished Tilney family: a stern General, a son who is a Captain, a sweet and modest sister, Eleanor, and the cadet son, Henry. Vol. I concludes with Catherine receiving permission from her parents and the Allens to spend several weeks at the Tilney homestead, a former Abbey.Eager to explore a real edifice which might have been the setting for a Gothic novel, Catherine is thrilled at this extended invitation. By this time she is very fond of Henry and hopes privately that romance will bloom in the quiet, dignified setting. Unfortunately she expects the worst horrors as a result of her dedicated reading of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, forwhere no mystery exits, Catherine is determined to discover one. Volume Two describes her gracious reception at Northanger, but she soon feels certain to have stumbled upon a secret family shame or even horror. Her imagination may be running away with her, but the General's odd behavior seems to confirm her growing suspicious of dark deeds surrounding the death of the late Mrs. Tileny.Suddenly, without any explanation, the domineering General orders Catherine thrown out of his home-defying all the rules of hospitality and decency. Henry is not present to protest, so Catherine is dispatched alone--in ignominy and secret tears--back to her unsuspecting family 70 miles away. This tale chronicles the most turbulent year in Catherine's young life, but how much is to be blamed on her excessive devotion to Gothic novels? Or is there a truly sinister plot undermining the hopes of the young lovers? JA uses her characters as mouthpieces to express her decided opinions on the role of fiction, literature and history. This is Austen-lite, with hints of her future work, where her heroines prove better judges of their acquaintances ans their own hearts."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I've always appreciated the wit of Jane Austen. Understated and sly, she manages to portray the inner wit and wisdom of early 18th century upper-class English women quite well. The choice is never to marry or not. The choice is always whom to marry and why.Unlike her other works, Northanger Abbey is a satire on the gothic \\"horror\\" novel so prevalent at the time. Full of suspenseful build-ups and hysterical interruptions, the story revolves around Catherine Morland, as unlikely a heroine as ever graced the pages. Amid the story, Ms. Austen interrupts with witty attacks on Mrs. Radcliffe and other gothic novelists.As always, Austen's humor is stylish and full of truths. She was perhaps a much happier forerunner to Dorothy Parker, in that she cut right through the sheen and told it like it was, as she knew it.I'd recommend Northanger Abbey to anyone who enjoys Austen's writings, gothic novels, or sly humor."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"When I was a kid, I loved to watch Wishbone, the terrier that used Classic Literature as a kind to life.

The style is promising but stilted, and characters and plots aren't really finely tuned. Catherine Morland is promising enough but the young girl who is prudent and sensible seems to lose all sense of balance when she enters an abbey, imagining the most ridiculous and silly gothic nonsense. A bit of fluff and silliness--if Austen wanted to send up the gothic novel she manages to do so for only half dozen chapters and not to any real purpose.There is the familiar secondary love story with a character who proves unworthy but harmless as our heroine caroms toward her inevitable 'happily ever after'. Like a bolt from the blue Eleanor, sister of Henry, Catherine's beau, suddenly is affianced and raised to the nobility. In 2 paragraphs. Talk about wrapping up loose ends too quickly! Sadly missing too are those ridiculous minor characters--Mrs. Bennett, Lady Catherine deBourgh, etc. It's not bad, but if it were written by anybody other than Austen I wonder how many of us would bother? Very few I think.Anyone other than Austen would have gotten two stars. Even genius has to be allowed a learning curve."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Though I have read most of Austen's novels some of them numerous times, I have been saving this one for just the right time when I felt like I could appreciate it the most. I finally decided I needed a good Austen fix and was ready to enjoy it. I knew that it is considered by most critics to be Jane Austen's most satirical novel so I was very excited to dive into this book and see for myself. I was not disappointed, I loved our heroine Catherine Morland, I thought she had just the right amount of girlish charm mixed in with some moments of good sense. I found myself routing for her throughout the book. I also have to say that Henry Tilney found his way right into my heart from almost the first meeting, especially when he exclaims, \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid\\", a opinion I agree with entirely."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Begun in 1798 and finished in 1803, Northanger was one if the first novels Austen completed, as well as her first sale, though it did not appear in print until after her death. She had already written Lady Susan and had started both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice, however.The novel follows 17-year-old Ann Radcliffe enthusiast Catherine Morland on a visit to Bath. Under the guardianship of complacent childless family friends, Catherine visits the pump room and attends public balls, making new acquaintances. She quickly meets and befriends the lovely but manipulative Isabella Thorpe, and it emerges that the two girls older brothers know each other at Oxford. When the young men pay a visit to Bath a dual brother-sister match seems eminent, or at last intended. Catherine, however, dislikes Mr Thorpe and remains blissfully unaware of his blundering attempts at courtship. She's much too interested in Mr. Henry Tilney, a clever and handsome young clergyman. Just Catherine's visit draws to close, she is invited by Henry's sister to visit the Tilney family at their home, (you guessed it) Northanger Abbey.Northanger is perhaps the least sympathetic of all Jane Austen's satires. Though all have their comedies, ironies and follies, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, also have the benefit of compelling heroine and at least one honest romance.Catherine, on the other hand, is, in many ways, a foil--a nice girl, honest and not too bright, but with a healthy imagination where melodrama is concerned. She is Harriet Smith, with a better family and a stronger character. Her romance with Henry Tilney also lacks the weight of the relationships in Austen's other novels--it's funny and frequently charming, but, like Catherine herself, not too deep.The real pleasure of the book comes from Austen's language, her frequent tangential diatribes on the nature and import of novels, and her many hilarious digs at Ann Radcliffe--who as far as Austen is concerned, seems to have been the Stephenie Meyer of her day (only pro-woman, a better writer, and a different kind of crazy)."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Before you read this free version of Northager Abbey I'd recommend watchingMasterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey. I can almost guarantee you will prefer the story that plays out in the movie. Still it is intriguing to compare the movie to the book. In the movie John Thorpe is much more likeable although annoying at times. In the book he is much more rude and coarse. I instantly disliked him for being rude to his mother and for treating his horse badly. What surprised me is how little we learn about Henry. He is fairly uninteresting and not very romantic. To compare him to say Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice would never do. Isabella is much more shrill in the book and is much more naughty in the movie. Catherine Morland is really the most developed character in the book although Jane Austen doesn't do a good job of explaining why she is so attracted to Henry. What amused me most was how Jane Austen talked directly to the reader about the value of novels. It was as if she was preaching to the choir. This Kindle version is nearly perfect - only one spelling error!~ The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JML7YC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis initially funny, then sad, then silly novel begins in one tone: Catherine is a silly girl who reads too many Gothic novels and and takes her ideas of life from them. As the fourth of ten children, she is overjoyed when a childless couple invite her to accompany them for a six-week stay at a wpa. There she makes several friends in succession, in a way such hat she comes to realize that real life doesn't copy Gothic romances quite as much as she thought. When she is invited for a three-week, then indefinite, stay at the Tilney household of Northanger Abbey, her reading causes her to leap to unwarranted conclusions from which she is yanked by the uncompromising sensibility of Henry Tilney.As she proceeds toward mental normality, away from the constant influence of the novels, she is totally startled when the General, Henry's father, who had appeared to be highly in favor of a marriage between Catherine and Henry, orders her sent home instantly with his strong disapproval. He is not even gutsy enough to tell her himself, but sends her friend, his daughter Eleanor, to tell her. It is due only to Eleanor's prudence that Catherine even has the money with which to get home by stagecoach.Still stunned, she is pulled out of the depths of depression by a visit from Henry, who tells her why his father had behaved so badly and assures her that he still wants to marry her. Her parents agree to the marriage only on condition that the general also agree.Up until now, the novel has worked very well. But what should be probably a quarter of the book is jammed into a couple of chapters of hasty telling, with no showing at all. One has the feeling that the author was tired of the book. Considering that it was her first novel and that she wrote it out in longhand, I suspect that was the case. All the authors I know, including my husband and I, are tired of the book by that point. But with a computer, it is a lot easier to go on and finish the book correctly than it was in the days of quill pens and inkwells--especially since Austen had no room of her own and had to keep her manuscript in what we would now call the living room, simply covering it when visitors arrived.This is a highly uneven book. That has led to a problem with deconstructionists finding in it all kinds of things that, for the most part, are present in neither the text nor the subtext nor even the author's context. Such fiddling around is not necessary. The faults in the text are quite obvious and do not need to be sought after with Satan's magnifying glass."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"So I thought that Pride and Prejudice was my favorite Jane Austen book. I was incredibly mistaken after reading Northanger Abbey. The story is told by Jane Austen herself.It is as if she was in the room with you reading it out loud. It is the only one of its kind. It really was a shock to know that this book was published so long after it was written and was one of the first novels she completed. As I found, this book was hardly re drafted, not like the other stories I believe. It is the closest we could ever get to Austen herself, the first instinctive writings we could ever read. Raw and powerful. When it was first published long ago it was some years later when it was written, Austen being the clever lady that she was made the story timeless,, so to speak as timeless goes .. that a women like me in the year 2010 could find enjoyment and humor in a book published so long ago. Now that speaks volumes..."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen's first completed novel is lighter and more humorous in tone than her subsequent work. It is however, as beautifully written as that later work - there was, as always with Austen, a lot of rewriting before publication, which in this case was posthumous - and it is in no sense an inferior effort.All her novels have a sly, subversive wit, but Northanger Abbey is the one in which she employs her humor more or less throughout, although darker elements emerge as the story develops.It is basically a satire on the Gothic novel, a genre still familiar to us through movies, and makes particular reference to The Mysteries of Udolpho. You don't need to have read that to appreciate the humor; you just need to have some idea of what a Gothic story is, with its gloomy castles, secret chambers and dastardly deeds. In fact, in the episodes that take place in the abbey, the author shows herself very capable of building mystery and tension. She could have written a splendid Gothic horror.Austen's extraordinary insight into human nature is already evident here. In chapter 5 of this book - which has more author intervention than any of her others - she presents a defense or justification of the novel as a literary form, in which she says, \\"...the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties...are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language\\". That is certainly true of Austen's own novels.The Signet Classics edition has an introduction by Margaret Drabble which is more an excuse for Drabble to express some of her own prejudices. You certainly shouldn't read it before the novel, because it contains spoilers. The Afterword by Stephanie Laurens is much better and is worth reading. There are no end notes or footnotes to explain the many references and archaisms in the novel. I suspect there are other editions with better editorial content.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I am a Jane Austin fan so I am reading all her books this year I was surprised at how different Northanger is. But i absolutely loved it. Catherine is a great heroine the story is magical. I found it a lot easier of a read. Sometimes the old english writing of the Jane Austin books makes me have to concentrate harder, but this was written in a style easier to read. It's a page turner. You won't want to put it down. For those who love Jane Austin and love her take on the gothic novels of her time enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"It's typical for the heroine in an Austen novel to have a pure biblical name and the virtues as delicate as a dove but for this Jane Austen masterpiece, the story is far from that. Intertwined with the themes of parody and the elements of foreshadowing and metaphoric language, Northanger Abbey distinguishes itself far from the expected in a Jane Austen Novel.The story starts out with dear Catherine, who at the age of seventeen is showing signs of the early peaks of beauty. Coming from a traditional family of ten children, Catherine is first described as very plain and subjected into playing Cricket and Baseball rather than with dolls. She is then introduced to a world in Bath, where society molds her years of adolescence and changes her into becoming a respectable young lady.What is really impressive in this work by Austen is that Catherine is not the typical \\"Damsel in Distress\\". Rather than being a damsel just waiting for the world to rescue her, she is distressed with the idea of being rescued and finds refuge in reading gothic novels. Jane Austen cleverly weaves in allusions of period gothic novels such as The Monk. As Catherine mentioned the books, Austen slyly put in hidden parodies and critiques of the works through the ridiculous images that Catherine imagines after indulging herself. The villains, the Thorpes, gave great humor in their dialogue as well as kept me captivated throughout the book as a whole. They were the epitome of gold diggers and what really amused me was the fact that Mr. John Thorpe played the role so perfectly that he could be representation of the modern day nut-brain in our society.The best part of the novel, in my opinion was Mr. Henry Tilney. Mr. Tilney, son of General Tilney, the hero of the story is by far in par with legendary Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Darcy. What puts him apart from the typical Jane Austen man is that Mr. Tilney has a personality that speaks volumes. He is full of wit and charisma that the slang word of \\"swag\\" wouldn't be enough to describe his aura. Early in the novel, when Catherine first arrives in Bath, he captivates her with his good looks and charming ways. Although Jane Austen is known for deceiving the audience with her men, Mr. Tilney is no fake, he is really charming. For the girls, like myself, who enjoy reading of distinguished English men with old school manners; Northanger Abbey is a seller.I could read this novel over and over, my only critique is that some of the characters such as Catherine's parents and Mr. Tilney's family could have had further characterization. It seemed as though at some points in the novel, those characters lacked growth. Other than that, it is now a favorite book of mine. I must say, because of Ms. Austen's lioness ways and feisty writing style, it can be concluded that once again the reader has entered into the lion's den."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Read when in highschool.

If you are a die hard Austen fan I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey was a good novel to read. It's not too long or short. It is very funny. Catherine, the main character, in the first is described fabulously as what you could call in these days as a ruff and tumble girl. However, Northanger Abbey's ending is disapointing. Nothing really is solved (opposite to other Austen novels)Catherine's marriage just brings in more upcoming problems. So the ending is like a cliff hanger. Some of it is rather spooky like when they actaully get to Northanger Abbey. But, if you expect this to be a horror novel; it is definetely not. Some parts maybe might be called scary, but its not a scary book as a whole. It may be a bit creepy in some parts but mostly not. Moreover, I liked this book."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Many of the references Austen made in Northanger Abbey were meant to be satirical towards the gothic writing style prevalent in her time. Certain elements of wordplay in her characters' dialogue will also sound dated to a modern reader. For example, Catherine describes a popular gothic novel as being &quot;Horrible&quot;, which can be taken as &quot;Awful&quot; or that the book was scary, which is a way the word was used in the author's time.Having said this, the book is slow, and is not as easy and interesting to read as her other novels, which can be explained by saying that this is her first attempt, and improvement was inevitable. The characters were not well-developed; I didn't understand the love-interest and I didn't believe that these two people were suited for each other. Again, she improved later.If you choose to read this book, try to get an edition with notes on the text.It will help a great deal in clarifying that which is now a centuries-old inside joke."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Got the same book from Feedbooks for the same price, free.

The movie is disapionting due to liberties taken. This book is darker than other Jane Austen classics, but still worth a look. Austen gives the romance that I always crave with a mysterious edge that is new, but understanding due to what was popular at the time. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going. The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband. The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt, a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance. It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting. The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.While not as charming as Austin's other books, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is enjoyable for all it quirks. The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I now want to explain myself: Jane Austen is the world's greatest author and everything she writes is wonderful. I just think her other books deserve 10 or more stars. NORTHANGER ABBEY compared to most books is just fabulous. I read this book every few years and am amazed at how much more I dislike General Tilney. Maybe I am imagining how angry I would be if he did to my daughter what he does to Catherine. But I did enjoy reading about the terrible Thorpe siblings. They are deliciously atrocious! Catherine Moreland, the heroine of this delightful novel is a seventeen year old who has the marvelous good luck of accompanying a wealthy couple to Bath. The people she meets in Bath all shape the next year of her life. And, as in all of Austen's books, there are villains; but, as usual, the girl always gets her guy (or visa-versa) in the end! This is why I love Austen!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"It isn't a wonderful book, it isn't a great book, but it's a pretty good book and a nice read.Catherine Morland is a great character, and the plot is light hearted and fun. Some of the scenes are really funny, and it's a good light read.On the other hand, the whole thing has had an air of &quot;rich people without problems amusing themselves&quot;, which is annoying, and parts of the book are dry. If you want a good book to waste away an afternoon, choose this. If you want a great classic, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The voices on the book are hard on the hear speaking with no feeling or expression. Are there other voices you can chose from.Shona"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a classic, but is able to be read with an ease usually associated with light, modern novels. It must be remembered that Northanger Abbey is a parody which can be more difficult that it sounds. Reading Northanger Abbey from a modern viewpoint and taking the action and dialogue seriously can quickly annoy the reader.Catherine isn't very worldly and has learned of the world through the books she has read. When she goes on a trip with her neighbors, she meets Tilney and falls in love instantly. Much goes on in the love lives of all of the younger people in the books, but most obvious is Catherine's utter innocent and naivety. More often than not, her doe-eyed charm is grating rather than endearing.Northanger Abbey is best when the characters discuss novels and reading. A lot of debate is put forth as to the worth of fiction and this discussion will strike a chord with most book lovers. Looking at it in a more specific light, this book delves a lot into the concept of the Gothic novel and readers may find themselves completely lost if they have no prior knowledge on the subject. The bulk of the humor stemming the parody aspect of the book is a take on this Gothic theme, so those who don't know the basics will miss this as well.The romance in Northanger Abbey can't be taken seriously, because taken at face value the love story is unconvincing, bordering on ridiculous. While Northanger Abbey feels like a casual read, a lot has to be brought to the novel in order to fully appreciate and enjoy it. While Northanger Abbey provides decent entertainment, those looking for a good Austen novel would fair better with Emma or Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"As with most of Austen's books, the plot is simple because the drama is within the people and their relationships. Catherine Morland is a sheltered girl who lived with her family in the country and never had nay friends or suitors. When a friend of her parents decides to take Catherine to live in the city, her whole life changes. She immediately befriends Isabella Thorpe, a deceitful and self-centered girl. Isabella's brother, John, attempts to court Catherine but she remains unswayed for her interests lay with Henry Tilney. As the story continues, Isabella becomes more demanding and almost tries to force Catherine to be with John. Eventually, Catherine finds her voice and refuses John's advancements. Yet, it takes Catherine almost the entire novel to completely come into her own. The title comes from the abbey that Henry Tilney's family owns. Catherine, who spent the majority of her youth reading Gothic novels, is completely enthralled with the abbey so when she is finally invited she just about bursts at the thought of hidden chambers and locked away skeletons. However, what she finds it nothing like what she had planned and when her imagination runs away with itself her relationship with Henry is put at risk.I really enjoyed this novel much more than I thought I would. I found other works by Austen to be boring, dated, and bombastic. Yet, Northanger Abbey is charming and has a message that still rings true today: don't allow yourself to be naive or prone to deceit because people will take advantage of you. In addition, I liked that the romance in the novel took a backseat to Catherine's development. Though it felt sluggish at times, I was never disinterested. I also loved Austen's defense of novels and the Gothic elements in this book."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a fun book by Jane Austen.

Her mother was an ordinary woman who sometimes had too much to do, while her father was a clergyman. Just for the season, Catherine was invited by Mr. and Mrs. Allen to come with them to a town called Bath. At first, Mrs. Allen and Catherine are disappointed by the lack of acquaintances, even though they walk the town all day and go to the upper room and the lower rooms. Mrs. Allen had a sense for fashion and always had a beautiful dress on. Soon enough Catherine was introduced to Henry Tilney. However, as she started to develop a crush on him and looked forward to their meetings, he did not come around for a while. By a sudden twist of fate, she meets the Thorpe's. A family whom her brother knows because he had befriended their son and stayed with them for a summer .She quickly became friends with the eldest daughter, Isabella Thorpe. She had a grace and way about her that Catherine admired very much. She is the one who encourages Catherine's interest in romantic fantasies and gothic reading. Isabella also starts a love triangle between herself and James Morland, Catherine, John and Henry. For the first half it is nothing but parties and friendship. It is not until the second half of the book that Catherine is invited to the Tilney's house in Northanger Abbey, where she gets caught up in her own imagination and believes that in that house there has been a murder and the murderer still lives there. Just like in the gothic novels she had been reading. Unfortunately, she was kicked out by General Tilney himself later on.In the end, the book was about a girl who was nave, awkward and shy yet she had kindness in her heart and sometimes got lost in her own world sometimes seeing things that were not true. With all the books she read and believed in, her imagination would tend to catch up to her.Overall, this book was a three star because even though the story was a little plane at the beginning, it improved later on. It was a good read if you are into a corky story or like the old books written in the late eighteen hundreds or beginning nineteen hundreds. I would not however, recommend it to anyone seeking adventure.By: Christina Menendez"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"As a great Jane Austen fan, who has read and re-read favorite like Pride and Prejudice as well as Emma(!!!)

In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a gem. Jane Austen (1775-1817)has written a charmiing little novel about a charming little lady named Catherine Moreland. Catherine is 15 as the novel begins in Wiltshire. She and the hilariously stupid Mrs. Allen go on a six week trip to nearby Bath to take the waters. Catherine meets the fashionable and fast Isabella Thorpe. Catherine dances with the clergyman Henry Tilney at a ball becoming infatuated with the clever young man. Henry and Catherine share a love for the Romantic Gothic novels of such authors as Ann Radcliff and Fanny Burney. Complications ensue but in the end the couple are wed.The first half of the novel deals with doings in Bath; the second half is a trip taken by Catherine to the Tilney estate Northanger Abbey. Catherine thinks the house may contain a ghost as she is influenced in her thinking by a vivid imagination fueled by her sensational Gothic reading.Minor characters are of interest: Captain Frederick Tilney the ladies man brother of Henry; old General Tilney the gruff father of Fred and Henry; Catherine's parents and Eleanor Tilney the kind and lovely sister of the two Tilney boys with whom Catherine forms a solid friendship.The book includes a spirited defense of the art of novel writing by Miss Austen. It is a light and commonplace tale of young love told with the wit and wisdom of one of England's greatest authors.

I found it really easy to relate with how she was feeling throughout the entire book and could just picture her talking to me.John Thorpe reminded me of high school and his character added to the adolescent/innocence of the overall book.My favorite part of the book is Catherine's trip to, and arrival of, Northanger Abbey. Henry's tale was very graphic and Catherine's sleepless night and awakening morning made me laugh.Any Jane Austen fan would love this book and those that found Pride and Prejudice too difficult/boring/etc., this book might make them a fan."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The satire isn't as harsh, and the humor isn't as brilliant as you will find in Austen's major works, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this little book.It's a charming and funny short novel that spoofs gothic fiction and romantic sentiment in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although the novel is full of subtle references to Jane Austen's favorite (and least favorite) books, you don't need to know anything about them to enjoy the story. Think of it as a teen comedy with moments of slapstick, lots of offbeat humor, and social embarassment galore, and you will be right in the spirit of Northanger Abbey. Some of the customs and vocabulary in the book are out of date, of course. But most of it will be easy to understand even without footnotes, (although it's nice to have them handy if you need them). Austen's wonderful talent for dialogue still makes this little novel a treat to read. I have re-read Northanger Abbey every year since I was a teenager myself, and I still smile all the way through it!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years. I assumed that if she couldn't get it published that it probably wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book. It is meant to be a satirical work mocking the Gothic romance popular during Jane Austin's lifetime. In such romances, there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such, and in this book the main character, Catherine, keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up, but they never really had. Towards the end, instead of some fantastic mythical monster, a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain Catherine experiences: pride in rank. The father of Henry Tilney, whom Catherine has fallen in love with, refuses to allow them to be married because Catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does. Austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both Henry's father and through her friend Isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself, leading Catherine to much pain.This is nowhere near as good as some of Miss Austin's other works, but it is good nontheless, and a fun read. It's much better if you understand what Gothic romance novels were like, since this is a satire on those novels.Overall grade: B+"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor, Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her. And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general.Jane Austen has been a favorite of mine since I was very young, but it was not until this past weekend that I happened upon NORTHANGER ABBEY while browsing through the bookstore, and decided to purchase it. I will admit that, hands down, this has become one of my favorite Austen books. Catherine is an enchanting character, whose innocence, and naivete make her charming from beginning to end; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers. Catherine's interactions with Isabella Thorpe, and the rest of the Thorpe family are intrepid, and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while the charming Henry Tilney - like Mr. Darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman, and our young heroine. A wonderful, satirical piece of fiction, that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an Austen fan.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This was a wonderful read. This was a realistic, though satirical, work about a young girl who goes to Bath and is at first utterly out of place, and then finds her niche. She makes some terrible friends at first because of her gullibility and innocence, but then falls in with some nicer people who appreciate her honesty and this same innocence. Her friendships develop in realistic ways, first with Isabella, which quickly and unreasonably flares up. Her friendship with Henry's sister begins more slowly but as a result is that much more lasting. Henry is a very likable and witty character; the introduction to the text says that it is in some ways based on Austen herself. He is also, however, not idealized completely. Through her characters and their interaction, Austen shows us the pitfalls of English society in this time period, and also lightly mocks the dramatics and irrationality of gothic novels. It is a nice commentary on literature of that time period, and a joy to read!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book I read, when I was a teenager, and it didn't impress me then--maybe because it starts off rather boringly, as she spends a whole chapter and more telling us how mediocre and ordinary her heroine is. Now that I've read more romantic-adventure novels--and seen the same kind of movies--Austen's warnings that Catherine isn't a beautiful orphan who is likely to get into life-threatening situations are a bit easier to take. The parallel romances of Catherine and her flirtatious friend Isabella are delights to follow, and I can't help but wonder why no film has been made of this Austen novel (though I believe there was a British TV miniseries). In short, not the best of the Austen romances, but a charmer that the author herself keeps warning us not to take too seriously."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I hear that authors never like people to pick their early works as their best, but I've always had a sneaking fondness for Northanger Abbey. Luckily, Jane Austen is unlikely to complain about me liking one of her earliest works.The novel's appeal is its extremely likeable anti-heroine, Catherine Morland. Catherine's appeal is her innocence and above all her fallibility. Of course, none of Austen's heroines are perfect, but Catherine has a charm that Austen's more self-possessed characters like Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennett lack.For this reason, I would say that Northanger Abbey can be a good introduction to Jane Austen, especially for younger readers, who may identify more readily with Catherine's naivete than with some of Austen's more mature characters.As ever, Austen is in fine satirical form, but she and her characters stop short of outright mocking the fanciful Catherine and her unfortunate novel-reading habits. As one might expect, the novel ends with Catherine's reform, redemption would perhaps be too strong a term to use here, and Austen allows the imperfect Catherine to shine among a sea of other imperfect characters. (Naturally, some are more imperfect than others.)One of the novel's stated objects is to satirise the gothic novels of Mrs. Radcliffe and her imitators. For the most part, Austen succeeds admirably, but once again her treatment of the subject is rather gentle. Although not many people these days will read the original gothic novels, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there addicted to contemporary fantastical horror that would crack a wry smile at the story, and be able to identify with 'poor' Catherine.Perhaps at times the characters do seem to be a little overstated, maybe a little too black and white, but this is a very creditable early effort from Austen, and perhaps some of her characterisation issues can be traced back to her use of the gothic novel as inspiration.All in all, a fine book, and certainly one for all of those 'almost pretty' girls out there who have their heads stuck inside books at every opportunity."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This was my first Jane Austen novel, very much against the recommendation of others. The novel does not paint detailed pictures, but the cleverness of Austen's wit is worth the read in itself. I was disturbed in a one place where Austen broke the continuity of the story for a personal rant, but overall the subtly and intricacy of the plot was much more than I expected, and in the later half of the book I was particularly on edge.I also think that this would be a good book for young people trying to understand relationships. Austen very powerfully demonstrates the underlying manipulation and frivolity that so often accompanies young men and women."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Another fabulous story by Jane Austen. This may be \\"lite\\" as another reviewer suggested...but I've never found anything heavy about any of Austen's works. They are all delightful to read. It never fails to surprise me how little the dealings between men and women have changed over the past 200 years. This was truly a joy to read and I would recommend it to everyone.

When all my friends in High School and College were reading her I was reading Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. I've seen the movies but have never gotten around to reading the books. I'm not sure if this one is indicative of her writing style because the synopsis says that it was her spoof on the noir genre. I liked it. There was enough tongue-in-cheek humor as well as \\"fake\\" suspense to make it interesting. Her writing is very flowery and wordy (which was how everyone wrote in those days) so it took some getting used to. I had to wade through the salad to get to the meat of the story. Luckily I've read enough books by authors of that time period to not get frustrated with the slow pace of the plot. I enjoyed the feel of the story - you really got a sense of what the people and the society was like back then. Another thing I liked that I've noticed other writers from that time period also do: her characters read books by real authors. I've actually found some of those books on Gutenburg.org and Amazon and read them too! I discovered Mary Roberts Rinehart this way. She is supposed to have written the first Locked Room Mystery with her book \\"The Circular Staircase\\". It's free for the Kindle at Amazon. I will definitely be checking out more of Jane Austin's books."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"After being disappointed with a couple of Austen's books after P&P;, I was glad to enjoy this one. Her wit is rarely as good as she accomplishes here. The characters are back, too and here we have both a decent leading man and lady.As a work of satire and literary criticism, the story works. Although I am not familiar with the genre she criticizes (past Frankenstein), it lampoons the fans as much as the genre and there are many parallels in today's genre fans.I put \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" on my list to round out my opinion, but it is huge and I won't be getting at it any time soon."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The format is fantastic.

They published a version with the original language, and add many notes to explain references to help a reader understand the context of a word or phrase. The book itself is better than I had expected. Many people dismiss it, possibly because it is not Pride and Prejudice, but I thoroughly enjoyed the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is Jane Austen's first published novel though not as well known as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Emma\\", it is still an ageless classic. Written in the English of the early 18th century it is at the same time almost poetic and difficult to comprehend, which can cause the younger reader to find it stilted or boring. In Austen's writing you must often times read between the lines, as in that period of time many things could not be openly expressed but only hinted at, so take your time. All her books relate to the reader lessons to be learned from life and the character of persons one might meet or associate with. This copy is beautifully formated by VOOK for navigation throughout the book, punctuation, and ease in reading unlike most of the poorly scaned copies of the classics that are available. Northanger Abbey also has a few nice picture illustrations."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I wanted to read this story because this is Jane Austen's take on a Gothic novel as well as her poking fun at novels of her day. I can see all these elements in Northanger Abby. Catherine's daydreams and suspicions of the old house, Austen talking to the reader in a humorous vein and the overall silliness of some of the characters.I have to admit I had a difficult time keeping all the characters straight and it took me a while before I didn't have to refer back to previous pages. This may have had something to do with the fact that I put the book down frequently. It's not that I got bored, because I didn't and when I picked it up again I enjoyed reading it. It just wasn't a \\"I couldn't put it down\\" novel.I like many of the characters and I feel they are the strongest element of the book. Catherine makes me laugh. She sort of reminds me of myself because she can be so oblivious. I felt her frustration and unhappiness as Isabella and John scheme to monopolize her and put her in a mortifying situation. I felt her disappointment at exploring the mysterious Northanger Abbey only to discover...nothing. I remember doing the same thing in my grandmother's old house. I hoped to find treasures, but only discovered old clothes that smelled like mothballs and cigar boxes full of pencils. Catherine's love interest, Henry, acts as mentor and teacher and tries to keep her feet on the ground, but he also indulges her whimsical imaginations. This aspect reminds me of Emma and Mr. Knightley. I feel Isabella and John are the most interesting. They are so self absorbed and manipulative that it is almost comical. What is more humorous is Catherine's slow and reluctant recognition of this. Someone said to me that they felt there is nothing extraordinary about Catherine, but this is precisely why I like her as the protagonist. Sure, I like to read about interesting, exciting people, but honestly, most of us are pretty ordinary and aren't we the protagonists in our own life story?Several times Austen speaks directly to the reader as if she is telling a bed time story. I read Pride and Prejudice so long ago, I can't remember if she did the same thing or if she does this in her other novels, but I find it a bit jarring and I'm not sure I like it.Northanger Abbey was published after Jane Austen's death and I wonder if she had lived to go back and re-work this novel what changes she may have made. Perhaps she would have shown us what happened at the end instead of paraphrasing or included the details of Eleanor and her husband. Maybe we would have seen more drama between Captain Tilney, Isabella and James or even Henry at odds with his father or friction between Henry and John.There are many things that are pointed out in Northanger Abbey that are just hinted at or taken for granted in her other novels, such as appropriate behavior, social norms and the subject of money. Although in my opinion, this is not a perfect novel, I enjoyed reading it. If you are a Jane Austen fan and have not read Northanger Abbey, it is a fun frolic through her world."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey - Jane Austen4 starsThis was the first book that Austen wrote. She sold it; it was never published; so she bought it back when her other books became successful. Possibly she intended a rewrite. Her brother had it published after her death.The story concerns the teen-aged Catherine Moreland who has little experience of the world, but much experience with gothic romance novels. Austen manages to make Catherine comic in her awkwardness and excessive imagination, but lovable in her direct honesty. This book has all the satire and social commentary of Austen's later books, but other than Catherine, I felt the characters lacked depth. Although Catherine's brother has a failed love affair with one of her new friends, Austen only deals with the effect this has on Catherine's relationship with Isabella. Little is said about the brother. Nothing at all is known about Eleanor's relationship to her Viscount. That marriage is only mentioned because it allows Catherine and Henry to marry. I missed the more complex interplay of multiple characters and plot line that occur in Austen's later books, but I enjoyed Catherine's runaway imagination.Juliet Stevenson gives a wonderful performance of this book. Each character is captured distinctly while she adds to the atmosphere and the comedy with her animated reading."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Knowing this was one of the first of Jane Austin's works, I was a bit wary when I began to read it.

Of course this applies to normal intelligent people not some of the morons around today although they probably existed then but were dismissed as irrelevant. Northanger Abbey is so refreshing after reading most books today that seem obsessed with sex.

I've read 3 of them now and they are marvelous. I've read quite a few novels from this era and it is really helpful to have notes to refer to in the back that explain things."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This excellent first novel by Jane Austen is a must read for Austen fans. Although this novel was the last to be published, Northanger Abbey was the first story she wrote. This first attempt is raw, emotionally driven, and shows the passion of a first time writer. The story is one of mystery, intrigue, and a match made in heaven... that is of course dependent on if society will allow it.From the balls in Bath to the secrets of Northanger Abbey Catherine Morland lives it all. Her youth and proper upbringing give Catherine the innocence and naivet&eacute; that everyone can't help but love in her character. Her truly good-hearted personality allows her to be liked where ever she goes. Catherine, it should also be noted, is a fan of gothic novels and is intrigued by the mysteries and secrets they hold. While on vacation with her wealthy neighbors the Allens, Catherine for the first time gets to experience the society in Bath. There she meets the amiable Mr. John Thorpe and the witty Mr. Henry Tilney. When Catherine is invited to the Tilney's Northanger Abbey, her imagination and the grandeur of Northanger Abbey takes hold of her as she tries to discover the truth behind the death of Mrs. Tilney (Henry's mother).\\"Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English: that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetuated without being known in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?\\" - Henry Tilney"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen wrote \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in the late 1790's, but it was not finally published until 1818, after her death. It is a broad satire of the Gothic Romance novels popular in her day. Its lead character, the innocent young Catherine Morland, is moderately attractive, good-hearted, and highly imaginative, but perhaps the least compelling of Austen's heroines. Nevertheless, Jane Austen's excellent writing gifts are on display in this short novel, which offers some superbly funny dialogue, witty commentary on social manners, and a sympathetic heroine.Catherine is offered the opportunity to vacation in the resort town of Bath by family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen. In Bath, she falls in with two people her own age, Isabella and John Thorpe. Isabella is to be engaged to Catherine's brother James, while John, a college friend of James, takes an interest in Catherine. The Thorpes involve the inexperienced Catherine in the social whirl of Bath. They will also provide her with some hard lessons in manners.Catherine also meets Henry and Elinor Tilney, a brother and sister who introduce her to walks and intellectual discussion. Their father, the imposing General Tilney, invites Catherine to visit the family estate of Northanger Abbey. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, in part to stay close to Henry, on whom she has a crush, and in part to see the ancient abbey, sure to be the embodiment of her cherished Gothic Romances.Catherine's willingness to see dark secrets in ordinary events leads her on a search of the Abbey for clues to the suspected murder of General Tilney's wife. In a gentle confrontation, Henry ends the search, but is not able to save her from the sudden wrath of the General, who banishes her from the Abbey. A heartbroken Catherine is separated from Henry and Catherine, and returned unceremoniously to her home. There, an unexpected visit by Henry Tilney will offer an explanation for what happened at Northanger Abbey and a chance to reunite with the Tilneys.Readers expecting a story with the heft of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Mansfield Park\\" may be disappointed. However, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fun book on its own terms, very much a Jane Austen product and likely to be enjoyed by her fans. It is highly recommended as an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is not a sophisticated read, but it is fun. Jane Austen wrote this before she wrote anything else and it was rejected, it is a bit adolescent, but fun. A young girl lets her imagination get away with her when she visits friends at an old house. I'm a high school teacher and I would recommend this for young teens who want to progress beyond R L Stine, etc."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"As a lover of Austen novels, it is well worth reading \\"Northanger Abby\\", which was Austen's first (but last published) novel. As her first novel, her writing style is still rough and lacks some of the refinment of her later works, but she still brings her sharp eye for satire and examination of societal/marriage topics. Catherine Morland pales in comparison to later strong heronies like Elizabeth Bennet or Fanny Price, but she's delightful to read and chuckle about her naive outlook on life."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey was one of Jane Austen's earlier works, and, reading it , you can definitely see her gift of writing in its infancy. While this work is not perfect by any means, it is a fine-tuned effort that any Austin fan will enjoy and appreciate. Basically it works as part comedy/drama of manners and part parody of Gothic literature, taking many of the elements of Ann Radcliffe's work The Mysteries of Udolfo, and slightly satirizing it. The ending's closure--where Austin ties everything together nicely--is something seen in many of her other, more popular works, where all loose ends are tied and questions are answered.The first part of the novel focuses on Catherine Morland, her family, and her acquaintances. Catherine goes away from her family and stays with the Allen family. While there, she meets the Thorpe family, and becomes an acquaintance and friend of Isabella Thorpe. She has to fight off the advances of Isabella's brother. Later on, at a dance, she also meets Henry, a man who she will eventually fall in love with. She finally gets the opportunity to stay with the Tilney family at Northanger Abbey. Because of her love of novels, and her chance to become better acquainted with Henry and his sister, Catherine is excited to go. The second part of the novel begins with Catherine staying at Northanger Abbey.One of the funnier aspects of the novel is the 2nd part, when Catherine goes to Northanger Abbey and immediately becomes entranced with the many Gothic elements she seems to have read about. This is when her knowledge and love of Gothic literature tales runs away with her imagination. At one point, she believes that Henry's father has murdered or imprisoned Henry's mother, or that he is keeping her stowed away and doing malicious and evil things. There is also a moment when Catherine is alone in her room late at night and sees a chest, and fears that it has something awful inside it--so naturally she goes to investigate. It seems that all her suppositions and fears are well-founded to her, but we see that she clearly has taken some things too far in her mind, and perhaps there is an anti-climax in her not finding anything noteworthy.What makes Catherine a likeable heroine is that there are faults to her, so she is perfect by no means. For one thing, she is oblivious to many events that are seemingly obvious to others, namely the romance that begins with her brother and Isabella. She also has some trouble expressing herself in the earlier parts of the novel, but as time wears on she becomes more assertive and mature. Also, her love for novels can be seen as a weakness because she tends to over dramatize and fantasize about them--this seems to be Austen's way of lightly poking fun at reading novels, something you have to admire from a great writer. Over all though, she is a character that is fun to read about and follow around in her adventures.While the story does have moments where it may drag a little, it still is a fun and adventurous read and is a must for Austen fans. This review is in reference to the Dover books version of the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I do not like the title since only part of the story takes place in the Northanger Abbey. The novel has some fame as a parody of Gothic novels, but that is not the primary focus of the novel. This is a novel written by Jane Austen at least a decade before her famous novels. It is similar to the later novels but it is less sophisticated, shorter, and it seems fragmented - as I discuss below. It was sold for publication in 1803. It is her earliest work but it was not a success. She bought back the rights and it was published after her death in 1818.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work. Jane Austen's formula for success was to write a novel about of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her own means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Northanger Abbey\\" among her works? All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters. This is her sixth major work but written earlier. That Austen formula is partially present in the plot and structure. The first half of the novel is good. Catherine is a sympathetic protagonist and John Thorpe is a suitable rogue. Her love interest, Henry Tilney, seems a bit weak or enigmatic. The story is good for about half the novel. When the action moves to the Abbey it seems to become very fragmented and disorienting for the reader. But the Abbey section is not too long, and then story returns to more what we would expect from Austen near the end.Most Austen fans will find the piece to be interesting but a bit confusing in parts and not her best."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a classic in several senses of the word: It's pure Jane Austen; it's set in the early 1800s, mostly in a Gothic abbey; it's dramatic and overwrought and wonderfully written. Any Austen fan who has not yet picked up this little gem of a novel should do so immediately because you are sure to be delighted!Catherine Morland, aged 17, is expanding her horizons by visiting Bath with her neighbors, The Allens. While there, she becomes entangled with the Thorpe family, who are not quite what they seem to be, and the Tilney family, with whom she forms a sincere attachment that leads her to visit their family home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine has spent a good deal of time reading novels, and she allows her imagination to run wild once she finds herself in the dark corridors of the abbey; the appearance of Henry, her hopeful love interest, helps quell her theatrics a bit but she still finds herself drawn into situations she doesn't understand. Classic Austen includes misunderstanding and love, and this novel has both in abundance.This is a slim novel, and from what I gather, one of Austen's earliest. The characterizations are not perhaps as finely tuned as some of her other works, but overall this is a satisfying read with the delights of the time period. Sit back, curl up, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"'Northanger Abbey' is Austen's first novel to be written, though it was published after others. The protagonist Catherine comes of age in her first thorough exposure to the society of adults. This involves going to balls, falling in love, meeting a couple undesirable people, and forever discarding some childish beliefs and fancies.When I pick up a classic I tend to expect and anticipate heavier reading than in a modern novel. 'Northanger' didn't have that depth I was looking for; it was more of a romantic drama, a genre that usually doesn't do it for me (with certain notable exceptions such as the superb 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' by Anne Bronte). Yet it surprised me with its wit and characterization.Austen renders, with great skill, several characters possessing a variety of personalities. Dialogue here is a delight to read and animates Austen's cast. You'll find at least one you can relate to; for me it was Catherine's brother James and also Eleanor Tilney. Though what seems a bit off to me is how the younger ones (especially Henry & Eleanor Tilney) tend to act more mature than the older folks! I can't recall a single grownup over 40 in the book who I would have serve as a role model to me. Perhaps Catherine's mother, but she barely plays a part in the novel. Henry Tilney is clearly cast in this role and he seems far more mature than the average 26 year old.I've read a couple of Austen's later works (Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion) and I tend to agree with other reviewers that 'Northanger' doesn't have the depth and subtlety that Austen develops later in her career. Sure I recommend it once you've exhausted the stable of superb British classics out there from the 19th century. I just started Thomas Hardy's 'Tess of D'Urberville' and I have to admit the contrast from 'Northanger' was a bit of a shock. Hardy's writing is on another (higher) level entirely."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This book was a hard one for me to start. Not in the tradional sense of being a difficult begining. Truthfully I thouroughly enjoyed the book from the start. (The opening paragraph was brilliant in my opinion). No, I had done something very wrong. I watched the movie first. Not that this is always wrong,(altough should be avioded when possible), I have watched some movies that have left me looking foward to the inspiring lituarature such as PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE or DAVID COPPERFIELD. But this movie punched me, left me reeling, never wanting to read a book that could produce a film like this.Flash foward a few years. My wife being an avid Austen reader was also hesitant about reading it. But she took the plunge and gave it a go. While it was not her favorite book, she enjoyed it enough to recomend it to me, saying it was almost completly different from the book.So with a little less trepidation I eventually decided I would read it. Amazing. I really liked this book. Why had I never wanted to read this book? How could they make a movie like that from this kind of material to work with? Why don't they get the people who did the PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE mini-series to do this?My only problem with it was that it ended way to fast for me. Everything seemed to be resolved and finished in the last two or three pages, with very little of how thier lives turn out in the end. But if that is the only thing you can truly critize in a book, then I think your holding an excellent book."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Though it started off with charm and piqued my interest, I raced to finish this book. However, on the whole, I found _Northanger Abbey_ to be a dull story, since it's an obvious imitation of more interesting gothic novels, such as Ann Radcliffe's _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ and _The Italian_, which I also just read.From an intellectual standpoint, I'd read this book again, and recommend it on that basis(probably because I read it for a course). But if you want a good and consistent gothic tale with an ending as strong as the introduction, turn to Radcliffe for starters. Austen's book will give you other references worthy of checking out.Three-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is my first Austen novel, and I must say, I don't know what all the hype is about. I thought it was excruciatingly slow at times, and then all of a sudden it was fast and over. Some of the writing was beautiful and poetic, but that is like 5% of the book. The other 95% of the book was pretty boring to me. Maybe I am jaded by all the horror and mysteries I read where I am used to fast paced suspense, but seriously, I would read one chapter a day or maybe two with this book and that was all I could handle, because it would make me tired. I felt no connection with the main character Catherine, and I found myself not caring what happened to her, good or bad. I just wanted the book to be over."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is a very amusing novel, and Cathereine Morland's adventures in Bath are very entertaining. But after she gets to Northanger Abbey it is a bit of a letdown. When she starts to suspect that General Tilney has done away with his wife, how much better it would have been if that had, in fact, been the case. naturally Catherine would find the proof to convict the General. It could have been the start of a gret mystery series, under the general title of the Morland Mysteries, or Miss Morland Investigates. Hnery Tilney could have been her amiable but obtuse sidekick, poor old henry, he never gets the murderer's identity right. Miss Austen missed a golden opportunity here. It's not that I don't like her novels, I do very much, it's just that I think they'd be better if there were more murders in them."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"it was a good book but very hard to get into. once you start reading (and understand it) its hard to put down. read this book if you have a lot of time on your hands."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a classic (time) about a seventeen year old girl who is invited to spend a period of time with some friends, Mr and Mrs Allen in Bath.

The secrets are somehow revealed to the General who has Catherine ordered out of the house.Catherine returns to her home (her father, mother, and siblings) an altered person. Henry arrives at her house (he has evidently followed her) and asks for her hand in marriage. Catherine consents, and later the General gives his blessing on the marriage of his son and Catherine Morland.I did not like this book. Jane Austen satirizes the Gothic novels of her time. In order to truly understand &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, I feel that you need an understanding of the Gothic novels of the Victorian era of literature.Despite this being a time classic, I felt that it was amazing that this book has withstood the test of time. I can not relate to Catherine, and the activities in which she engages.However, if you want to read a classic, Northanger Abbey is a good choice, as it teaches about the life of an upper class girl in Victorian society."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"If you read this after Emma, you will see a slight but distinct maturing on the part of Austen.

Austen was on the top of my list. After reading Northanger Abbey, I think I'll eventually go thorough all of her works.Why? Well, it's like reading about an alien race and their customs and habits. I realize the society that she writes about was her own and not that long ago ... yet, it's so foreign when compared to today's society. It's like being plopped down in a foreign land and expected to relate to the natives -- and yet the characters are so vibrant that you find yourself drawn in.Catherine Morland is every person who takes people at face value -- if they are recommended as nice, kind, and entertaining people then they must be. In her sheltered life, that attitude has always worked. But on her first trip to Bath, Catherine has to learn to listen to her own heart, observe what others do and form her own opinions. Sounds simple but in that society, women weren't exactly encouraged to think for themselves. Catherine's active imagination, fueled by all the novels she has read, color her perceptions. She learns to recognize the difference between fantasy and reality but maintains her sense of humor.Delightful, insightful, and fun to read."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"If you're a fan of Austen's other works like I am, you'll probably read this book regardless of any detracting review... so this is more for me to vent than anything else!The last time I read this was as a teen, and it didn't leave much of an impression then. I've just finished reading it again after having watched both film adaptations.The story itself is engaging and interesting. It is a satire of gothic novels, and that aspect of it is very entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud at quite a few lines. But I could only enjoy it on that level, because I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters themselves. They seem to be written on purpose to be either unlikeable or uninteresting.The main character, Catherine, is a complete simpleton. I kept finding myself rolling my eyes and inwardly saying, \\"Oh, please,\\" in regards to her outlandishly wrong opinions and conjectures about people. The fact that she's 17 doesn't excuse this extreme naivet&eacute; and lack of judgment. I was a better judge of character at 17, and I was about as naive as it gets!Henry Tilney, who is supposed to be such a gentleman (especially when compared with one of the novel's \\"villains,\\" John Thorpe) seems to me to be as rude as John Thorpe but just in a different way. Until the very end of the book, Henry almost never says anything that is not sarcastic or joking. And usually his conversations are based on something he finds amusing about the other person that he wants to play off of, but so subtly that the person he is addressing doesn't realize that he is making fun of them. He does this even with Catherine, who is his love interest. I can't for the life of me figure out what attracts him to her (or vice versa)--other than the fact that he enjoys having someone always around whom he can feel superior towards. (Austen even alludes to this in Ch. 14: \\"a good-looking girl with an affectionate heart, and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young man.\\") He even calls his sister \\"stupid\\" in one of these sarcastic speeches, after which his sister assures Catherine that \\"he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say... an unkind [thing] of me.\\" Sorry, sis, he just did! Whether or not he meant it, it was still unkind.The Allens, the Morlands, and Miss Tilney are all nice but dull, and everyone else surrounding Catherine is positively obnoxious. Maybe this was on purpose and Austen's intent was that the characters and not just the plot be satirical. If so, then she succeeded. But personally, I prefer novels in which I can care about and like the heroines and heroes, as I do in her other books.If this were all I knew of Austen's writing, I wouldn't be inclined to read any of her other works! Fortunately her others are much better than this one. P&P; is one of my favorite books of all time and I've read it countless times. Next in order of preference would be Emma, S&S;, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. But this one I could do without. I guess that's not too suprising since it was her first novel (though last to be published)."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Catherine Morland has nothing to recommend her as a bride. She is somewhat pretty in a tomboyish kind of way, but she is far from rich. She is also not particularly accomplished. She is passionate about gothic novels, but that is hardly a quality men seek. What is a girl of marriageable age to do? To Catherine's delight, she travels to Bath, where she meets the charming Mr. Tinley, who invites her to meet his family at his estate called Northanger Abbey. Catherine loves the house's dark and mysterious appearance. Her imagination gets the best of her, and soon she begins to experience things not unlike the stuff she reads about in The Mysteries of Udolpho.I didn't know what to expect from Jane Austen's \\"dud.\\" This was published last, though it wasn't the last novel Austen penned (I believe Persuasion was her final completed work). I had read all of her books except for this one, for everyone told me it wasn't that great. Well, even though this isn't the best Austen novel, it is not terrible either. It exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. Austen's keen eye for satire can be appreciated more here than in any of her other novels. She let us know what she felt about the gothic genre, not in a derogatory manner, but with sharp humor and interesting characters. Catherine is an engaging heroine, though irritating at times, and Mr. Tinley is so charming that I couldn't help falling for him. There are no surprises in the story, but that did not take away from my enjoyment. As a lover of gothic novels and a fan of the likes of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Bronte and Daphne du Maurier, I was able to laugh at Austen's antics. I definitely recommend this novel if you haven't read it. If you're new to Jane Austen, then I advise you to read this one first, that way you won't be disappointed with it after reading the others. But if you hate this book, move on to the other books, for you might feel differently about the others. Whatever you do, do not read the author forewords, for most of them contain spoilers."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is a very well done book! I congradulate Jane Austen on yet another classic. Many reviewers stated that this was less mature then Austen's other novels, well duh! She was like 17 at the time! This is better then what some of the top authors today can write! I really liked this novel because it's easier for me to relate to because i'm 14. Catherine is really likable and I totally didn't predict the ending! This book was hard for me to find funny though, maybe i didn't get the humour? I liked Henry Tilney and hope they make a big movie of this novel with good actors/actresses. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to Jane Austen fans!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen enthusiasts (Janeites) tend to re-read \\"Northanger Abbey\\" less often than they do her other novels. It nevertheless has several merits.One distinction is that the voice of Jane Austen the narrator is perhaps picked up more clearly here than in her other novels. Here you will find, for example, her minor dissertation in praise of the novel, \\"... work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of the human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humor are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\\".A second quality is the strong sense of location that emanates from its pages. Jane Austen is rarely a travel guide, but here she conducts the reader around the small English city of Bath.A third excellence is its depiction of its \\"heroine\\" Catherine Moreland, a 17 year-old who gradually learns that reality is not the same as it's depicted in Mrs Radcliffe's novels.And so it is great fun to read of the novel-reading heroine Catherine finding mortifications and infatuations in Bath. It is fun also to see if \\"something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way\\"."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"One of Jane Austen's best attributes as a writer is her rapier wit and sense of humor, which especially shows itself in her earlier novels, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, which preceded both of them but was published only after her death, is a clever parody of the Gothic novel as written by Anne Radcliffe: full of dark, stormy nights, ancient castles with secret passages and locked rooms hiding unspeakable crimes, damsels in distress, and all the rest. Austen's heroine, Catherine Morland, has read a few too many such books, and we meet her at the age of seventeen, emerging from the chrysalis of adolescence as a passably pretty young woman with her head full of romantic notions and not much else. When she meets the hero of her dreams, Henry Tilney, a surprisingly level-headed young man, Catherine realizes that life as melodrama is a poor second to life in reality. Catherine is fascinated at the prospect of visiting Northanger Abbey -- what mysteries and horrors must be waiting to be discovered -- only to be brought up short by the pedestrian intrusion of real life (a locked cabinet which might have held vials of poison or, even better, a skeleton, turns out to hold nothing more dangerous than a laundry list).&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a good first novel but it is by no means Jane Austen's best, and Catherine is not as interesting a heroine as Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Watson or Elinor Dashwood; she's a somewhat shallow, undeveloped young lady who lacks their depth and their intelligence. But she's a likeable heroine; unlike Fanny Price, Catherine doesn't try to be perfect nor judge others for failing to be so, and unlike Emma Watson, she's not meddling in everyone else's business. She can admit when she's at fault and she has a generous spirit. We like to imagine her as the tomboy Austen pictures her in her childhood, rolling down hills and chasing her brothers and sisters. Austen provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe. By the book's end, Catherine has grown up a bit; she sees life as it is and realizes Henry's steady common sense is infinitely preferable to the histrionics of any Gothic hero. Jane Austen's first book was a promising introduction of better things to come."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This book really is the story about a girl who lives in her books and learns to live outside of the imaginary world she creates. The book is a satire of the Gothic novel, but I think it is more than that. It's the story how the words one person says may be reflected onto someone else and how they can be interpreted to either enrich or ruin another's life. The way that John Thorpe, in order to make himself look better, &quot;enriched&quot; Catherine's story; the diverging opinions of James &amp; Isabella; the general falseness of Isabella &amp; John; and how the simplest statement can be misconstrued &amp; almost ruin a friendship.Catherine, by living in her novels (aided by Henry, of course), sees things that aren't really there when she visits Northanger Abbey. She makes mountains out of mole-hills. Thankfully, Henry acknowledges the role he had in creating these fantasies and is able to help her laugh it off.This is a great Austen novel, and although you can tell that it was her first, I think it ranks right up there with the others."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"It is believed that Jane Austen wrote many of her first works for the entertainment of her family and would read them aloud for their opinions and enjoyment. It is not hard to imagine that Northanger Abbey was presented to her family in this manner. The language and phrasing lends itself so freely to the spoken word almost like a stage play, that I was quite certain that an audio book would be a great enhancement to the text. Add to that the talent of a creative narrator and you have a great combination for several hours of entertainment ahead of you.I adore audio books and listen to them in the car during my commute to work. It is a great time to tune out the traffic, clear my head, and get lost in a good story. When I decided that I wanted to listen to an audio version of Northanger Abbey I discovered that there were three new unabridged audio editions that had been produced in the last two years to choose from. The first Blackstone Audiobooks (2007) was read by Nadia May, the second by Tantor Media (2006) and read by Donada Peters, and the third by Naxos AudioBooks (2006) and read Juliet Stevenson. The first two readers appeared to be professional narrators specializing in the classics with a diverse range of authors, and the third Juliet Stevenson is a well known British stage and screen actress, whose performance as the acerbic Mrs. Elton in the 1996 movie adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma was so hilarious, that I knew she would be an excellent choice to read the novel with the extra bit of animation that I desired.Ms. Stevenson did not disappoint and far exceeded my expectations. She added just the right amount of irony and humor to the reading of Northanger Abbey that no one would be in doubt that it is a burlesque on the sensational Gothic fiction or other overly sentimental novels popular in Jane Austen's day. Her choice of characterizations was imaginative and captivating. Hearing her interpretation of the emptiness of Mrs. Allen and her frivolous distinction for fashion, Isabella Thorpe and her shallow endearments, and Henry Tilney with his knack for reading and adapting to different personalities with wit and charm, I have a deeper appreciation and understanding of the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I'd forgotten how much fun this novel is! Northanger Abbey was actually Austen's first completed novel as far as history knows, although it was published posthumously, long after her other works were published. It's really the funniest and most satirical of all her novels, and the gothic tomfoolery is what kills me. I just love it.A brief plot summary is that the story's protagonist, Catherine, is invited to spend some time in Bath with some family friends, where she meets the characters that will carry out the various themes in the story, namely two sets of siblings: Isabella and John Thorpe, and Frederick and Eleanor Tilney. A recurring theme any Austen fan will recognize is that of first impressions and innocence giving way to deception and misunderstandings, as a young, naive Catherine finds that her dear new friend, Isabella, is not quite who she at first appears to be, and that all kinds of scheming and plotting are going on behind Catherine's guileless back - based mostly, of course, on gross misconceptions that will cause all manner of ruckus down the road.The real jewel of this book in particular, though, is the hysterically funny and affectionately rendered spoof on the gothic suspense novel genre that was in its heyday during this period, a la' Radcliffe, Burney and Walpole. Anyone familiar with The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho or any of the other gothic classics will really appreciate the humor. I absolutely love the gothic suspense novel in all its forms, so I get a huge kick out of it. The scene between Frederick and Catherine in the carriage on the way to Northanger Abbey where he teases her mercilessly (merciless because she's only about 2% sure she's being teased and is 98% wide-eyed with horror) about the abbey's dark corridors and hidden passages is so funny it makes me laugh out loud every time. Catherine's discovery that the abbey is decidedly un-haunted, sadly lacking in cobwebs and absolutely devoid of gothic gloom is even more amusing.There's a love story here too, and in fact a triangle or two, and as with all of Austen's stories, all's well that ends well. Wonderfully soothing balm for the Austen-starved soul, and secretly my favorite of her books (I usually lie and say Mansfield Park is my favorite. Sometimes Pride & Prejudice. Or even Sense & Sensibility. All lies. Northanger Abbey is it, hands down)."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen just knocks me out. She wrote in a living room full of extended family,she wrote longhand when paper was not so plentiful as it is today and mistakes could not be so frequently wadded up and tossed to the landfill, she wrote without the instant editing afforded by personal computers, she wrote without benefit of the MFA programs and workshops we are assured today are the only route to producing literary art, and yet she wrote beautifully and for all time. Every word counts, every character is real, every scene pulses along in a swift current. Her work can be many things at once: social satire, romance, social criticism, a comedy of manners. It is a portrait of a certain society in a certain time, it is a universal commentary on human foibles, gender relations, class and money.NORTHANGER ABBEY was one of Austen's earliest mature works, and it stands alongside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and the rest. She does something different in this one: she uses her own novel to, among other things, satirize the popular literature of her time, especially Ann Radcliffe's MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO. She sets out telling us that her protagonist, Catherine Morland, is not your typical heroine, that in fact she's ordinary without special talents, a dramatic home life or heart-stopping beauty. She belongs to the audience that was vacuuming up the burgeoning genre of popular literature of her time, and the second half of the story largely finds her attempting to live like a heroine in her favorite gothic romance, only to have reality jump out of the closet at her at every turn. The first half of the story is the set up for the second, the comedy of manners that positions her in the company of the residents of Northanger Abbey, whose name conjures up in her mind a dramatic ruin of a castle. There is, in fact, quite a bit of suspense that keeps you up late, just not the kind Catherine has in mind. If you pay attention in the first half of the book, you will find the \\"guns\\" neatly planted that go off in the last act."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"First let me say, I like Jane Austen. I'm not kissing up to my wife, and I don't feel less masculine in admitting it. I like good writing, and Austen is clearly a good storyteller.That said, I'm not always really into the subject matter of her stories - romance, coming of age, etc. But she writes well enough that I generally want to keep reading. Additionally, I've always enjoyed the many film adaptations of her books.But I wasn't crazy about Northanger Abbey. It was her first novel, and you can tell. The story is painfully slow, the characters (except for the heroine) are underdeveloped, and in general the love story feels very Jr. High (except with wealth and British accents).If you're reading the whole Austen corpus, then by all means read this. But if you are picking and choosing, I'd put Northanger Abbey at the bottom of the list."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I have to disgree with my fellow reviewer on the delight to be found in Northanger Abbey. I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and am also somewhat partial to Gothic romances so I expected to really enjoy Austen's satirical take on this genre. While it started off with promise, I soon found myself wishing it would end as there is little action until the latter chapters when Catherine Morland, the heroine, finally goes to Northanger Abbey. I won't deny that there is some pleasure to be had in Austen's wit and humorous take on Gothic romances but the majority of the story drags a bit and the ending feels almost too rushed.Additionally, while it is clear that Austen created a heroine very different from those in her later work and that she is intentionally naive and easily influenced, she is difficult to like, making it hard to stay engaged with her story. Of course, Austen may have also done this intentionally as a way to hold Catherine up as an example of the failings of youth and the influence of this type of literature on a sheltered mind, but even in that case, it doesn't make the story any easier to enjoy.It is certainly worth reading to see a different side of Jane Austen as well as to judge the progress of her style and thematic focus but it may not stand up as well against the talent and mastery shown in her other work."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Being the first novel that Jane Austen ever wrote and the last that was ever published (posthumously at that); \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an interesting specimen of a book. Though the plot itself is a little unpolished when compared to her later books, her sparkling wit is still firmly intact. Poking fun at the Gothic-Romantic novels of her time (and the effect that they have on impressionable young women) Austen crafts a satirical treatise on the dangers of the unbridled imagination and the real \`horror' of the time: the hypocrisy and two-facedness of the society Catherine lives in.Catherine Morland is an ordinary young woman, who thrilled by the excitement and intrigue that she finds during her holiday months in Bath. The fact that she is given quite a free rein by her foolish guardian Mrs Allen is just the ticket she needs to have a good time. Catherine enjoys the friendship of the glamorous Isabella Thorpe and her brother (whose attention is perhaps just a *little* unwelcome), the sights and sounds of the resort city and two new acquaintances: Eleanor and Henry Tilney. Quickly falling in love with the intelligent and well-read Henry (a character based on Austen's favourite brother of the same name), Catherine struggles with her innate sense of right and wrong, and her romantic delusions concerning the Tilney family. Marilyn Butler (the author of the introduction in my edition) describes her perfectly: \\"she is always capable of saying a good thing, which is either to the point, or refreshingly honest, or nave but disarmingly loyal to her parents and brothers and sisters.\\"Unlike heroines such as Elizabeth and Emma, Catherine is quite an immature young woman, and remains so for most of the novel. Her mind is filled with the fancies of romance-fiction, and as such Catherine is often criticized as being the weakest of Austen's heroines. But dismissing the novel on the basis of its weak protagonist is missing the point of the story itself (besides, I found Catherine to be Austen's most amusing heroine in light of her flights of fancy). Unlike \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\", \\"Northanger Abby\\" is not a character-study. In fact Austen makes it clear from page one that Catherine is not to be considered your typical heroine: \\"No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be a heroine.\\" Austen douses Catherine's romantic ideals with a glass of ice-cold water, continually reminding the reader how ordinary she is, and - far from the romantic entanglements of her other protagonists - how simple and unaffecting her relationship with Henry is. In fact, Austen ultimately commends the major villain of the novel - his interference in the couples' plans extend their engagement and ensure that the two get to know each other better before they marry.Of course, Austen also has plenty of room for her other great literary technique: poking fun at the restrictions and regulations of her society. However, its treatment here is somewhat darker than it is in other books, as many of the decisions made by characters have very grave effects on others and aren't at all meant to be considered amusing by the reader. Catherine's mind is full of the horrors to be found in Gothic-Romanticism, and as a result is blind to the real nastiness going on around her; whilst she dreams about murders, secret passages and other sinister goings-on, she is completely unaware as to the cynical machinations and games being played right under her nose.The mastery of Jane Austen is of course that her work has aged magnificently, and is just as relevant now as it ever was. Just try and tell me that you can't relate to this following passage, as Catherine tries to avoid Mr Morland and find Mr Tilney at a crowded ball: \\"Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or another known the same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of some one whom they wished to please.\\" First published in 1818, and these words are as true now as they ever were."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The story of Northanger Abbey is really the story of the literary influence of fiction in Jane Austen's day. At a time when fiction was still spoken about in whispers and the subject of much debate, Ms. Austen was writing this epithet to the genre. Many believe that Northanger was the means of Austen's scorn for gothic novels. However, a closer look reveals a bold defense of the fiction writers of her day. This, alone, makes the book a treasure chest - because not only does Austen give you a picture of society's views of all things poetic, but actually lists novels that were popular in her time. Specifically, she lists novels and authors she personally enjoyed.The power that novels seem to hold over her leading lady, Catherine, was not a source of derision for the silly, flighty escapades of young ladies - but another way of Austen's showcasing the power of the written word - fictional word, that is. Here, she addresses the audience of her novel directly, and most provokingly in places - arguing those attributes of fiction novels which she believes show a greatness of mind.Because of the insecurity of fiction, she actually published her novels anonymously as did many other authors mentioned in her first novel - this one not being published until after her death. I have found great personal pleasure in seeking out and indulging myself in the many authors she lists whom she personally enjoyed and was inspired by. In reading them, I feel that I have discovered more about Ms. Austen and what made her brilliant mind tick. My imagination tells me that a glance at Catherine was a little glance at Jane."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I generally love both Jane Austen's work and the foot & end notes accompanying it that give a more thorough sense of the culture, but this time the notes completely ruined the story for me!At first I thought perhaps I was enjoying Northanger Abbey less than Austen's other works because it was her first, and therefore less practiced and perfected, novel. But towards the end of the book I realized that it's main flaws are not of Austen's doing.Every morsel that Austen holds back, every secret she hints at to draw the reader along with her main character is dashed to pieces by the explanatory notes! No wonder I didn't think it very good - before I'd read a third of the introduction (and there I stopped), I knew what trials would befall Catherine, what motives the antagonists operated under, and who the heroine would marry in the end!Of course her first work is not as heralded as Pride & Prejudice, but it is still worth the time of an Austen fan. If you are capable, ignore every memo in this book until after you're done. If you're incapable, I recommend you find another version so that you may enjoy Austen's first novel for what it is, without anyone spoiling it for you!A.L. TravisAuthor of The Pillar of Light: The Legends of Milana Series"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"All periods have their literary crazes, the equivalents of &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; or serial killer books. In Austen's time, it was the Gothic romance, with its beautiful suffering heroines, haunted castles, ghostly visitations, and unspeakable horrors. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is Austen's send-up of this genre, which she combines with a more typical (for her) story of husband hunting and social comedy.Catherine Moreland is the least accomplished of Austen's heroines. She's pretty enough and gently reared, but the author makes it plain that she's the early 19th century equivalent of an airhead. In typical Austen fashion, Catherine travels to Bath in the care of family friends and quickly becomes best friends with the husband-hunting Isabel Thorpe. She also encounters Henry Tillney and his sister Elinor. Henry and Catherine hit it off, although not without some rough spots created by the actions of Isabel and her family. When Catherine is invited to visit the Tillney's home, the ancient Northanger Abbey, she is delighted as much by the chance of having a Gothic adventure as by spending time with her beloved's family. Making much out of little and using her favorite novels as guides, she immediately begins to investigate the hidden secrets of the place and reads a nefarious purpose into Henry's father's every action. Eventually her eyes are opened to reality, duplicity is exposed in the real world, and Catherine gets her man.&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is one of Jane Austen's earliest works, and many consider it her weakest. Compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; it's definitely rough around the edges. But it still has its pleasures. Austen may not have created as admirable a heroine in Catherine as Elizabeth, or Emma, or Anne, but she treats her kindly in the end. Austen's eye for the foibles of those around her is just as sharp as it would be later, and her pen is just as lethal. As for Austen's literary parody, you don't have to have read the early 19th century Gothic novel to appreciate the humor the message. Just think about the effect that many of our novels and movies have on us today--it's basically the same thing. Austen may have been using what was familiar to her audience, but the point remains--art and reality are not the same and those who are too impressionable run the risk of confusing them."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The story describes the development of a young girl, Catherine Morland. She is the daughter of a clergyman, not very rich nor especially handsome or clever. At the age of seventeen she is allowed to go with Mr. and Mrs. Allen to Bath, were all the upper class of England spends the holidays. She meets there a plenty of young people, for example John and Isabella Thorpe, Eleanor Tilney and her brother Henry. They all become friends, but John and Henry take a deeper interest in Catherine. She has to make up her decision: The young student John or the earnest reverend Henry, and soon it's clear. Catherine goes with Eleanor and Henry to stay for a visit at the abbey where they are living with their father, Captain Tilney, while Isabella ingages with Catherines brother James. As Catherine has read many novels about misteries (f.e. &quot;The misteries of Udolpho&quot;) she expects to find something puzzling and amazing in this old abbey. Everywhere she looks for a strange thing, but never finds anything. Even Henry tells her once how stupid she is to believe in such things, and now Catherine has a more realistic vue to the world around her. But then she receives a letter from her brother James where he writes that Isabella has left him, and moreover Catherine has to leave the abbey because Captain Tilney has found out that she isn't as rich as he thought and because of that not adapted to become Henry's wife. Through all these experiences Catherine grows up, and at the end of the story she is a very different woman than at the beginning."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"A CHRISTmas gift for my daughter who loves Jane Austen.The book arrived in excellent shape and by the date promised.It now sits on the top shelf of her new bookshelf with her otherJane Austen books!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I've been working on reading all of Ms. Austen's oeuvre, and all I have left is Persuasion. Reading Northanger Abbey was a miserable experience. The heroine is so insipid, and I could care less about the parody of the gothic novel. I'm reading Austen for her character-building abilities, not for her making fun of old novels I haven't read.The other characters were abominable too--Mr. and Ms. Thorpe, the Allens, the whole lot of them, Catherine as a child. And I thought for so long that the widower General was hitting on Catherine himself.I even had to listen to the audio version to try and move things along but it still made me grit my teeth and at times bored me to the end of my nerves.Well, if you only have one Austen to skip, skip this one. Or read it only if you're a diehard fan, which I am not."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"So it's time to review another classic. Ugh, these are probably the hardest ones to review for me. I'd give Northanger Abbey 4 Stars. I did like this book and it definitely had moments where I was extremely curious to know what was going to happen next, but as with all of Jane Austen's novels that I have read thus far, there are moments that are more boring in nature and therefore allow me to put the book down easily.The more I read of Jane Austen's writing and the more familiar I am with other works from the same time period, the easier it is to read these works. I'm more familiar with the phrasing and general canter of her writing style than I once was, but sometimes I still have to slow down in order to absorb what it is that she's trying to say.Northanger Abbey's heroine, Catherine, appears to me to be surrounded by several people who's speech is contradictory to their actually feelings or actions, Isabella, John Thorpe, and Mrs. Allen. And Catherine herself appears to me to be one of the most ignorant of Jane Austen's heroines. I don't mean that in a bad way necessarily. It's just that Catherine doesn't always know what is proper and usually defers her own judgment to those around her assuming that they know better than she does. While Catherine does appear perceptive in some cases, as in disliking John Thorpe very early on, she also appears the opposite in other cases, such as Isabella's true nature as well as John's supposed attraction to herself.I like the fact that while Jane Austen's heroines seem to be similar in some ways, they all have very different circumstances and experience which makes each story very much unique to itself. I do find that there has been in at least 3 of the novels that I've completely finished a character that I wholly dislike...and it's usually the one that talks the most about things they know nothing about. In this case, it's Isabella Thorpe. One thing I was disappointed in was the ending. It's not that she didn't satisfy my desire to know what happened or that I wasn't pleased with the end result; however, she essentially summarized the ending rather than letting the reader experience it as it happened.Anyway, a short read, but well worth it if you're an Austen fan. If not, I wouldn't suggest reading this one first, but work up to it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is Jane Austen's 5th published novel, although it was actually written before her earlier novels. Catherine Morland is an impressionable, innocent and nave seventeen-year-old from the country, in Bath for the first time in her life. She is grateful to be befriended by the lovely Isabella Thorpe, but less than pleased to be pursued by Isabella's brother John. Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor appear to be more genuine in their friendship, and Catherine is invited to be a guest of their father, General Tilney, at Northanger Abbey. Catherine is an avid reader of novels, and, believing life to be an adventure, gets the wrong end of the stick on more than one occasion. Austen's style is a little different in this novel; she occasionally mentions, as the author, her readers, her characters and the plot. She has her characters make some quite strong statements about novels and novelists. Catherine's plight towards the end of the novel brings a lump to the throat, but much of the novel is filled with humour. Probably the funniest Austen."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey is a great addition for those who are already Jane Austen fans, but it's not a good choice for first-time Austen readers (or even, second or third-time Austen readers). I have now read all of her novels save Mansfield Park. Northanger Abbey is not without its merits, but overall, it is underdeveloped. According to Wikipedia, it is the first novel that Austen wrote, but among the last published. Knowing the novel's history helps one be more understanding and sympathetic towards all of the book's flaws. In fact, arguably, the value of this novel is precisely its unpolished state, for that provides precious insight into Austen's thoughts and development as a writer.Catherine Morland is the title's heroine. You know that she is the heroine because the author explicitly tells you at the outset. She is invited by family friends, Mr and Mrs. Allen, to travel to Bath, where she meets her hero. Again, you know who the hero is because the author explicitly tells you. When she first arrives at Bath, she bemoans her lack of acquaintances. Slowly but surely, she meets some friends; and thus, the first half of the novel revolves around Catherine's social life in Bath. The second half of the novel brings Catherine to Northanger Abbey, which gives the author an opportunity to poke fun at gothic settings.Northanger Abbey is largely a parody of popular gothic novels during Austen's time. Not having any knowledge of the gothic novels that Austen references, such as Udolpho, I couldn't properly appreciate Northanger Abbey. The best analogy I could think of was if someone today wrote a parody of Twilight, not in a mean way, but in a good-natured humorous way. Then two hundred years from now, someone reads the parody version without ever having heard of Twilight. That's the analogy I had in my head as I read Northanger Abbey.Thus, I tried to appreciate this novel for what it was. But still, I didn't care for the characters or the plot of Northanger Abbey. I never really took to Catherine Morland in the way that I always took to the heroines in Austen's other novels. Catherine's personality lacked that fire, that spark present in Austen's other heroines. I also didn't care for the story in this novel. Not much happened, and what did happen was choppy. Certain plot elements towards the end felt abrupt and I didn't get sufficient closure on certain characters at the conclusion of the novel.One unusual aspect of this book is that the author sporadically interjects herself into the novel, and even offers a lengthy ranting defense of novel readers in Chapter 5. From this I infer that others in Austen's society must have looked down on novel readers. Ironic, isn't it? Nowadays Jane Austen novels are considered classic literature, and I imagine that those who read classics are more likely to look down upon those who don't. Anyways, the author's direct interjections are weird and out of place. I know that sometimes writers speak directly to the reader as a literary device, but that is not the case here. Austen is just randomly spewing her thoughts here for no good reason.All of my complaints aside, I must give Austen credit for writing a pretty humorous novel. Some of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are delightfully funny. The parody of the gothic setting is amusing, even if not fully appreciated. I might even say that among the Austen novels I've read, this is the funniest."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I'm not sure why this novel is considered the \\"lesser\\" of the Austen novels. It's brilliantly funny and contains wonderful satire of the gothic romance novels popular at the time and the silly games that suitors play with one another. Through the character of Isabella Thorpe, Austen reveals the damages that can come from a deceptively manipulative friendship. It is only when our heroine Catherine Morland becomes independent from Isabella's influence that she can realize that she wasn't a true friend at all.I have great affection for Catherine Morland. It is true that she's the least intelligent of Austen's heroine's but that's because this is a true coming of age story. We get to see her journey from naive young girl, to an independent young woman, through her profound life experiences. And Henry Tilney is a great hero because even when he is amused and befuddled by Catherine, he does everything he can to spare her feelings and lead her in a sensible direction. Plus he's really funny.It has been years since I'd read this book and I forgot how many of Austen's best quotes come from it! Here are just a few:\\"But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way.\\"\\"Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\\"\\"I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\\"Catherine's thoughts on reading History:\\"I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all - it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs - the chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other books.\\"And my all time favorite Austen quote, as spoke by the wonderful Henry Tilney:\\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid.\\""},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I like this book.

Catherine does go to Bath with the Allens, she does fall in love with Henry, and she does begin to question the happenings of the Abbey and the Tilney family.

I was expecting, by the description on the back of my Barnes and Noble copy (and everything else I'd read about it), that this would be a gothic novel full of mysteries and enchanting (or not so enchanting) secrets. Not so. The first \\"Volume\\" was consisted of their time in Bath, Catherine and Isabella's friendship, and possible suitors (other than Henry) for both of them. Henry is introduced but not much happens between him and Catherine until a bit later.Catherine, Henry, and Isabella were developed well, as were Mr. Thorpe, Isabella's brother, and Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister.

Not surprisingly, my favorite was Pride and Prejudice, but my #2 choice was her little-known book Northanger Abbey. Northanger Abbey was published after Austen's death, though it was written much earlier. It's a bit different from her other works. It is a very good parody and satire of the financial considerations of marriage among English gentry of the time, as well as of the then popular Gothic literature.Catherine is different from the typical heroine. She is very ordinary, and not at all heroic. She's rather naive, somewhat ignorant, pleasant-looking but not beautiful. She's grown up one of ten children in a parsonage, but gets the chance to go with family friends to visit Bath. She doesn't have men falling at her feet, and actually has only one real suitor other than the hero. She wants to see the best in people and is easily misled as to the character of a friend, even when we can see that she's almost wilfully blind. She's enthralled with Gothic literature and when circumstances take her to a forbidding abbey, partially in ruins, her imagination is prone to running away from her.Austen's parodying of Gothic literature and the travails of the marriage market is outstanding. I love dry humor, and this book is rife with it, much more than Austen's others. A few samples:\\"When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together;... Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farmhouse, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the following points. \`I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the Rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend....'\\"\\"Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the journey began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\\"I would definitely recommend this book to any who have enjoyed Austen's other books, but also to those who enjoy satire or dry humor. While relatively unknown, this is, in my opinion, one of Austen's best."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen's first novel is a delightful and witty satire of gothic literature, and is a paradigm of both her future genius and current youthful exuberance. While I would argue that Austen by no means condemns the genre itself nor the reading of it, she does artfully illustrate the foolishness of expecting such romantic extremes in real life, and in her own writing acknowledges the conventions of the genre that render it so identifiable. Like Austen's later work, Northanger Abbey is full of social commentary and astute observations as she leads you through a year of the life of Catherine Morland - the increasingly romantic young woman who finds herself in several less-than-gothic conflicts.Northanger Abbey is as charming the second and third time as it was the first. As a fan of both Austen's body of work and the gothic genre, I can't help but find myself enamored with this particular work. I do not hesitate to give Northanger Abbey my highest rating."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming.

Northanger Abbey is often referred to as Jane Austen's \\"Gothic parody.\\"Catherine, a sweet, naive 17-year-old girl from a tiny rural farming village gets the chance to visit the big, bustling resort town of Bath England with chaperones.The first half of the book is the typical comedy of manners that Jane Austen writes. Young Catherine arrives and is introduced to new friends in Bath. The most notable of these new friends is new BFF, the scheming Isabella, a classic mean girl who is a phony and a user. Isabella's deviousness goes right over poor Catherines head. For a while Catherine gets led around by the nose and manipulated this way and that by Isabella until Catherine finally figures out how to out maneuver her.The second half of the book is where most of the Gothic satire is written.

Catherine Morland's visit to Bath is enlivened by friendship with the shallow Thorpes and the fascinating Tilneys. Invited to accompany Miss Tilney to their ancient home, Northanger Abbey, Catherine expects to wander crumbling, mysterious halls but finds a modern, comfortable residence. The dictatorial General is the fly in the ointment, oppressing Catherine as well as both of his children.This is an early Austen and it shows. Austen's oddly cynical attitude permeates this unusual tale, frequently contrasting what is actually happening with what would usually happen in a novel. The story is disjointed and wraps up in a hurry, as if she had run out of paper suddenly. But the portrayals of both innocent and calculating characters are dead-on, as only Austen can manage."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is more a review of the free Kindle version of this book than of the book itself.

To modern eyes the characters appear very tightly constrained in their actions, words, and even in their thoughts. Life in Bath was an artifice of social conduct designed to showcase breeding through demonstrations of social grace. Relatively minor infractions of these graces could, and did, bring disgrace and dishonor. Jane Austin portrays the resulting social tension with sensitivity and accuracy. The reader who fails to appreciate these delicate risks and the resulting precariousness of social status will also fail to follow the character development of the principal protagonists, and will find the novel dull. A disjoined second part of the novel is set in the country, in a great and ancient manor house. Our heroine is considerably awed by it, and never becomes comfortable as a house guest, despite the attentions of her love interest, Henry Tilney and his family. Indeed, her imagination is so active, that this dark segment of the book reads like an Edgar Allen Poe story. It is a side of Jane Austin which is not present in any other of her novels. Present, as always in Jane Austin, are the wonderful descriptions of carriages, horses, liverymen, and everything relating to horse-drawn transportation. Here the young Jane Austin shows the fascination with carriages which became a trademark of her writing. The ending, too, with its taunting unpredictability is a familiar feature for Austin readers, and which carries the tension straight through to the end. Alone, this novel would not have assured Austin her legacy. To me this novel appears to be a study for a subsequent Austin novel, Mansfield Park, which has a very similar basic plot, and where her thematic dimensionality and wordsmithing is perfected."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"In this novel Jane Austen lampoons the gothic romance -- the type of story in which weird things occur with accepted regularity, and nobody has anything but the most intense of emotions.Catherine, the heroine, longs to fall madly in love, so she does so. She visits the house of a friend, coincidentally the sister of her beloved. Northanger Abbey, with its medieval architecture and labyrinthine corridors, inspires Catherine to envision ghostly presences, long-hidden secrets, and hideous crimes kept locked behind closed doors.Of course, Catherine learns that reality is quite different from her grim imaginings. There are no mysteries inside the walls of Northanger Abbey. At the same time as she learns the truth about the abbey, Catherine discovers some realities of love. One is the realization that &quot;true love&quot; is less enigmatic than she had previously believed -- it springs from friendship and the belief that one will be loved in return.A readable, funny, and wise tale from the always practical, delightful Austen."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is by far my favorite book of Jane Austen's.

I enjoyed the indirect way she draws the characters of the devious Isabella and her money-hungry family. From a historian's viewpoint, the descriptions of vacationers in Bath and of the Abbey are fascinating."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Living a sheltered and quiet life in the small, peaceful village of Fullerton, Catherine Morland, at the ripe young age of seventeen, is in want of an adventure. Since she is fond of horrid Gothic novels, the ideal adventure for Catherine would be one with sinister characters, secret mysteries, and many Gothic horrors! Catherine does receive an adventure of sorts when the she is invited to travel to Bath with her wealthy neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Allen. Leaving her confined and quiet world behind, Catherine embarks upon a trip that will introduce her to many new acquaintances, test her understanding of human nature, and teach her that the real world is nothing like the fantasy world of novels...Out of all of Jane Austen's novels I find Northanger Abbey to be one of her wittiest. Between her poking fun at Gothic novels and her biting social criticism, I experienced many laugh out loud moments! Moreover, in reading this novel a second time, I gained new appreciation for Jane Austen's unabashed sarcasm and sharp tone which pour out from every page of this novel.In writing her first serious novel, Jane Austen focuses a great deal of page time on the subject of novels and heroines: (What is a heroine? Should people read novels?) I took pleasure in seeing the characters of this novel take part in enlightening debates and discussions of other novels whether it be a horror novel or history novel. In addition, I greatly enjoyed how warmly Jane Austen defends the reading and writing of novels in her narration and commentary.\\"Yes, novels; -- for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding -- joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it.\\" - The Narrator\\"'It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda;' or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.\\" - The NarratorCatherine Morland is an utterly delightful heroine! Some readers and critics may find Catherine to be an immature and inferior heroine, but I disagree. While it is true that Catherine is a little fanciful and young, I find her naivet&eacute; and ingenuousness to be endearing and engaging. In addition, Catherine's tendency to think the best of everyone reminds me a little of Jane Bennet from Pride and Prejudice. At the close of the novel, Catherine emerges as a perceptive and discerning young woman. I took pleasure in viewing the significant improvement in Catherine's understanding, growth and maturity throughout her adventures and experiences away from home.Northanger Abbey is a stellar masterpiece that clearly illustrates Jane Austen's great genius. This novel will be sure to divert and entertain Jane Austen admirers no matter how many times they have previously read it before. One of the great things about rereading a novel by Jane Austen is that it will be never a dull experience; the brilliance of her writing will forever be discovered and rediscovered with each reading.Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I have seen numerous movies of other Jane Austen books, so this was nice to not know the story before reading it. You can tell that she wrote this earlier, becuase it didn't have the same flow that her other books had. The end was very hurried, almost as if it was finished hastily to get it published. Other than that, it was really good and still better than most books I read. I wish there were more Jane Austen books in the world."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"\\"The building is haunted\\" or \\"There's treasure buried in the backyard\\" are a couple things you might tell a child to make an ordinary event like a wedding rehearsal or dinner at the neighbor's more exciting and interesting. The novel's protagonist, Catherine, does the same thing; only she's telling the stories to herself! After reading a Gothic novel (which this book is, in turn, designed to parody) Catherine convinces herself that the abbey she's staying at houses a dark secret, that her her host murdered his wife nine years ago. As a result she takes on the role of detective and tries to solve the case. Those who are looking for a strong female lead like some of Austen's other characters (i.e. Elizabeth Bennet) may be less than satisfied with Catherine, who sometimes acts more like a spoiled child than an adult. However, Catherine in endearing in her own right, and her efforts to make the \\"boring,\\" normal life of the abbey into an intrigue-filled adventure are entertaining and enjoyable to follow. This reader certainly felt nostalgic for childhood games of make-believe, at least. The male protagonist Henry also makes a great counterpart to Catherine, as the voice of reason (or sometimes of teasing) that balances Catherine's imagination and naivete. This novel leads the reader on a fun, nostalgic adventure with Catherine, while also demonstrating the dangers (however humorous) of confusing fiction with reality."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"When I read the words written by Jane Austen telling me that Catherine Morland had been in training to become a heroine I knew I was going to enjoy this novel. This book allows us a glimpse of Jane Austen as a younger woman, as a beginning novelist and as a woman with a lovely sense of humor. There isn't any denying that this book, then titled \\"Susan\\", was the first to be sold by Austen to a publisher. There it languished in some forgotten corner for thirteen years before she tried to get it back from a firm which had no intention of publishing it. Ultimately she had to borrow the money to buy her own book back. People can probably get involved in scholarly discussions as to whether or not any revisions were made to this book by Jane Austen before her death, but that's isn't what I'm interested in. I wanted to read this book because I just couldn't believe that Jane Austen had really written a book which I didn't like. At all! Thankfully, I proved myself to be both right and wrong. I completely and thoroughly enjoyed this book and am only sorry that I allowed film versions of the book to turn me away from actually reading what the author had created.Catherine Morland became a heroine for me to love and to sympathize with, while I watched her grow and mature. At the age of seventeen Catherine is quite young to be starring in her own novel but according to the times she lived in this was a perfectly respectable age for a young woman to become a wife and mother. Up until the time Catherine was fifteen she was the epitome of a tomboy, much preferring playing games outside to learning the skills to help her in her housekeeping and marriage. When she was around fifteen she discovered novels. It was the most delightful thing to read Jane Austen's words in defense of her heroine reading novels and particularly Gothic novels. The information contained within those books colored so much of Catherine's thinking and when she is given the opportunity of having a prolonged stay in Bath with close friends and neighbors she is ecstatic. Mr and Mrs Allen will become the surrogate parents of this young woman for their stay and upon arrival Mrs Allen continually bemoans the fact that she knows nobody in Bath, therefore she and Catherine are restricted as to who they can talk to. Very quickly Mrs Allen meets a former schoolmate, Mrs Thorpe, her son and daughters, and from then on Catherine can move in society with Isabella Thorpe and later her brother John Thorpe. One process leads to another and Catherine makes the acquaintance of Eleanor and Henry Tilney along with their father Colonel Tilney. Austen uses Catherine and her new friends to demonstrate the social limits and restrictions on young women of the time. She also illustrates how easily deceit can be camouflaged as friendship.My reading of this novel was enhanced greatly because I was sharing the experience with a friend. We discussed the novel from the viewpoint of our previous interest in the writings of Jane Austen. I must rank this book right up there with my other favorite novels now. Yes, there is melodrama. Yes, Catherine is a very young woman prone to being fooled by others. Thankfully it is also about Catherine conquering her fears caused by the melodrama by facing reality and Catherine learning to see the motives of other people more clearly.This novel is Jane Austen at her most natural, at least it seems that way to me. She is obviously having fun with this writing, she also seems to genuinely like her heroine and the other \\"good\\" characters in the book and shows us the deceitful characters we all need to recognize and avoid. Austen seems young in thought and spirit in this writing. The prose is light and very readable. It is also a relatively short novel. I would have liked for it to be longer (of course!) but specifically because I would have liked for some of the characters, even major characters, to have been presented in fuller form. The only portion I'm definitely a little disappointed with happens in the final chapter, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. Who knows, you might not have the same reaction at all. I do highly recommend this novel as a truly great early novel from a writer who was to go on to a fame which probably would have truly surprised her. This Penguin Classic edition is a wonderful version of this novel. It contains much information aside from the novel which was a great help for me while I was reading. The Notes from each chapter by Marilyn Butler, Exeter College, Oxford, were invaluable in keeping me in the time frame of what was happening in Austen's world when this book was written. I also highly recommend this specific edition of Northanger Abbey."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"A man reading Jane Austen is a bit like a woman watching an old Chicago Bull's title series - you don't want to do it at first, you pretty much knows how it ends, but it is surprisingly captivating. With that being said, this is an enjoyable book with a predictable ending but an interesting path. The extensive scenes in Bath are intrinsically rewarding due to their humor and the knowledge that girlish precociousness has made it through to the 21st century pretty much intact. For the 99.99% of the world's population unfamiliar with 2nd and 3rd tier 18th century Gothic novels, the end notes to this edition are required to understand the parody.Plotline: girl goes to Bath, girl meets first 'friend' and then a true friend, girl visits big scary Abbey only to find out it is not actually the subject of her juvenile fantasy stemming from Gothic romances, girl falls in love, love is condemned, love conquers all. The narrative is very funny in parts, and always lively. One traditional criticism that holds true in my eyes is the uneven split between the first 3/4 (Bath) and the last 1/4 (the Abbey). Other than that, I have to say it is probably better than 75-80% of what modern writers can put out on their best day."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Jane Austen has created an immortal being in the heroine of the book: Catherine Morland.

Some authors try to make a big deal about how special their main character is, or about how extraordinary things can happen to their normal character. But Austen makes it clear that, most of the time, ordinary stuff happens to ordinary people, no matter how much they wish for excitement and adventure. Though the plot and other characters are not as well-developed as in other Austen novels, this is no reason to give it fewer stars as Austen is far better than most authors even when she herself is \\"mediocre\\". I found this book to be smart, sassy, and lighthearted. But the humor is very, very subtle. You need to be either very quick on the uptake or have a cynical mind to catch some of it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"The heroine in this novel is Catherine Morland, who is just an average girl with straightforward manners and not an ounce of pretension; yet, she has an outrageously vivid imagination. This is cleverly and Austen-intended, I believe, to purposely deviate from the conventional heroines of the times.The story begins with Catherine joining a friend of the family, Mrs. Allen, for a vacation at her home in Bath. Her days are filled with socializing, taking walks and especially spending time at the \`Pump- room', where she meets the rather hard-edged Henry Tilney. Catherine's simple, yet direct and opinionated responses and approaches in conversation lead her to distancing Henry for a while.Realizing that she has feelings for him, Catherine begins to wish she could see Henry again and does everything possible for that to happen. Meanwhile she befriends Isabella Thorpe who shares her passion for books and poetry. As the two become inseparable, Catherine feels close enough to Isabella to tell her all about her feelings for Henry Tilney...In fulfilling her dreams of being with Henry, Catherine's journey evolves through a fiasco of events revealing true personalities, feelings and deceptions. Other important characters that help bring this about involve John Thorpe, Isabella's brother, who is full of mischief and schemes. As well, Catherine's brother James, is one who has a love-story of his own to mourn over as his sister begins to put all pieces of the puzzle together. Just to add to life's intricacies, Henry and Catherine become at odds about a dilemma, caused mainly by Catherine's imagination. The couple's difficulties do not stop there as problems get compounded by family misunderstandings.Confusion of events? You bet. This story is filled with the ups-and downs of young love, anxious situations and very comical moments. Catherine was a girl before her times, which makes situations heartening as well as endearing and perfectly understandable. I gasped, laughed and truly enjoyed this Jane Austen novel. It's the perfect introduction to the author's subsequent masterpieces."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I recently read Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and thought it was a little disappointing and full of annoying characters. Pride & Prejudice will always be my favorite, but I found Northanger Abbey superior to almost all of Jane Austen's novels, except P&P; and Persuasion.In this novel, seventeen year old Catherine Morland is invited to visit Bath with her neighbors, the wealthy Mr and Mrs Allen. Catherine is eager to attend balls and be introduced to society. In Bath Catherine makes friends with Isabella Thorpe, who is very quick to befriend Catherine and can hardly bear to be separated from her new friend. Isabella's brother, John Thorpe, always goes out of his way to befriend Catherine and press the friendship between Catherine and Isabella.Trouble brews when Catherine meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, the children of a wealthy and distinguished General. Catherine is immediately attracted to Henry and desperately hopes to further their friendship, especially by befriending his sister, Eleanor. There is a glitch in Catherine's plan, her friend, Miss Thorpe tries, to discourage the friendship and with the assistance of her brother, goes out of her way to sabotage the friendship between Catherine and the Tilneys.The name of the novel, Northanger Abbey, refers to the Tilney home, where Catherine is invited to join her new friends. Catherine, who is an avid reader of Gothic novels, is in awe of all the history and possible mysteries lurking in the historic abbey. Catherine's love of Gothic novels, especially The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe, convince her that something mysterious occured at Northanger Abbey. When Catherine sees the General behave in a strange manner when his deceased wife is mentioned, and when he suddenly appears just as Eleanor is about to show Catherine Mrs Tilney's former bedroom, Catherine convinces herself that something is amiss. Perhaps the General murdered his wife or worse, perhaps she is imprisoned somewhere in the abbey!Northanger Abbey is a parody of the Gothic novel. Catherine is so busy imaging the murder or imprisonment of Mrs Tilney, that she doesn't realize the joke is on her! Some people may not think that Northanger Abbey is Austen's best novel, but I thought it was absolutely charming and amusing. Definitely Jane Austen's best lighthearted novel."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I had not thought of Austen as a satirist prior to reading Northanger Abbey. Within the first chapter the author addresses what the book is not - a gothic romance, thought it is fashioned similarly, and named similarly. Austen points out the heroine's father did not lock up his daughters, there was no lover of unknown origin, (something Emily Bronte uses years later in Wuthering Heights), and the heroine's mother does not warn her of the seduction of barons. Rather, when the teenage heroine, Catherine Morland, leaves for a resort town to stay with neighbors, everything is done \\"with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life...\\" 6. With the contrasts Austen makes to the typical gothic romance she conveys the message that life is not like the popular novel.Austen makes some straight forward comments in Northanger Abbey, without irony. Throughout the book she comments on novels, a rather new and popular form in the late 18th century. The novel, evidently, was looked down on, but was also a guilty pleasure. A person would suggest reading Milton or Pope or Addison, but would condemn books by Anne Radcliffe. Even novelists would do this. But Austen, as narrator, would not. She does, however, illustrate problems for those who read such novels, as the character Catherine experiences. Catherine is disappointed that Northanger Abbey isn't ancient nor dark nor in ruins. She is terribly mistaken in her perception of General Tilney, suspecting he has imprisoned his wife in the Abbey, based on what she had read in novels. I'm not sure if all statements of judgment are ironic or not.The satire is strong only in a few chapters of the book. Otherwise it is something of the standard Austen work, with characters pairing up according to society's expectations, then finding out they are mismatched. Though no one may expect Catherine to be a heroine, she is a very good character, practical, sociable, yet refraining from coquetry, earnest. The book tells of her maturation through the age of courtship."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"When it comes to Kindle publications, a review of the readability of the text really is much more critical than of the work itself. There are plenty of reviews of this book out there. But Kindle versions of any classic work are a dime a dozen, and they vary greatly.This version (Candlelight Press or publications or whatever it is) looks fine. Nothing special, nothing fantastic, but it gets the job done, the formatting is fine, and it's a buck.The end."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"\\"Northanger Abbey\\" has been my favorite novel since I first read it at 15, six years ago. I haven't written a review of it until now because I hesitated to ascend to such presumption. I, critique the great Miss Austen? Unthinkable! Yet I find I must put in my own glowing praise for this delightful novel.As many other reviewers have said, this is not Austen's most polished or refined work; it is not her greatest in terms of literary merit, scope or influence; it is not even her wittiest novel. But I think it is her cleverest work. The entire novel is a joke, and knows it. The narrator is charmingly self-conscious, as is the book itself. It is a novel that simultaneously parodies and praises novels.I must also mention that the heroine, Catherine Morland, is unique from every other Austen heroine in that her development as a character is solely for personal growth; she doesn't have to change or refine her mind or her character to be worthy of Henry Tilney because she already deserves her hero even before her self-actualization. She does not have to learn to be humble or attentive or how to conduct herself; she only has to learn how to use her own good judgment, and to trust it."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This is a wonderful spoof of the Gothic novels that were popular at the time. Jane had such a wicked sense of humor! And this is a particularly nice edition of the book - the type is easy on the eyes - not like the tiny type in some versions!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Cathrine, the main character, is a great reader of dramatic Gothic novels. so her life is written like a Gothic novel. she is always thinking dramatic things are going on, like in the books she reads, and is so preoccupied with her own thoughts that she seems to be missing just living life. interesting things do happen in her life, travel, engagements, broken engagements, balls, etc. but she really is too busy looking for foreboding and giving everything a Gothic twist that, when all events turn out to be perfectly normal her ideas had only served to make the incidents funnier."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Although the introduction does give away the entire story, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the adventures of naive Catherine Morland. The book is full of a cast of wonderful characters who you get to understand better not only from the author's descriptions, but also from their candid dialogues. I didn't put the book down until I had read it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Northanger Abbey was Jane Austen's first novel, even though it wasn't published until after she died. While a delightful story, it doesn't quite measure up to Austen's other works. Catherine Morland, 17 and completely innocent, is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with some family friends. Bath, a vacation hotspot in 19th century England, is filled with fashions and eligible young men and women, as well as parents looking to make an agreeable match. Catherine has never left her small village and is accustomed to being surrrounded by people who love her, and so is vulnerable to the tricks and games played by Isabella Thorpe and her brother John. Isabella has formed an attachment to Catherine's older brother James, and John attempts a similar relationship with Catherine. But our dear Catherine has developed feelings for Mr. Tilney. While Mr. Tilney shows the sparkling wit that Mr. Darcy will later become known for, much of the book is told through the narrator's voice which is awkward at times. It wasn't my favorite of Austen's books, that would be Pride and Prejudice, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I am making my way through all of Austen's book, and thiswas the third after Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.This was the first of her novels and the last one to be published.However, her writing is most of the time almost as sharp as inthe later novels, and the plot will also not be too much of asurprise. The novel is, however, not at the level of the previuslymentioned two, perhaps mainly because the heroine is somewhatdim, although likeable. The conversations between Mr. Darcyand Mrs. Bennet are those of equals. However, it is sometimespainfully obvious in the exchanges between Henry and Katherinethat it is Henry who is the intelectually superior. Although theplot rambles a bit here and there, this is still a very good read,and Austen's wit shines through on a number of occasions."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"This book was okay, but the storyline was weak wrt the protagonist Catherine. I felt zero compatibility, or affection or passion between her and Mr. Tilney, so much so that their engagement at the end seemed forced and unbelievable. I didn't even bother to read the last few pages, I was pretty much done with the book after that. The only characters I actually endeared to were the Thorpe siblings, John and Isabella. I love a good book and this just was not up to par."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Not one of Jane Austin's best works. Feels rushed, lack of story. It builds and builds and then just deflates, a little abruptly. Left me wondering where the other half of the story is."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"It's not surprising that \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is Jane Austen's first novel. It's not quite pulled together as smoothly as her more famous and well-regarded works, and the dialogue is stilted at times. However, the novel is still enjoyable enough that it's worth investing the time to read its mere 200 pages.Beginning novelists are told to \\"write what you know,\\" and a young Jane Austen followed that advice. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" tells the tale of a 17-year-old girl (Catherine) of a respectable family that lives in the countryside. Catherine is given her first real opportunity to see life beyond her rural village when she's asked to accompany an older couple on a six-week trip to Bath. Once there, Catherine is introduced to \\"society,\\" and her naive, straightforward way of looking at the actions and words of society people provides for satire and criticism of the pretensions of upper-crust life at the time.Many things are skewered, such as the idleness of time spent at bath, the lemming-like surges of people to the same places at the same time, and the rigid rules for manners and conduct that must be learned. But perhaps the thing most satirized is women. For example, Catherine's benefactor, Mrs. Allen, spends all of her time shopping for clothes and marking every occasion by what she and others are wearing. Also, Catherine's first Bath acquaintance, Isabella, constantly says one thing when she means the exact opposite and is always on the lookout for a new angle. (Remarkable how those traits continue today to be the primary cliches about how women spend their free time.)Meanwhile, Catherine stands in opposition to those two foolish women. Though not a beauty, she attracts the attention of two men. One is Isabella's brother John, who is a ridiculously boastful ass. Catherine quickly sees through his bluster. The other, Mr. Tilney, is a charmer who turns out to be a genuine gentleman. Things ultimately work out for Catherine and Mr. Tilney to live happily ever after, despite the machinations of John and some misunderstandings that involve Isabella, as well as Catherine's brother, and Tilney's sister Eleanor.Other reviewers have said that the book satirizes the gothic romances that were popular at the time, and I guess that critique is true. Austen goes to great pains to humorously distinguish the plot of her book from the intensity of those novels, and she makes it clear that her book is rooted in reality, not the supernatural realm that is the domain of the gothic.However, I detected a great deal of respect for those types of books. The narrator does attack gothic novels, and Austen also puts criticisms into the mouths of some of the characters. But she allows her heroine Catherine to defend those books because they: 1) Are enjoyable; and 2) Provide insights into human nature that are not readily available in non-fiction books. Given that the heroine Catherine is a devotee of gothic novels and that she triumphs in the end, in part because she uses the wisdom of those novels to understand people's motivations, I think that Austen is gentler towards popular fiction than many reviewers suggest. Isabella and Mr. Tilney, the other two favored characters, also declare their enjoyment of popular novels. If anything, I think Austen is defending the novels as providing some understanding about human nature, even while mostly serving as diversions for women wealthy enough to have leisure to read."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"\\"Northanger Abbey\\" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance. But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality. The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story. That fiction is just that.Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends. She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home - Northanger Abbey. Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance). The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite. They are wealthy \\"English Christians.\\"There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners. Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.I would recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"What is there to say.... Jane Austin was the most dedicated writer of her time. Inclusive of love triangles, mystery, intrigue and of course deceit. For an author writing in the 1800's she is just simply amazing. I will warn readers to give yourself a chance to decifer the \\"language of the day\\". It is well worth the effort because the result is a series of books that are unrelated to each other but formidable and of the out-most literary content. Enjoy every word I know I did!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"\\"Northanger Abbey\\" was apparently written early in Jane Austen's career, but not released until after her death; it is unclear that she ever quite finished it. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a broad parody of the gothic novels that were popular in her day, but Austen manages to work in some good characters, plot twists and a rather touching schoolgirl romance.As the story opens, the young and naive Catherine Morland is invited to visit the resort city of Bath with some family friends. In Bath, Catherine soon falls into fast company. Before any real harm can be done to her reputation, she meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, respectable brother and sister, who are however members of the dangerous Tilney clan. Catherine is invited to visit the Tilney family estate of Northanger Abbey, where she finds that a gothic novel has somehow come to life around her...\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is perhaps not Jane Austen's best work, but it is a fun read and an example of her writing range.

BORING!!!!! This book is extremely overrated. The novel is also hard to follow at times since Jane Austen jumps from one time frame to another time a lot longer down the road in only one sentence. If your teacher or professor makes you read this book, then good luck. I would pass on this book if you are looking for an intellectual stimulation or just plain old good story."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Austen's supposed satire of the gothic novel is tangled up with what would have been the finest fluff of effeminate fiction -- had anyone else written it. Austen, however, cannot resist sinking her sharp little claws into naivete, romance, and (of course, this IS Jane Austen) men. I will say, it is the only book of hers that I have ever been able to finish.No one would want to be quite as stupid as poor Catherine, but we've all been naive. Personally, I envy Catherine the ability to be so pure and trusting with the object of her affection -- as jaded and overeducated a modern woman as I am, I find myself reading the story with no feeling so strong as a wish that (after closely and cynically examining him) I could meet a man with whom I felt free to admire his perfections and flaws as the finest in the world! (I'm sure there's one out there.) I'm sure Miss Austen would find this proof that I am as contemptibly stupid as Catherine, but when we kill our inner innocent completely, then we have made life unworth living, and I pity all the people with whom we live and work.The book would be much better if it didn't dawdle with condemning feminine sweetness &amp; innocence &amp; male behavior's apparently universal (to Austen) unacceptability, particularly in tarring them all with the same brush. It would be far better if bereft of the perfunctorily &quot;happy ending&quot; which is treated in such a way that love and marriage wind up reeking of as much of Austen's contempt to at least the same degree as Mrs. Radcliffe's literary crimes.If you want to see this story the way it should be, the way it's funny, check out the movie (an episode of Masterpiece Theater). If you want to slurp latte in a windowless cafe and paint your nails black, buy the whole Jane Austen collection!"},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"If you've read Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, or any of the Victorian gothic novels and thought that the authors overdid it a bit, you'll love this.

The heroine not only had a pitifully inconsequential childhood, but couldn't seem to find any dark secrets or mystical adventures."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Very funny in typical Austin fashion. A must read for any Jane Austin fan. It is a bit difficult to follow the characters and the relationships at first; Once you get to know who the characters are it is easy to appreciate them and their interactions. Austin's version of the Gothic novel.The Longman edition is very helpful in setting the context for the work. Being relatively new to Austin it was valuable for me to understand the historical setting and read the examples of contemporary authors that this edition provides. I highly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with the life and times of this period."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"In the first chapter of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Jane Austen introduces Catherine Morland and pretends to apologize for having such an unromantic heroine. In the next few chapters, Catherine appears to live up to her creator's apology, while the author appears to forget all about telling us about the abbey for which her novel is named.The presence of the two shockingly audacious and impudent Thorpes--John and Isabella--almost makes up for this. Never did I want to slap and/or kick two fictional characters more. The ways in which they try to foil Catherine's hope of romance with Henry Tilney--and arrange a marriage between the artful Isabella and Catherine's innocent, unsuspecting brother--are enough to make readers gnash their teeth. Ironically, the scenes with the charming Henry and his kind sister Eleanor ramble along in comparison to the explosive scenes &quot;graced&quot; by the outrageous Thorpes.I liked the last twelve chapters better. Actually set in Northanger Abbey, they are a hilarious satire of the nineteenth century Gothic novel. Catherine stumbles into misadventure after misadventure (if I may be so generous as to call them such), thanks to her wild imagination and voracious novel-reading. It is wonderful to be caught in the excitement of a (pseudo) Gothic mystery that readers know is not real, but that they understand _could_ be real. It's the excitement of telling ghost stories around a campfire then trying to get to sleep. Everyone believes that anything could happen, though anything rarely does. It's nice, safe, thrilling fun.In my opinion, Jane Austen was having so much fun herself, in writing these scenes, that she did not sufficiently develop the romance between Catherine and Henry. They have few scenes together and Henry's character is too agreeable to be as interesting as John Thorpe's--or even General Tilney's. (Jane Austen should have apologized for him instead of for Catherine. Henry Tilney is more a Mr. Bingley than a Mr. Darcy.)Despite this, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; has the expected happy romantic ending--with the author still giving cheeky asides to the reader. I'd still recommend this book . . . but only after &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, of course."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I was not too happy with this seller.

Is it a popular piece of literature or one that is lucky enough to stand the test of time? Maybe it is one written by a famous author and all his or her works become classics. I wonder these questions as I finish reading Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey.It has been many years since I've read any of Ms. Austen's work. I never read Northanger Abbey until I joined a book club that was reading it. I was thrilled. I'm to a point in my life where I'm revisiting all the books I hated in school or managed to avoid. I'm discovering that I'm enjoying most of them.Northanger Abbey proved to a hard read for me. I couldn't understand why until I really thought about it. I was so used to contemporary writing that reading a piece of English literature from more than a hundred years ago proved difficult for me. The plot seemed to drag and become nonexistent. I was truly disappointed. The story could have written in a quarter of the pages and delivered with a bigger punch.I know that all the Austen fans will be calling for my head. Truly, I tried. I don't think less of Ms. Austen. In fact, have another book of hers lined up to read. It was this one in particular that did not trip my trigger.If you want to read more of the classics and are just getting started, you might want to put this novel off and read some of the others. You might love it. You might hate it. I would put this in the category of a back-burner classic to read.This was a public domain book and came with quite a few formatting and editing issues. It did not detract too much from the reading. For free, I couldn't complain about the issues.Note: I purchased this book with my own funds."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"Ah, Northanger Abbey, without a doubt my least favorite Jane Austen novel. For the longest time I thought Sense and Sensibility was the worst, until I reread them all last year and wondered just what the hell I was thinking all those years.Don't get me wrong, I think NA is really funny and I absolutely adore Henry Tilney (one of my top 3 Austen heroes!) but compared to her others, this novel is weak. It was her first novel sold to a publisher, in 1803, under the title Susan. For some reason, the publisher sat on it for years until her brother bought it back. I don't think it was revised at all before she died- it was published posthumously with Persuasion. It's very different in tone from all her other novels. It still shows glimpses of her wit and the dramatic ironies and everything, but it's closer to a spoof of the popular Gothic novels of the day than anything else. The romance is pretty lacking (again, spoofing the Gothic novels)- Henry only falls for Catherine because he realized she loved him!I don't want anyone to think I don't like this book- I do! It has comedy in spades. It just lacks the depth of all her other works."},{"Title":"Northanger abbey: A novel","review":"I was mildly amused at first, but as the novel bogged down halfway through, I couldn't help but wonder if there was ever going to be an ending? What trivial and boring lives Austen satirized. Yes, this is satire, but it is not high satire. It's barely noticeable satire. I finally put the book aside, not even caring if the heroine ever gets the man who makes her heart thrill, or any man at all."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A portrayal of the glamour and superficiality of the Roaring \`20s, The Great Gatsby focuses on the tragic love story between millionaire Jay Gatsby and young beauty Daisy Buchanan. Narrated by Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, the first half of the tale traces Gatsby's past--how he met Daisy, left to serve overseas, and how she married harsh but practical Tom Buchanan in the meantime. The book traces this event as the inspiration for Gatsby's wealth: we witness his numerous, lavish parties thrown in vain attempt to attract the attention of Daisy, who lives in a different sector of New York. He resents the fact that Daisy feared marrying him due to his financial status. We learn that he obtains his money through shady means, thus underscoring the values of a goal-oriented society. Gatsby, with the help of Nick, is eventually reunited with Daisy, yet Tom grows suspicious of their close relationship, leading to Gatsby's tragic demise.Throughout the novel, the reader sees the extravagance and excessiveness of Gatsby through his reckless lifestyle, yet as we look closer we see a certain emptiness pervading it. For example, although he lives in a gigantic mansion, only a few people live with him. At his funeral, only four people show up, and Daisy is not included in that number.F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby in order to illustrate the American dream as a vain, empty journey without progress, exposing the tragic flaws of an achievement-oriented society. Fitzgerald is essentially criticizing society's tendency to concentrate on the goals, rather than the new experiences and learning we ought to gain from the journey. Thus, he asserts that the entire point of the American dream--freedom, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness--has been lost to the new cynicism, extravagance, and greed that now characterize it. Gatsby, though a seemingly friendly and gracious individual, undergoes his downfall due to his lack of integrity in his pursuit of wealth.We can see that The Great Gatsby mirrors Fitzgerald's own tragic love story with his lover, Zelda. In his state of disillusionment after losing Zelda, Fitzgerald wrote the book in order to emphasize the decline of the American dream; Gatsby's willingness to cheat and swindle his way to riches marks a shift in the American dream in the 1920s from integrity and individualism to extravagance and greed. Though he tried to hide his past from Daisy, it eventually caught up to him, establishing another of the book's themes: the inescapability of the past.Although this novel does not make for the most entertaining or action-packed read, I completely recommend it to everyone. The characters, in truth, are not at all likeable, yet this is exactly what Fitzgerald was aiming for: flawed individuals. From first-hand accounts, he has tremendous insight into the faults of humans in a goal-oriented society. There is also abundant symbolism, allowing for a very in-depth analysis of the novel's purposes. I advise any potential readers to fully chew and digest this novel for full enjoyment, as it is no hollow work."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In a world that celebrates capitalism to a T, The Great Gatsby brought me back to the negative aspects of a world that celebrates spending at the cost of meaningful relationships. Not only is this story well-written, it is also fundamentally relevant. In a nation where the gap between the rich and the poor slowly, but steadily grows, a book for the twenties is as equally important for today.Nick Carraway is a disillusioned banker who introduces the story in a generally negative tone. The reader finds out why as we are introduced to the one, the only, Jay Gatsby. This story is completely tragic, as it explores the moral gaps between the old wealth, the new wealth, and the poverty. Daisy and Tom represent all of a conservative society that looks down at everything from the new wealth (aka Gatsby) all the way to the financially strapped characters, and I leave the rest for you to sort out.It's an extraordinary novel and it is the best novel that shows us today how the twenties represented the major dilemmas of consumerism and its detrimental effects."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel demonstrates the importance of creating one's own happiness and not relying on material things to generate that. Gatsby believed that by becoming rich he could solve all his problems, but that only made him more somber with his already tainted life.Gatsby had been living a tough life of rejection and decided to turn to the one thing he thought would help--money--and poured his life's ambitions into procuring that. He became so dependent on this solution that he would go to any means necessary to become rich. Gatsby would devote the next five years of his life to cheating and scheming his way to the top. He began illegal drug sales to generate more profit. His riches were gained by no honest means and represent a life of lying and shortcuts. That is no way to go about happiness. Happiness can only be achieved if one actually makes it for themselves. They cannot rely on material possessions to create that for them. Being truly happy takes effort, and that is something Gatsby does not know how to give. Taking the easy way out will never lead to any blissful ending.Gatsby has to learn that lesson the hard way as his riches begin to worsen his life, not better it, and people take advantage of him and only want him for his money. Gatsby feels lonely in this world as he begins his new life as an elite \\"business man\\" so he invites people over to his house to enjoy his money with him. He soon realizes that spending time and money on strangers does not make him any better off than before his riches. His money can only make others happy, not himself. Those people who he begins to believe are his friends do not care about him in the least bit; they only want him so that they can enjoy the same luxuries as he does. These people that spend all hours of the night at Gatsby's house do not appreciate him enough to come to his own funeral. No one cares about him except his father and neighbor. Having money does not make Gatsby happy and it will not make any one else happy. The only thing that warrants true happiness is having people who love and care about each other and that will not forget their true friends when they need them the most."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Okay, I'm guessing if you're reading this review, you're a teenager as well, and have to read it for school, or you are an adult curious to see other perspectives of a hated or treasured novel.

One part trenchant social commentary, one part Dominick Dunne-like pot boiler, it's a rich, creamy, yet damning work you can savor page after page, perhaps the most taut piece of fiction ever written. Five Stars for language.The expositions on past as shaky prologue to future and of holding onto dreams too long until they inevitably go up in smoke, of materialism and greed, of class and of postwar disillusion - we've seen these elsewhere, sometimes told better.Fitzgerald's close seems an overly harsh indictment of The American Dream, obviously forged from the many unsympathetic characters of his story and the zeitgeist of the period. It does little to suggest that those who eschew the excesses that litter the landscape of Gatsby's world may be able to successfully build on their pasts and create a successful future - meeting and marrying a spouse grounded in Midwestern virtues, raising well-adjusted children, finding more intrinsic value in honest work, and for the most part looking back on their past with general contentedness.Five stars for exquisite storytelling; four stars for a period piece about classism and excess that will exist as long as civilization does."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I re-read this book for a book club, being ~20 years since I read it in high school. It was much better reading it as an adult, as one generally has a much better perspective on answering/understanding concepts of lust vs. love, desire/drive for material aquisitions and what importance it has in life. There are multitudes of discussion questions regarding this novel available on the internet, worth considering. I believe that our club's discussion of this book offered many different opinions, making it one our more intersting ones. Also, worth reading about F. Scott Fitzgerald's biography and seeing parallelisms between his life and the story. The book is relatively a quick read and maintains your interest. It is worth re-reading, particularly if it was something you read many a years ago."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can one lead a happy life while hoping to relive the past? F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the perils of optimism in The Great Gatsby, which points out that although optimism sustains one's drive for life, the hope of a bright future may be devastating as it often requires the need to revive one's past, a difficult task that often generates misery when one's memories cannot be recreated. Fitzgerald portrays this message through America's famous Jazz Age set in the 1920's, as Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, rises from poverty to become one of the richest men in a fabricated town, West Egg. Despite his new role in society, Gatsby fails to achieve the only dream he has- regaining his ex-lover, Daisy Buchanan's love. Despite the two lovers' past intimate relationship, Daisy represents society's artificiality as she dismisses Gatsby's love to retain her husband, Tom, and cling onto Tom's noble name. This allows her to automatically achieve a protective seal of respect in society, which comes with Tom's last name, and therefore, does not need to be earned through hard work. Gatsby's tragic ending symbolizes not only the frailty of America's desire for true happiness and social equality, as seen through the fact that even Gatsby's wealth cannot overcome society's critical view of his poor roots. Fitzgerald thus explores the deep meaning of life and society through his creation of Great Gatsby, a man great only because of his rise from poverty, but tragic and pathetic to the noble, who accept only those with \\"royal blood.\\" The Great Gatsby is a timeless literary achievement because of its skillful and universal observation of human nature, but may prove to be depressing to those who enjoy comedy and \\"happily ever after\\" endings, as Gatsby ends up being far from normal people's view of \\"great\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Laughter echoes into the chilly city air as a collection of musician delicately stroke their instrument to the beat of the party. Glasses click gently together, while men in black ties and women in luxurious dresses drown away life's problem under the elaborate mansion. In the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the story depicts the Jazz Age in the 1920s, while it revolves around the drama in the East and West Egg Village. Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, is hopelessly enchanted by the beautiful and married, Daisy Buchanan. Holding on to bittersweet memories, Gatsby hopes to rekindle the flame between them five years ago. As he desperately holds on to a lost dream, corruption and deception wiggles into the life of the upper classes.Set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald gives the reader a deeper understanding of the conditions and fast paced lifestyle of the Jazz Age. In a descriptive and easy to read manner, he guides the reader that one can have everything in the world, but true happiness lies within things that are not tangible. Masterfully Fitzgerald displays this through Jay Gatsby, whose obsession and only happiness lies blindly with the conceited Daisy. Without holding back, Fitzgerald explains the flawed nature that exists in every human being rich or poor. The story is filled with symbolism and unique imagery of the glamorous Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby is an instant classic and respectable piece of literature because of its refreshing viewpoint about the flawed American Dream, which illusion and chaos spur from."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, is definitely considered a classic for many reasons. The vivid details and outstanding descriptions of the setting are truly amazing. The major theme of this novel is the American dream which is portrayed with excellent hard evidence of the exact ear of the 1920's included.This has to be one of the greatest books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The plot flows which makes for easy reading, but is also very interesting which makes the book impossible to put down. I strongly suggest that every person make time to read this amazing piece of American literature. It is truly a work of art which has be studied for generations, and will continue to be studdied for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I think that this novel had a good plot line. There were quite a few parts though at which I got confused.If I did not have to read this book for a novel project in my Language Arts class, I highly doubt whether or not I would have gotten past the first chapter. The first seventy pages of the book were filled with so many details and so much information that I kept getting confused. Luckily, one of my friends, the one who recommended the book to me, was always able to answer my questions and explain things to me in a manner that I could comprehend. I feel that the book does not really begin to pick up and make any sense till page eighty or so. After that point though, I feel that the plot really picked up and became more interesting. I am one who watches soap operas, so it was a little bit of a resemblence.

Targic without being sad."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby's life plays out like a autobiography of F. Scott Fitzgerald himself because it is. The Great Gatsby is more authentic and wonderful because the author himself lived in the twenties. He wrote about what he knew and his finished product turned out to be a great contribution to American canon. The two settings contrast the other as the story moves along the sparkling East and West Eggs to a old run-down gas station. The setting is important as they show the power money and greed hold over people. Jay Gatsby is a &quot;new money&quot; millionaire that is in love and slightly obsessed with Daisy who rejected him years before because of his shabby upbringing. Gatsby, determined to be Daisy's &quot;gold-hatted lover&quot;, makes himself a fortune that his mysterious past helps him with. Gatsby throws elaborate parties(a reflection of the twenties) hoping that his beloved Daisy will come running back into his arms. The only problem is Daisy is married to the rich and jealous Tom Buchanan.The narrator Nick Carraway, Daisy's distant cousin, moves in next door to Gatsby and the inevitable happens: character's lives start to mingle and intertwine.There is no happy message and hardly anyone gets what they want at the end but I was entertained and moved by this book. It is a realistic story that has all the elements it takes to enjoy a book: jealousy, suspense, love and humor. And will you look at that: all before the days of major motion pictures. See, screenwriters don't make all this stuff up."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There is some excellent writing throughout this book. It's biggest problem is the lack depth to the characters and the relationship between them, particularly Daisy, Gatsby and the relationship between Jordan Baker and Nick, the narrator. In the last thirty five pages or so, the writing seems to take a turn for the worse. The end is just too incredible. Fitzgerald becomes maudlin and sometimes unintelligible. This book is more than anything evidence of the truly great things that Fitzgerald might have ascended to had he not been overcome by his horrendous alcolhism."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Kilianski blurb from December 2000 is extraordinary -- his admittedly &quot;Marxist&quot; perspective denies the novel eligibility as a great American novel because of the &quot;Socio-economic&quot; [sic] status of its characters. Conversely, this must mean that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is second only to Shakespeare. How sad. (He sounds like the Village Voice when it berated the movie &quot;Arthur&quot; for being a comedy about rich people.) The trouble with narrow schools of criticism is that they cease to be about the text and focus instead on their own dogmatic (or phlegmatic) view of the world. I suggest you just read the novel and make up your own mind. Bathe in Fitzgerald's descriptions (especially Nick's first sight of Daisy in the wind-blown room), the gradual unveiling of the truth about Gatsby, and the suspense and heartbreak of the last few chapters. (And avoid the Redford adaptation.)"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I usually do not enjoy reading but this book caught my attention a lot. In my opinion \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is not an outstanding novel but it is quite good. I would recommend this book for teenagers from 15 to 23 years old. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the best love stories I have ever read and it is also a suspense story. On the one hand we are encountered with the love between Gatsby and Daisy, which grows bigger as the story develops, and on the other hand we have Gatsby's secret; nobody really knows Gatsby but everybody enjoys his big parties. Once we find out why he organised them and why he surrounded himself with glitter, we admire him for his total dedication to his dream and for his endless search of love. Gatsby is a character with which we can easily identify because he is the embodiment of the American dream. in my opinion, the book shows how this dream will never came true because of careless and cruel people such as Tom Daisy and Jordan, who are materialistic. I would rate it with three stars because although the story is interesting the book is written in a very complex way. The only thing I would criticise about it is that the action does not start until the fourth chapter, which encouraged my reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"With flowing prose, Fitzgerald depicts through the simplest of plots the univervsal needs of every person. The success of this book does not simply lie in the fact that this author portrays the ideals of his time so well; applicable to today's society, it is the destruction of them as seen through the profound observations of the narrator that places this book among the elite. The impact of these observations is what highlights Fitzgerald's impressive skill. Not only does this author portray the historical pressures of society at the time, but he also interweaves advice through a simple plotline of love and greed. This advice does not act to accentuate the story, but to create it; it is the questioning of the push for the perfect life and what we define it as that allows this novel to stand alone. Read not for the sake of entertainment and strictly for the qualities of a good novel; look beyond the obvious into the social implications stated through the author's voice. Only then, will this novel become what it was intended to be - a helpful tool written to assist us in broadening our views on society.

Now I wonder what all the fuss is about - for the novel has been a major disappointment. If this is one of the pinnacles of the American literature - and I keep hearing it is - I shudder to think what some of the lower peaks must be.Whether I was prejudiced against the novel by its classical status, or sceptical about it because of the huge amount of praise conferred on it, or simply had too high expectations, is hard to say. But I surmise I might kinda exclude the first two possibilities - for there is a precedent for a classic which I was both prejudiced against and sceptical about, but which I enjoyed quite a lot and which made me an ardent fan of its author (or authoress, because I am speaking of Jane Austen and ''Pride and Prejudice''). As for the high expectations, if one doesn't have them about the classics, what is there to have them about? Certainly, no one is obliged to like any book under the classical label, but I certainly think everyone should give a good deal of time and attention to the classics. The fact that they were first published many decades ago and the reading public, generation after generation, has found them valuable enough to keep them in print is a good enough recommendation. It fills me with respect and awe; sadly, they are not always reflected in the works themselves. ''The Great Gatsby'', alas, only proved again what a wonderful series Penguin Popular Classics is: it gives me the excellent opportunity to acquire at a really cheap price classics that simply don't worth more. As far as I am concerned of course.To start with, the story is good enough for a mediocre novelette, but it is hardly remarkable, much less compelling, and surely unworthy of a novel: Gatsby is fooling around with an old girlfriend of his and that's just about all - until an ill-conceived and badly paced series of dramatic events lead the reader to a lurid end out of the blue. What is much worse than the inanity of the story - which is not so rare a thing after all - is the fact that it is simply very poorly written. It is well beyond me how such prose can be described as ''beautiful'', as I so often hear it described; to me it seems convoluted and laboured, ungraceful and heavy, from time to time bursting with affectation and odious sentimentality. The worst thing of all is that the florid, hideously purple language often completely parts with lucidity. Indeed there are moments when I am left perfectly at sea what at all happens or what the characters are talking about. Nor is the dialogue much better, though sometimes it is remarkably dramatic and meaningful. On the whole, the book certainly is readable, but I was neither entertained by it, nor sorry when I finished it. Nor do I have any intention of re-reading it - I do that only with books which have succeeded to give me a unique and valuable experience.As for the characters, they don't fare much better. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who shows some hints of depth, complexity and charm. One of the book's major flaws is that Nick is far more interesting a character than Gatsby himself. Certainly Mr Carraway doesn't suffer from modesty:''Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.''Well, neither with the other characters nor with his readers is he as honest as he wishes he would be, but at all events he tries really hard to be - which is highly commendable. We are given to understand that he is poor, so he naturally has nothing but scorn and contempt for the rich. This only makes him more acute observer, which in turn makes a fine combination with his sharp tongue. The sarcasm of Nick Carraway virtually pervades the whole story and leaves no doubt about his opinion of the wealthy. It is often not a little amusing but it is rather unfortunate that the narrator should harp on it so much; every third sentence it gets quite tedious indeed. Moreover, Mr Carraway is not exactly a skillful narrator: few times does he turn to Gatsby's past but he invariably fails to say much that is less confused than the numerous rumours flying over Gatsby's mansion; except that he didn't earn a single cent of his fabulous wealth but inherited it all - which only makes Gatsby less and less compelling, if that's possible.It is Nick Carraway, too, who is there to make some sense of Gatsby's otherwise perfectly incoherent behaviour and singularly boring character. The only sign of greatness that can be ascribed to Jay Gatsby, as far as I can see, is that he is an exception of the rule: much as Nick despises the rich strata of the society, and disapproves of the man who ''represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn'', he cannot help but being attracted to him. But what is this attraction founded on? That, I confess, remains a mystery to me. For Jay Gatsby is as boring a character as there ever was one. There is somebody there, perhaps some fascinating hint of contradictory nature as well, but we are never given anything more than lots of ''old sport'' stuff together with a strange mixture of an urbane, aloof host of the most glittering parties on the East coast of America and incoherent, infantile and devoid of simple common sense man who is head over heels in love with one Daisy. And who on earth is Daisy? Nothing more than a silly girl with one-track mind and affected manner that borders on the incredible. Her pathetic cries in the beginning ''Sophisticated -- God, I'm sophisticated!'' are just too ridiculous to be amusing. Nor is her husband, Tom Buchanan, any less dull and lacking anything that might be called appealing, though in general he is much better drawn; as a matter of fact, he is perhaps the most complete character in the novel after Nick Carraway which, in a way, makes Tom fascinating, if by no means likeable. Jordan Baker, with whom Nick had something of an affair, so sketchy and insubstantial that it might have been spared to the reader, together with Mr and Mrs Wilson, surprisingly shadowy characters given their crucial part in the story, only complete a list of dramatis personae more poorly presented than many a mediocre play can offer.I surmise what makes ''The Great Gatsby'' a classic is its vivid representation of the so called Jazz Age, term invented by Fitzgerald himself as I am given to understand. He is certainly at his best describing monstrously expensive parties full of monstrously wealthy people whose ultimate goal is to get perfectly drank and to talk the most stupendous crap one can possibly imagine. Nick's devastating tongue has a feast here all right. The emptiness and the decadence of an era in which one of the most popular waltzes could be named ''Three o'clock in the Morning'' is vividly described, with a degree of verisimilitude which Mr Fitzgerald should certainly be given credit for. But I have two rather simple questions: 1) is this Jazz Age, or whatever name one might wish to call it, worth the trouble to write and read whole novels about?; and 2) can the Jazz Age in this particular case, evocative as it is, compensate for uninteresting story, flat characters and indifferent narrative?This has been my first encounter with the work of Francis Scott Fitzgerald and I am not at all sure that it won't be the last one as well. For my part, despite charming moment here and there, the best thing about ''The Great Gatsby'' remains its short length. A classic it may well be. But certainly not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had heard a lot of great things about The Great Gatsby but never read it before and was eager to finally read it. It was well done and an easy read even after all this time.The tale is told by the neighbor of Gatsby. It is a twisted tale of adultery and adoration. Some say it is the quintessential American novel. Gatsby's neighbor tell us of Gatsby's quest to win a married woman's, Daisy's, heart. Daisy struggles with a husband who cheats on her with another woman and she married him for money. The whole tale ends in a tragedy not unlike a Greek play.The tale was an easy and quick read and fairly engaging. Fitzgerald does an excellent job describing the era and the surroundings, making everything easy for the reader to picture.The story quickly gets twisted and complicated with various characters involved with other characters that they aren't supposed to be with. The tragic ending is strangely ironic and suiting of all the selfish characters present.I can understand how some might root for Gatsby and Daisy and their supposed quest for true love; but personally I found all of the characters to be selfish, shallow and deserving of what they got in the end. This tale truly shows an era of American decadence.Overall a decent read and I am glad that I read this. I loved the ironic symmetry of the story, but didn't really enjoy any of the characters much. The story is paced well, has great description throughout, and is engaging. I wouldn't run out and read everything by Fitzgerald based on this book, but I enjoyed this book and am glad I can say I finally read this."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Well, I admit, I am let down. I concede that I am rating this from a scale of expectations; and on that scale, its rates only an okay. Like many, from time to time, I go back and pick up a \\"classic\\" to see what it is I missed the first time around. I was without a new read this particular weekend and picked up \\"The Great Gatsby\\" off of my daughter's required reading shelf of books from high school.Well, in comparison to other such deservedly vaunted works (\\"Moby Dick\\" is my second favorite book in a lifetime on such a re-reading), this one did not measure up. It was not just the ennui (although it was primarily that) that seemed to envelop one and all the characters (sparing only Nick, who I am guessing was the author's own self reflecting on his world), there also seemed to be evidence of an odd lack of discipline in spots. There were a couple of passages where the author seemed to have forgotten in whose voice he was speaking. In others, time and space are confused.(And, its only a minor complaint that Fitzgerald can't seem to stop using the work \\"murmur\\" to describe virtually every other audible utterance. Was this intentional?; I am not sure but it did strike me a bit lazy).But my biggest complaint was the lack of any inspirational bottom. Perhaps, indeed this was Fitzgerald's own experience, and I would have to guess in many ways it must have been. But while I have read many a novel full of misanthropes and other desperate souls, this is one of the few that are thought of as \\"great\\" in which virtually everyone seems to be lost or desperate, or, as to most of them, just so plain self-orbital, that one is left without some glimmer of hope. On reflection, aside from the pitiable Mr. Wilson, Jordan Baker (despite her tendency to lie and cheat) was perhaps the only character that elicited genuine empathy at the end of things- an insecure soul who had allowed herself to be finally vulnerable to her feelings for Nick only to be let down by his withdrawal from her, when he finally retreated from the ennui of the East. Only she seemed \\"human\\" in a way that one could understand or tolerate.A friend once laughed at me for describing Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" as a hopeful novel. Yet despite a post-apocalyptic world full of survivalist desperation, there was at its core a message of the hope of delivering a next generation into a world with the faintest glimmer of new awakening in it. In Gatsby, in contrast, the only child in the novel is revealed briefly as an ornament for her mother's parlor gathering, and then ushered away for her parents to get on with the party. And, the author ends the book with a despairing description of human hope as being washed away with the sands of time.I have to admit Fitzgerald could set a stage for dramatic, and sometimes emotionally gripping moments, although the scenes sometimes (too often it seemed) bordered on melodrama. The characters, were, for the most part, richly rendered and he was able, at times, to make them make me laugh. Indeed, the symbolism of the settings he described was wonderfully rendered. In these respects, I can admire the flourish of his writing.And as for my disappointment with the substance, that may well have been the product of a gifted writer (and that much is clear) working in that gilded age after the Industrial Revolution and before the Great Depression.BUT,\\"the great American novel\\" (of which there are many) should some, for this reader, offer some source of inspiration or at least enlightenment. In the end, this exquisitely written book left me feeling empty in the way that its well sated characters did after their summer season's tragic end."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a seriously awesome book. Quite simply, you must read it. I know you've heard it before: allow me to join in praising it.The first thing I'd like to point out is Fitzgerald's brilliant use of symbolism. The cars, the colors, various characters' glasses... these aren't just trivial things, you know. Pay close attention to them.Anyway, the next thing I'd like to discuss is the character of Gatsby himself. A very intriguing figure. In fact, he's a bit of an enigma to me in that I have no definite opinion on whether or not I admire him. My opinion on the other characters is clear-cut (I mostly dislike them, other than Nick - which I believe was Fitzgerald's intention, to portray the rich as shallow and irresponsible - another thing that comes off brilliantly). But Gatsby... I'm not sure on Gatsby. I have to salute him for sticking with his dream for so long, in spite of its hopelessness, but the ends of said dream would have resulted in disaster for all parties involved, and his motives would be questionable. Gatsby is charismatic, well-read, determined, and intelligent; he is also greedy, self-absorbed, and stuck in the past. In other words, very human. And that's the most intriguing part of his character: when the end comes, I am unsure whether or not I feel Gatsby deserved his fate. Something to ponder. I like books that make me think deeply, and this is one of them.As for Fitzgerald's language, let us say he has total mastery over it. I knew he was a phenomenal writer from reading a collection of his short stories before I picked up Gatsby, but nothing could prepare me for what this book would present. Fitzgerald was a very, very talented writer, and there's a fine reason why he is widely considered one of the best. Books don't get much better.As an attack on the fast, hard lifestyles of the wealthy (something Fitzgerald himself knew a lot about), and as a meditation on how time's passage can ruin lives, this is equally brilliant. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Every character is fully fleshed out, even seemingly (but only seemingly!) trivial characters like Old Owl Eyes; the symbolism is perfect, the language is stunning, and the book is just the right length. I can think of no criticisms."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gastby is honestly one of the greatest books out there these days. Despite the infamous spellin errors, Fitzgerald really pulls off a complicated relationship that truly reveals the true ideals and values of the new American Dream.Dedicated to his wife Zelda, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a quick compilation of his passion for her, pouring out every single rush of emotion from pen to paper. After Fitzgerald's rocky relationship with Zelda, he decided to embed his experience into a book replete with mistakes as a result of his burst of emotion and fervor.The Great Gatsby argues that even if an individual is determined enough to chase a dream to the ends of the earth by any means necessary, his social status would remain the unchanged. Left with no choice, Gatsby is forced to perform illegal actions, like bootlegging, in order to gain monetary success. With this wealth, Gatsby can successfully compete with Tom and win Daisy over. However, Daisy cares not only about the wealth of her husband, but also the reputation and social status. However, the only way Gatsby was able to obtain that much wealth in a short period of time was to bootleg, an illegal action that would lower anyone's social standing. In the hierarchy of society, an individual is rarely able to move up on the social ladder. Because Gatsby had to earn his wealth through illegal means, his reputation was thus undermined. Because his goal was to win Daisy's heart, he cared less about his appearance to his contemporaries and thus sacrificed his image for his goal. Despite his determination, he was unsuccessful in that he died before he could fully experience Daisy's love, ultimately coming up short.Even though he had gained the wealth he needed, his goals were eventually hindered and obstructed, as he died without his dear love. Because the story ends as a tragedy, Gatsby represents a low social standing individual who failed to reach his goal, despite his quick path to financial success. Though he came close, he still could not hold back the repercussions of a society, in which reputation mattered as much as wealth.I recommend this book, because it's ideas are intriguing and realistic and can potentionally happen to you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I never read this book in school but it is on my classics list so i read it.

Scott Fitzgerald has written a classical portrait of life in the 1920's in America. Nick Carraway narrates this tale from the sidlines more as a spectator rather than as a participant. Jay Gatsby, the main character in this engrossing tale of life among the party set of what has become known as the roaring twenties, is a somewhat vague shadow of a character especially when compared with the other richly portrayed personalities. Perhaps it a virtue of the book that Gatsby remain a mystery man to the reader. \\"Old sport\\" is a phrase overused ad nauseum and gives Gatsby a grating personal quirk that was off-putting to this reader. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of Fitzgerald to keep Gatsby from being a more sympathetic rather than tragic figure. This novel has become a standard literature piece in the college-level curriculum as it lends itself to many insights to the human condition."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While I was reading it about a month ago, The Great Gatsby seemed like a pointless story of spoiled rich people, too lazy to commit adultery successfully, let alone make a marriage or even romance work. There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early. The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is an average book with respect to everything: storyline, style, pace, and characters. I couldn't finish reading it even though it is a thin book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had heard about this book a long time ago and knew that it was supposed to be one of the great &quot;classics,&quot; but I hadn't ever actually gotten around to reading it. Well, recently a friend of mine reccommended it to me, saying that it was the best book he had ever read...so I finally decided to read it. After finishing it last night, I was left with one question, &quot;What was all the fuss about?&quot; It's alright, I suppose, but why it's considered a classic I have no idea. As a lover of history, I found it interesting as a commentary on the life and times of the 1920s, but at times I was left confused as to what was going on and found the plot line drab overall...There are some interesting ideas included, but they are very poorly developed. Also, there are notes included in the book about how Fitzgerald was poor with geography and made a lot of errors that had to be revised later on. If he couldn't even write a book on his own, why was it even published in the first place? Bah! I could take it or leave it, personally."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is just a book of idiotic ideals full of propaganda."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In The Great Gatsby, a book considered to be a true classic of American literature, F. Scott Fitzgerald examines the theme of aspiration in America during an era known as the Roaring Twenties. Jay Gatsby, the hero in Fitzgerald's novel, embodies every aspect of the American Dream, fancy houses, flashy cars, and glamorous parties. Yet, his attempt to obtain true love is the cause of his downfall. Fitzgerald uses this novel as a satirical attempt to unveil the truth behind this so-called glamorous time period. Although I felt that Fitzgerald was successful in creating an interesting plot, his execution causes the story to seem slow and it leaves his characters well underdeveloped.Fitzgerald uses this novel as an expression of his views of the nineteenth century. The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Fitzgerald uses Nick to interweave his characters, but according to Sashee \\"he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person,\\" which leaves the characters unfinished. Another reader, Shalom Freedman says \\"Fitzgerald's remarkable ability to create or capture an atmosphere, a feeling of time, of a special kind of American world.\\" Fitzgerald spends too much time creating a sense of place in his novel, that he has left my imagination wondering about the characters. Novels of tragedy are supposed to contain something that tears at the readers emotions and this novel failed to do that in many ways. In a sense the characters were extremely one dimensional and I am only able to grasp the surface of each characters personality. The deaths of Mr. Wilson, Myrtle Wilson, and Gatsby had no major effect on my feelings, because Fitzgerald did not shape the characters into memorable characters, that drew emotion from his audience.Another problem that I encountered was Fitzgerald's slow and dismal writing style. Fitzgerald's style focused on the details of every scene, for example when Fitzgerald lists the pages of \\"important people\\" that attend Gatsby's parties, he loses my attention. By adding unnecessary details to simple scenes throughout the story, Fitzgerald postpones both the climax and ending of the novel. These are two pivotal points for readers. Sashee finds that \\"although the plot might be fascinating enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring.\\" Fitzgerald's story contains minimal surprises, even the climax is hard to distinguish from the rest of the novel. Anticipating the ending might motivate some readers to plow through this novel, but they should not have to wait until the end of the book for it to become interesting. In contrast to what some may think, this novel is not a work that according to Freedman, \\"simply holds its readers in a very special charm and grace.\\"Fitzgerald allows readers insight to the atmosphere of the nineteenth century, as he captures \\"a feeling of time.\\" Yet, he fails to understand the concept... time. The Great Gatsby is a classic story of achievement and aspiration, but wordy pages, a slow climax, and ending make it a hard read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If you like wild parties and the exclusive nightlife you will love this book. Taking place in the giant city of New York a young bachelor named Nick Carraway finds his neighbor to be one of great wealth and mystery. He has never met his neighbor but there are always wild parties in the gigantic house next to his. One evening after returning from a small dinner party at his friends Tom and Daisy Buckhannon's house; Mr. Gatsby emerges from the shadows next door and greets Nick mysteriously.

One evening Gatsby confesses to Nick that he has loved Daisy Buckhannon for a long time. So Nick sets up a tea party with the two and, they fall in love behind Tom Buckhannon's back. That's only the beginning it gets much more interesting from there.Personally I didn't like this book, because its just not the type of book I like to read. I think that over all the entire book was interesting and had a good plot. However I couldn't familiarize myself with the characters. I didn't really understand were they were coming from or why they did certain things. For example I never understood why Mr. Gatsby threw big parties because he was always quite and no one really knew who he was or where he came from. Also I didn't like that the author only described the characters once. It was hard to get a mental picture of what the characters looked like. The author also introduces new characters more than halfway into the book and I didn't really know who they were. I started to get confused with the characters. For example the author introduces a man named Michaelis for about 15 pages and then he is gone from the book.

Hemmingway's remark that Fitzgerald wrote like the gossimer wings of a butterfly is completely accurate.

A good writer ought to tell a story that is interesting enough to spark a natural curiosity in the reader over its deeper implications. The Great Gatsby is a good example of this. Fitzgerald subtly interweves social commentary into a solid story, providing entertainment for the casual reader and enough material for the critical reader to keep himself occupied.I only had two problems with this book: First, Fitzgerald's drawn-out, boring writing style, and secondly, the novel's climax, which seemed a little hokey to me. Other than that the Great Gatsby is a very good novel that I would recommend to anyone who has the patience to sit through boring narration (thankfully the story wraps up in less than 200 pages)."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Lydette Lyn ConcordiaAmerican Literature IIMs. KroneMay 31, 2005Book ReviewType of Book: novelAuthor: F. Scot FitzgeraldTitle: The Great GatsbyPublished: 1925Type of Book: fictionTheme: differences between social classes and conflict with loveBackground Information: The author of this novel can greatly relate to one of the main characters. Like Jay Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald was ambitious when it came to women they wanted. They both had a sense of a rich lifestyle and they just had to be successful people.Content: Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, moves to New York during the summertime to learn about a bond business so he rents a house in West Egg. Jay Gatsby is his rich neighbor who always throws parties every Saturday night, but he does not really engage in them. All the main characters that are in a marriage either have a mistress or another significant other.Reactions: The book becomes very appealing because all the suspense builds up as you read. You would have to keep on reading to find out what really happens next. For example, there is a part in the novel where someone gets killed but the one who killed that person seems very unlikely of them. The book affected me in a few good way too. It is better to be honest in any relationship and try your best to express yourself in a decent manner. By having the ability to be mature when it comes to certain things, it helps you have a better understanding of different situations that have to be solved."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"First off, I greatly prefer genre (i.e. commercial) fiction to literary fiction, so this fact will no doubt negatively color this review.I found the author's lyricism commendable and uniquely his own, but as for the plot ... well ... I found it to be poorly structured and somewhat choppy. The characters are pretty well crafted for a short novel such as this, but you don't really become enthralled with any of them. When the murder occurs, you really don't care. Even when the individual is struck by the car, you kind of go &quot;Oh, wow, that's too bad,&quot; but nothing more is felt. And there are a few minor loose ends that are never resolved. I finished the book with a feeling of &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;Perhaps the big rush to get this into print was part of the reason for its shortcomings. I'm not sure. But I think it could have been vastly improved by the author had he been given the time and also the encouragement."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It was after seeing Modern Library's top 100 novels of the 20th century that I decided to read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (No. 2). However, I really don't see why this book has been so highly overrated. Maybe I got my hopes so high before starting to read it, or maybe it is only to Americans that this book apeals, being written in a period that historically has been important to them. Apart from that, I really fail to see all the fuss surrounding this book. None of the characters carry a unique personality, nor the interaction between them is anything special. It is not an inspirational book by any stretch of imagination, and it's really absurd to regard this novel as the second best novel ever written in the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought that the book The Great Gatsby was decedent. There were some things I liked about the book but more things I didn't like about the book. It seemed like too much of the same thing happened, with the affairs and then the deaths.The Characters were one of the things I enjoyed about the book. That was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it. Nick Carraway, he was the narrator, the thing that I didn't like about him was he claims to be objective. Throughout the whole book he isn't objective at all he always seems to judge others. To me Jay Gatsby was my favorite character. He started out poor and left his love to go to Vietnam and then he came back and worked hard to try to get her back. He became a millionaire. He always threw the most amazing parties and he just seemed like the man. All of the other characters I didn't like that much daisy tom Myrtle, and Daisy.The things that I didn't like about the book were there was too many affairs. I understand that there are a lot of affairs that take place in the real world but I don't think you need to have that many affairs in one book. I also don't like how Nick left Jordan at the end and he just went back because things got too weird and complicated. I also don't like how Gatsby dies at the end and I thought when Myrtle died that was a little cheesy. I mean she died by Gatsby car running over her. I couldn't stand that at all. I also didn't like how Daisy didn't wait for Gatsby; I mean if they were in love you think she would wait for him.I gave the book a bad review because to me the book didn't seem to keep my interest for a long period of time.

When reading the one review where the guy says he identifies w/Gatsby, I chuckled, thinking, 'Must be a doctor or lawyer' and wouldn't you know, he was a lawyer. What is it about these 2 professions?

I had to go on schmoop after (a great site with summaries of classic novels) to find out what I was reading. This is a classic but far from what I consider great reading.

When I read it years ago in high school, I didn't care for it. Actually, I hated it. But after seeing that title pop up over and over again among lists of the greatest novels, I wanted to try it again. Did I like it any more the second time around? Nope.First, there is the language. Most people will tell you that that is what they love about the book, that The Great Gatsby is the prime example of exquisite and beautiful language. Maybe it works for you, but reading Fitzgerald's words leaves me scratching my head wondering, \\"What is he trying to say?\\"Let's take a relatively unimportant line from Chapter 1 as an example. Fitzgerald writes, \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\\" Okay, what does that mean? I get the second half of the sentence - that the narrator doesn't care how one's conduct, i.e., one's behavior, is founded - that it doesn't matter whether you were brought up with great advantages or if you were brought up without them. But why hard rock? Why wet marshes? What does that mean? Hard rock? Wet marshes? Maybe you have a great answer for me, and I'm just not getting it. That's entirely plausible. But without a straight answer, I'm just left struggling. And this happens all over the place in this novel - words that conjure up images that float in the sky without any meaning to ground them.Second, there are the wholly unlikeable characters. What more needs to be said? The characters are wholly unlikeable. All of them.Third, through the narrator Nick Carraway, we are treated to a love/hate relationship with the wealthy class of the time period. We are to be in love, in awe, and in constant fascination with this one percent (to use today's language) for no reason other than the fact that they have lots of money. We are to be envious of and hopelessly attracted to high society. And although Fitzgerald paints these one percent characters as wholly unlikeable, he falls short of actually condemning their behavior. It's not a scathing satire. In the end, you still see the glimmers of attraction. And this, I cannot stand. I cannot stand the pathetic fawning over of the one percent. Cue eye roll. Get a backbone and find some self-worth. Please.Why two stars instead of one? My hatred of this novel bordered on obsession. I kept wondering why I disliked it so much. Those thoughts kept churning and churning in my head. And so, two stars instead of one, because evoking this level of obsession is worth something."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I again bought copies of \\"Gatsby\\" at Amazon for my sister, an English teacher in a mission school in the jungle of Peru.

Oddly, during the several years Sis did not teach at the school while home-schooling her own kids, her previous copies disappeared from the school, so perhaps not everyone agrees with the need to teach this work.

Don't you dare dreaming of style and flair and exuberance, I will yank the carpet from under your feet just so you know where you belong. Don't you dare. But I do.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's 1926 The Sun Also Rises. At the time, I wasn't impressed with either, considering both to be shallow tales of spoiled rich folk. I gave The Sun Also Rises another chance a couple of years ago, and was so impressed with the power of Hemingway's novel that I quickly read the rest of his major works, and some of his minor. I just finished re-reading The Great Gatsby, and while it didn't leap up as much in my estimation as The Sun Also Rises, I did appreciate it more than I did back in high school.The story of The Great Gatsby does, in fact, revolve around the discontent well-off of Jazz Age New York. Our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the one decent guy in the book, while the titular Jay Gatsby, his old flame Daisy, Daisy's husband Tom Buchanan, and Carraway's love interest Jordan Baker are all despicable people in one way or another, though this time reading it, I was able to appreciate as certain tragedy to Gatsby that had previously been lost on me.The main thread of the novel it Gatsby's attempt to win Daisy back to him. There are also parties. Lots of parties. You may not know much about the mysterious Gatsby until the end of the novel, but one thing you know from the start is that he throws a hell of a party. You might also finish the novel with an urge to start calling everyone \\"Old Sport.\\" Try to resist it.What I enjoyed most about the novel this reading was the language. Fitzgerald at times seems to be writing poetry as much as he is fiction, so lyrical and evocative is his writing. You'll finish the novel with many memorable phrases and scenes still echoing in your mind. While his contemporary and friend Hemingway wrote powerfully using as few words as possible, resembling a minimalist stone sculpture, Fitzgerald strings together glittering, complex phrases that call to mind a necklace of sparking diamonds. Between the two, I like Hemingway's approach more, but those jewels of Fitzgerald's - they do shine brightly and catch the eye.I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production of The Great Gatsby, read by Anthony Heald. Heald did a fantastic job with the novel. The tone he used for this production fit the Jazz Age drama perfectly, and he captured all the characters very well. I had not listened to anything narrated by Heald before, but after listening to his recording of The Great Gatsby, he's on my audio book narrator radar. The unabridged recording runs approximately five hours.In the end, I'm glad I gave The Great Gatsby another chance. I don't love it as much as I ended up loving Hemingway's work, but Fitzgerald's most famous novel was well worth reading again, and it has a fitting place as an American classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald is an exceptional writer. Always has been---always will be. There is no other Fitzgerald. In many ways, the same can be said of The Great Gatsby. It is an hauntingly beautiful novel. Yet, it is a very sad novel. For, it reveals the fickle nature---of the human race. In the beginning, Mr. Gatsby is greatly taken with Miss Daisy. Yet,---what he neglects to realize is the fact that the attention that Miss Daisy is projecting towards him---is simply a form of self admiration, whereby---she is the center of attention: Almost as if, she is standing in the midst of a chamber full of mirrors. The surrounding mirrors are the men which are encircling her: Projecting back to her the great and beautiful image of herself. She sees it,---reflected in their eyes. She feels it,---reflected in their mannerism. Mr. Gatsby is but one of the many admirers---just one of the mirrors. Yet, for the moment, that image which he projects back to her is the one which is the most pleasing to her---that is,---for the moment. However, sadly, Mr. Gatsby feels as if he is not worthy of her. He walks away---from her, from all that she represents, and all that which---he madly yearns for. For years, he does---whatever he deems to be necessary---in order to rise up to her level of, what he believes to be, her existence. He arrives at a point where he feels that he is now in a position to consider himself her equal. He is now good enough for her. He strives for wealth and power, because he correlates wealth and power---with Miss Daisy Buchanan. Yet, what he fails to understand is that Miss Daisy Buchanan is not good enough for him. He has been faithful to her, but she has not been faithful to him. What he fails to understand is the fact that she is indeed married to the right person---Mr. Tom Buchanan. For, just the way that he is boorish and unkind on the outside,---so is she---in the inside. He is a reflection of her. But, alas, it is well hidden behind the soft looks and the gentle demeanor. Tom Buchanan portrays the physical aspects of the characteristics which they both share---in one way or another. This is why they came together, and this is why they stay together. She is a fickle woman. Yet, she is not weak. She knows exactly as to what she is doing. The destroyed lives of men have no meaning to her as long as the image in the mirror continues to be. It is the image which must survive. At the end, she is just as much responsible for the tragedy. At one point, Mr. Gatsby states, \\"Her voice is full of money.\\" It is as if he is saying---she represents all that I have strived to achieve, and have wanted. Again and again, he tries to prove himself to Daisy---that he is indeed good enough for her, but what he fails to understand is the fact that the quest was not worth it,---because she was not worth it. It is indeed a very sad testament to human nature, yet it is so very true. This is why, this book lives on and on. The world has not changed much. There still exists many a Daisy Buchanans and Tom Buchanans. Sadly,---there are also many Mr. Gatsbys---trying desperately to prove themselves to the fickle Daisys of the world. Human nature has not changed since Mr. Fitzgerald penned this great novel. What Mr. Gatsby fails to understand is the following fact---that his tragic end came to be on the very day---in which he met Miss Daisy Buchanan. For she reflected in the mirror,---the very image---of what he wanted to become."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"East Coast America, 1922, and young Nick Carraway decides to rent a house in the fictional town for the rich, West Egg, while he tries to make it in the city trading bonds. Except his life is about to change as he meets his flamboyant and rich neighbour, Jay Gatsby, whose charisma and lifestyle will spirit Nick away to catch glimpses of how the rich live in 1920s America, the good and the bad. But Gatsby isn't all he seems and when Nick introduces him to his married cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan, their fatal company will reveal to Nick the sordid and black-hearted side to the American Dream.What to say about this book that's not been said before? Should there be a superlative limit for this novel? And where should someone start? Well, I read this book several years ago and decided to re-read it recently to see if the novel was as good as I remembered, as clever and well written, as fun and as sad, and with a beating heart still behind it; and I was glad to find that it still did.Nick Carraway is a brilliant narrator, flawed and biased, yet all-seeing out of all the characters; we see Gatsby as a charming personality at first and then slowly and subtly see the flaws in his character, see through the lies that go into the creation of his persona and the darkness beneath. We see Daisy and Tom as a sad married couple - Daisy full of regret yet unable to leave because of her love of Tom's money and Tom with his numerous infidelities and foul temper showing how the rich can live a life free of consequence.The book contains many images of startling beauty such as Gatsby's glittering parties wearing his pink tuxedo, the green light from Daisy's window in the night, the decayed ruins of Gatsby's mansion, the decadent empty Buchanan household - and the stench of squandered privilege, crime and death that accompanies it all.The writing is of the highest quality, each sentence perfectly written and filled with layers making up rich paragraphs and textured pages - it's not hard to see why Fitzgerald is canonised and celebrated when the writing in \\"Gatsby\\" is this good. But that's not to say that it's unreadable to people looking for a good read - it's perfectly approachable, understandable, and fun. The scenes are so full of life and action that it's as compelling to read purely for its story of doomed love between Gatsby and Daisy. The scene between Gatsby, Daisy and Tom is as explosive to read the first time as it is to re-read it again and again.But because the writing is so good, the story so layered and full of symbols with a strong theme and message, it's no wonder this book has had untold numbers of books and papers written about its complexities and nuances - how truly magnificent a work of art it is. I won't go into the various themes and sub-texts as this review will turn into a sprawling mini-book of its own but suffice it to say Fitzgerald explores the theme of how wealth in America means the rich can do what they want to the poor and the law can't touch you if you have cash, with a wry and precise eye that still has relevance nearly a century after it was written.And why is Gatsby great? Because he is the embodiment of the American Dream - a working class boy who became rich; a self-made man, yet his pursuit of riches and love were all illusions in the end. Riches come and go and love can be fickle and deceitful.

But the editing in the Kindle edition is, frankly, an embarrassment. There are odd things going on with line breaks and egregious typos that occasionally confused the meaning of the text. For example, the following passage should read as follows:-- \\"I couldn't get to the house,\\" he remarked.-- \\"Neither could anybody else.\\"-- \\"Go on!\\" He started. \\"Why, my God! They used to go there by the hundreds.\\" He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.In the Kindle version, however, it reads:-- \\"I couldn't get to the house,\\" he remarked. \\"Neither could anybody else.\\"-- \\"Go on!\\" He started. \\"Why, my God! They used to go there by the hundreds.\\"-- He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.This was my first Kindle purchase and I am extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is now 87 years old and still feels fresh, edgy, modern, and still has something fundamental to say about the American experience. The writing is stunningly beautiful and whole paragraphs deserve to be savored again and again. Yet the story is bluntly sad and tragic. It's a story about chasing after elusive dreams -- once you seem to have reached these them, they evaporate. Fitzgerald packs a lot of punch, style, and tragedy into less than 200 pages. I loved traveling back to New York in the 1920s and spending some time peering into these character's lives. I also just loved reading the words of an absolutely brilliant writer."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby is this rich, mysterious man who throws infamous parties on Long Island during the 1920's. He appears to have everything he wants but what he really wants, is Daisy Buchanan. Daisy slipped through his fingers once before, and now she lives just across from his mansion with her husband, Tom. When Nick Caraway rents a home nearby, Gatsby accepts him into his circle with the hopes of luring Daisy back to him. For you see, Daisy is Nick's cousin.Oh, to be rich and young in the 1920's! At its core, this is a love story and has been called one of the greatest American novels of our time and I can certainly see why. It's gorgeously done and Gatsby is a character that stays with you, long after finishing the novel. He's complex and just mysterious enough for you to understand everyone's infatuation with him. Everyone except Daisy who continually reminds him of what he used to be.The Great Gatsby is a beautifully rendered masterpiece and should be read and enjoyed by many."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I admit, I was made to read this book for English in college, and I read it in one sitting. I think it might be the first assigned classic literature novel that I made me to read beyond the assigned pages (ok, maybe Of Mice and Men had the same effect too.)I particularly adore the Nick Carraway. Even if he is a rather passive character who seems to get dragged everywhere by Tom, Jordan, and Gatsby. He comes off as someone trustworthy and humble. I admit I get frustrated with his passiveness at times; somestimes I just want him to slap the characters, but I guess that would be acting out of character. For a guy that only knew Gatsby for three months yet held a funeral for him, and is aware that he was used as a pawn to get close to Daisy, Nick is admirable. There couldn't have been a more perfect narrator.Gatsby is beyond redeeming. He is a friendly, likable character, but it is apparent that he is a desperate mess behind his overwhelming wealth. He is clearly deluded by the idea of having Daisy and social status, even when Daisy is clearly a mess herself. I'm not sure what he even sees in her, but I suppose his undying love makes him likable, albeit frustrating.I'm not sure how Daisy can murder someone and not be terrified. I imagined her as a girly girl who gets scared easily, but to kill someone and not feel immense guilt...I have my reservations."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was essentially forced to read the book, and I am glad I was. While I was reading this book, I thought I was watching a soap opera. It has everything you could want in a interesting, action packed story, everything from love triangles and murder to back stabbing and philosophical enlightenments.The book gave me a pretty clear and convincing perspective about the early to middle 20th century obsession with the American dream, otherwise known as the great, ideal, promising American dream. The tragic story of Jay Gatsby exemplifies the flawed aspects of the American dream, warning readers even from modern day of the danger and sacrifice demanded from the pursuit of the American Dream. And because we are a growing society still pursuing financial success in most matters, the book applied and will apply in the near future."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I still love this book, love Gatsby. After all these years, Gatsby holds up as a hero and a tragic figure. I find I can recall lines from this poetic classic that pushes us against the undercurrents of the American Dream. Everyone should re-read The Great Gatsby at different stages in their life and heights in their career."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If a novel can be both ornate and spare,The Great Gatsbyis that and more. It is a book history buffs might enjoy as much as those seeking simple entertainment, becauseFitzgeraldset out to write a story of the times in which he lived--The Roaring Twenties. Accuracy in contemporaneous fiction is challenging, because historical elements were included, such as the World Series debacle of 1919, and everyone's a critic!Fitzgerald sought to make it an extraordinary work, only part of which he accomplished by sketching a larger than life character, Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald's first novel was published when he was only 24, still wet with a commitment to excellence that is available only to the young--not that more mature souls aren't allowed excellence, but no one has it in his or her own mind as much as those who've been less knocked about by sorrow, misfortune or tedium.\\"The Authorized Text\\" adds to the pleasure of reading, becauseBruccolipresents some of Fitzgerald's own words on the novel as well as on writing in general, such as \\"An author ought to write for the youth of his generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.\\" Two out of three isn't bad. The youth of his generation were too busy living the life Fitzgerald described to be bothered with reading about it.This version also opens a peephole to common paperback publishing by tracing some of the errors that crept into the work over time. Corrections were made by comparing various editions to the galleys, which contained Fitzgerald's hand-written edits and rewrites, some of them notably more difficult to decipher than others, yet vast improvements to an already splendid tale.Finally, two more points stand out from reading this authorized edition. Fitzgerald's editor, Maxwell Perkins (Scribners), absolutely gushed over the manuscript,\\"I think the novel is a wonder.\\"As effusive as Perkins was, he was not totally so. \\"You are right in feeling there is a certain slight sagging in chapters six and seven...\\" and \\"Gatsby is somewhat vague.\\" Perkins went on for pages about Fitzgerald's treatment of Gatsby and his wealth, simultaneously accusing the author of saying too little and too much. Bruccoli calls Perkins a genius, so his critique may in fact be brilliant. Even so, they're both talking about the greatest book of one of the greatest writers of all time. All writers should take heart.The ONLY THING THAT COUNTS: The Ernest Hemingway/Maxwell Perkins CorrespondenceGatsby was a legend in his time. Only in his own mind? He did, after all, make himself up as Fitzgerald squeezed him out of his pen. And part of the greatness lies somewhere between knowing what is true and what we only wish were so. In Fitzgerald's own words, \\"That's the whole burden of this novel--the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world so that you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.\\"For me, \\"the magical glory\\" showed itself by racing me to the next page, though I wanted to linger over the words, and then too soon I finished the race, and there was no more Great Gatsby to read. (F. Scott Fitzgerald won.)"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel about life in the roaring twenties and the pitfalls that accompanied that mostly carefree time has remained a classic for many years, and will remain for years to come.Told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, this timeless classic focuses on the life of self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby and his pursuit of love and happiness. Gatsby lives next door to Nick, and it seems that Gatsby's house is always full of people who have come from near and far to get a glimpse or hear a story about him. Many have formulated their own ideas, but Gatsby has remained mostly a mystery to his guests. He's frequently torn away at his gatherings to attend to business or to speak with some fellow captain of industry. Most people never meet him, but they enjoy his lavish gatherings.Gatsby's story really begins five years before the events of the book. During this time, Jay ment and fell in love with a young lady named Daisy. However, Gatsby was enlisted in the Army at the time, and he was forced away to fight in World War I. He distinguished himself in many battles and earned the rank of major, but he longed for a life with Daisy. Not content to wait for Jay to return, Daisy met and married Tom Buchannan, a bullish and pig-headed man. Five years later, Gatsby, now a wealthy man, bought his luxurious home which happens to be very near where Daisy lives.Meanwhile, Jay's neighbor Nick Carraway dropped over one evening to one of his parties. The two meet and soon become friends. Over the remainder of the book, Nick becomes very close to Jay, and he remains his only true friend. Events transpire among Gatsby, Nick, Tom, and Daisy that end up changing each of their lives forever. Some survive; some don't. In the end, greed, envy, betrayal, and even murder rear their ugly heads.This is an excellent work of contemporary literary fiction. The reader gets a very real sense of what life was like during the roaring twenties. The depression had not yet come, so life was good. This book has remained popular for decades, and has been called F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work. His story of the larger-than-life Gatsby is both exciting and tragic.I recommend this book very highly. The story is well-written, and the character development is excellent. I did have a problem with some of Fitzgerald's style of writing, but this in no means detracts from the overall story. Read this classic work of American fiction and discover what life was like for a group of people during the roaring twenties."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face-- the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\\"-The Great GatsbyF. Scott FitzgeraldHow many times can you, honestly, say that you have seen a smile quite like this?The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, a well-known classic, is about Nick Carraway's experiences in transitioning from the laid-back life of the Middle West to the more up-beat scene in the East. Mr. Carraway moves into a house in Long Island's West Egg village that neighbors the great mansion of Mr. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby frequently has lavish parties with many wealthy guests, at one of which, the two neighbors meet. Carraway is also welcomed by the Buchanans; Tom, whom he knew from college, and Daisy, his second cousin. This book, set in the 1920s, tells of the lives and affairs of this circle of people, and a small number of others, through the eyes of Nick Carraway.I, personally, wish that there were more people out there that had the good qualities of Gatsby. This makes me feel like my life isn't as messed-up and complicated as others. I also think that reading this classic has helped me to better appreciate my normal (yet abnormal) family, friends, and circumstances.

I find it disheartening reading the reviews here that pan the book because the characters are not \\"noble\\" or possibly engage in illegal activities to make their money. Hint...we are not supposed to like them. Nobility in novels is done to death at any rate.The book represents the death of a dream. The American dream at that, and I suppose that makes it difficult for some to embrace.

He Shows the reader how life was somewhat deteriorating back in the 1920s, what with the love problems and money problems. He shows how people always look back into the past to try to relive everything and have everything that you had when all you had to do was stop living in the past and start living in the present. Stop living on past moments and look at what is right in front of you and what you have.

It's short and simple, beautifully descriptive and carries within it the weight of great devotion and tragedy. It's a book one would call a work of art. I would read this for a taste of the fabulous lifestyle of the rich, decadent and charming in New York at the height of the Roaring 20s. Also, for Gatsby's utter devotion to a lost dream, the depth and the consequence of such a devotion.If anything, I felt the characters of Nick Carraway (narrator) and Jordan Baker weren't built up enough. Fitzgerald's method of description wasn't too much to my taste either. It was rather amusing when at one point, within the same conversation, he uses &quot;inquired Jordan humorously ... said Jordan helpfully ... snorted Tom contemptuously ... demanded Jordan crossly&quot;."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"From what I understand, this book is considered by those in the know to be among the very greatest of American novels, and the most important American novel of the 20th Century. I don't really think it deserves such high praise. Although it is a penetrating look at 20's life- in all its excess- the book falls short on plot and substance. Sure there are greater meanings (don't forget that green light) but reading it is not the pleasure it could be for me. Perhaps I feel this way because I find that much of the writing, especially the dialogue, is still very much ingrained in 1920's culture. Thus, I find it hard to see how it is so timeless in the minds of so many people. So, I personally would give 3 stars but its &quot;greatness&quot; has got to be 5. I will settle with 4."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Mariangeles, why are you so upset?

That's all I have to say about this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Perhaps the strongest point made by this book is Gastby's futile attempt to reach the idealistic goals that he has set based on the romanticism of the 20's. In his work Fitzgerald has created a picture that summarizes an entire decade. The character Daisy also represents the pressures put on women during that time period. This book is excellent for anyone fascinated with the 20's as it transports you to Gatsby's time and for all of you hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This remarkable book is one of the chief reasons I am such an avid reader of classic fiction. The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I love it so much, but I do! With this masterpiece, I believe that Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and created something exceeding the extraordinary. Nick, the narrator, has a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's story played out, and at the same time bringing us into his own life. I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings, not present in the book, that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have. It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand the book, or have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a cherished favorite forever."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the very first book by F.Scott Fitzgerald that I have read, and it was actually engrossing and interesting. There are parts that seem to move slow, but the author makes up for it with his amazing lyrical writing/description and his great characterization. The way he writes of the character's reactions and emotions seems so realistic, that is what I beleive will make it easy for one to read and get \\"into\\", so to speak.Now, yes, Fitzgerald was an alcholic, but that does not mean that he wrote this while being drunk. Quite the contrary; Fitzgerald is known for his notorious revisions - in which 'Gatsby' was revised several times before he was satisfied with it.I am saying this to basically let the reader know that it is very worth giving it a chance, and even though by the end it may not be ones' \\"favorite\\" story, however it is a very good introduction into the writings of F. Scott Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was required to read this book for English II. I am a bibliophile by nature and have always loved books.This is one of my favorites. We were required to extensively research the 1920s in order to fully understand the background of the book, the time period, the setting. That research and this book have made the 1920s one of the most interesting decades in the 20th century for me; certainly, the one I am most attracted to.THE GREAT GATSBY is written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, \\"social historian\\" of the Lost Generation of disillusioned writers in the post-war world. Fitzgerald's prose and style so eloquently capture the fleeting spirit of the 1920s, the breaking through of social taboos and finding little on the other side, the desire for something impossible, the continuing themes of disillusionment, spiritual isolation, and death."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Note - this review assumes you've already read the book.Writing is excellent and east to get into, and you feel you know the narrator despite his lack of emotional openness. Gatsby however I found elusive and even somewhat unbelievable - maybe that's the idea but the notion that this otherwise capable guy lives his entire life in pursuit of his elusive Daisy and what-might-have-been strikes me as, at best, fanciful and at worst bad romance-novel blubber. Maybe I'm cynical but I just don't believe anyone without severe emotional disorders - a stalker, a depressive, etc. - would idealize someone the way Gatsby does Daisy, and after what seemed like a pretty superficial, if intense, initial relationship. If Gatsby is supposed to be so emotionally or psychologically damaged that he would thus lose all perspective, Fitzgerald does a lousy job of having it manifest in other ways that would give the reader a clue. Overall I come away finding Gatsby, who is supposedly this tragic hero, to be a histrionic schmuck. Not that he deserved his fate, really, but c'mon - he shows up out of the blue to steal a woman away from her husband and child? How am I supposed to sympathize with that?Having said that, the book is very evocative of the time - jazz age, flappers, etc. and this is its true attraction. A generation of people with wealth, health and opportunities who fritter it away with gaieties and shallow pleasures - this I can understand, and relate to when I look around me at my own age. Fitzgerald may not have been a huge critic of this (he was too busy participating) but his portrayal of the life of the bold and beautiful doesn't exactly come across as an endorsement either. Tom and Daisy Buchanan in particular provide a good and not too heavy-handed example of carelessness, as Fitzgerald thoughtfully has Nick point out at the end of the book. The utter self-absorption of running your life based on \`what do I want?' causes them to be oblivious to the lives they ruin. Nick, to his credit, at least has the decency to feel tawdry about his involvement in it all, and to escape back to the west. A parallel English novel is Huxley's Point Counter-Point, about a similar demographic (rich, spoiled, idle) in England at the same time.Other thoughts - interesting sub theme of midwesterners adrift in the wild east, that I hadn't picked up on much and can relate to, after living in the east, though I think the midwestern mindset has gained some confidence (or the east has realized its vacuity) since I found it more pathetic than intimidating. I had also forgotten how obvious it was that Gatsby's wealth came from the Jewish NY mob and his connections to it. Not sure of the significance of that (some comment on the American dream?) but it does undermine Gatsby's shine a bit, and made me even less sympathetic to him as a character. I also thought the giant eyes of DR TJ Eckelberg were an interesting touch that I had previously overlooked - cuckolded Mr. Wilson, in his rage and grief, focuses on the eyes as he rants \\"You can fool me, but you can't fool God!\\". Considering how little justice there is to be found in this story, this is the most comforting line in the book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As a thirteen year old boy growing up in a small town in Kansas this book changed my life.Reading it again as a lit major in college I got even more out of it.Now, as an adult my original copy is one of my most read, most treasured possesions."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby is a tragic figure blinded by his own ambitions to rekindle romance with Daisy, a woman from his past. The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carroway, who sees from all perspectives the world of the rich: the hollowness of the Buchanons, the &quot;mask&quot; that Gatsby must wear to attain his goals, the many &quot;acquaintences&quot; of the Gatsby parties who only attend his parties because it serves their own purpose of having a good time.At the heart core of this tale is the question of how far one must go to follow the aquistion of a dream, whether realistic or not. Nick admires Gatsby's determination, but he sees the dangers of Gatsby continuing to follow his dream. However, what Nick learns from Gatsby is the most essential part of the book.This is one of those books that starts off relatively slow, but picks up as we move on. It is set in the mid 1920s and has a few flashback references to Gatsby's former affair with Daisy. Overall I would recommend reading this book if you have never done so. I will admit that I was assigned this book in high school, but never even finished it. When I reread it a few years later, I was pleasantly surprised. I think what you should take from a book like The Great Gatsby is what it says about not only life in the 1920s, but the times we live in now."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of those works both blessed and cursed: blessed to have gained literary immortality, cursed to spend much of that immortality as assigned high school reading.

If it isn't the finest novel ever written (which I've been known to argue it is) or the finest American novel (which again I've been known to argue it is) or the finest Twentieth Century novel (which, you know the drill), it is the finest crime novel ever written. I read this book annually. Many other crime fiction writers do the same. THE GREAT GATSBY is perfectly constructed, with ambiguities within enigmas, as it recounts the Jazz Age, capturing that era's ambience splendidly. It is a crime novel, yet, as with the best crime novels, crime does not dominate the entire book. At one level, it is the story of a poor boy who dreams of becoming rich and marrying an American golden girl. On another level, it is the story of the American upper crust personified by that golden girl and her polo playing husband. On still another level, it is the story of a young Midwestern gentleman who matures into genuine manhood one summer amid the parties and social events of East and West Eggs in Long Island. It is the Tale of America. No one has told it better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, either before or since. Ever."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Delivering no comforting message or feeling of warmth, The Great Gatsby glitters and dances off the smooth and lively words of F. Scott Fitzgerald. \\"It is a shocking book,\\" wrote Walter Yust, \\"one that reveals incredible grossness, thoughtlessness, polite corruption, without leaving the reader with a sense of depression, without being insidiously provocative.\\" The book is captivating; when the story becomes calm and relaxed, the words themselves remain thrilling as they impel the pages to keep turning. Set in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby explores the life of the wealthy and hopeful J. Gatsby as he pursues his love, Mrs. Daisy Buchanan. Through the narrative of the gentle and level-headed Nick Carraway, we learn to love Gatsby and to loathe those who cause his downfall. Money, love, selfishness, infidelity and misdirected passions are woven together to form a net that ensnares the larger part of the book's characters. \\"Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men\\" (pgs. 6,7). Yet, through many understated, despicable acts, there is a light of goodness and hope: Gatsby's hope. It is seen shining brighter than the great and twinkling lights of Gatsby's summer parties. \\"It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found before in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again\\" (pg. 6). Fitzgerald magnifies the underlying ideas of the novel in each of Daisy's tears and every splashing drop from Gatsby's fountains. When gathered together, the droplets reflect Fitzgerald's own life of money and misfortune as his own wife caused him heartache over an extra-marital affair. Furthermore, Fitzgerald also battled against the troubles of living a lavish life without an incredibly stable income. As the story can be paralleled to Fitzgerald's own life - Gatsby can be paralleled to the ideals of America in the 1920's; a generous visionary with a goal and, also, hopeful enough to pursue his goal. \\"Gatsby believed [in] the future that year by year recedes before us... So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" (pg. 189). As time went on, the world around Gatsby changed, and, outwardly, Gatsby changed right along with it. But, inwardly, Gatsby longed for and strived to regain his past, just as so many people of the twenties were torn between the past and the present. The Great Gatsby shows a hero like we have never seen before. A hero who unconsciously battled against an evil force: corruption caused by money. He also, consciously, fought for the sake of his heart as he tried to regain the love of his past. Despite his valiant efforts on both battle fields, Gatsby is trampled over by the effects of the thoughtless, calloused actions of others. With the book thus ending, Gatsby can still be called nothing short of heroic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This remarkable book is one of the chief reasons I am such an avid reader of classic fiction. The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I love it so much, but I do! With this masterpiece, I believe that Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and created something exceeding extraordinary. Nick, the narrator, has a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's story played out, at the same time bringing us, somewhat, into his own life. I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings that weren't present in the book, but that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have. It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand the book, and have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a cherished classic forever."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Contemporary readers likely go into this work expecting the quintessential American novel, and though I found it less than world-changing, I was pleasantly surprised to see it live up to my expectations, a nice combination of lyrical beauty and economical pacing. The tone of the storytelling is fascinatingly whimsical and monumental at the same time. As it satirizes the lifestyle of a group of free-wheeling upper class twenty-somethings partying through a summer on Long Island in the early 1920's, the title character displays an innocent desperation that resonates profoundly, indeed, on the meaning of the &quot;American dream&quot;. My only major qualm involved some apparent contradictions regarding this said character. At the outset Mr. Gatsby is referred to mysteriously as a celebrated self-made man who few can get close to. When we do get close to him, however, he suddenly becomes two-dimensional, a love-crazed sap. I wished Fitzgerald had gone further to make the Gatsby we come to know match up more with the far more complex character we have imagined. However, this problem is minor. Among the many more numerous things to admire, it stands out how Fitzgerald reaps benefits from using an the unconventional narrative style perfectly appropriate only because of the idiosyncrasies of the tale, a terrific example of content dictating form. This is one &quot;classic&quot; you will not regret reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fail to understand how anyone could not enjoy this book! Fitzgerald's fantastic style and flair completely engulf the reader, and lets you fall in love with the characters.I'd like to point out one thing. i read this in an English 11 class, and while some high schoolers may fail to understand much of it, I took so much from this book. perhaps it is the way in which the teacher presented it and developed it in class (assigning each character to a student along with many perspectives on symbols in the book - colors, parties, etc) Everything in this book fascinated me - the characters, the parties, the colors, and so many other things - I was nearly overwhelmed. I recommend it to anyone who can look past the outer shell and see the symbolic meaning and theme of this novel.ALso, I'd like to question the review by Aaron Goldberg. He criticized Tom for being a racist. He's intended to appear that way, it's the way many people in the 1920's thought, and it remains today. I don't understand how calling Wolfshiem a &quot;small, flat-nosed Jew&quot; is racist, if it is merely the description of a character. he's got a flat nose - that's racist? And the fact that TGG and DB never get together? It';s tragic, it's supoposed to show that all the money and wealth in the world cannot ensure you happiness, and to not let missed opportunities of the past bog you down in the future. And as for a &quot;dated&quot; book? That's the purpose, it is set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald wrote it in near-pefrect sync with the era.Some people just confuse me when they cannot look deeper into a book and hrasp literary concepts such as setting, irony, and symbolism.Anyway, read this book! It's a great!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just enetered the 9th grade and, as a requirement, i had to read 4 books over the summer. After a visit to the book store and a chat with a salesperson i decided on The Bean Trees, Of Mice and Men, Cold Sassy Tree, and, The Great Gatsby. As a teenager i am insulted at the thought that we(teenagers) can't fully appreciate this book and would simply pass it of as trash and refuse to read it. I LOVED IT!!! and I have at least 3 friends who agree with me. We were all able to understand and discuss the book and found no cause for complaint. I would read it again in an instant. Just because i'm a teenager doesn't make me any less literate than the next 20 something year old."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I first read some of the reviews that stated that high school students could not appreciate the boor, or that they were not sophisticated readers I laughed. I remeber reading the book in high school and loving it, disecting it, reading critical studies and articles on Gatsby. But, after reading one of the reviews that discussed Tom's racism, anti-semitism, etc. and failure in chronology I am now inclined to agree that the book may go beyond some high school students, and in a their zeal to deconstruct a text before having any of the proper background, maturity or tools can not appreciate what is one of the finest American works ever written. The mistakes in chronology are minor and insignificant to the point and power of Fitzgerald's work. The racism is a crucial aspect in Tom's character. And rather than going on to explain why I suggest that any high schooler who misses this takes another reviewers suggestion and try again a few yeras later. No one has to like this book, but there is a reason that this may be the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; and if you don't understand that you may need to wait a few years."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is Mr. Fitzgerlad's great misfortune to find that his acknowledgement as one of this young country's few authentic literary masters should be to have his work forced upon millions of the nation's TV reared, comic book-glutted High School students. Wholly unprepared to see the author's work in a cultural or artistic context (for to do that they would have had to read legitimate novels in the past), they doubtless rush for the Cliffs notes or else plagiarize reviews in abetting encyclopaedias for their sham book reports. This sacrilege is as nothing, though, when compared to the frustrating denunciations of &quot;right-thinking&quot; young people who, ignorant of changing historical and cultural trends, can't understand why Fitzgerald had his characters express themselves as people really spoke and NOT according to the politically correct scripts that are so common nowadays in the hangover after the nightmare illusion of Free Speech."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read these &quot;reviews&quot; of an American masterpiece where people are comparing the Great Gatsby to a soap opera when the story is so much more epic than the brainwashed masses who sit in front of TVs can recognize. First of all, it was written before soap operas so how could it be unoriginal. Second, its lyrical prose is among the best of any novels. Third, it is boring and pointless only to those idiots who want car chases, explosions, sex, and moronic dialogue about 70s pop culture. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At first I didn't want anything to do with this book. It was assigned as summer reading for my American Studies class. Before reading the book, I came online &amp; read some of the reviews it received. I saw that a lot people thought this book was excellent. Well I have to agree with them. Fitzgerald moves a little slow in the beginning, but this story is so romantic and it didn't bore me at all."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"i read this book my sophomore year in highschool. i loved it. it is one of the best books that i've read that depicts the &quot;american dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a wonderful book, which I couldn't put down. Though it may only be a story of a man, he was indeed a memorable one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fiztgerald's The Great Gatsby is the tragedy if not death of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby longs to become rich and captivate his only love. It depicts the longing to relive the past intricately yet adds a feeling of grand admiration for Gatsby. Gatsby was just a man, surrounded by attitudes and consequences. This book only lets the reader admire a fictional character while leaving him or her without a learned lesson or a thought to ponder over. I truly believe the essence of this book is powerful yet only for the main character not the public. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read of made-up legends and unique characters but not to the the vivid reader who hopes to find a momentum to retrive from it and carry in throughout life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What could I say about this book that hasn't been said before? I can't think of anything: hence the classic effect. What better reason is there to read 'The Great Gatsby' and first handedly experience Fitzgerald's opulent prose in a tale so perfect that it could have been written only by Fitzgerald? But all this has been said before; please forgive my redundancy. I just had to get my say in.And don't forget to catch Fitzgerald's other works."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a classic of American literature. Many people have read it in school, but I came upon it later in life. I admire the beauty of the language and the story. No need for me to comment on the symbolism, etc.- many others can comment more intelligently.After reading it twice now, and appearing in a bit part in a stage production of the novel, I have had time and opportunity to reflect on the book. What sticks with me are the characters. Tom Buchanan is a blustery bully, but very vital and interesting. His wife Daisy is beautiful, period. Gatsby is a fool who refuses to grow up. The &quot;love of his life&quot; is taken by another man and he should just get on with it. He is attractive and magnetic- he could find any number of beautiful, intelligent women to be with, but he fixates on the unworthy Daisy. His tragedy seems to be his inability to live in the present. So that gives us Tom and Daisy in the category of People I'm Glad I Don't Know and Gatsby in the category of People Who Need a Vigorous Kick in the Seat. However, the character who ended up making me angry was Nick Carraway. He is so often mentioned as some kind of Greek chorus. This is not how I see him. I see Nick as the one person who could have done something or even just said something that might have averted the tragedy of this story. He does nothing. He sees people make bad decisions and do stupid things and doesn't say a word. In fact, he helps things along. Obviously, Fitzgerald would never have written it any differently. Gatsby with a happy ending would have been forgotten immediately if ever published at all.It's a wonderful read, and part of the American Lit canon. I do recommend The Great Gatsby, but I can't get the bad taste of Nick Carraway out of my mouth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is simply the greatest American novel. Enough Said. I believe the Publisher's Afterward, by Charles Scribner, is excellent as well."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest American novels ever written. Much has been said of it supposedly chronicling the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, but I think the themes are much deeper, penetrating the heart of what it means to be an American. The prose is near flawless, and the character of Gatsby is equally enigmatic and familiar. The idea that America is a place where one can continually reinvent oneself and spin a life out of dreams is as prevalent today (maybe more prevalent) as it was in the 1920's. Gatsby's seduction by this myth and its tragic consequences shows Fitzgerald's complete understanding of the limits and and even dangers of such a romanticism. The themes aside, his command of words, paragraphs and structure is something that all writers aspire to."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald ranged between the two extremes of liking the book then hating its ending. The characters of the book were excellently described, from Tom Buchanan's enormous size and temper to Jay Gatsby's strife for prestige to wealth. The story line was well written, except for the disappointing ending. My favorite parts were of the great parties Gatsby threw and of the confrontation between Gatsby, Nick, Tom, Jordan, and Daisy in the hotel room; this is where I was totally tuned in as a reader. These incidents portrayed the intriguing, lavish lifestyle that Gatsby enjoyed and the turmoil of the lovers' quarrel. The thing in this book that just irked me was how fickle some of the characters turned out to be, and how easily swayed by their emotions. This really upset me, but what also bothered me was how Nick appeared spineless in the face of defending his friend. Yet, these two dislikes do not add up to my hatred for the ending. It left me disappointed in all of the characters and mad at the senselessness. Even though, it was a good book overall."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I put off reading this book for quite a long time because I thought &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was awful.

In an attempt to win Daisy over, Gatsby moves across the harbor from her and her husband Tom. By moving across the harbor, Gatsby hopes to lure Daisy to come to one of his huge parties held during the prohibition. The narrator of the story, Nick, Daisy's cousin, moves next door to Gatsby. When Gatsby finds out that they are cousins, he gets Nick to invite Daisy and Tom to one of his huge parties. When they finally meet, Gatsby and Daisy rekindle an old romance.Conflict is a main literary element that is used in this story. Gatsby is battling with society because he smuggles alcohol to earn money to impress Daisy. He thinks that if he has money that she will come back to him. He is using illegal means to try and get money to impress her. Even though this was during the prohibition, Gatsby still manages to get alcohol."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a good book but not a great book. After deciding to go back and read some of the classics I fell upon &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The problem I have with this book is it leaves to much up in the air and you want to know more. You get a feeling for the 20's but not much since this is such a short novel and very little is written describing the 1920's parties and events. The people seem interesting at first but you never learn anything of value about them and why they are in their current condition. After reading 1984 and Slaughter House 5 I was enthralled by their charters and their situation but that just didn't happen here. Maybe Fitzgerald is showing how shallow the 20's era and people are bye making everything so empty and non-descriptive but that doesn't make for great reading by my standard."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really enjoyed This Side Of Paradise&quot; so I thought I'd have a go with this one.

The Cliffs Notes are very helpful and make this story even more interesting. I didn't feel that I knew the characters, but had feelings about them. I pitied Gatsby, was annoyed with Daisy, aggravated with Tom, irritated about Jordan, and admired Nick. Taking place during the Jazz Age, Fitzgerald made it seem The Depression might be welcomed, so it can put people in their places. I felt that F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing a semi-biography about himself, perhaps unknowingly. A wonderful read - I recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When asked what the 'Great American Novel' is, nine times out of ten you'll hear either Twain's Huck Finn or Fitzgerald's Gatsby (one out of ten times you'll hear Kerouac's On the Road). And if this isn't _THE_ Great American Novel, then it comes close to being so. It's a simple story of a love triange. But it is so much more than that. Fitzgerald captures the period of The Jazz Age, and is considered to a certain degree, a social historian, by himself if no one else. What strikes me most about this book is the voice Fitzgerald uses to tell the story. There are a handful of narrators in American fiction whose voice stands out as so good, that it lifts the story above being merely good. Examples are Huck Finn, Holden Caufield, and Nick Carroway."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I enjoyed this book. The descriptions were lovely and rich, and Fitzgerald really captured life and put it in this book. It is about a midwesterner named Nick who goes to New York and meets several characters including the rich nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. It then shows the progression of all of these people's relationships until the climax of the book.My only gripe would be that the characters are quite unlikeable. You can't relate to them. You can't sympathize with them. It's not that they're thinly drawn. They're not flat and two dimensional. One simply has to dislike all of these characters, though! The book would be perfect if I could at least have one character to hang on to, so to speak. Maybe see myself in. Despite that I still have to say it was an exceptional book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby in high school and I have picked it up and read it again many times since.My first few repeat readings were for the quality of the writing -- the absolute clarity and economy of the words, and the &quot;just right&quot; tone.And I still read The Great Gatsby for the writing, but now with each reading I seem to gain more sympathy for all of the characters -- even the brutish and stupid ones.I finish the story each time feeling that I have lived among those people, smelling their perfume, riding in their cars, dancing at their parties, guessing at their secrets.All these years and all these readings later, I still can't say precisely why Fitzgerald makes me feel this way, but each time I jump back into this wonderfully realized little book I feel as if Nick is beside me on the sofa or across from me at the table, telling me a story I have never heard before.In this day and age when every third or fourth novel is carelessly called a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; it is always a pleasure to read Nick's opening words, spoken especially and unambiguously to me, and know what a masterpiece truly is."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was recently voted as the second greatest english novel of the twentieth century, right behind Ulysses. And no wonder, The Great Gatsby is vintage America. As a panoramic snapshot of the Jazz-Age, The Great Gatsby provides a crystallized glimpse into the age that bore swing dancing, the end of prohibition and the new exhuberance of an America breaking out of the shell of old world puritanism. With poignancy and simple beauty, The Great Gatsby conveys the timeless story of endless love, and the jealousy that eventually murders it.The Great Gatsby is not simply a reflection of its times -- it is perhaps the greatest love story of the century. It is the story of a man who had everything but love, and gave everything for his love of Daisy -- a Marilyn Monroesque goddess who evokes the raw passions of innocence and beauty.The story is not complex -- nor is particularly innovative. What makes this novel a masterpiece is that Fitzgerald associates all these actions with a particular naivety -- the same naivety seen in Nick to Daisy to Gatsby. It is this unbridled ebullience that typifies the era that gave way to a depression which shackled the nation with fear for years to come. And in its particularly austere style, there arises an unmatched elegance, whose words cannot be matched by those who masquarade behind the incomprehensible jargon of \\"knowledge\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of the best classics American Literature has to offer.

The two if them end up confessing their true love for each other. This book comes across a lot danger, suspense, love, and friendship scenes.

A must read American classic! The perfect gift for students!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To me, one of the most depressing things about grad school was reading through great works of literature, finding one that I really loved, digging up criticism and scholarship about it so I could write my double-spaced ode to The Sound and the Fury or War and Peace or whatever... and discovering that the book was all used up.There was nothing I could possibly say about it that would be new. Every possible thought and conclusion had long since been had by dozens of other, more qualified people. Every minor character and allusion was already the subject of half a dozen moldering dissertations. Sure, I went ahead and wrote my little paper, but it didn't add anything to Timeless Academia's conversation on the subject.The Great Gatsby is one of those books. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said hundreds of times before, and neither can you.But lately, I've been having the most fun with these old books when I can arrange to read them with relatively new people. It's kind of wonderful to read alongside someone who's not had \\"Great American novel\\" tattooed under their eyelids, who isn't swallowing bile at the thought of churning out a five-paragraph essay at the end of it all - who still has room for virginal surprise and wonder and disgust as they turn the pages.I'm finding this mix of old book, new reader especially satisfying with Gatsby. You get that sense from the city itself: in the summer of 1922, everything is so new and extravagant and full of spectacle that a person could forget just how old and worn-down the world really is.So there it is, my one halfway original thought: if it's been awhile since 11th-grade English and you'd like to try this book again, see if you can get a fresh companion to take you to one of Gatsby's parties. They are really quite something."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time i read this book iwas bored because i didnt fully understand how Fitzgerald conveyed the plot of the story.

The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"An interesting story about that time in history when there was great wealth.

The book was in great condition."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As with many great works, I can read this book at many different times in my life and uncover new layers of meaning. F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a world that is almost like an optical illusion. With one twist of the wrist, something can appear as the exact opposite of what it previously seemed. The characters are presented in such a way as to create sympathy for them which ultimately leads the reader to excuse their reckless deeds.There is no character that doesn't have something to like about them, however superficial those attributes they may be. However, if one looks beyond the superficial allure, instead of being dazzled by that which shines on the surface, one can see the more important deficits of character and human decency.The character Daisy, with the constant references to her sonorous voice, alluring visage and pleasant demeanor, is painted as the perfect portrait of a modern day siren. She was indeed a \\"beautiful fool\\" who can get people to like her by acting in ways that pander to their sensibilities and expectations. It is because of her charms and her apparent helplessness that most readers will, in some way, excuse or minimize her cold-blooded actions. The fact that F. Scott Fitzgerald has the reader rooting for characters that are so obviously self-centered true testament to his skill as a writer.The writing is enjoyable to read. The character descriptions are memorable and the action of the novel is well-paced. I read this book in one afternoon."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was amazing.

Gatsby sports an english accent which is splendid in its own right. Although written in 1922, this book is very far ahead of its time as today, many Yale grads decide to go into high finance similar to Nick's decision to learn about the bond business in New York. The novel shows young, impressionable high school students that hard work and a little elbow greece can put you anywhere you want to be in life, even if that position is into the higher echelons of society."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Why is ' The Great Gatsby' so loved? Why is it so popular ? Why do literary critics value it so highly ?I will venture a few speculations without providing of course a definitive answer.One is that it is simply a beautifully written work. The tone the voice from the very beginning have a charm an appeal that draws us.Secondly, the book is about glamorous American, about money and success, great American themes.Thirdly, it's more deep theme is the theme of dream, also American dream, and reality. It is the green light of the great American future, it is the dream of young American making himself over into his own ideal. It is the American theme of the self- made man, the American dream story from Franklin on.Fourthly, it is the charm of Romance and great wealth.Fifthly, Fitzgerald's remarkable ability to create or capture an atmosphere, a feeling of time, of a special kind of American world. Consider the way he describes Grand Central Station or the trip out to the West, or the two Eggs of Long Island.It is about human loneliness and abandonment. The great scene of the aftermath, of Gatsby's home , of no one coming to the funeral except that one belated guest of the never- ending party.There is too the famous list of characters at the Gatsby party, a satirical list of America's social- climbing reality.And again the great dream and romance. Of the new continent opening before us. Of the American hero whose very dreaming is his greatness and romantic quality . And the failure too and the tragedy of Gatsby's fall. And the veniality and trivality of the American reality which contradicts and confounds the dream. The sordidness by which Tom Buchannan and his mistress bring Gatsby and Daisy down.And the final so American note of still seeking the new and better world, the great dream ahead .A work which simply holds it readers in its very special charm and grace, the quintessential American embrace.Out to the territory ahead of us, the green light , the orgiastic future a man's got to live and dream by."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story that consists of a lot of drama dealing with life, love, and social status. Each characters personalities and behavior is an example of every human beings temptations, flaws, wants, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald created the book The Great Gatsby in a way where it symbolizes a typical human being. Each character shows a human flaw, our arrogance, needs, wants, and temptations within life. He describes the steps we use to get there and how we try to be on top to achieve things.Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, Myrtle, and George are images of an idealistic American life. The way Daisy and her other family live is full of riches and never a day full of work. At the beginning of the book, Daisy admitted to herself that the things nobles do, like go on picnics, was a rather odd thing. That alone was a big point in the book because she segregated herself from the commoners. That proved that she thinks of herself of being different. Also, Gatsby, Daisy, and Myrtle all ends up having an affair in the book. The affair leads to unfortunate endings and a twisted story line.Overall, the book was great. Not only was it a great read, it had a great plot and the way the book was organized was spectacular. Fitzgerald not only wrote a great story, but he created a book that got in depth with the American society and the way we chase after our dreams. Making us realize that sometimes, no matter where time brings us too we cannot turn back time and live in the past. All that you can do is move on and be who you are, accepting the future and taking grasp of it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I believe this novel would be good for everyone to read.

Eliot coined the phrase objective correlative for the author's device of describing an object so that it reveals an emotional state, but without explicitly linking the object and the emotion in the narrative.Fitzgerald mentioned the green light three times in the novel. On page 26, when Nick is observing Gatsby gazing across the bay between East Egg and West Egg, Nick involuntarily glances seaward and distinguishes \\"nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.\\" On page 98, Gatsby says to Daisy, \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\" Finally, on page 189, at the end of the story, Nick the narrator tells us \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic* future that year by year recedes before us.\\" By then, the reader understands that the green light correlates to Gatsby's distracted longing for Daisy.*In his afterword, Mr. Bruccoli claims that Fitzgerald purposely used \\"orgastic\\" instead of \\"orgiastic.\\" The Encarta dictionary accepts orgastic, but not the Microsoft Word spell checker or my WordWeb Thesaurus.For those interested in a timeline, do a Google search on: \\"last day of summer,\\" 1922, Gatsby. The results should be two hits, both good timelines. The one on geocities has at least one error, however; it has Cody dieing in 1910 instead of five years later.I found 113 proper names of persons, some only given names, some only surnames in the story. Of these, 74 are names of Gatsby's guests listed on pages 65 - 67. Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story. He does not give \\"Owl Eyes\\" a proper name, but he figures as a significant character."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Quite simply, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is F. Scott Fitzgerald's tour de force.It ranks among the most literate works of the twentieth century.This story of the man who reinvents himself to win the woman he loves is multi-layered and laced with analogy upon analogy.It is more than just a love story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an indictment of the Jazz Age, new money and the shallow and selfish excesses that often accompany it.Jay Gatsby is a true mystery man.Even by novel's end he remains a shadowy figure lacking in substance or apparent texture.He is as much a mystery to the reader as he is to his associates and neighbours in the East Egg social set.Despite its numerous sub-texts, The Great Gatsby is ultimately a warning that, try as we may, we will never escape our pasts and that who we were is who we are."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is indeed a great book. Great books and authors are much like children, each one is both different and special, with different flaws and strenghs. To truly appreciate the unique beauty of Gatsby, you have to look in the right place.The tone of Gatsby is that of a man who is filled with a longing for a woman and a dream that he is driven to pursue. Gatsby is torn by his knowlege of the transparency of his illusive dream and his his obsessive need to conquer it.I do not admire chasing illusive dreams,I admire the courage to dream and the incredible drive it takes to chase the dream -- the power of his spirit and the courage that he shows when he holds nothing back in his quest, risking everything. It takes a brave hearted man to soar to remarkable heights only to crash to the ground, when the common man hugs the ground instead. We admire them when they soar and we admire them when they fall and manage to get up again.Great story, great writing, great book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Hard to believe that I'm just now getting around to reading this author and this classic. Fitzgerald's writing is very exquisite, full of imagery and his mastery of language is awesome. I found myself reading sentences twice. Not for understanding, but because I loved them so much I had to read it again. And the story...Gatsby. Such a sad reflection of what is known as the American Dream. Touching and thought provoking. Excellent read! Truly awesome!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This great and immaculately well-written novel is about a rich guy named Jay Gatsby and the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, who chooses money and security rather than love. I love the thought-provoking ending!!If you wanna know what it was like to be a young carefree person living in the roaring and decadent 1920's America, you must read &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; I think of this book as The Great American Novel. Its enduring popularity is a testament to that fact. Characters like Gatsby and Daisy show us that although fashions, cars, manner of speech, etc change, human nature stays the same, people who are a certain way think and act the same in similar situations.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In American literature, there are two distinct &quot;schools&quot; that emerged from the Lost Generation of ex-patriates who lived in Paris after World War I. These are the Hemingway and Fitzgerald wings of political novelization.Fitzgerald was a member of the East Coast elite, the Ivy Leaguers of the Hamptons known as the &quot;idle rich.&quot; Hemingway represents a more red-blooded Midwesternism, tempered by the war and it phyical and mental horrors.&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; describes a con man from the lower classes of Middle America who remakes himself. He achieves fabulous wealth in the heady early days of the Roaring 20s, at time when the stock market was unregulated by the SEC and such things could be accomplished. In the manner of the Count of Monte Cristo, he makes a fantastic splash on High Society, a nouveau riche pretty boy, supposedly an officer in the Army during the Great War, who owns a huge Long Island mansion and holds enormous Summer parties.The book centers on the angst of the idle rich, the love affairs of the morally ambiguous, people who must look for newer and more outrageous ways to tickle their fancies. Naturally, Gatsby's attractiveness among the gorgeous socialite women of the Hamptons stirs resentment among the old school boys, who question his validity.Fitzgerald here describes a world from the standpoint of guilt; guilt at being rich. He paints a picture of people who have money without having earned it, who are not worthy of it in the entrepreneurial sense. This is an elite, liberal view - the opposite of the more hard-scrabble Hemingway world.Political views aside, Fitzgerald is a fabulous writer who lends a distinct voice to the American literary scene. This is the proverbial Great American Novel.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I first started reading this book I didn't understand it but as it went along it really caught my attention.

The characters and Fitzgerald 's writing style are what sell the story"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recently re-read this after having first encountered it 14 years ago. What amazed me is how so many of Fitzgerald's phrasings remained with me during that time. It was like the story and the characters were timeless. My perspective on some of the individuals, however, did change. As a younger person, I saw Daisy as a more innocent actor in the final tragedy. As an older person, I recognize her silent complicity in evil. Years ago, I also saw Nick as naive. This time, I recognized that, in many ways, he grows throughout the story and becomes a good man.This is the first book in my lifetime that I've re-read. Based on the experience, I imagine I'll be doing it again and again with books I read as a younger person."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm assuming this book is considered a classic. I don't read the classics that often, so I wouldn't know. But anyway, I've heard of this one all my life, and watched part of the movie a couple times, I think. The other day, it so happened I was in the mood for literary fiction, and already having an armchair historian's interest in the 1920s, I waded in.Story-wise, I didn't quite know what to expect. Turns out, the plot is an age-old standard about a poor boy's devotion to a privileged girl. Thrown into the mix is a rags-to-riches theme, a couple intersecting love triangles, the futility of material ambitions, the disease of wealth and much analytical fodder for social anthropologists.Gatsby is great, as I see it, only in his heroic determination in conquering the world (well, financially conquering a significant piece of it, anyway) to win the heart of the narrator's cousin, Daisy. Daisy is one of those girls who is fun and bubbly at casual social events, held at arm's distance. Under her attractive surface, however, is a shallow, vapid conformist hardly worth the efforts Gatsby has labored at to ascend to her snobby caste. Daisy's hypocritical two-timing blowhard husband is even less likable. Though Gatsby has amassed his wealth by extra-legal means, he was by far the most sympathetic character for me, even without the poignant destiny.I don't know if this was considered light reading in 1925, but today Fitzgerald's prose would befuddle all but the most literate. Not to say he meanders into introspective tedium as James Jones did 30 years later. Fitzgerald reminds me of Victorian-era authors who spent considerable time spelling out their observations of subtle human nuances/intuiting/speculating about the cognitive patterns they translated to. It's actually enjoyable, and didn't tax my 21st Century attention span too often. It was obvious, however, that F. Scott's favorite word was \\"vitality.\\"There is a murder, of sorts, in this novel, but the mystery that makes it worthwhile is the title character."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought the book would be a in a little better shape, but it is still in its binding so I guess that's okay, thank you for the speedy shipping."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At the instigation of an Amazon friend, I am about to read a noted novel of the Jazz Age, \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", by John Dos Passos. Before doing so, however, I decided to re-read what is commonly regarded as THE novel of the Jazz Age, THE GREAT GATSBY, which not too long ago I had proposed to another Amazon friend as one of the ten best American novels. I did so based on having read it in high school and then, over the years, having from time to time heard it nominated as \\"The Great American Novel\\".Well, upon re-reading it, I now would dispute it as THE great American novel and I no longer would propose it as one of the ten best. For one thing, it is somewhat superficial. For another, it does not really hang together. For a third, its characters tend towards the one-dimensional. (But then, its author was only 29 when he wrote it.) But, despite its flaws, THE GREAT GATSBY is powerful. There is something mythical about it. And it is a distinctively American myth - about mammon and materialism; dreams and desires; craving and crassness. And it ends in operatic tragedy. So even if it is NOT one of the ten best American novels, it IS quite possibly one of the ten best novels ABOUT America - perhaps not America as many of us would like to envision it, but America nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After about a million name drops, Facebook reading tests and dopey confusion with Marsden's the Great Gatenby, I finally read Gatsby over a Saturday afternoon.Mixed reactions. Certainly set in an unusual time for the setting of a novel - the jazz age apparently - the time after the Great War, but before the Great Depression. It's odd for an author to focus on a time not automatically associated with great strife and suffering.Or so I thought. What struck me most about Gatsby was Fitzgerald's portrayal of opulence was filled with this desperate hopelessness and lack of morality, a theme which carried right up to the end of the novel.I'm no great literature connoisseur, however to me the balance of Gatsby was a little rushed. Almost everything about the setting and the characters of the novel were well set up. Our narrator Nick's earnest disposition, his friend Tom's darkness and Gatsby's mad optimism. However when the action truly started in felt like it was all over in a second.Nonetheless, I will say the Great Gatsby has a unique flavour to it, quite unlike anything you will read today, and in a market where literature seems to mean languishing for endless pages over every detail, a novel where we as readers are thrown about in sudden events makes for pretty compelling reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is the quintessential American novel for me.

Symbolism is prevelant throughout the book, so read carefully! The characters show the shallowness of people, and the idea that money buys everything...even love is hinted at throughout the novel. A definite must read. For those who read it at a young age, read it over again, you won't regret it. I read it sophomore year and I also thought it was a &quot;soap opera,&quot; but now _The Great Gatsby_ is my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is probably one of the best novels of its time in the sense that it depicts the disillusionment of the Jazz Age to a tee! Gatsby's love for Daisy is not &quot;love&quot; in the sense that you or I know, but a kind of sick perversion or more aptly put - the inability for him to come to terms with his past. The need to have money and the need to be known in the Jazz Age is forever present in the book, and, from what we know of Gatsby's past, is something that Gatsby strove for his entire life. The reason his love affair with Daisy failed was because he had nothing! Love was not enough for Daisy in the relationship, and *her&quot; disillusionment was with her need for material possessions: money, cars, fancy dresses, fabulous parties, etc. I find the role of Nick in the entire novel to be somewhat strange since I think that it would have been a good story without his presence, and my favorite part of the book is when he realizes it is his birthday - as if that is something one can forget. Gatsby's death at the end is envitable since I think the book comes full circle. Gatsby is violently awakened, and, perhaps, never realizes his disillusionment. I think though the end of the book reinforces this sense of disillusionment with the American dream when Nick sums up his encounter with Daisy and her husband. They apparently carry on as if nothing had happened, Dasiy doesn't leave Tom, and Gatsby's &quot;role&quot; as a martyr is ignored. Not even the death of Daisy's former love could bring her out of her disillusioned state. Of course there are many other themes - the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby, the mysterious glasses which recurs throughout the novel and many more... All in all...a very good book historically, sociologically, and psychologically. I've read it at least four times and will probably read it many more times!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As I was reading through the other reviews, I noticed something. Nobody was ableto really say &quot;why&quot; they liked the book. The reason (as I believe itto be) is that the Gatsby shows characteristics that we allhave inside of ourselves, that all our descendants will have, and that all ourancestors had. We all havea yearning to return to the past and to avoid the mistakes that we made. To return to theGarden, and avoid giving into temptation. To find a new land(i.e. America) and have a new beginning (as the dutch sailorstried to do and as Gatsby fails at). We all believe in the Myth of Edenic possibilities(the belief that one can return to his/her past and avoid themistakes that they made) and so does Gatsby. But that's not theentire reason readers are fascinated with Gatsby. Throughout the entire novel, F. ScottFitzgerald debunks the American Dream of going west to startover. He does so by having Gatsby go east, and making it sothat he can't be successful without going outside the law. But throughout the novel,Gatsby never gives up. He's like the man who was standingin the trash after one of Gatsby's parties. Just as this manrefused to acknowlege that he couldn't live in the past, so Gatsby refuses. Gatsby refuses toacknowlege that he can't go back to when he first met Daisy, before she marriedTom. There is a lot more to this book than what others havesaid, and there is still a lot more than what I have outlined. Although, I hope that thiswill allow some people to realize that The GreatGatsby is more than just a love story between two people. Everytime I read it (I've read it at least 5 times), I pick up new symbols and archetypeswhich allow me to see this masterpiece through new lenses.It truly is an American Classic, which everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As an English major I've come across numerous examples of excellent literature. Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_ is, in my opinion, THE definitive American literary classic. The author's use of language, characterization, and subtle symbolism is simply amazing! The last line of this novel has become one of the most hauntingly beautiful lines in literary history. Do yourself a great favor and read this novel--my highest possible praises!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is the best short novel of the twentieth-century. Fitzgerald's portrayl of Jay Gatsby focuses on his own life in many aspects and that is what makes the book so real. The book contains much complexity, reflecting the era of the roaring twenties."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Supergreat beyond compare. A Fun book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Could a short work of just over 100 pages that centers on an insularized social station and contains numerous inconsistencies and no continuous narrative be the mythical &quot;Great American Novel?&quot; Could the lionized author of this work in actuality be a philandering alcoholic who wasted the better part of his life and talent galavanting across the beaches of Europe with a dry gin in one hand and his diary in the other?The assignation of The Great Gatsby into the junior high school curriculum personifies its persecution complex. A generation of readers have explored only the most topical of its themes, the symbolism of the green light, the excesses of the Jazz Age, the positioning of the narrator. To students of serious literature, The Great Gatsby is seen as more of an introduction than an immersion. A excellent book by a gifted, yet misguided writer. Nothing more.However, Fitzgerald proves more adept than thought. By the magical end of the novel, his topical Jazz Age themes grow into ruminations on the importance of money and love and the dissapation of the American Dream. The characters transform from stereotypical players in a fable to archetypal representatives of human fraility. The structure, despite the shortness of the novel, is compelling. Nine distinct scenes flow and weave together effortlessly through narrative and flashback. The chronological discrepencies drift away; just as Fitzgerald's prose seems to drift in, wondrous and ephemeral.Fitzgerald plays no stylistic gymnastics or ouija board gambits with his novel, and perhaps this is why it often is found lacking in comparison to the works of Faulkner, Joyce, and Hemingway. Fitzgerald did not invent the &quot;iceburg theory&quot; or pen a novel of the length and scope of Ulysses. But, The Great Gatsby possesses the unmistakable qualities of excellence; able to be read in one sitting, it leaves the reader breathless and emotionally spent pondering themes as eloquent as any in literature and as timely today as they were during the Roaring Twenties. Every time the radio blares the Boss and &quot;Glory Days&quot; or Simon and Garfunkel and &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; it echoes the sentiments of Fitzgerald's book. In painting a nation afraid to relinguish its storied past, The Great Gatsby searches for that &quot;one fine morning . . .&quot; when we are able to come to grips with who we were and concentrate on who we are and will become. No other book so wonderfully crystallizes the struggle of man and his infinite ability to dream with the parameters of time. The Great Gatsby is a marvelous achievement; just because you read it as a child, do not hesitate to read it again.

Fitzgerald captures so much of human attitude in his characters and the telling of the story that each reading brings a fresh insight not only to the story, but to its relevancy in the late 20th century.Two particular comments: doesn't it strike you that our current inhabitants of the White House are Daisy and Tom Buchannon? Easy to be friend with, but they are not friends on whom you can rely. They use people not deliberately, one suspects, but rather innocently, as Daisy and Tom do. Though I voted for Bill in primaries and general elections, it's been an interesting revelation to me to see the Buchannons come alive in Whitewater, Paula Jones, personal aides left dangling before committee investigations, and the like.Second comment: this edition is the best I've seen. I purchased it several years ago and Bruccoli's insight is wonderful. After reading his discussion of time and Fitzgerald's use of time tables, time of day (both painstakingly accurate and terribly casual), and even how the chapters in the final version never quite made sense, I enjoyed a stronger sense of the mastery of the work.Enough.

Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.Don't read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because you have to. Read it because you want to. And then put it aside and live a few more years of life. Then come back to it. You will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've read this book several times, and each reading shows me something else that I didn't know before. If you want a clarifying perspective on the great, powerful, capitalistic engine that we call the United States, read this book. If you have ever had a dream that you just couldn't let go, look in the mirror, and you'll see Jay Gatsby staring right back at you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is absolutely my favorite novel of all time. No matter how many times I go back and re-read this book (that I was first introduced to as a sophomore in high school), it never fails to take me to a different time and place.I love the descriptions of the lazy and decadent ways of these characters and the struggle Nick Carroway has to be a part of them. I love the scandals that are around every curve. But, most of all, I love the easy-going manner of Gatsby himself. He's quite possibly the greatest character in all of American literature and I feel that, often times, he's the least appreciated too.I've heard many say that this novel is \\"too slow\\" or \\"too descriptive\\". But, I really feel that Fitzgerald was trying to completely overwhelm the reader with excess. It's an underlying theme in this novel and his writing style makes the reader feel the fact that money can not buy happiness. Sure this novel is wordier than some - But there's beauty in each and every carefully chosen one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have always loved FSF's writing. His prose is beautifully poetic. This is his best work by far. The book comes alive in this reading by Alexander Scourby. I have listened to this recording probably 10 times over the last few years and I never tire of the story or the way it is read. I have also listened to the version read by Tim Robbins and he doesn't do the book justice. He portrays Gatsby as kind of a dour fellow. I have always viewed Gatsby as the ultimate romantic and that is how he is portrayed by Scourby in this reading. I cannot recommend this audio enough."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a difficult novel that successfully polarizes readers, especially ones who take it seriously. That marks great literature. When serious readers react oppositely to the same work, you know you are looking at good, if not great, art. Please note, too, that the range of reviews today mirrors the range of reviews that greeted this book when it arrived new in bookstores over 80 years ago. You can easily search those then-current reviews on the Internet for your own amusement and instruction and once again be surprised over how little people change. For some of us, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a wonder, while it leaves others wondering at us.To describe briefly the novel: Set in the American 1920s at the height of a stock market boom in the Roaring Twenties, this novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a wealthy, young Ivy League graduate who's learning the bond business on Wall Street. Nick tells us about his life at the time as it connects with a second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, from Louisville, who is married to the fabulously and formidably wealthy Tom Buchanan. Tom and Nick schooled together at Yale where Nick had an uneasy relationship with the larger, wealthier, and crueler Tom Buchanan. The story unfolds with Nick, Daisy, Tom, and an attractive female golf pro, Jordan Baker, out on the glistening lawns of the wealthy sections of Long Island. Fold in Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson and her clueless, but devoted husband, George, and we have a strong story, but nothing about this Gatsby guy. Only when we are well into the story do we hear about the title character, Jay Gatsby, and he is slowly brought into plot and character development. Gatsby has been driving this novel from the beginning, but we don't know that. We learn in subtle, indirect fashion that Daisy and Gatsby have a mutual past that neither our narrator, Nick, nor her husband, Tom, discern or know. And in that past connection we grasp the proximate, animating force of the novel: Gatsby loved Daisy then and loves her now. The novel unfolds as Daisy learns that Gatsby owns a mansion across the bay from her estate. The old lovers cross paths again - one forcing the reunion, the other gliding into it - and we have all the action that will drive the remainder of the novel. I reveal nothing more and observe: The novel is simple and obvious, a story of wealthy, sophisticated people in boom times, with a narrator watching a married couple that has romantic rivals.The basic plot and character in part explain why serious readers can be so seriously divided over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Virtually everyone who dislikes the novel finds it to be simplistic, boring, and obvious. Gee whiz, let's try to get interested in people who have everything in life yet have trouble doing anything in life well. Tom and Daisy have it all, yet are stupid, shallow, and thoughtless people. Gatsby at least strives for something better and while he achieves great wealth, notoriety, and popularity, he, too, suffers from problems that should be easy to solve given his talents and resources. Jordan Baker, the female golf pro, is successful, famous, and attractive, but alas she can't make her life work. And, Nick, our narrator, seems to observe everything well, except for himself. All in all, we have a cast of characters who warrant scorn, dismissal, and contempt.And yet, other serious readers see Gatsby as a great novel, a work of art. How?Start first with a quality that almost all serious readers notice and admire: The writing. Fitzgerald writes romantic sentences with a Hemingway edge. His words are at once beautiful and descriptive. Even readers who overall disparage the book, heed the writing, and marvel at it. The voice is unique, esthetic, and sharp. Gatsby is Fitzgerald's finest writing and certainly some of the best writing in English anytime. But writing skill alone will not save this book for some serious readers.What earns this disdain, I think, is found in the deceptive simplicity of the book. At a genuine level of analysis the story is rather easy to grasp, understand, and evaluate. Especially if you are reading this book under requirement as it appears many students experience, the psychological demands of the classroom (it's required, a specific timeline, deadlines for completing various chapters, assignments in class or for homework on the book, etc.) I think lead many readers into the worst outcome for a reading class - you read to survive the course rather than for your own simple entertainment and education. Under these conditions, the obvious, simple, and designed elements of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" attract immediate attention in the short term demands of required reading and lead some readers to obvious, simple, and designed conclusions about the book. If you've \\"had\\" to read Gatsby, give it a year, and try once again. It's not a maturity issue. It's a motivation issue: Read it for yourself on your own terms.If you read for yourself, you can reflect on complexities in the book. Realize first that Fitzgerald writes differently about Tom and Daisy than he does for Nick or Jordan Baker, or the minor, but important characters like Myrtle and George Wilson, but most especially for Gatsby. With Tom and Daisy, Fitzgerald tends to offer direct and immediate observations of their behavior and thoughts as if he is looking them right now with a God's eye view and telling us about them. He really gets under the skin with Tom and Daisy. With Gatsby, by contrast, most of the writing is a narrative recounting of the past that is cloudy, perhaps misremembered, and operates as description with little interpretation or with contradiction from an unreliable narrator (Nick). This makes the characters of Tom and Daisy seem like high quality photos while Gatsby comes off more like a portrait done by an Impressionist painter: Clearly a portrait, but with shadows and no sharp edges. Tom and Daisy are objects. Gatsby is all subject and he becomes a Rorschach test allowing us to project ourselves onto him.Next, you need to be alert to absolutely crucial plot actions that are briefly presented and can be easily missed. The climatic action of the story in particular requires the reader to do a lot of work and keep certain actions in mind through a long series of character reactions and developments. Recall the scene late in the book that takes place in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Who's in the scene? What do they say to each other? How are relationship conflicts resolved? Then, the characters move rapidly out of the Plaza Hotel and drive back to West and East Egg in separate cars. How do those car rides manifest behaviorally the relationship conflicts resolved earlier in the Hotel? Stated another way, in the Hotel we hear conflict and resolution. From the car rides we see how that conflict and resolution play out in action. This sequence is the ultimate plot point for the novel that drives interpretation. You need to read it carefully.Finally, you need to relate what we hear and see regarding relationship conflict and resolution with the interpretation and understanding of Jay Gatsby. You'll recall that Tom and Daisy are bright, detailed, and sharp characters while Gatsby is vague, shadowed, and blurry. You can try to understand Gatsby through the events that occur following the car rides back to the Eggs. For you see, the whole point of the book is in what happens to Gatsby and what happens to Gatsby is caused by his character. (So, Fitzgerald exemplifies that maxim that all writers steal and that good writers steal from the best which in this case is Fitzgerald stealing from Heraclitus!)For many people the basic theme of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is this: Be careful what you wish for. I think at a simple level of analysis this is true. At a deeper level (one that follows my suggestions above) I would refine that theme into this: Be careful what you aspire to. For me, this novel is a great cautionary meditation on the American Dream and its less pleasant possibilities. In positive form, the American Dream is that you can be more than you started with. That explains in part why this book is often required for younger readers in high school or college who are taking their first real steps toward realizing their own American Dream. Fitzgerald offers Gatsby as a caution to those of us who think that aspiration past our beginnings is a good thing, a desirable thing, and the point of ambition. Everyone in this novel aspires to be more than they seem to be or who they are. Everyone in this novel suffers loss, failure, or disaster. No one in this novel leaves with any awareness of why they failed. Yet most of the characters can be described as either great challengers to the American Dream or else already living the American Dream. How is it possible for such failure to occur?In my eyes, the answer is found in the last sentence of the novel: \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Aspiration moves \\"against the current.\\" Ambition motivates us not to a positive manifestation of the Dream, with the Dream as the Vision or Goal of one's life, but rather ambition motivates us to a negative manifestation of the Dream, with Dream as Fantasy or Psychosis or UnReality. And for those of us who aspire, we will find ourselves \\"borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" a modern Sisyphus doomed to push the stone uphill to the crest only to see it roll down to the valley every time.That is a soul-chilling thought. Isn't this kind of ambition a good thing? Don't all good parents aspire for their children to aspire? Doesn't it all fall down if we don't aspire? It is not that anyone in the novel aspires badly or stupidly or illegally, but rather that they aspire at all is the root and branch of their failure. Here, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" argues that it is ambition itself that will cause people to fail and worse still to fail without insight and repair, for as long as you continue to aspire you will continue to fail.This is an interesting and heuristic interpretation. First, it breaks free of the simple and obvious surface appearances and misdirections that divert some readers: It's the 1920s and irrelevant; it's about a bunch of spoiled white folks; it's about the vita loca. Clearly, there's a lot more going on here and it requires careful, thoughtful reading and reflection. Second, it explains why Gatsby is still appealing to so many people even after 80 years. It turns out that we are still living in a Modern age and the current Postmodern foolishness is explained by the past: Gatsby and Tom and Daisy and Nick would call themselves Postmodern today. The American Dream here is the defining element of Modernism and the fact that we're still aspiring the same old way like Jay Gatsby connects with us at a deep level. Third, it reinforces the perceived greatness of the novel that many readers see and continue to see. This is not only a well written, well structured, pretty novel, it also addresses eternal human nature and the repetitive futility we experience in life. Gatsby is dramatic philosophy, a better written Platonic dialog.Or so I think."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The beauty of this book is that Fitzgerald's elegant prose flows so nicely into the story being told. It is wonderfully written, but not distractingly so.I can't give the book 5 stars -- I save that for only the books I truly think are perfect -- but The Great Gatsby is definitely worth reading. For anyone who has ever felt that deep sense of purpose or meaning in a world that feels bloated with socialite zombies, Fitzgerald's novel is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald broke literary ground with this novel. His style--clean-chiseled characterizations and sentences that cut to the chase--was unlike the work of his contemporaries.Most novels that influence literature in this way die a short death. They are stylistically innovative, but soon other writers perfect what they pioneered. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of simultaneously innovating and perfecting. In that, the novel is pure genious.The Great Gatsby is the saddest novel I have ever read, because it goes to a deeper level than just tear-jerking. It ends in a place of complete emptiness, despair, and loss. It's a book that will satisfy you emotionally and intellectually, and also a book that will show you how powerful true emotion can be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is true the story is not particuarly Original, but to qoute the wisdom of solomon The only reason something is believed to be new is because we have forgoten the past. It is extremly well written with lavish description that is not laborious, but enjoyable. The choice of Narrator as Nick carroway is brilliant, as it gives proper perspective. I don't believe the Previous reviewers understand what Fiztgerald was trying to convey. The perspective reminds me Seneca's Thyestes in the it is about are desire to fill the emptiness in our souls. The charecters in the great gatsby are longing for something that will make them happy. Something that will revive the joys of the past. Tom buchuan and Gatsby are both trying to pursue the oldest pursuit of mankind; the Pursuit of Happiness. The Tragedy is that nothing will fill their emptiness even though they think they can."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Now, at the age of 15, I am reading this book, The Great Gatsby. I was not forced into reading this novel, but coaxed into reading it by my older sister. After the completion of the book it took a few days of pondering before I could make a clear knowledge of it's contents. I enjoyed reading it, staying up until three or four o' clock in the morning on schoolnights just to find out what happens.

That first time I read it, I thought it was extremely boring, and couldn't even get past the first 8 pages. However, when it was assigned to me in my English class the following year, I learned how rich it was in it's symbolism and style. It really made me question where our society is headed in terms of ethics and materialism. I can see how people who may not totally understand this book will find it boring and slow, as I had experianced it when I first read it. However, I recommend it as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone in high school or above."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that is probably one that I will be able to remember for the rest of my life. I say this because it has so much to do with the realities of today, not just of the early twenties. These include issues of love, social status, and money. Following the life of Gatsby makes you realize how much all of us has experienced at one point in our lives what he is experiencing. The novel was well written with numerous methaphors to give readers their own interpretations of different scenes. Take for example the locations of East Egg and West Egg separated by the harbor, symbolizing the separation of the rich and the poor and that Jay Gatsby may never be with the woman he loves. This and many other things make this a great book. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys to read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book because it was assigned to me in my english class. I had heard a lot about it, but I was sceptical of how good it would be. In the end, I really enjoyed it. I felt it did an excellent job of conveying the greed and materialism of Americans in the 20s and it can certainly apply to Americans today. Fitzgerald is an amazing author. Every word of his novel is important and included for some reason. There is also remarkable symolism that I thoroughly enjoyed discussing in class."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Well, the first time I read this book was when I was 13 and trying to fit into the &quot;big leagues,&quot; modeling after my brother who gave me the book and said I'd hate it because the content would seem all too mundane. Well, I hated it. I hated it so much, I would have never recommended it...Now, I'm 16 and I re-read it three days ago, and I have to say it's the most wondeful piece of American Literature ever written. It stands above and beyond To Kill a Mockingbird (though that is VERY debatable), The Grapes of Wrath, An American Tragedy, and even Old Man and the Sea.I would suggest reading the book if you are into a master perception of the human character, and enjoy stories of rich people and greed and luminous lifestyles.At times, I wanted to tear the book right in half because I got into it so much and actually had real emotions, which is something very few books have allowed me to recieve. The only two are A Prayer for Owen Meany and Of Mice and Men...wait...also Lord of the Flies. But once I finsihed the book, I thought about it, and realized how damn good it really is.Read it if you have a good sense of diversified taste.

Through his portrayal of the incorrigible and and somewhat naive Gatsby, the self-made man, the reader begins to understand some of the mindset of the time; the pursual of the American Dream and the corruption that was necessarily involved. A great book, with a range of characters (though some are irritating) and wonderful symbolism and meaning, especially with regard to the color. The Great Gatsby is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Truly, I know this is a American novel. This book to me, got boring really fast.

Though the novel didn't get very popular until after Fitzgerald's death, the novel is definately a must-read. There is so much meaning within the book if you look at it. It is full of different motifes, for example, the repetition of some colors and the disappearance of others, the idea of fascades... There is even a good connection between this novel and Homer's epic Oddyssey, which I won't get into. Anyways, Fitzgerald's style is fantastic, as is the story - full of intrigue and criticism of the times."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This story is amazing and eloquently written. At a '1st glance' and a 1st read, it seems like a simple love story with a tragic ending. However, having studied the novel and explored its issues and themes, the broader and more significant issues are brought to our understanding and we realize what Fitzgerald is really trying to tell us. The way that it conveys this message very subtly and in an eloquent way, is its strongest point. It is books like this,Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and many others, which really give a book a real meaning for us to realize of the world we live in.

Dark, mysterious, and rich, we never really get a good look at him (don't watch the movie for this reason), but he's an intriguing character, worth at least a glance.I don't know if this book is a classic, but I don't know what makes a classic.

Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was written during the time of the roaring twenties. The novel has many themes, but the most dominating one is the death of the American Dream which died because of Jay Gatsby's involvement in organized crime. Nick Carraway is the narrator of the story. The story starts when he [Nick] is leaving the Mid-West to start a new life in New York. There is where he meets Jay Gatsby, who is a rich man and the protagonist of the novel. Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchannan, who is coincidentally Nick's cousin. Even though Daisy is married to a man named Tom Buchanan, she is very much in love with Gatsby. Tom is the bad guy in the story or the antagonist. Tom is having an affair with a lady named Myrtle Wilson. He treats Myrtle very badly, but she puts up with it because of his wealth. Myrtle is married to George Wilson who is the hard luck guy in the novel who in the end takes out his revenge on someone that did not deserve it. Jordan Baker is the woman in brings Gatsby to Nick and consequently Gatsby to his long lost love Daisy. In the end it is revealed that Gatsby and Daisy are very much in love. When Tom finds out about this he gets very upset and tells George Wilson that Gatsby is having an affair with his wife. Raged, Wilson goes and murders Gatsby for something he did not do. The story ends tragicically because Myrtle and George are all killed in violently. Fitzgerald's main purpose of writing this novel was to briefly describe what it was like in the 1920's. In the critical essays that I read it seems that Fitzgerald's purpose in writing the essay was to relate himself to Gatsby. Gatsby is described as Fitzgerald which I don't believe is right because he [Gatsby] is described as the &quot;victim&quot; in the story when really he is not."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"C'&eacute;tait tr&egrave;s bon! j&eacute; l'ai lu pour mon classe d'anglais.. je n'aime pas Robert Redford Au revoir !"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recommend this book because it gives a realistic view of the American Dream in the 1920s. The '20's were a time of change for women. They were cutting their hair, working for the right to vote and playing golf. These new freedoms were enjoyed by the character Jordan Baker.The '20's were also a time of getting rich. Lots of people were making money on the stockmarket, but only white people. All of the characters in the Great Gatsby were Caucasian.The '20's were a time of organized crime and bootleggers. Gatsby was rumored to be earning his wealth illegally. Life had lost its meaning for the rich. Daisy Buchanan's life was filled with material comforts and luxuries, and empty of purpose. &quot;What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon, and the day after that, and the next thirty years?&quot; she asks one afternoon.Nick Carraway, the main character, symbolizes the average, middle class person who dreams of being rich. He moved East for a better job and more money. During the course of the book, he learns to know rich people. (Daisy is his cousin.) He realizes that the American Dream is not as dreamy as it appears to be. In fact, part of the American Dream is a nightmare. Still the desire to be rich and have the American Dream is strong and hard to resist. Myrtle Wilson is treated shabbily by Tom Buchanan a rich man with whom she is having an affair. Still she prefers time with the rich Tom to the life she has with her husband who is poor.I enjoyed this realistic view of the American Dream in the 1920s."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is truely a well planned novel which has a slow beginning into conflict and reaches it's climax only towards the end.

As you can see, The Great Gatsby by F.

Furthermore, they were not satisfied with their wealth which contributed to the surprise ending. I think the author is trying to tell the readers that everyone wants to have a successful life, but some people may have to work harder than other people to obtain a successful life. Also, there are a lot of people who started with poverty but still succeeded in life. The book taught me not to focus only on money but to focus more on healthy relationships.It did not take me a long time to finish this book.

Scott Fitzgerald is a fantastic novel of the Jazz age that mostly describes the differences and struggles between various social classes. After reading this book, I can see the fantastic connection between the original cover art and the conflict of emotions within The Great Gatsby. The title itself connects perfectly with the character of Jay Gatsby; he is truly The Great Gatsby.The story within this modernist novel is the story of Nick Carraway, a young man of the midwest. Carraway moves to New York during the summer of 1922. Nick visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. From the visit with them on, Nick's life only becomes more and more chaotic. The layer that covered the infidelity and chaos of those in this book is suddenly peeled back. I really enjoyed the dramatic element of this novel simply because the drama keeps the book riveting. However, the amount of infidelity in this book portrays that perhaps the author could not think of another way to keep things alluring.Fitzgerald is a very eloquent author. His words seem to undulate across the pages as they flow together. I had to read some lines multiple times to truly get the meaning, but I did not mind because in diong that one recieves a deeper connection with the text. All in all, I recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Or maybe I never knew! I read this when I was a teenager and certainly didn't pick up on all the nuances or the impeccable way Fitzgerald crafted the story. I know this book is taught in high school--although I don't remember it being part of required reading for me at the time. It was just a book that you read, like you had to try smoking cigarettes at that age. I think I was too young to get it. I didn't understand Daisy or Gatsby, and especially Nick. It seemed to me everyone was his or her own worst enemy, except maybe for Jordan who got short shrift. The whole scene, dissolute rich people in the 1920s, was beyond my comprehension. One of the only scenes that stuck in my memory was that of Gatsby flinging his numerous clean shirts around his bedroom to show off how wealthy he'd become. Reading it now, as a supposedly mature adult, I was touched by the masterful descriptions and the economy with which Fitzgerald communicates his characters' emotions. I had never realized the implications of where Gatsby's wealth came from, and totally missed the desolation of the funeral secne. The book was maybe too subtle for me as a teen. I was moved by it as an adult. I recommend it, even if you've read it before."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can, says Gatsby. Essentially, this is the prototypical Great American Novel - that old cliche of pop literary culture so often used by writers and laymen alike. The book conflates America's promise of the past, corruption of the present, and hope for the future. It is the beautiful and ugly side of American ambition, optimism, and sense of invincibility that makes so many Americans feel immortal.The story, which Mencken inevitably declared to be a trivial anecdote, is nevertheless an exciting look into twentysomething romanticism. Glamorous parties, nouveuax riche and old money values colliding, the luxury of youthful idleness, whirlwind romance. This is the perfect book for a high school student with dreams.More than anything, this book struck me as a metaphor for timeless American ethos. Gatsby makes the paradoxical attempt to move against the tide of the future to bring back the past. He wants, like so many people, to bring back that magical moment in his life when he thought life was eternal, the world was beautiful, and he was the biggest man in it. He wants to recapture the love that opened a plethora of infinite possibilities, turning his back on the reality of changing times and changing people.Gatsby's greatness is in making himself and others believe the sublime fantasy that thinks itself real. He wants his Daisy as so many other people have wanted theirs - pure, perfect, and existing solely for him. The ambition to defeat life may become tragic, but it never gives up hope - the hope of a better, stronger tomorrow. And in the end, it is action that moves the world, but it is hope that keeps the world alive."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If I was a high school student forced to read this and have to answer test questions on it, I would not think so highly of this book. However, now thirty and coming to this on my own I found a book that has righfully earned it's place among our few American classics. At first, Fitzgerald's poetic and economic prose takes some time getting used to. I found myself rereading certain passages. It did win me over though, after the first page where the narrator defines personality as &quot;an unbroken series of successfull gestures.&quot; He has other witty observations throughout and I was surprised to see how funny the book could be at times.Symbolism aside the story is a decent, readable one. The premise is a young man starting out in 1920's New York after the end of Worls War I whose next door nieghbor is the self-assured but mysterious Jay Gatsby. This may seem boring to some, but I hesitate to say more at the risk of giving anything away. Trust me, there more to it. At first it meanders, seeming to string a series of almost random but interesting vignettes depicting the jazz age. For those who may want to give up on the book at that point, I say don't. Fitzgerald has been setting the reader up. The other shoe drops halfway through the novel. Also a note on the characters. Even though you may not agree what the characters are doing, at least it invokes a reaction. Which is more than I can say of the &quot;classics&quot; that I was forced to read in high school.The themes in Gatsby are very poignant. Showing us how fragile dreams and perceptions, both self and outside, can be. And that sincere intentions do not always come from honest sources. Is this the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;? I don't know, I have a few more books to go before I make that assumption. What I can tell you is that I has a pleasant time reading this one and see why many people think so."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a novel set in 1920s New York City that precisely captures the mood and tenor of what came to be known as the Jazz Age. The story focuses on the flashily affluent Jay Gatsby, who made his fortune through dubious means, his more modest neighbor Nick, Nick's captivating cousin Daisy Buchanan and her wealthy husband Tom. Gatsby hopes to use his material success to win the adoration of Daisy, who happens to be a love from his past, before he went off to war. However, Gatsby\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d ends up paying a heftier price - his life - for the girl he has passionately but secretly pursued through the years.On the surface, The Great Gatsby seems like a book designed solely for leisure reading purposes. But dig beneath that surface, and the reader excavates some philosophical themes. For example, since Daisy did not marry Gatsby at the time of their affair because he lacked wealth, when Gatsby returns from the war, he is intent upon making a fortune in order to lure her back to him. His efforts ultimately doom him, reflecting the dour consequences of material obsession. Additionally, Gatsby's fervent focus on Daisy after so many years have lapsed exposes the peril inherent in clinging too closely to far-fetched fancies.But while Fitzgerald deftly works these themes, sometimes his commentary on the moral substance of his characters is ambiguous. He appears to revel in Jazz Age excesses, as portrayed in Gatsby's elaborate parties and in the characters' periodic jaunts to the city. Yet, through the sober-minded narration of Nick, Fitzgerald also seems to indict Gatsby for his ostentacious display of wealth. Furthermore, Fitzgerald draws Gatsby in a dualistic way - he simultatenously shows him as a man of principle and as a starry-eyed fool for persistently pursuing Daisy. But perhaps Fitzgerald simply wants us to make up our own minds about Gatsby rather than preach to us, or maybe he wants to show how human weaknesses can serve as strengths and vice versa, depending on the scenario.The character of Nick is credibly drawn; he represents temperance, but also passivity, as he appears to float on the fringes of his friends' lives rather than actively indulge in them. Indeed, as narrator, Nick allows us to see the story through his eyes, and while we never lack insight into his feelings, we also never feel pressured to see things his way; Nick's tone is calmly questioning rather than priggishly pedantic.Tom Buchanan as a vapidly wealthy and viciously philandering spouse is artfully conceived; whether he's flaunting his latest love at a party or speaking haughtily about the menaces of black economic progress, reader disdain for Tom is never far from the surface.But it's Daisy Buchanan who steals the show in The Great Gatsby; a mishmash of contradictions, Daisy exudes a sultry charm that masks a profound restiveness with her current lifestyle. She wants desperately to break free from her stifling circumstances, and Gatsby provides the catalyst for her to do so. Yet, she is constrained by convention, and Fitzgerald permits us to feel the tragic dimensions of her fate throughout the story. This tragedy is never more apparent than when at a tense gathering that includes Gatsby, she reluctantly (and not altogether believably) concedes that she has loved Tom, despite her earlier assertions to the contrary.The Shakespearean conclusion of The Great Gatsby will seem heavy-handed to some, while other readers will embrace it as a logical c\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001dulmination of a story infused with melodrama. But one thing is certain: The Great Gatsby will leave an indelible impression on readers with its instructive themes, intriguing plot, and realistically drawn characters."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby. The most sophisticated, popular, extravagant man on West Egg Island. The host of lavish, extraordinary parties, sprawled across the gardens of his enormous house, filled with aristocrats, vibrant colors, jazz music, laughter, and the tinklin of glasses. A personable young man if there ever was one. A friend to all, and fond of calling them &quot;old boy.&quot; And above all, an Oxford man. Or is he? For it seems one can never fully trust Gatsby and the stories of his past. The occasional uncertainty d hesitancy in his voice, as well as frequent inquiries, investigations, and juicy rumors, contradict the his words. Jay Gatsby is the hero of F. Scott Fiztgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, an captivating novel full of intertwining stories and characters, and the revelation of the first connection is intriguing enough to leave the reader begging for the next. A won rful story, The Great Gatsby is laced with mystery, and spiced with a dash of romance. The tale unfolds itself in 1922, on the Long Island provinces of West and East Egg Island, the latter being the more fashionable of the two, and the island where Daisy and Tom Bucanan reside. Daisy is a sparkling young woman and adored by all that meet er. She is sociable, polite, energetic, enthusiastic, and positively delightful, complete with a voice resembling lilting music notes. But this bright girl isn't all she seems; even lovely Daisy has a passionate secret. Her husband, Tom, is an athletic an, the epitome of arrogance. His eyes are always described as &quot;flashing about restlessly.&quot; The former football hero demands dominance over all, especially over the women in his life; his wife, and his over-the-top, full-figured mistress, Myrtle Wilson. t is only when he feels denied of this control that he shows emotion. Across the bay, on the West Egg, lives Daisy's cousin, and Tom's college friend, Nick Callaway, who also happens to be Gatsby's neighbor (just some of the slew of intertwining connec ons between the characters). Nick is the narrator of the story, and does well in presenting an objective view of the string of events that take place. Perhaps this is because he lives by the rule to not criticize others. However, he is incredibly percep ve, and whatever criticisms and opinions he does take on become completely justified to the reader, biased or not. Nick is forever changed by his encounters with Gatsby, but still remains able to continue his normal life, leaving any stinging memories b ind. Perhaps this can be attributed to Jordan Baker, who can be considered the anchor of sanity, or the accomplice for the plot basis. Jordan, Daisy's good friend, moves through the story to become Nick's love interest, but also serves as the source of e missing pieces of the story, the glue between other characters, without being incredibly integral to the connections themselves. As said before, The Great Gatsby is a wonderful whirl of mixing and mingling pasts and presents. It focuses around Jay Gatsby and his quest to recapture the love he had and lost five years ago; Daisy, who loves him in return. However, between elaborate chemes and secret meetings, the two must conquer husbands, mistresses, death, tragedy, and pass the test of true love and loyalty. And despite how much readers come to wish them well, at times their happy fate is wholly uncertain. Through the tangled story of Gatsby and Daisy's romance, and the web of characters and events that surround them, Fitzgerald makes it painfully clear to his readers that people are interminably connected, and the actions of one can start a chain that e ects the lives of many. And, contrary to main-stream fictitious happiness, love does not always prove to be pure and true, or prevail over all. Although The Great Gatsby eventually proves itself to be a simply engrossing novel, the primary story line can be difficult to deeply fall into. The first seventy-five pages can seem dry and lagging, as they primarily consist of explaining how Nick cam to live in West Egg, and retelling seemingly unimportant encounters with several of the characters, probably simply a method of presenting them to readers. However, with the introduction of Mr. Wolfshiem, a shady character, as well as the conversation b ween Gatsby and Nick that precedes that meeting, the plot thickens tremendously. It is with these two events that the mysterious story and the intertwining pasts begin to unfold themselves, and readers will find themselves immediately entranced by the s uence of events to come. The Great Gatsby, though not entirely difficult, should also not be tackled by those who find expressive language and metaphors troubling. However, once readers have become aquatinted with Fitzgerald's writing, his exquisite use of language and metapho will become apparent. They will find the lavish words find even necessary to match the sophisticated nature of the characters. He makes exceptional use of metaphor, best exemplified by his description of Daisy's voice. It is praised time and time again, nd is said to retain the quality of music, notes that will never be played again, the sound of tinkling money, and glowing and singing noise, the sort that the ear follows up and down. Jordan is also frequently said to &quot;balance objects on her chin,&quot; def ing the way she holds herself. And just outside of New York is an area where everything is apparently made from ashes, and the piercing blue streams of sky are solely referred to as &quot;the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.&quot; These metaphors help to paint a wo erfully vivid picture, making sounds and sights come alive, full with depth and meaning."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I suspect that there are three types of readers.1) People who read just to read a good story2) People who read for the beauty of the prose and the beauty of the way the story is told3) People who are a combination of bothI myself am #1.

That is why I gave the book three stars. It was easy to follow, but still only mildly interesting. I guess as I study literature more, I will come back and reread this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A good plot plus an engaging writing style make a bestseller. Sometimes, those elements are combined with a third: the story makes us think about ourselves, and life in general. It's only then that we have a classic...In my opinion, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is just that, a classic. It was first published in 1925, an the author set the background of the story in the 1920's, the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;. Disregarding the fact that particular period of history is already distant, this book has managed to mantain its edge.But why does that happen?. The plot is interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the story of Jay Gatsby, a poor man who fell in love with a rich young girl named Daisy, who ended up getting married to someone who had as much money as her parents. All that happened before the beginning of the story, that starts quite a few years after that marriage. Daisy is quite unhappy (in a rather superficial way), and ready for a change when Gatsby enters again into her life, as good-looking as ever but with much more money.The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who is Daisy's cousin and who happens to meet Gatsby in one of the party the later organizes. Nick is a catalyst in the story, due to the fact that he puts Daisy and Jay in contact again after many years of separation. However, and more important, Carraway makes the book remarkably more interesting for the reader, making commentaries from time to time regarding what is happening. In the book, Nick says &quot;Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known&quot;.At the very least, Nick's role is an effective way that Fitzgerald found of involving the reader a little bit more in what's happening in the story. Most people can identify with Nick Carraway because he doesn't go to the extremes where the other characters permanently are. Gatsby, and his relentless persecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy... And Daisy, so frivolous and vain, so thoroughly engrossed in herself that is incapable of true love...All in all, I liked the story, but I especially enjoyed the way in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes. His style is very simple, with only some metaphores that don't obscure the meaning but help to make it clear. He is also quite concise, as evident from the fact that this book has little more that 200 pages.I think it is probably wortwhile to point out that what really makes this book a classic, instead of merely an enjoyable book (not that there is anything wrong with those!!), is the fact that it deals with many themes all of us deem important, for example love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy...From my point of view, this book is more than worth your time and money. I only wish the ending had been different... The book would have lost some of its dramatic air, but I would have been happier. Even though I know it is rather silly, I prefer happy endings. I hope you notice that despite that, I still recommend &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to you. I really don't have other choice, because it is really a great book :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America. The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience. At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness. Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness. In this time of global uncertainty, we can get back in touch with what it means to be an American by reading such books."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"...of course, that's just my opinion, and I obviously haven't read everything that's been written (or even a minute fraction of it!). However, I've never come across anything that so captured the profound wonder and sadness of the human condition. There are passages in The Great Gatsby which took my breath away, passages so perfect I couldn't believe that someone was capable of writing them. Hunter S. Thompson once said something to the effect that he couldn't imagine one word being added or taken away from this novel. Surely that's one of the highest compliments one writer could give another (it also gave me a newfound respect for Hunter S. Thompson, but that's beside the point...). Like most of Fitzgerald's work, The Great Gatsby holds up well as a period piece on young America in the Jazz Age. More importantly, it is a timeless metaphor of mythical proportion. The green light on Daisy's dock is the longing that drives us all; our dreams dissolve in the moment of fulfillment, leaving us with the bittersweet realization that it was only the dreams themselves that gave our lives beauty and meaning."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Amazon.com, I don't know what was wrong with the last 2 reviews I left. Hopefully, you'll print this one!This book may have been written 80 years ago to this writing, but the message is no less relevant. Greed and the lust of power are dangerous. Our hero Jay Gatsby becomes a victim to the American Dream. All because he has a crush on the conceited airhead Daisy Buchanan. The problem is that Daisy is already married to arrogant rich bully Tom Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, remains Gatsby's only true friend. It is not for nothing Nick tries to warn Gatsby of the so-called upper class: &quot;They're a worthless lot! You're worth the whole d___ group put together!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald would have been better served as an evangalist. Perhaps he would not have died from a coronary doubtless related to his depression and alcoholism.The book is told through the impressions of Nick, a middle class fellow, and revolves around Mr. Gatsby. A man who has replaced the fortitude of spirituality with the frailty of materialism in the hopes of acquiring a woman, Daisy, hardly worth his disdain let alone his life.The story reflects the deeper truth that rationality and science alone cannot solve our problems and certainly cannot supplant the need for a higher purpose in life or belief in a higher power. To do so leaves a void too often filled with materialism which is a cheap substitute.This is exemplified in the characters of Tom Daisy and Jordan, souless wraiths who drift aimlessly from place to place draining the life of everything they touch. Even Tom, who has every conceivable material possession, betrays a longing for days gone by when he was revered as a football hero presumably since this was the only title he ever earned.Gatsby is a compromised and tragic figure partially redeemed only by his solitary quest to fulfull an adolescent meaningless fantasy. Unlike \\"old money\\" he has a goal however trivial.The fulfillment of his goal is anti-climactic as with all objects pursued solely for possession and display. The empheral joy of possession is replaced with the enduring meaninglessness of his life and the eventual ignomy of losing Daisy.The end of the story shows the illusion of Gatsby, a young wealthy eccentric enigmatic gentleman, dissipated by the reality of Gatsby, a hollow common criminal consumed by the desire for a used mindless woman.With the contemporary obssession with materialism, in the form of youth, beauty and wealth, to the exclusion of all else the book is more relevant today than it was then."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One of the great pieces of American literature, The Great Gatsby is picture into the lives of individuals living in the Northeast during the 1920s.

In brief, the Doppler effect addresses the perceived frequency of waves, such as a fire truck's siren, by taking into account the actual frequency, and the relative speeds of the source of the sound, and the observer. So too with books; your opinion is so often determined by your particular circumstances, perhaps rushing towards the source, or enjoying the lengthening perspective that life in its fullness can provide. Unlike so many of the now familiar 1-star reviews, written by students forced to read the book as an assignment, I first read this book, of my own free will, more or less, when I was in Vietnam, some 40 plus years ago. When you are living in a bunker, the whining of the rich, and their self-induced troubles, does not go down well, and if Amazon had existed then, the best I could have mustered would have been a 2-star rating.But a friend chided me into undertaking a second read. And I found a finely crafted novel, yes, concerning the rich, primarily; set in the early years of the \\"Roaring 20's.\\" The story is told through the voice of Ned Carraway, standing in that proverbial inertial reference frame, a migrant from the Mid-West, attempting to scratch a living by selling bonds on Wall Street, and living in modest circumstances on Long Island. The book's essential theme is lost love, or more precisely, lost opportunities in courtship, and involves the title character, Jay Gatsby (n&eacute; Jimmy Gatz), and his desire for Tom Buchanan's wife, Daisy, whom he had briefly known before her marriage. She requites, for sure. The \\"minor characters\\" do their share of suffering. There is plenty of philandering all around, and a somewhat predictable Greek tragedy denouement.Fitzgerald tells his story well, and it is relatively fast-paced and dense. There are sufficient insights to maintain the interest. Tom exudes much of the stupidity and bigotry that so often goes with wealth. Consider the following statement: \\"...Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard, and have intermarriage between black and white.\\" At another point, Fitzgerald says of Tom: \\"As for Tom, the fact that he \`had some woman in New York' was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his preemptory heart.\\"But the primary focus is on Gatsby. And therein were some problems. Somerset Maugham did the \\"obsession with a woman\\" thing to perfection. Fitzgerald's explanation of Gatsby's obsession was substantially weaker. And then there is the matter of his rapid acquisition of wealth. Could it have occurred so quickly, under any circumstances, since the novel was set in the early 20's, instead of the late 20's?The Rich really are different than you and me, as the old saw goes. The concentration of wealth in the United States, even in the midst of the Great Recession, exceeds even that of the \`20's, so the foibles, prejudges, and contrived problems of the lucky, or is it unlucky few, from that prior era, merit another look, as the wavelength of that receding period lengthens, along with perspective of the reader.A 5-star read, but not one of the 10 best American novels of all time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just ordered this book as a gift for a friend and when it came I was so delighted with the quality that I purchased another one for myself, even though I already own several copies of Gatsby.

The novel focuses on the lives of young and shallow rich people .Nick Carraway is the narrator who provides the perspective and the main focus is on the title character Jay Gatsby who is fabulously wealthy. Gatsby invites many people to his grand parties but none of them are his friends as future developments in the novel show.He has a fake life which he creates to win the hand of Daisy Buchanan, a woman he loved in hiss youth but could not obtain because of his poverty.Gatsby gains wealth in illegal and immoral ways and when he has an affair with Daisy,her husband investigates Gatsby's past and exposes him destroying the affair and eventually destroying Gatsby.The novel is how wealth without character is worthless pleasure without purpose is worthless and using money to buy friends without developing ones relationships so that friendship is not dependent on money is also a worthless way to live. Fitzgerald clearly sees the pointlessness of the young and wealthy of his era who live primarily off the inheritance from their parents but his life in many ways would end up becoming like those he criticized partly because of the unstable alcoholic he married who enticed him to join in her self destructive lifestyle.After Gatsby, Fitzgerald's writing declined but the magnificent dialogue and descriptive phrasing plus his keen and compelling insight into the hollowness of a live driven by wealth and the desire for pleasure make this a great American novel"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Who was it who advised writers to get rid of as many adjectives as they could in their manuscripts, and then reread the \`mani' to get rid of some more?

Tom is an arrogant pompous man who is just as careless as Daisey, his wife. The story ends in such a tragic way, eventhough the event is foreshadowed throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Other than the story being good, The Great Gatsby contains some of the most beautifully written prose in the English language. For that and the emotional power, you must read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel, with it's perfect evocation of the American Dream gone hollow, unrequited love, useless wealth and the desperate importance of dreams, is one of the finest books ever written in English. That so many negative, misunderstanding, unsympathetic, even hateful reviews appear here is more than I can grasp."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read the book when it was assigned my junior year in high school. At that time I was amazed by the absolute simplicity, yet the brilliance, of this novel. Fitzgerald weaves a tale of two worlds into a compelling story. There is much to discover in this book, much to compare. Since high school I have read this novel at least a dozen more times and every time I discover something new about it. I love the symbolism, it is so complex. From the contrast between East Egg to West Egg, to the colors used throughout, even to their names, the symbolism runs deep and true. Readers who do not like this book have not given it a chance. They need to go back and read it again, and pay attention to each and every detail."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The most used word I here spoken today by many teenagers and many adults for that matter, is the word boring. I would be a millionaire if I could get a dollar every time I hear high school students use that word. We have become a society where we are bringing up our children on TV shows like 90210, movies like &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, and cartoon shows like &quot;South Park&quot;. The philosophy has become, &quot;Hey, I'm bored, what are you going to do about it?&quot; A classic book like The Great Gatsby is just too advanced for many people."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I say that The Great Gatsby is empty calories because it is my belief that even fiction should be food for thought and this book was so easily digested that it was easily forgotten. I am in the 9th grade and have only begun to form my own tastes for adult literature, but to me, there is an enormous difference in the knowledge I gleaned from this book versus George Orwell's 1984 or Emile Zola's Germinal, both of which I have read this month. I found myself absorbed in both of those books and even took interest in understanding the principles of socialism and totaltarianism. I found myself feeling just a little more enlightened by these books. The characters in the Great Gatsby, however, are by comparison, very superficial, and I didn't connect with their problems. So even though it's a moderately dark book, it went down like a fairy tale: eloquent, fanciful and fluffy. Some people like that, but I would rather laugh and cry with a good book than read an indulgent novel like The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is supposed to be an American classic? Personally, I've read better children's books then this. It's boring, useless, and basically states that rich people are boring, drunken snobs. The story went about no where, and I can't believe I even wasted my time to read it. The writing style was good. Imagine what he could of done if he had actually had a good idea for a story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) lived fast, achieved success early, and then descended into a ferocious alcoholism from which he never emerged. His literary star was already in decline when he published THE GREAT GATSBY in 1925. Although the book had admirers, critical reception was lukewarm and public interest was virtually nonexistent. At the time of his death Fitzgerald and his works were regarded as trivial relics of an era noted for its superficiality; it would not be until the late 1940s that both critics and readers began to re-discover and re-assess them.THE GREAT GATSBY has often been described as \\"the great American novel.\\" In some ways this is unfortunate, for it has resulted in the academic world's force-feeding of the novel to exactly those least likely to have any appreciation of the work: high school and college students, who most often lack the maturity required to grasp the nature of the work. It is short but remarkably complex and requires skills of critical analysis that seldom arrive short of thirty years experience.On the surface the story is not unique. Nick Carraway, a well-to-do young man from the midwest, has come to New York to learn the bond business. He takes a small house and afterward discovers that his cousin Daisy, now married to Tom Bucchanan, lives directly across the bay. A visit to their luxurious home introduces Nick to professional golfer Jordan Baker, an attractive woman in which Nick is soon interested; it also alerts him to the fact that Daisy is disillusioned in her marriage to Tom, who for all his wealth and social status is limited in his views of the world and more than a little brutish in his habits.Nick is only casually interested in Daisy, Tom, and Jordan, but he is soon propelled into constant contact with all three through his own neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a mysterious yet charismatic man whose chief occupation seems to be staging parties. After some little time, Nick learns that Gatsby knew Daisy before her marriage, and indeed his parties are set forth as bait, an attempt to lure Tom and Daisy to his home on the less fashionable side of the bay. For Gatsby loves Daisy, and his memory of their romance has propelled him to fame and riches, all in an attempt to bring her to his side. Through Nick, Gatsby arranges to meet Daisy once more, and the lost love blooms anew.Or does it? THE GREAT GATSBY never allows us entry into Daisy as a person; we are never privy to her thoughts but are instead required to see her through the eyes of those around her, and the way in which we read her changes according to the people and circumstances involved. As the novel climaxes Nick and Gatsby and we ourselves do at last understand both her and Tom and the others of their kind, but the understanding comes too late to avert the three deaths and profound disillusionment that conclude the book.Like most great novels, THE GREAT GATSBY is about a great many things, but it is perhaps most particularly about America's drift into a terrible sort of materialism in which human beings become less valued for their humanity than for what--and in a very real sense--who they own. Almost everything the characters of the novel do, say, or plan is done \\"for show.\\" Gatsby's parties and his car, Jordan's golf competitions, Tom's mistress, Daisy's child, Nick's job are masks that conceal the screaming emptiness of a world in which what you have has become more important than who you are. \\"What shall we do with ourselves this afternoon?\\" Daisy asks at one point in the novel. \\"And the day after that, and the next thirty years?\\" Who would you be if you had only yourself? Would you still be what your possessions seemed to indicate--or would you be a different person, perhaps better or perhaps worse?Although THE GREAT GATSBY has always been admired for the cool, languid beauty of Fitzgerald's language, many felt the core statements of the novel were rendered largely irrelevant by the Great Depression and World War II. But like Gatsby's memories, which he himself cannot lay to rest, the book has a way of resurfacing in our minds in a remarkably disquieting sort of way, again and again with each generation. The great literary diamond of the Deco age still glitters, and it does so all the more in the face of the \\"on demand\\" confused consumerism that has arisen in the internet age. We know it should not be like this, and we wish it were not so, but we expect someone else to deal with it--or, as Fitzgerald writes with such profound clarity near the end of the novel, we, in this most American of American novels, are a people prone to smashing up things and creatures and then retreating back into our money and vast carelessness. We prefer to let other people clean up the mess we have made.A brilliant work.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\"He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.And so begins The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But what--I can hear you asking--What does the \\"F\\" stand for?F. Scott Fitzgerald's full name was actually Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, as he was distantly related to the famous author of The Star Spangled Banner, the national anthem of The United States of America. He is famous for writing The Great Gatsby, a prime example of \\"the Great American Novel\\" that all writers aspire to. It is the kind of book you are made to feel that you should read. And it is true, that you should read The Great Gatsby. But it's also true that you will probably enjoy it, and that is the main reason why you should read The Great Gatsby. It is a great book that can be studied and analyzed in college literature classes, but it is also a fun book, not too long, that tells a good story and tells it well.Gatsby is a millionaire who throws fabulous parties. No one knows where he really came from or how he got his money, but he bought a mansion where he \\"dispensed starlight to casual moths\\" for some as yet unknown purpose. Written in 1925, just before the stock market crash of 1929 that began the Great Depression, Fitzgerald is prescient. Did he know that the glitz and glamor of The Jazz Age and The Roarin' 20's was a house of cards built on a foundation of sand--mixophorically speaking? That it could all be washed away in an instant?The Great Gatsby is the subject of the book, but it is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, the narrator. Nick doesn't say that much out loud. He is kind of an introvert. But his inner voice is exceptionally rich and poetic. If he has a flaw, it is that he judges everyone around him, though he begins his narrative by telling us that his father told him not to criticize others who may not have had the advantages he has had. He then proceeds to judge and criticize everyone. He is like a male Judge Judy. That is the fun of the book. If he wasn't judgemental it would be very boring. Nick Carraway considers himself to be one of the few honest men around. If he thinks he doesn't judge others, that as a consquence of his father's words he's \\"inclined to reserve all judgements\\" then he is certainly not being honest--with himself.Nick judges all before him, almost like the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles that pass over a non-existent nose.Though they are not the eyes of God, but merely an advertisement for an eye doctor, they brood over the dreary landscape nonetheless, like Nick Carraway also broods. He judges Jordan Baker, a female golfer not above moving her golf ball to a better position or telling little white lies, but only when it is absolutely convenient. He judges the hoards who flock to Gatsby's parties. He judges Klipspringer, who spends so much time at Gatsby's parties that he is called \\"the boarder.\\" He judges George B. Wilson and his wife Myrtle, and he judges Tom Buchanan.Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?Nick Carraway presents the evidence on Tom Buchanan's character, and we don't even have to hear him read the verdict to know what it is. Daisy, his wife, is a little harder to pin down, but later Gatsby provides him a clue. Nick thinks Daisy's voice is indiscreet and full of a certain jen se qua\\"Her voice is full of money,\\" he said suddenly.That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl. . . .The Great Gatsby is a book that I am very grateful to have been required to read in college. Professor Edwards at San Francisco State University led our class in an insightful discussion, and I will include some of the points he made--as I remember them many years later--in the comments, so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet read The Great Gatsby. Even if you haven't been to college you will still enjoy this book. I have made a list of 10 books that I would recommend to those who aspire to be well read, and The Great Gatsby is right at the top. If you can just get started you will want to keep reading until the very end. A veritable page turner. You are swept up in the story, carried away by the narrative voice of Nick Carraway, moving forwards and backwards in time in alternate passages--forward as Gatsby's final chapters unfold--but backwards as we delve deeper and deeper into Gatsby's past.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning----So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.10 Books For Those Who Aspire to be Well ReadThe Great Gatsbyby F.

Additionally, the novel suffers from an extremely contrived plot and climax. I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Brilliant, a simple conversation scene in the book make me sit up, enthralled, and laugh out loud. Perceptive, erudite. A genius."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The thing that this book brings out more than anything is the idea that the rich gained their power and notoriety through some type of moral superiority. That is completely trashed in this book.First of all, Tom Buchannan is the most unctuous character in this book, if not all literature. He is the picture of the eastern establishment rich kid who had everything given to him. And he is a leach to his wife and skulks around with Myrtle.Daisy and Gatsby are also pathetic characters. The thrust of the novel is also important in that it brings to light the fact that money and vast riches cannot bring happiness. We still see that today. The 1920s and the Jazz Age were the beginning of the era of conspicuous consumption and while Gatsby throws weekend long parties, he almost never partakes in them, and he is rather quite miserable.The ending of the book, not to give spoilers, demonstrates the conceit of the era. A seminal work of American Fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite classics. I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read a good book and a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"And I mean the book and me. Although I am not perfectly aged. I mean by my title that with age, I have been able to really appreciate the beautifully poetic words that Fitzgerald used for his story. I think that teachers must assign this because they think the simplicity of Fitzgerald's words are easy for teenagers to understand. They may be able to understand all the words, but I really don't think most teenagers can truly understand the meaning behind the beautiful word choices Fitzgerald made. I for one, did not and I just loved this book the second time around. Life experiences make it easier to see Daisy and Gatsby for what they truly are, very shallow people. I think only Tom shockingly looks good in this book. He recognizes his life for what it is. When I was young, I really thought Tom was a bad guy. I feel differently after reading it the second time. I still see this as such a sad, sad story, where nothing happy takes place.A must read!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought everybody already knew that. There is no better American novel in existence. I read it first in high school and it captured my heart and imagination. I have read it many times since, and each time discover more depth and nuance."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"and lacking in content to be memorable such that I actually read it twice.It doesn't say much about me probably, but this is a book I've been interested in enough that I read it twice, but not on purpose. I read the book on paper once 10 years ago, but apparently found the book lacking enough substance to remember I had read it. The second time through, I read it on Kindle. You'd think in starting a book a second time that something would click, but when you read a book such as this... a book that works as a character study in a setting I've read about multiple times (I find this book similar to The Sun Also Rises), the book starts out a bit typical to the point I passed off the familiarness to the genre rather than to having read the book before. It wasn't until the climactic scenes at the end of the book that I realized I had read this before.Of course, we often read books twice when we like them, and we even occasionally find we like things on a second go around. In this case, I found I didn't like the book on the second go around. The book is a character study on a man named Gatsby whom moves into the \\"neighborhood\\" of his former girlfriend in the pursuit of ultimate happiness. In this pursuit is where the character flaw begins. It boils down to the ideal that money can buy happiness. And, of course, we often see that greed is more of an addiction that can rarely be overcome, and Jay Gatsby has that greed.The setting is in the jazz era of the early 20th century, and of course Jay Gatsby isn't the only character stricken with greed. The book is simple as far as plots go, and the plot wouldn't even be all that out of place now nearly 100 years later. The biggest strength of the book is really in the intricate weaving of characters surrounding Daisy Buchanan, the girlfriend Gatsby pursues. While Daisy and Jay are the most important characters in the book, it is what I call the character flaws for all the characters including those two that give any interest to the book. It is unfortunate that as the book progresses it is Jay Gatsby who dominates.I know the book is a classic, and I know many people like it. I am actually surprised I don't; I liked The Sun Also Rises, which seems to be the opposite of many people (many like this book and not that one). I'm not sure what it is. I really seemed to me that liking one should lead to like in the other, and in that regard giving the book a second chance was worth it. My biggest complaint is that the book is in someways too simple.Gatsby is a complicated character, but we are never fully given a view into his complicated mind. I was left at the end of the book wishing I knew more about him especially what happened to him before the novel. Of course there are hints and background, but I felt like I was wanting more. The book almost seemed too simple and in some ways too predictable. Perhaps that is unfair too having read the book twice, but I remembered feeling that way at the end both times I read it. Gatsby and Daisy were relatively likable characters (not lovable for their various flaws), and I felt they deserved a bit better.Of course, it isn't Hollywood, and the ending provided only enhances the novel since as far as plot goes the ending makes the novel. Never-the-less, I felt like there could have been more; more insight into the characters, more to the plot, more resolution, etc."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There are numerous reviews of this American classic available on the web, so I won't bother trying to re-hash them; suffice to say I found it thoroughly enjoyable and a good holiday read.

What starts off as an adventurous festive tale turns into a troubling and deeply sad story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells us the life story of a Mr. Jay Gatsby. However, don't expect the narrator, Nick Carraway, to tell everything up front, he leaves plenty of room for the imagination. The Great Gatsby is filled with dramatic love triangles and the ever-present truth looming over Gatsby. Keep in mind the central theme of not everything is always as it seems.Written in 1924, The Great Gatsby is one of America's most recognized literary works of art. F. Scott Fitzgerald has eternalized the glory of the \\"roaring twenties\\" and has captivated his audience for over 85 years. The \\"roaring twenties\\" plays host to the Prohibition movement and creates an air of hysterics among the characters. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote five novels and over twenty short stories. His works have been translated into many other languages and continue to be adapted into plays, films, and other forms of entertainment.Fitzgerald presents this short novel in a way that leaves the audience wondering about the truth behind every single character. Each character has his or her own agenda and rarely forgets who number one is. Don't be fooled by the brevity of this novel, it is packed to the brim with double meanings and truths to be discovered. The Great Gatsby breathes life into the past and makes you want to be a part of it. The way Fitzgerald describes Mr. Gatsby's parties makes you wish you were there to experience such a fun and never ending night. In a way, it perfectly describes the themes of love throughout the novel, fun, seemingly never ending, and yet never turning out the way you thought they would. The glitz and the glamour that is present throughout the novel would make anyone want to crash one of Mr. Gatsby's parties.What is truly remarkable is that Fitzgerald manages to make a love story into a suspense novel by always making Gatsby have to be a half step in front of the truth. A \\"truth\\" that Gatsby weaves so intricately, even he second-guesses it. I would have to say that my favorite aspect of this novel is that Fitzgerald never tells a scene with all the information up front. This novel really makes you think and recall information in order to keep up with the story line.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys having to put together a puzzle without knowing the bigger picture. The Great Gatsby is commonly used in high school curriculums across the United States, but is a novel that everyone should read with or without a requirement attached. This novel is intriguing, lively and full of entertainment. The only draw back is that it is extremely short for a novel. I feel that it could have been expanded a great deal, but who am I to argue with F. Scott Fitzgerald and the story lengths that made money in his time. Overall, I would agree with the masses that this is literary classic. Make sure to watch out for the fifth film adaption of The Great Gatsby in 2013, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If I could go back and time and tell high school me to actually read this book for class instead of ignoring it and assuming it must have been bad... Ah...The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel. It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible. Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement. Fitzgerald managed to embody the modernist idea of an artwork that stands for itself, by no means an easy task. This is a book that must be read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This classic book got my daughters attention when we saw a trailer for it when we saw the movie Lincoln, I put it in her stocking and she's already dug in.

But, if I liked it I would consider this a very good purchase, because it's a good quality book and a good price."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I came into \`The Great Gatsby' knowing it was a classic (and highly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature) and that I should read it bit also knowing that the 1974 film adaptation (which I did see) was awful and tainted my interest in the novel. Knowing that rabid fans of the book also hated the film helped convince me to take it off the shelf (I've owned it for a few years) and read it.So glad that I did.Having previously read Fitzgerald's short story collection which contained \`The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', I was familiar with his writing style (detailed yet easy on the intake) and immediately took to this novel. The way that Fitzgerald paints these characters and their situations and the \`Jazz Age' itself is so wonderfully astute and captivating at every turn. This is a short yet very rich story, filling nearly 200 pages with beautifully delicate character development (enough mystery to make these people intoxicating as opposed to merely fascinating) and an engaging plot that completes itself in the most unexpected and yet tragically beautiful way imaginable (yes, I knew the ending thanks to the film, but it feels so much more \`complete' here).The meaning behind the pursuit at play here is remarkable, and the way that the story's conclusion truly embeds itself in relevance, even today, is unexpected yet welcome.The story told is that of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who moves nearby his sweetheart of yesteryear, Daisy, who is now a mother and married to a wealthy man with a downtrodden mistress on the side. Daisy and Gatsby were torn apart by social circles and the war, and while he was fighting for his country she was being swept off her feet by Tom Buchanan. The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor and trusted confidant. Through his friendship, both Gatsby and Daisy reunite and Nick is torn between his friendship with Gatsby and his knowledge of not only Daisy's love for him but also of her husband Tom's indiscretions.Beautifully fleshed out and \`whole', this classic earns that title with every word. Creating characters that are unforgettable (Tom being one of my favorite literary creations) and a story that is so inspired and poignant, \`The Great Gatsby' is just that; great!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Author F. Scott Fitzgerald composed his 3rd and most renown novel, The Great Gatsby, when wanting to write a new and exciting book. A romantic tragedy of a man and a women who are in love but life and money gets in the way. Set in the jazz age in Long Island, NY, a man name Gatsby has made him self a fun and exciting persona. Throwing grand parties for people every weekend just so people would like him, but they liked his money more than Gatsby himself. This character he made is fake. He throws parties because he used to be poor and it's the only way to attract the love of his life, the married Daisy, to his home. Daisy is a rich woman and he wants her to leave her spouse,Tom, for him. I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars. I had read this book a few years ago and did not understand the main theme of the book. This time around I realized the theme was greed, and doing useless things for a spark of pleasure. Fitzgerald who had lived in so many places around the world really understood the hardships of peoples lives during the jazz age. It had a lot of information for 180 pages and is a good book to read when you are over 15 years of age but it can be a little dull at times, or at least for me anyways."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"My all time Favorite book!!

IMHO it is one of the great American novels, and one of the best American novels to tell the story of a particular class of people in any era out there. In this case, the era is The Roaring Twenties and the class of people that the novel deals with is the extremely wealthy. It was definitely an interesting era and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the novel that stands tall above all the other novels to deal with this subject matter.Jay Gatsby is a man of mystery and intrigue. Women fall at his feet. He supposedly went to Oxford. He hangs out with the man who fixed the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series. Nobody really knows how he makes his money or how he made his fortune, but he apparently started from scratch. He throws outlandish parties that all sorts of rich and famous people who do not know him come to. People clamor to be on the list to his parties but do not know him.These people are portrayed as shallow, brittle, vain. They have come by their money, but they care not whom the victims are along the road or in the path ahead. Just so they can hold on to their claim to fame. Anything, so that they can maintain their lifestyle. Society is disposable, people come and go, they live and die. It really does not have anything to do with them, does it darling?What happens in the novel is really of no concern, also. This is profound, but it makes \\"Gatsby\\" the novel that it is. \\"Gatsby\\" is the first book in \\"The Big Read\\" for Wichita, KS. this year (2012). The contest for it is to re-write the ending in so-many-words-or-less. This, too is very interesting, because the novel could have a number of differnt endings.

Scott Fitzgerald had.Cam"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A very enjoyable novel depicting life in the &#34;Roaring 20's&#34;, when large sums of money were made from bootleg whiskey."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Beautiful language. I can now say I've both read this book and listened to a reading of it, and there's so much complexity in the subtext that each time the tone suggested something slightly different.Regarding the story itself, more of a short story really, it seemed to me somewhat unremarkable.

What a great photo, although I can't quite picture any of the females in this book dressed so sedately--well, maybe Jordan. Yes, Jordan would wear this outfit. I also bought this edition because it is just the book--no intro, no preface, no notes, and thank the book gods who watch over us for NO readers club discussion ideas! Just The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald wrote it. So much action in such a short book.And what was so great about the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties, getting dressed up and getting drunk? The first time I read this book, many years ago, I was completely caught off-guard and not expecting the violence so what a shock it was and I remember feeling like I had mistakenly read a few pages of Erskine Caldwell, and even now I feel like re-reading God's Little Acre. \\"Ain't we got fun\\"? I don't think so. I feel like I have been peeking in Gatsby's windows here, and it doesn't look like fun to me.And speaking of Gatsby, the character, just what was so Great about him? Aha, the catch.

The words so clever you may be lead to believe you were reading poetry instead of a novel. His precise use of words does well when describing the characters; who are created perfectly and paint a vivid picture. The pages are covered with a slew of excitement and love, lust, and inevitably murder. I feel in love with Daisy Buchanon her candid way of speaking along the naivety described in her voice creates such a complex character. When the plot unravels; we find her to be the opposite of what we had been lead to believe. The main character Nick narrates his adventures of a time different from our own. In fact different form any other Fitzgerald also let's us dive back in time when the female celebrated her singledom and rebellion wafted throughout a nation.

Eliot. And try as I might not to wax rhapsodic about this greatest of novels, I am overtaken and undone! I recently saw the theatrical innovation based on \\"Gatsby,\\" \\"Gatz,\\" and was struck anew by its transcendent beauty and also by the freshness and fascination of its narrative. The voice of Nick Carroway is a beautiful one, moral, full of world-weary sympathy, and always astutely tuned in to the voices of the grubby characters around him. You hear it and you feel as soon it as begins, and reading it is no less haunting than hearing it aloud on stage. Fitzgerald--and Nick, too--- are unerring in their understanding of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan's, all their their sordid badness masquerading as glamor, all their innate incapacity for happiness,their fragility, sadness and their brutality. Finally, I love his clarity about the tragic self-delusion that is America. Fitzgerald may have been glamor-struck himself as a young man but he sees through it as surely as Proust his own snobbery. I wish folk would not teach it as a high school book unless they are true devotees; teaching it at a less than fever-pitch enthusiasm will surely kill off its beauty. And what could be more beautiful than its last few sentences, its only equal Proust's own last sentence in \\"Swann's Way\\"!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Of course, reading the Great Gatsby is something every American owe's to himself. I was never good about reading the assigned literature in high school, but I read this. It introduced me to a world of poetry and prose, people and plot, and all elements of writing that have enthralled readers for as long as writing has existed. The language makes me want to weep. Authors don't write like this anymore, they might not be capable of it. Though the book presents itself as a tragedy through a portrait of our nation's most riotous decade, it is soothing in abstract ways. I love this book dearly and I'll never love another one more. If you haven't read Fitzgerald's Gatsby yet, read it. It belongs in the pantheon of classic books one must read before they die."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have probably read this book 20 times and it seems to get better with time. The first time I read it was in high school and I couldn't fully appreciate or understand it. Then as an Education major in college, I taught it to my students when I did my student teaching and had to know every nuance about it. What do I love so much? Mostly Nick Carroway's narration and the way Fitzgerald describes things as the writer. He uses such rich imagery that you can just picture the scenes and characters in your mind. And yes, all of the characters are shallow and mostly immoral, except for Nick, the narrator. To me, this is a story about love, longing for something you want so badly and will do anything to have, how money doesn't buy happiness or fulfillment if you don't have love, how people will use others for money, and how money can ruin people. It's also an interesting portrait of the east coast and rich people during the 20's. Every time I read it, I get so lost in the descriptions of Daisy, Gatsby, Jordan, Gatsby's parties and the guests at his parties, the sprawling mansions, etc. Overall it's a very romantic book about wanting something you can't have - and then getting it only to have it not fully meet your expectations. I will admit, the ending is depressing and sometimes I stop reading before the book ends because it's just not pleasant.

After seeing it on all of the \\"Best of\\" lists and being told that it was inexcusable to have not finished it already, I took three days and read it. And it is great.The story itself is intriguing and beautifully-told. Fitzgerald had a \\"pretty\\" (for lack of a better word) style of writing -- the way he worded things in this book just read so well. The story is simple (as it must be in a >200 page novel), but every word is used to great effect.The symbolism is perhaps more what I am left with, however, after reading this novel. As Nick Carraway (perhaps, the only \\"good\\" character in the novel) loses his innocence on his 30th birthday, it seemed to be a commentary as to the end of the 1920s -- the end, in many ways, of American innocence. And Gatsby's tale, the mystery behind his rise, the inevitability of his fall, all shrouded in rich parties and mansions -- they aptly reflect the decedent materialism that often comes with success but leaves one empty and incomplete.The Great Gatsby is a wonderful novel that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, takes place in the fantastic city of New York. Nick Carraway, a southern boy, leaves the farms and hills of the South to live where the noisy traffic and tall skyscrapers of the North surround him. Of course to Nick, everything is so different. For one thing, New York is a more \\"open minded\\" kind of place and Fitzgerald allows us to explore the feelings that Nick encounters on such a drastic change. We move along with Nick throughout the novel, bouncing around from character to character. We also find the dramatic difference between \\"West Eggers\\" and \\"East Eggers\\".Daisy, a second cousin to Nick, is in fact an \\"East Egger\\" and she and her husband, Tom Buchanan, unload a boat load of secrets, lusts, and well kept mischievous acts. Nick of course tries to keep out of things but there is no avoiding what Tom and Daisy are dealing with. Jordan Baker, a pro-golfer, becomes a good friend of Nick's and they both are on the outside looking in on the Buchanan's rocky marriage. Nick finds that he's very fond of Jordan but tries to stay alert so that he will not be sucked into any of the chaos.What will this novel be without Fitzgerald's most mysterious character, Jay Gatsby? Jay Gatsby, from the very start of the story is a very fine, handsome, and yet awe-inspiring man. Nick's curiosity of this creature only lure's the reader to find out what this Gatsby character is all about. Now of course you'll learn that \\"East Eggers\\" are not too fond of the \\"West Eggers\\" and Gatsby just happens to be a \\"West Egger\\". So, of course there's some dispute between Tom and Gatsby when they are first introduce in the novel. However, this dispute goes far beyond where each men are living. The reader finds out about Daisy's past and how she and Gatsby are more then just acquaintances.It seems that many of characters in Fitzgerald's novel are looking to attain something. What that something is, well it all depends on that character. Throughout the book we still find that even though Nick begins to talk with Gatsby he still doesn't know anything about him. Gatsby throws these extravagant parties and yet is rarely present at the occasions. However, Nick and Gatsby become very good friends and all the secrets begin to spill out to reveal who Gatsby truly is.Toward the end of the novel you may think that the story may slowly fade out and the book will come to an end, however Fitzgerald throws a huge shocker that will keep you suspended in your chair. Lives are changed forever and all Nick can do is watch helplessly from the sidelines. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is truly a remarkable story. The characters all have their place. You're able to create bonds and dislikes which make up a great book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY BOOK REVIEWThe novel, The Great Gatsby, is a work of fiction written by F. Scott Fitzgerald around 1924-1925. It is told to us from the perspective of Nick Carraway, one of the main characters. Through Carraway we learn about the rest of the characters and their way of living. The book introduces time, love, and reality as its major subjects. From beginning to end, Carraway mentions time for an event that takes place, along with the season which gives a certain type of mood. The character of Jay Gatsby runs after luxury and wealth in order to gain the love of Daisy Buchanan. Through this action Fitzgerald demonstrates the hardship he had to go through in order to be with his love, Zelda. Similarly, other events in the book are related to the author's life.Fitzgerald raises the issue of morals and decency in this novel, however, each of his character face a problem with morals. Nick Carraway believes he is the only one who is honest and decent but I believe he is not as good as he thinks he is. Carraway secretly forms opinions about the others but when he needs information or company he has no problem being around them. I don't believe this action of his to be decent behavior, consequently he is not decent as he says to be. At first, Carraway is very curious to meet the famous Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and interesting guy everyone talks about, but towards the middle he changes his opinion about him, making Gatsby the mean guy and in the end Carraway is once again on Gatsby's side because he feels sorry for the guy. Carraway's cousin Daisy is dishonest with her marriage and to her Gatsby, her love. She appears to be innocent and unaware of her husbands affair and yet she herself goes of with another man, not caring about the consequences her marriage would have to face. Jay Gatsby has lied his way into the lifestyle that he is living, all for his true love, which he hopes will someday return back to him. As you can see, Fitzgerald has his characters based on a web of lies and problems, which hardly leaves them any room for happiness.I believe the novel to be very informative and descriptive. All the characters are introduced with a full detail of their appearance, actions and achievements so far in life. For this very reason, the book did not hold my interest. I thought it to have no real meaning behind it and didn't quite enjoy it even after we were done with the book and surely didn't think of it as a classic. I definitely would not recommend this novel to read but if you enjoy drama that is pointless than go right ahead and read the book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Written about 1920s culture this book still has a powerful effect today. After having lived through the 1990s, which was another prosperous time for the economy, I can relate to the characters quite well.If you are an F. Scott fan you already know how well he writes. Many of the more recent authors aren't as good at developing a story as he is.If you like the book there's a most excellent movie to supplement it. It stars Robert Redford and follows the book quite well."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Sypnosis:The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from the West who moves to New York City in the 1920's to learn about the bond business. This book is about Jay Gatsby, a young wealthy neighbor who lives in a huge mansion, and his tragic love for Daisy Buchanan, Nick's beautiful cousin. However, she is already married to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby once dated her before World War I but had to leave to fight in it. He still loves Daisy though after many years and moved back to New York to impress her with his wealth. Apparently, she does not realize Gatsby even lives there because he asks Nick to organize a reunion with her. Nevertheless, Daisy falls back in love with him during the reunion and the two begin an affair. Gatsby then stops throwing his extravagant parties as they were only meant to attract her attention. Before long, Tom learns of their relationship and is outraged by his wife's infidelity, even though he is already involved in an affair with a woman named Myrtle Wilson. Afterwards, he forces a group of friends including Nick and Daisy to accompany him to a hotel where he confronts Gatsby. There, he accuses him of making his fortune illegally by bootlegging alcohol. Attempting to prove he cannot hurt him, Tom sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby. However, while driving through a road, Nick, Jordan, and Tom discover Gatsby's car struck and killed Myrtle earlier. Nick then learns from Gatsby that Daisy was actually driving the car when it killed Myrtle but he intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom mistakenly tells George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, that Gatsby ran over her. George concludes that he must've been her lover and shoots him dead in his mansion. However, he also commits suicide. Nick is the only one left to organize Gatsby's funeral and after doing so, he heads back West, disgusted by the life in New York.Essential Questions:What is the truth and how do you know?This question refers to the truth that Jay Gatsby hides behind his rather superficial faade. In an attempt to impress Daisy, he lies and creates an appealing past far from his own. Her high status would not suit his low birth so Gatsby makes up many stories. For example, he claims to be an Oxford man when he really in fact dropped out of this prestigious university after only months. Also, his \\"drugstores\\" sell things far from medicinal such as alcohol. In addition, Gatsby does not tell Daisy that he loves her but throws wild parties instead in an attempt to attract her attention, assuming that money could always cover up for anything."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A classic that has concured time. Start reading and you'll only let it go out of your hands if you turned the last page. You can actually feel the heat -as in warmth of the weather as well as the personal relationships between the characters- that is described!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"[...],There is the brighter blue and the darker blue. For the brighter side, blue is the color of the earth and the sky, represents purity and beauty, and holds wonders to the limits beyond the eyes. For the darker side, it is synonyms with dreary, dismal, depressed and gloomy, and phrases like into-the-blue are associated with extreme exasperation. These two different and contrasting qualities of blue come into perfect match in The Great Gatsby, with the brighter blue matching the dreams and glories of Gatsby's life, and the darker blue matching the cold gray sadness of Gatsby's reality. The blue ocean and sky, the BLUE music, and the blue eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are three themes showing these contradictions. Blue is the color of Gatsby's tragedy.Rain, ocean, and the swimming pool are where Gatsby's dreams once lay, but also where they vanish. Gatsby loves Daisy, but he is always separated from her by blue water. At first it is the Atlantic Ocean, and then it is the water that separates East Egg from West Egg. Gatsby dreams of Daisy all this time and the blue distance is the medium through which his dreams grow into the grandest proportions. In fact, blue, the color without edge gave Gatsby too much room of imagination, and at the end, golden fruits turned out to be the same old apple trees. Really, who can argue that the ocean is not a beautiful thing, but yet with all the tragic dreams that this grand blue beauty empowered people to, is it not also the greatest curse? Then there is the rain and the swimming pool, which further add to the sadness. It is significant that it rains both during the meeting of Gatsby and Daisy, and Gatsby \`s burial. Gatsby's blue dreams was a cloud building up in all these years. It gets too heavy that it collapses with reality and falls on to the hard earth. Gatsby dies in his swimming pool, on one of the last days of summer, when the pool is drained. The pool represents his blue dream, and Gatsby dies in this pool of dream, or more accurately, was killed by his dream. At the end, the once flourishing bright hopes of light blue, becomes the smoke of gun shot, a darker blue dimmed by the setting sun.Blue is the music of the 20th , it is popular, beautiful, creative, full of soul, and relieves people of their pains. Yet, the songs are about Poverty, hard times, Lost love, Sexuality, and Oppression. Listening to BLUE music is using sadness to defeat sadness itself, and this contradiction has the same quality as the contradiction of the color blue and of Gatsby's life. The \\"wailing\\" of the Beale Street Blue's \\"hopeless comment\\", while \\" a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.\\"(P158) during Daisy's party with boys after she losses patience with Gatsby is a good example. All night saxophones will play this music among \\"golden slippers\\" of happiness, but inside there is only the depressing notes of the \\"wailing hopeless\\" BLUE. It presents happiness as a brief stop on the train of a depressing life. Then there is the \\"There is music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens.....\\"(P42) when Nick witnesses Gatsby's magnificent party. This \\"Blue Garden\\" is where Gatsby waits, and where sad music of the Blue flows with a million bottles of gay champions in a lonely and crowded symphony. There is grandeur, yet inside this grandeur are fighting husbands and wives, people talking who did not know each other, and drunker who attempts to drive a broken car. The people are empty, they are searching for \\"fun\\", only because they are confused about life and their place in their life. The \\"blue garden\\" did not have blue grass, but had blue music, and a blue soul, and that blue soul belongs to all the people at the party, and the host himself.The symbol of the valley of ashes is \\"The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\\". They are \\"blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high.\\", and its \\"persistent stare\\" is always watching over. This stare by this brighter color over the lesser colors around it makes the pure blue eyes seem like a ruler. A ruler to which all the forgotten ashes and decays are hopelessly compared to, and the reality around is so corrupted and ugly that they even clouded the ruler itself. Words \\"pale\\"(P167) and \\"faded\\"(127) describe the blue eyes, which to a greater extend show this overcrowding of darker forces. The gray ash field is the reality of the world, and underneath the grand mansions of Gatsby and Tom is a thousand valley of ashes. They support the superficial happiness, but that happiness is to fall and to become a part of the gray burial mound at anytime. In fact, Gatsby becomes a part of the ashes even before he dies, he has nothing real, except a empty dream for Daisy. The blue here represents the only hope inside a hopeless world, because it is the only color inside a colorless valley of ashes. It is clear that the blue here is different from the blue ocean and BLUE music. It is still about hope and despair, but of a different and higher sort. Near the end of the book, Wilson repeats \\"God sees everything\\" as he looks at the blue eyes. It is questionable if Fitzgerald is calling people to turn away from the fate of been buried in the evil ashes and turn back to the promise of God. But it is clear that those blue eyes of a certain moral values are been ignored, and it is Fitzgerald's intention for people to pay more attention to this only color of promise.Gatsby lives in the fancies of the blue music, sleeps in the dreams of the blue ocean, and is buried under the blue eyes of God. The use of the color blue shows not just the contradictions of Gatsby's life, but also that of his generation, the roaring 20th with all its laughs of the brighter blue and tears of the darker blue (as on the cover). The Great Gatsby is about hope, the collapse of hope, and more hope, and blue, with all its contradictory qualities, best mirrors this tragic story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a true masterpiece with a wonderful plot and incredible artistry of language which opens up the roaring 20s era in all its glory. This is not only a love story of the rich Jay Gatsby and the glorious Daisy Buchanan, this is the epitomy of all which that time period stands for. Fitzgerald paints an era where money and status were the true faces of the American society and people were defined by their glamourous houses, expensive clothes, and lavish habits. It was the era of the parties lasting until dawn, the era of nightlife and gossip. But it was also a very unsteady era where that green light which could bring you up to the top of the mountain could just as well make you fall from grace. Nevertheless, one finds himself hoping that \\"one fine morning...\\"I was never forced to read the Great Gatsby in school but reading it now I know instantly that this will be one of my favorites and I will read it many more times because one time is not enough to understand all of its levels and fully appreciate this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald captures the yearnings of a man's heart, no his very soul, in the pages of The Great Gatsby.

I thought that the author could have gone a little more in depth with each character.

I think you will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One way to describe The Great Gatsby is to compare this piece of literature to a treasure hunt. The reason for this comparison is because of the abundance of symbolism and tiny snippets of important information throughout the book. In my opinion you would have to read this book a few times to get a really good sense of the complexity of the story because each time through the book you will find many things you missed the last time. However, I find this style of writing a little annoying because I am not one that usually goes back to read a book again, so for this book I was left confused. The Great Gatsby possesses many lessons on life and how to achieve goals and therefore, an American classic on the American Dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was both touched and frustrated by the style of writing. Pay attention to every line or you may miss something. The over arching message is universal, that wealthy people can make big mistakes in life too...The author seems to want to blame wealth for irresponsibility...a theme that is difficult for me to buy. Everyone can be there no matter what station in life. The real tragedy was Gatsby's investment in worthlessness.

Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking. I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he doesn't. The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts, especially near the end, but it has a nostalgic feeling to it, and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"i bought it new. but i could have just checked out the book at the library while i needed it instead of paying for it :("},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is relatively small, but packs a huge story. It is intriguing from beginning to end. The sentences are written so beautifully that they could be appreciated by themselves. The characters are lovable and despicable. In Gatsby's world no one is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates a good story and strong writing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I reread this recently and loved it so much more than when I had to read it in high school. Fitzgerald's humor is so much more subtle than most humor writer's today and the funny lines are tucked between such beautifully crafted prose. The story is so simple - basically just describes a few parties at a mysterious Gatsby's mansion - but the humor and just enough foreshadowing keep you wanting to move forward. His observations of the young rich would fit in almost perfectly today.

True, it's a fairly nice love story, but there have been many better love stories written. The characters all seemed very one-dimensional to me, and the story was fairly dull. It's not a *bad* novel, but I cannot fathom why on Earth the Modern Library would rank in #2 on their top 100 list. I wouldn't have put it in the top 100. Or the top 1000, for that matter.If you want to read classic American lit, don't read the Great Gatsby - read Twain or Steinbeck or Salinger. Their worst books are probably better than this one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was intially enthusiastic that I had found time to read the &quot;great American novel&quot; and the definitive work of the 20th century, Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his works, such as &quot;Bernice bobs her hair&quot;. So if it's insight on the 20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else it's reputation demands."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in high school, and now 20+ years later. I still don't get what makes this book so highly acclaimed. As a Christian, I do not condone the adulterous affairs portrayed in the novel, one character beating his girlfriend, nor the rumored illegal means by which Gatsby earned his wealth. Perhaps if I didn't care about those things, I would have felt more favorably about Gatsby and the other characters.I did find the narrator, Nick Carraway, somewhat likable. Nick observes all the immorality around him, and he seems to keep himself from being sucked into the abyss; however, his being seeing as an outsider was likely due to his modest means compared to most others in the story. I was happy to see Nick had a sense of honor about him and his chosen profession of selling bonds. It seems his independence separated him from the filthy rich, but he was friendly enough that people entrusted him with their secrets."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I bought this for my daughter because it was on her summer reading list. I'm honestly noe sure why this is so highly rated in \\"Amrican Literature\\". While its well written, the story is depressing, the characters are shallow and I thought it was a boring read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner. The price was wonderful. What wasn't so wonderful was all the handwritten notes throughout the book. It made it difficult for my high schooler to focus on the author's actual writing because of the writing, underlined marks, notes in the margins, etc. I wish the bookseller had stated the extra marks. I would have picked a new book or maybe another vendor. Guess I learned my lesson, you do get what you pay for."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I finished the No. 2 novel in a much shorter time than I finished the No. 1 novel (Ulysses). The Great Gatsby was a very short and readable novel, that didn't confuse your mind with incomprehensible jumble of psychedelic words pasted together to make a nice literary mosaic (still hammering on Ulysses). The Great Gatsby provided a nice window for looking at the pre-depression era of the 1920s lifestyle on the east coast, and also portrayed a vibrant narrative of a love-stricken psychotic fool within all of us given the right circumstances. The culmination of related events at the end is well worth the minimal effort required to read this book. Because it was such a short novel, I would recommend it for light reading, but would not rate it No. 2 all time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was able to hold my interest. I want to read more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"All I can review this book on is the shipping of the book.

He wrote an essay that explains how the various colors relate both to her and to the important themes in his novels. The Great Gatsby is the perfect distallation of these themes and codes."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Contrary to some of the other reviews, I thought this book was great, and you don't need to be an accomplished reader to enjoy this book. I read this in fifth grade and everyone liked it. Sure not everyone caught the true meaning of the book when they first read it but when they did, they realised that they were reading a truly good piece of literature. When you read each page you can tell that the author has put alot of time and thought into this book. This book isn't for people who want a fast, action, packed read. It takes some time and thought to finish the book as you mull over each page. If you're looking for a great classic, then read The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A required book for my English class, _The Great Gatsby_ has become one of my favorite books. The symbolism is amazing--a green light, the watchful eyes of an eye doctor's ad, the owl-eyed man, driving, Gatsby's library... it is amazing how Fitzgerald pulls it all together. And on top of it all, Fitzgerald creates what is considered the perfect narrator in Nick Carraway (give or take a letter). All in all a great read!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yes, this is a classic, but not everyone was required to read it in school. I wish I had been, since I would have discovered a wonderful, heart-wrenching, beautifully written novel much sooner than now, when I am in my late twenties. This book made me feel so much emotion, and every word Fitzgerald uses is brilliantly perfect. The story is very compelling as well, and it drew me in so much that I did not put it down on the second day I read it (the beginning drags just a tiny bit--keep reading! ) for a full eight hours until I finished it. If you have never read it thus far, DO...for the women, it has a touching, tear-jerking love story, and for men, all the violence and egotism you've come to expect from a good read. EVERYONE should read this excellent piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Its written with high detail and low action. Fitzgerald's now classic piece of life in the 20's set in New York, Long Island. I cant think of a more moving book than this one, however, I had realized that I felt more when I was done with book. When I had a chance to see the story as a whole that the emotions began to set in. Truly wonderful writing that is top notch among any of the writers I have read. His reading does not &quot;talk&quot; over you, but rather with you. Which is what makes the story attractive. Although many people complain about being forced to read it for school, its probably best read on your own time without constrictions. The story of Jay Gatzby, party man, millionaire, mansion owner. Everyone knows Jay. But who really knows him? Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've yet to read a better crafted book than The Great Gatsby. It is simply the most beautiful book you can come across. The prose is gorgeous and deceptively simple, all the more stunning for its simplicity, because it almost makes you believe you could write a book like this yourself. You can read the novel on many levels. Few readers can avoid finding symbolism. Daisy is the untouchable American Dream, perhaps, and Gatsby is the immigrant who, like all new Americans, throws himself fully into the idea of America while ignoring or hiding his own and America's reality. The opulence and decadence of 20s America is brilliantly conveyed, and there is also a considerably amount of realistic description of the time. The Great Gatsby more than any other book made me realise just how pervasive and persuasive the idea of the American Dream is, and just how empty the reality can often be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was absolutely wonderful. The book takes you back to the post-World War I era where you find the narrator, Nick Carraway, a young midwesterner moved to New york to find a home in West Egg working as a stock broker. The book journeys through Nick's experiences in high society at West Egg. When the narrator first arrives to West Egg he meets up with his cousin Daisy Buchannan, and her quite wealthy husband Tom. Shortly after coming to New York he attends the party of Jay Gatstby, a racketeer of the 1920's. He then becomes fast friends with Gatsby, and finds himself everly more intwined in Gatsby's life. Overall the book was very good. I enjoyed the many themes at hand, especially those about high society during the 20's. Such as the idea that Gatsby's own constant reinvention of himself is what inevitably destroys him. A fantasic book for those who enjoy books about people."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The language of this incredible book is rich and tangible. As the background of each scene is subtly created through descriptions of colors, tones and textures, all the strange and brightly colored building blocks of a masterpiece are set in place. It is a book full of the dismal philosophy of early 20th century America and full of the irridescent vitality of human passion and pain. I was hesitant to read it at first because of its overexposure--it seemed as though everyone had the same things to say about it. But last year, as a junior, I did finally read it and now that I have, I can only heartily agree with everything I've heard--this is one of the greatest books of our century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is positively the best book I have ever read in my life. I was assigned this book to read during my junior year in high school, and although I read it on a schedule due to the tests, I looked forward to reading it everyday, and I loved discussing the book. This is such a great book about romanticism, how Gatsby would stoop to gaining riches from bootlegging, to impress the woman of his dreams~Daisy Buchanan. Tragic ending, especially with the funeral, but it's still the best book Fitzgerald ever wrote, hands down."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I probably would never have picked up the Great Gatsby at my own accord, but thankfully I was required to read it for school. The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books now. Its short, but full of substance. I like that it moves quickly when reading and how human the characters of Gatsby, Daisy, and Nick all seem. The reader can connect with these characters and I think Fitzgerald did a wonderful job on creating this novel. It is about the great American dream, so I like it even better. However, Fitzgerald does an expected twist at the end which makes the book even more effective. I really like this book, I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a little bit of reality, humor, and a great American story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In my life, I have read many books; however, none has affected me as much as _The Great Gatsby_. When I read reviews that claim it is over-rated or trivial, I almost take it personally. How can anyone miss the beauty, eloquence, and depth of this novel?Fitzgerald creates some of the most magnificent characters and scenes in the history of literature in this book. Gatsby is the embodiment of the American dreamer. He is so insecure that he shrouds himself in glitter. He wants one thing he can't have so much, he surrounds himself with every other possession. He finds that getting what you want is often the worst thing possible, and that, to be very cliche but borrow from Fitzgerald's own images in this book--everything that glitters is not gold. The character is classic because a part of him exists in so many people.Daisy and Tom are also classic characters. Haven't we all met this shallow type that takes what it wants at whatever cost and leaves the world to clean up their messes? Sure we may feel sympathy for Daisy in some more tender scenes, but isn't that how people like her get away with hurting others?Finally, Nick is a wonderful character because he is so like the reader. He is the man who can't help but stand on the side of the road watching an imminent disaster. There is little we can do but watch and once it happens, we can't force ourselves to turn away.These characters are incredibly developed, and because they are so universal, so archetypal, we can identify society through them.I have failed to touch on the unity of effect of the novel, the poetic prose, or the incredible theme that permeates the novel, but I hope that readers will find these for themselves. Let Nick take you for a xfat drive through East and West Egg; you won't be sorry you took the trip."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a great Modern American Literature novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It takes place in the early 1900's. The main characters are Jay Gatsby, a very rich and handsome man, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, and Daisy's cousin Nick Carraway. This book is written for entertainment. It captures all the romance and glitter of the Jazz Age in its portrayal of a young man and his tragic search for love and success. The theme of this novel is that Gatsby wants to get Daisy back as his true love. The problem is that Daisy is already married. Gatsby believes that once Daisy sees him again, she will fall back into love with him. One day, Gatsby wants Nick to invite Daisy over to his house for tea. Nick said that he would do it, so he called Daisy and asked her to come over. When she got there, she started talking to Nick, then Gatsby appeared. Daisy hadn't seen him for a long time. They just starred into each others eyes. Finally, they started talking. This scene is a major event in the story because this is where Daisy starts to fall in love with Gatsby again. The use of irony in this novel is repeated throughout the story. For example, if Gatsby is so much in love with Daisy, then why would he have even thought about leaving her in the first place. Then, if Daisy was so in love with Gatsby, why did she marry Tom and not wait for Gatsby to return to her. A quote that is repeated in this novel is &quot;good morning, old sport.&quot; This quote is said to Nick by Gatsby. Gatsby never calls Nick by his real name. He always refers to him as &quot;old sport.&quot; A person that likes love stories would like this novel. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more to find out what might happen to Gatsby and Daisy's love for each other."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby's life plays out like out like a biography on F. Scott Fitzgerald because it is. The Great Gatsby is a better book because the author experienced everything that went on during the twenties. In fact, if Fitzgerald had wrote this book today it would be a plot line on Days of Our Lives. I didn't know this book would be so entertaining. Jay Gatsby is a millionaire with a wonderfully mysterious past. He is madly in love with his old girlfriend Daisy who rejected him because of his poor beginnings. Now, Gatsby is back with an extravagent life and an obsession with Daisy. Only problem is, she's married to the rich and jealous Tom Buchanan. Gatsby throws crazy parties(a reflection of the decade)hoping that one day Daisy might stumble back into his arms. Nick Caraway, Daisy's distant cousin, moves into next door to Gatsby and soon the inevitable happens:characters start getting tangled up in each other's lives. This book was satisfying in all aspects:love, scandal, suspense and humor. And will you look at that: all before major motion pictures. Screenwriters didn't make this stuff up."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby wasn't just great, it was fantastic, excellent, amazing, and most importantly fun to read. Fitzgerald's style of writing ingrigued me from the beginning. His exquisite use of figurative language had me fully engaged. I never wanted to put the book down. His characters had me enthralled throughout the whole novel, and I felt like I was watching the events happen, just as Nick was.When I first was told I was going to read the Great Gatsby I wasn't that excited. Although the 1920s were a fascinating time in our history, it didn't seem the book would be that great. Once I read the first page, I was proven wrong. There were many themes that taught me. Instead of running away from the question &quot;What are the themes of this novel?&quot; (usually asked by English teachers), I wanted to know the answer and understand the novel more.The symbolization in the novel was also great. The green light across the bay represents the far away love Gatsby has for Daisy. The clock falling represents the way that love has been lost and will never be retrieved; that too much time has passed.All of the symbolization, the themes, and the distinct description throughout the novel make it a wonderful read. I enjoyed reading this novel so much. It was one of the best written novels I've ever read. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY superficially is the story of what happens to Nick Carraway, and the conclusions he draws from his experiences. Yet the very experiences of his own become the theme of the book. Nick, as a narrator, becomes significant in the thematic content.Like many American novels in the same time period, THE GREAT GATSBY relies heavily on variety of symbols. A symbol may function on several levels at once. A symbol may represent an idea but also function as an idea throught the book.One of the central idea that stands out and persists throughout the other novel is wealth. Fitzgerald's persoanl life has contributed a greal deal to this idea of wealth. In fact, his own life has more direct pertinence to his work than the lives of most writers. The idea of wealth ocuupies a great deal and achieves a central role in the novel, as well as Fitzgerald's life.Nick Carraway is able to see the self-destructive nature of fascination of wealth. Maybe this is the message Fitzgerald wants to get across as he was deeply possessed by such fasination of materialism."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot; These are the last words in the novel, and sum up its theme. Our minds (like moths to the light) are drawn irresistibly to the most wonderful moments we have experienced. Our mistake is then to build our future around them, not realizing that they can never be recaptured. In pursuing the past into the future, we deny ourselves the real potential of the future.The Great Gatsby is developed in novel form around the story line of a Greek tragedy. Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor, is the narrator, serving the role of the chorus. This choice of structure creates a marvelous reinforcement for the book's theme. The novel is constricted by the tragic form, even as Gatsby's future is by his immobilization by the past. If you like that sort of irony, you'll love The Great Gatsby.Nick knows both Gatsby (his neighbor in West Egg, Long Island) and Daisy Buchanan (his cousin who lives in East Egg, Long Island). Daisy knew Gatsby before he was Gatsby and before meeting Tom, her husband. Gatsby has made himself into a rival for Daisy over the five years since they have last seen each other, and makes his play for her again through Nick about mid-way through the book. Daisy and Tom's responses shape the tragedy that is this story. I won't say more because it will harm your enjoyment of the novel.The story itself is somewhat dated by the romantic perspective of the Roaring Twenties, and few will read it for the instant connection they will feel with the characters. Why would someone want to read this book? I see three reasons. The first is to explore the theme of moving illusions about the future built from the happiness of the past. The second is to see a fine example of plot development. There are no wasted words, actions, and thoughts. The third is to enjoy the language, which is beautifully expressive. For example, consider the book's opening sentence: &quot;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.&quot; Fitzgerald goes on one sentence later to give you a clue about how to read the novel. &quot;He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.&quot;These are not characters you will find uplifting. &quot;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness . . . and let other people clean up the mess they had made.&quot;Why did Fitzgerald create such characters? Precisely, because he did not approve and did not want you to approve. 'Everything that glitters is not gold' is another way of summing up the lessons of this novel.Why should someone not read this book? A reader who wants to be inspired by positive examples will find little to uplift oneself here. Someone who wants a story they can personally identify with will likely be disappointed. A student of how to create love and happiness will mainly find out how to create heartache and unhappiness. So the book is not for everyone.After you have read the book, I would encourage the self-examining reader to consider where in one's own life the current focus is dominated by past encounters rather than future potential. Then consider how changing that perspective could serve you and those you love better."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I did not go to school in America, and read this book about a year ago, but for whatever reason, I ended up here, and have to write some kind of upbeat report on the Great Gatsby to try to balance the tide against all the revisionist critics.The reason I mention school is that it would appear a lot of people have had traumatising experiences with classics being thrust down their throats. I do not know if it is a case of bad teacher, bad student, or simple incompatibility, but I would say this - if you really did not enjoy a book, DON'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO READ IT! One of the most disappointing experiences of my literary career (if you can call it that) was when I recommended my girlfriend to read Catch-22, and had it metaphorically hurled in my face after &quot;3 chapters&quot;. That's her right, but the negative reaction will always hurt more people than help them, whereas vice-versa for the positive one...especially since I have noticed that works that someone has always been attached to can still be reduced for them in the face of violent enough criticism. If you had a bad experience at school, it's fair enough to be upset about it...but this truly is a great book which should only have great things written about it.Both of Catch-22 and the Great Gatsby have humour and grace, and not a little hidden dignity. But Gatsby is clearly the superior work for the symbolists and amateur students of literature. It is a period novel, but like all the greatest of these kinds of works of fiction, it reaches far beyond its time. The writing is timeless, and the mystery makes for a latter day Much Ado About Nothing - perhaps it is boring on the surface, but boring like tectonic plates: fundamental, dealing in huge issues in subtle and slow movements. Yet it is not even a particularly long novel - several hours of great entertainment and effort well expended.I hate having to write prescriptively, but sometimes you can't help reacting, you know?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald wrote this classic in the grip of a stroke of archetypal genius. Hemingway, who previously disliked Fitzgerald, said that the book's cover was the ugliest he'd ever seen. Then, after reading it, Papa decided he would be Scott's friend for life because he could write a book like that.Jay Gatsby attempts to reach back into the past to retrieve Daisy, the southern belle who rejected him when he was poor. Now mysteriously wealthy, Gatsby moves to Long Island where Daisy is ensconced with her husband and proceeds to re-establish contact with her.Gatsby is an characature of a famous Mafioso of the twenties that always stood behind the scenes, never in the news. Alas, for all his guile in the underworld, he succumbs to love or what he thinks is love.The end of Chapter Six reveals the archetypal nature of the book, that Daisy is the object of a projection and transference. The absolute proof lies in the final paragraph of the chapter in the words of &quot;Nick Wheat&quot;, the first person chronicler.We should all take heed of the last page in the book, where the message comes across that pursuing old dreams is living in the past. &quot;...so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As a teacher of American literature, I have read many of the American classics, and since to teach is to learn something twice, I've had to read them often and closely. Without a doubt, The Great Gatsby is my favorite American novel to teach. Fitzgerald's prose verges on the poetic. The thematic and symbolic issues in the book heighten the reader's enjoyment of the story, but even the basic story is enough. I simply love this book. I couldn't put it down when I first read it. It is a flawless comment on the Jazz Age and the death of the American Dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"i have read a lot of bad reviews for this book and i am trying to understand why. yes, i can see where people are saying this book is shallow but are they really looking into the symbolism in this story. it is everywhere in the novel from the green light to t.j. eckleberg. also, this is a critique of fitzgerald's time. he wanted to show that american society of the 1920's was shallow. this book, i think, is a timeless classic. it makes americans look at their society and think what is going on."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's been fourteen years since I last encountered F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic short novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. What I've found was a much richer, much more perfect book than I'd remembered-- a book that evokes a time and place, and yet manages, I think, to speak to all times and all places where people have dreams, and where dreams go wrong.Because of it's brevity, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; aspires to a kind of structural perfection that longer and more ambitious masterpieces such as &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, for example, cannot begin to approach. Every scene contributes to the careful design of Gatsby's disillusionment and his eventual undoing. Every sentence, every word tells. Fitzgerald's prose is as tight and vigorous as it is rich and elegant.On this reading, I noticed the complexity of the emotional tone that Fitzgerald evokes. His narrator, Nick, seems to celebrate Gatsby's extravagant romaticism, even as he exposes its shortcomings. The effect is lyrical and cynical at once, much like life itself.I also got a better handle on the ambiguities that inform the character of Nick. The very first thing that he tells us is that he is slow to criticize others, and yet the narrative that follows is informed with Nick's judgement and implied criticism throughout. Later, he tells us that he is one of the few truly honest people he has ever known-- and yet in the end, Jordan Baker accuses him of fundamental dishonesty. I haven't figured out who is closer to the truth. Perhaps I'll approach the answer in some future reading. I'm already looking forward to the pleasure."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I did not like the novel entitled \\"The Great Gatsby\\" very much. I really found it disappointing, for before reading this book I thought it would be interesting enough to capture my attention. This did not happen because those parts that would be considered the climax were not interesting (I found theses scenes dull and predictable).Furthermore, I would like to say that most characters were not good at all. I consider that some scenes, such as the one in which Daisy starts crying on Gatsby's shirts, are meaningless (perhaps because what these parts want to symbolise, is not clear enough). Moreover, I think that the story should not have been told in the first person by Nick, because by doing this Fitzgerald gave no possibility of including an account of the emotional relationship between Gatsby and Daisy from the time of the reunion to the catastrophe.Finally, I would like to make clear that my opinion should not be taken as an insult towards Fitzgerald, who is a worldwide well-known writer, but as a personal comment in which I highlight what for me was wrong in the setting and development of \\"The Great Gatsby\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed. He provided a frame of reference for the people of the 20's to perceive their own time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I feel sorry for Gatsby. I know it would sound strange to most readers but I relate to Gatsby in his love for this rich girl ....Daisy.He thinks that one day he will marry her by becoming a rich man...but that never happens...the barriers of class are too great..

I fail to see how this book got an average of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book totally confuses me i'm supposed to do an art project on it and i have no idea what to do. The book had so many drags, why did the author use his symbols. What happened really at the end? And can some one give me an art project to do/"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book thinking I missed something by not reading it going through school. I didn't. The premise is decent enough and may have even been more original when he wrote it. But the fact is he wrote it quickly, across the ocean from his editor (no e-mail or faxes in those days), and the book apparently didn't even get edited appropriately before publication (Fitzgerald was already a success by the time he wrote this).The result is something barely fleshed out beyond your basic plot outline. This is just the bare bones, no character development, no real insight into what is happening, just a string of events that come to what Fitzgerald must have thought was a shocking conclusion (although you aren't entirely sure how you got there - we don't really know how Daisy made her decision). The ride is great though. Page after page of poorly edited text that reads like stream of consciousness, first draft writing as opposed to a finished work. I swear at least once he used a word that isn't even a word. It was so unintelligable that in certain editions (before they went back to previous Fitzgerald drafts and corrected the mistake) a simple grammatical error meant that you could think Daisy was pregnant before marrying Tom. Such a small error actually dramatically changes how you interpret the key plotline of the book.This book actually was not a smashing success upon publication, nor immediately after Fitzgerald's death. No, it became popular in the 1950s as America became obsessed with class differences and simultaneously fascinated and envious of the wealthy. This was the first novel in that space by pure happenstance because there wasn't much interest in the subject when Fitzgerald wrote it. So being first to market in public schools eager to stoke class differences, it was widely used in schools and took off from there.Utterly skippable. The best thing you can say about it is that for only 150 pages of your time, you too can claim to have read a classic novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Greed, lust, and money. These are the things that we as Americans dream for. This book shows what it can turn us into. This book is the greatest drama to ever be written. The most intricately simple look at what these things can turn us into. It journeys into the mind of humans and their ambitions. Simply amazing. A must read for any and everyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At the end of this novel, I finally understood why it is considered a piece of classic literature. Fitzgerald vividly depicts the gildedness of the Jazz Age without being obvious. Several plots are intertwined at once, offering an intriguing complexity that keeps your interest without confusing you. Nick's omniscient narration offers the reader a unique perspective on the corruption of high society, considering he is not a part of it. The poignancy of the story doesn't hit you until the end, but the ride on the way there is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm a high school student, and I'm still reading the book -- just started ch. 8 -- I got to say this book is pretty good. I love Fitzgerald's style of writing, and although some parts may be hard to understand, going over it again is very helpful. This books makes me wish I could've lived in the Jazz age."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby could be called the perfect novel - a flawless plot, creative characters, and beautifully written. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is one the finest novels America has produced. It centres on the lives of a few wealthy New Yorkers during the 1920s, and is now thought of as epitomizing the \`Jazz age' more than any other novel (hell, more than ANY other book for that matter).Through the main character Gatsby's love for Daisy, Fitzgerald shows us how we become blinded by our dreams, and yearn so much for them that they take over our perception of reality. But Fitzgerald was also giving a scathing criticism of the materialistic lives of the wealthy, as the sub plots and numerous conversations in the novel show. The narration of the character Nick is superb, and the numerous flashbacks that he describes are brought on so effortlessly that the reader often forgets they are occurring.I have read the Great Gatsby twice, because this really is the type of book that needs to be read more than once. It works on so many levels that cannot be fully grasped in a single read. The books slimness (most editions are around 200 pages) make it is a quick but by no means light read, Fitzgerald packs more than one could ever imagine into these 200 pages. A true classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a classic for a reason. Read it and you'll agree."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's work holds up exceedingly well over lo these many years. Written in the first person, its detailed descriptions and sensitive humor remain immensely readable, even as the lives of the characters descend into troubling, inevitable chaos.The namesake character, Gatsby, is an intriguing mystery who happens to live next door to the narrator, Nick. Gatsby's house is an overwhelming mansion that serves as the location for many a party among the city's idle rich. Nick gradually becomes entangled in their lives and carefully observes the drinking, carousing and (oftentimes) harmful behavior.As Nick tries to unpeel the layers of the mysterious Gatsby, desiring to discover the source of his fortune, he instead discovers a secret he'd be better off not knowing. As the central characters descend into the abyss, Nick can only watch and dictate his observations. Needless to say, it's still outstanding after all these years."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a famous novel, short novel, a rich novel- a novel that encapsulates many of the values, customs and characters of a certain era. Fitzgerald draws in his simple, careful, detailed style characters that are memorable for the characteristics they display, typical of the 20s flapper generation. Jay Gatsby- highlighting the strength of the appeal and ultimately failure of the American Dream, Daisy- beautiful, rich and reckless, Tom Buchannan- encapsulating the snobbery and harshness of many of the East Coast rich, Nick Carraway- a subtly drawn narrator who has many of the reactions associated with those who enter the inner circle of the wealthy- the curiosity, the fascination, the horror and the despising of their values. And Mrytle Wilson- representing the other side of the coin- from a poor background yet desperately enamoured with the world of the rich and turning up her nose at those close to her to climb up the social spectrum.The Great Gatsby shows up the hollow, nasty, reckless, superficiality prevalent in certain sectors of society better than any other novel I know. A timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Set in the 1920s, The Great Gatsby traces the tragic James Gatz (Jay Gatsby) and his yearn for his past love, the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The novel is narrated by Gatsby's next door neighbor, Nick Carraway, as he views everything that happens to Gatsby. The setting takes place in Long Island, New York, in two places: \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" separated by a bay. Gatsby is this filthily rich guy who lives in a gigantic mansion next to Nick in West Egg. Rumors about what kind of a man he really is swirl about Gatsby, but Nick keeps his own opinion until he actually meets the great Gatsby himself. Gatsby holds extravagant parties in his mansion, and people from all over the Island come, even uninvited. In reality, he has moved to West Egg and holds these big parties hoping to attract the attention of the woman he once loved during World War I, Daisy Buchanan, who is now living across the bay in East Egg. Unfortunately, Daisy married during the war, so she is technically unavailable. Gatsby, who values the past and money above anything else, does all he can to win her back, but alas, Gatsby is not called a tragic character for nothing.Beautifully written, mostly in prose, The Great Gatsby makes a reader step back and examine his own values. Even though Gatsby has all these bad characteristics attributed to him, the reader cannot help but empathize with him and his romantic idealization of the past. We all do that sometimes--live in the past and forget about the present.F. Scott Fitzgerald, when he died in 1940, thought he died as a failure in life. Well, with this classic The Great Gatsby that I have just now read, I beg to differ, Mr. Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Sadly, the Great Gatsby has been relegated to the pantheon of books we are forced to read in high school and dutifully summarize in book report format or else address the endless concerns of whether this or that character should have done this or that thing. I have made the similar mistake with works like the Scarlet Letter, or Emerson's Essays, which equally require a greater degree of maturity and perhaps experience to appreciate.The core of this book lies not in a simple unrequited love story. Fitzgerald addresses a much larger theme of how the mythic aristocratic ideal triumphs in American society while the fundamental reality of this ideal is denied. It must of course be remembered, that this paradox is distinctly an American one. This is a book written in and for a culture that embraces the value and rights of all of us and believes in the ability that we can all fulfill our unique destinies in life. There are no institutionalized lineages of kings and queens believed to be ordained by God to embody qualities above the common lot. No! We may say 'God save the Union!' or (until recently) 'One nation under God!' but never 'God Save the Queen!' The Great Gatsby was not written for a British or French audience who have believed in the authenticity of royalty and royal power, but for an American one. The Great Gatsby challenges each of us to question how we can reinvent and embrace a notion so fundamentally contrary to our stated beliefs and constitution?Primarily through the title character Jay Gatsby, we see how the aristocratic ideal triumphs, particularly over the unfortunate ones who choose to inadequately embody it. Gatsby fails in his pursuit of aristocratic grandeur for one simple reason: he is not an aristocrat. He comes from a poor family and is primarily a self-made millionaire, scrappy and opportunistic. If this were not condemning enough, we get a glimpse into some of the questionable business practices he is perhaps too closely tied to (we are led to believe bootlegging. It is the Roaring Twenties after all). Thus, one of the two must perish; either Gatsby or Gatsby's dream. We learn that it is Gatsby who does.At first inspection, the title seems contradictory. Gatsby fails, so therefore he is not great. However we see that he is - he achieves great success, purchases a great house on the Long Island Sound for a great sum of money, throws great, if not spectacular parties. The problem is that he is only great and great is not enough. He wants to become royalty and royalty is not great - it simply is.Those who do embody the ideal successfully are Tom and Daisy Buchanan. They are the victors. While we see that they win and those around them fail, what is it that they win? Who and what are they? Fitzgerald constantly defines them in elusive terms, the indescribable melody of Daisy's voice, the majestic athleticism of Tom Buchanan, the Yale man. The activity of life is not perpetuated by these two demi-gods. They behave as if they are spectators, bored and dissatisfied ones. While they have connections, wealth and beauty, what of a fundamental nature do they do that makes them admirable? Nothing. And therein lies the eternal source of disappointment for the imitators and emulators and worshippers. Inherited wealth and privilege cannot be achieved or pursued it can merely be had.The book is the story of a disappointed and disillusioned man, but not a mad-man. Gatsby is not someone who worships say; toothpaste and we can veritably call him crazy. We can relate to his quest for grandeur. We may even root for his success with Daisy. This is one reason why this book resonates and can be called a classic and should be read. Gatsby is not nuts. In fact, we are like him. Why? Because the myth has persisted through time as a way to make life taste more real and exciting, to create aspirations based on more than tangible considerations. We embrace the mythical because the converse is to embrace the mundane. Yet... How can we also embrace authenticity and meaningful values in our lives? And what about embracing values that contribute to stability and continuity? These are the timeless questions that remain."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Set in the 1920s, this now-classic-piece of literature has more than stood the test of time. Fitzgerald has so perfectly captured the era between WWI and the Great Depression, that it is forever engraved in our minds--the colors, sights, sounds, and even moral forays of the time. And all of this melds wonderfully with Fitzgerald's characters; the way carry on with reckless abandon. But don't think that Fitzgerald is preachy. No, he simply presents the material and lets you decided what kind of karma, if any, should be passed around. The beauty of this book lies in its simplicity (seeming) and execution. This is a keeper. Also very much enjoyed &quot;The Scarlet Letter, Bark of the Dogwood, Of Mice and Men, and Catch 22.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In the early 1900's there were two kinds of people, the rich and the poor. It was the period of time which was known as the Gilded Age. The Gilded Age could be used as a comparison to a gilded vase. Things during this time looked nice and perfect on the outside, while on the inside, things were rotting, diminishing, and disintegrating. The poor were becoming poorer, while the rich were becoming richer. The lives of the rich were perfect, for they had nothing to worry about. It was a time of fun , games, amusement, parties and women. However all was not as good as it appeared to be. This time was filled with deceitful men and women; it was the time of prohibition, where the so-called drug stores sold about every kind of liquor; it was a time when bribes ruled the way things were run; it was a time when the World Series was fixed, and the profiteer was not found. F. Scott Fitgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was written to show the lives of society of both the newly rich, and the ones who inherited the wealth, the ones that were born rich and stayed that way. To show their inside lives, and to depict the morality of these people, the author has used to depict the themes of Gold Imagery of moral corruption, misplaced idealism, and waste of potential in the lives of the fictional characters."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot; Awsome....if you like Death of a Salesman, check this book out. Our lives seem to be an endless series of New Years Resolutions...stop chasing dreams tommorow, chase them now."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've tried every diet in the book(s.) But Mr. Fitzgerald has hit upon th perfect balance of low-carb dining and exercise. His insights into plums are unparallelled. Thank you Fitzy, you truly are a &quot;great&quot; gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was voted number two on the list of 100 greatest of the twentieth century and I never questioned this rating until confronted by an influentual college professor who made me examine the novel more closely. Many of the thoughts I now have on Fitzgerald and Gatsby I owe to him and I think it would be good to share them and allow people who read these reviews to rethink Gatsby somewhat. The fact is that Fitzgerald's &quot;great&quot; novel of the &quot;American Dream&quot; has serious problems that make it a questionable text for number two on such a list, especially considering it is placed above such novels as Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury and Light in August and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man.From the beginning of the novel, we are in the hands of a first person narrator in Nick Carraway, an empty shallow young man from the midwest who moves to the east to try his hand at the &quot;American Dream.&quot; The problem is that although most people would regard Nick as a shallow character, Fitzgerald doesn't seem to offer an underlying critique of this moral void inside of his character but instead forces the reader to accept what Nick says at face value. Then we meet Tom and Daisy Bucchanan. Tom is the quintessential Aryan prototype spouting racist propaganda about how it has been scientifically proven that the blond haired blue eyed Nordic male is superior in every way to other races, and again there is no satiric edge from Fitzgerald to say that Tom is not correct in his beliefs and assumptions. Then we reach the introduction of Gatsby and the melodramatic love story of Gatsby and Daisy. Gatsby is the nouveau riche who throws large excessive parties for anyone who will come to his mansion hoping that Daisy will someday show up. Fitzgerald goes down a list of participants in those parties and most of the people there are Eastern Europeans. This is a criticism of the parties in Fitzgerald's prose and begins to venture into the anti-semitic areas of the novel. The introduction of Meyer Wolfsheim, the stereotypical Jew seals the deal on that. We also soon discover that what attracts Gatsby to Daisy is not a human bond of understanding and friendship, but the fact that Daisy's voice jingles like money; and yet, people seem to view this love affair as stirring and tragic. The sad thing about the book is that all of its characters are shallow and money hungry. There is not a redeming figure in the book though the narrator Nick would like to say that the hero is Gatsby. Gatsby was all right in the end. It was what prayed on him that was bad. This is Fitzgerald's judgment.If this is the quintessential novel about the American Dream, if the lust of Gatsby is our lust as Americans and the love story of Daisy and Gatsby the type of love we as a people aspire to, we're in a great deal of trouble in this country. When books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn come under attack in high schools across for using the word &quot;Nigger&quot; and others such as The Grapes of Wrath are banned for using profanity such as &quot;Christ,&quot; The Great Gatsby, which is a far more damaging and subversive novel, slips by unnoticed. I'm not for censorship in any form, but we must think about what we want to tell children or any other students about America. While Huckleberry Finn and the Grapes of Wrath are being banned yet are permeated with important and positive messages about the meaning of America, The Great Gatsby is a staple in cirriculum everywhere saying that this is really what America is about. Part of the problem is that Fitzgerald's prose is so exquisitely poetic that the themes of the book sometimes disappear beneath the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleberg or get clouded by a green light at the end of a pier. Half the time if you stop to think, you can't even figure out what Fitzgerald is talking about. &quot;And so we float on, boats against the current borne ceaselessly back into the past.&quot; At the end of examining the novel in an American literature class in college my professor asked the students what this line meant. No one could come up with a satisfactory answer. The teacher who had been teaching The Great Gatsby in class for twenty years told us that he had never met anyone would could tell him what it meant. Perhaps the novel should have fallen to a lower spot on the list of the twentieth century's greatest novels."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book about the upper class in New York. It shows you how luxurious life can be but also how money doesn't bring total happiness. In this book the main character Nick Carraway is trying to break away from his country background and finds himself living in New York. What this book shows and what Nick finds out and doesn't like are the selfishness of the rich community, the backstabbing, and the shallowness in everybody. These are the reasons that Nick movies back to the country and marries his hometown sweetheart.In my opinion I didn't like this book for the same reason that Nick left to go back to the country. I thought it was a very difficult book to read because there was never any positive happening to these people and it moved at a slow pace. All the ladies in this book were selfish, shallow sluts who didn't care about anyone but themselves. This is shown when Daisy Buchanan has an affair with Gatsby. At the end of the book, when it comes down to choosing who she wanted to be with, she pick her husband just because Tom could offer her security and the life style she is accustomed to, not for true love. The men are not any better. They are also shallow, careless, and like to take risks. For example, Tom Buchanan is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is the wife of George Wilson who owns a garage in the Valley of Ashes. Tom keeps an apartment for her in the city during this book which is the scene of a rather wild party.Even though I didn't like this book there were still a few parts that I liked. I thought it was sort of sweet how Gatsby had a never-ending love for Daisy. Even though she didn't deserve the kind of love Gatsby gave her, the relationship was kind of a fairytale without a happy ending. I also thought the way Gatsby died was interesting. It was perfect timing for a death because he never had to go through life suffering, knowing that Daisy his obsession, would never be with him. It was ironic that George Wilson was the one who shot Gatsby because Wilson thought Gatsby was the one who had an affair with and murdered his wife. In fact Gatsby did neither and the only one who came on top was Tom Buchanan, who was responsible for causing pain in both of the men's lives.All in all I didn't like this book. It was slow moving, boring, and depressing. If I had to recommend this book to a group of people, it would be to adults/teenagers with a lot of time on there hands or if you just like gossip."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the most overrated book of all time. It's all about ritzy partying, about the things that happen to people who party a lot. That's the great American dream -- sappy unrequited love before and after partying. I can't understand why it's revered in American literature. It doesn't have anything to offer but a melodramatic peek at the lives of very shallow characters. The characters sounded as if they were culled straight out of Beverly Hills 90210: The Jazz Age Version. The prose is masterfully done, but the story is just pathetic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have to say, this is one of those books where you feel like there is something important that you are missing when you read it. It seems to be about nothing on the surface, but for some reason, it feels like there is an undercurrent of meaning that just didn't come through for me.The book is narrated by a man named Nick, who moves out to West Egg on Long Island to learn about bonds in the 1920s. His cousin Daisy lives on East Egg with her husband Tom, though they don't have a good relationship.Next door to Nick lives a self-made millionare named Gatsby, who throws weekly wild parties at his house, but seems to have a sad secretive side. Gradually, Nick gets to know these people, but not a whole lot else seems to happen for quite a while. Tom has a mistress named Myrtle, who is married to a car mechanic.Eventually, Gatsby begins to confide in Nick, and tells him that he once knew Daisy and wanted to marry her, but left to fight in the war. By the time he came back she was already married. His wild parties were designed to attract her attention so he could see her again. Nick eventually gets them back together, and finally one hot day, Gatsby confronts Tom.They had gone into NYC for the day, and argue hotly over who Daisy really loves and who she's going to live with, but eventually, Tom pretty much wins. He sends Gatsby back to East Egg with Daisy while he stays with Nick and another girl, Jordan.Meanwhile, the car mechanic has finally discovered that his wife is cheating on him. He tries to lock her up, but she runs out the door and is hit by Gatsby's car. Driving by a little later, Nick and Tom see this and are convinced that Gatsby was driving, though it was really Daisy. Gatsby decides not to tell anyone the truth to protect her.By the next day, Tom and Daisy have left the state and Gatsby seems tranquil, but there is a sense of foreboding. Nick has to leave for work and when he returns, Gatsby is dead in his pool, killed by the mechanic because he thought Gatsby had killed his wife. This part was a little confusing.In the end, Daisy doesn't seem to really care about Gatsby, and no one comes to his funeral except for his father and Nick.By the end of the book, I definitely felt that it meant something, but it seemed very hazy and I couldn't figure out exactly what. I think it has something to do with caring more about appearances and money, than anything else. I would recommend reading this book as it was fairly enjoyable after the first chapter, but if you're a teenager you probably won't understand it completely. I'm going to do a re-read when I'm older and hopefully it will become clearer."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It was too &#34;wordy&#34;.

I would buy from Amazon again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald took place on Long Island. This book was a very good example of the roaring 1920's. After studying the prohibition that happened in that decade and the depression in the following decade it really shows how the stock market really can change the world. The Great Gatsby is a good example to what happened during the prohibition. It was never said in plain English what was going on but if the reader knows the events of the 1920's it was very apparent.While reading The Great Gatsby, I was amazed by all the money that was spent. One example was when Jay was having large parties and driving very expensive cars. It also occurred to me that Jay Gatsby has a very dark side that nobody knew about. The people that did know about his income weren't willing to talk. This was one reason that the 1920's are called the \\"High Times\\" nobody cared how much money they spent or how they made money.I enjoyed reading this book. It was very easy to follow and had a lot of descriptive clues about the time period. It seemed like the whole book was an adventure because Fitzgerald never paused on one subject for a long amount of time. I liked how Fitzgerald wrote it on the events that really did happen in the 1920's. This gave the reader a glimpse into what a person at that time could have been doing or was doing to have fun or make a living for his family.I would highly recommend this book for anyone that is studying or going to study the 1920's. It is a very good example to what could have happen to someone during that time period. You won't regret reading this book once you start it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Many years have passed (alas!) since I read this American classic in college. So, I decided to give myself a treat and reread. Here is some of my marginalia: \\"Not a great paragraph. Nice image and flow. Could Gatsby be so successful while being such a clumsy liar? Anti-Semitic image. Great scene. Great chapter. Thought is confused. Another terrific chapter.\\" So, what am I saying? Fitzgerald writes with flawless lyricism when the subject is money and society. But when his subject doesn't evoke this lyrical mood, his writing can become choppy while his attitude toward certain types of people becomes superficial and harsh. Regardless, it's amazing the book is nearly eighty years old, since it still conveys what many people probably regard as a contemporary experience. My advice: Read Gatsby again!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I would have to agree with Mr. Thompson on this one. I can't add any new words of wisdom that haven't been written already by one of the other 600+ reviewers of this book. This deserves 6 stars, and is the quintessential american novel, putting the American Dream under the microscope and finding the ugly truths that lies beneath the glammor. The jazz age of the 20's is the perfect setting for a novel like this, about the American Dream, and the people who would do anything to acheive it. This is the era of bootleggers (how Gatsby got his money) and the sort of reckless spending and investment that sent the country into the Great Depression. If you are in high school, you should definitely read this book, and most high schools make you read it. I read it back in high school and didn't think too much of it, but after reading it again on my own, without useless worksheets or stupid deadlines, I got a lot more out of it, and that's what I suggest, read it on your own. If you are over high school age and haven't read this, shame on you. Pick this book up now, and read it front to back. No cheating! Do yourself a favor, and pick up this american classic, old sport."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a classic novel of the Jazz Age about aspiration in America. As V.S. Naipaul was recently quoted in the NY Times Book Review: &quot;The only valuable life is one that is shaped by the anguish of aspiration and that is engaged in a struggle against the void of nonachievement.&quot; Gatsby's life personifies the aspiration of a young man who has just returned from World War I so poor that he wore his uniform after his discharge because he couldn't afford to buy new clothes. Through his own entrepreneurial talents he rises to attain an immense fortune, which he hopes will renew the affection of his much beloved object of desire, Daisy Buchanan. She once jilted him because of his abject poverty and married another wealthy man. Now that Gatsby is rich, he wants Daisy to become his wife at any price. He asks her to forsake her relationship to her wealthy, philandering husband. The denouement of the novel is opulent in its irony. Gatsby's demise and the response of his many friends to it is truly memorable. Fitzgerald as Nick Carraway is an intelligent, articulate, noble and faithful narrator in this great American novel. At a time when so much focus has been placed on the hubris of American CEOs, the message of this novel about the unbridled pursuit of material wealth plays with as much high fidelity now as it did in the Jazz Age. This brief but important and beautifully crafted novel is a must-read for anyone who seeks to know the best work of one of America's most legendary writers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"All I have to say about this book is that it is incredibly heartbreaking, romantic, and beautiful.

Hopefully you all will enjoy it too. Thanks~"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a quality Classic, full of enchantment, and taking us back to the twenties just after the war.I took my time and savoured every word as it flowed along with a mysterious edge, causing me to be somewhat unsure of where you I was actually heading next.Narrated by Nick Carraway who had been anxious to come out to the East (New York) after spending a rather dull childhood in the Midwest, I found Carraway a very interesting person. A bit of a schemer sometimes; one is never sure how he really feels about Jay.Jay Gatsby is the enigma in this story; a rather poor officer who before he goes to war falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Daisy Fay from Louisville. But what happens after the war???The Great Gatsby having heard that his lovely Daisy has tied the knot with the uncouth, ill-mannered and filthy rich Tom Buchanan, goes to great measures to become wealthy too.... by all means. When he accomplishes this, he buys an elaborate house not far from the Buchanans where he hosts glittering and five star parties most weekends; with the hope that Daisy will eventually turn up.You will be entertained and shocked by the things Jay Gatsby does all in the name of love. His parties filled with lots of celebrities and Hollywood people do nothing to assuage his troubled and lonely soul. I felt his pain in this book and his isolation which you will experience too when you read this book.This is one of the best Classics on the market, even more so now that it has been updated. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to get my hands on F. Scott Fitzgerald's other updated ones; The Beautiful and The Dammed and Tender Is The Night. Fitzgerald is a boss and oh; the cover is soooo beautiful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yes, I've read this many times,since high school, where it seemed like a force fed waste of time.I never knew the types described in this book then.Like &quot;Bond Business&quot; Nick,a business based on trading money (update to Tom Wolfe'S BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,which has many similarities to THE GREAT GATSBY!) But, that was a long time ago. Usually I breezed thru it,but recently I gave it a more serious try, and found it to be just as great as they say! Why? Simply, because the characters are incredibly true to life. I've met Tom Buchanan types so many times it makes me want to (I won't say here.) The world is full of arrogant smart alecks who never had to do a thing on their own,and who look down their nose at their supposed &quot;inferiors&quot;. And Daisy...How many shallow,money grubbing,self obsessed young ladies are there like this? One wonders what Gatsby saw in her too,but that's probably the point. You know, the ones who get thrilled by looking at dozens of colored shorts in a wardrobe, as she does with Gatsby. Both types really care for nothing except themselves and their little toys. FS Fitzgerald probably knew hundreds like this...Now the Gatsby character is more unique and refreshing,even if he is dull.The self made guy who may have made his money under shady conditions. Then again,how about the dot-com millionaire rage of recent memory, and the way the world and the media were lapping it up. Now, the Enron fiasco where it's obvious the bigshots could care less about anything other than lining their own pockets at everyone else's expense.A little like Tom perhaps. But Gatsby seemed to have a heart, shallow as he may have been. And the New York 1920's locale rings true too...This novel easily can be read by a 15 year old,even though his life experience will not be able to understand it. And an 80 year old can appreciate it too. If Joyce's ULYSSES was the best novel of the century, how many can figure it out?. Really, almost no one! Same with most others on the list,like say Faulkner.ULYSSES was not about what FSF called &quot;the bitch goddess success&quot; which is what THE GREAT GATSBY is about...As far as another reviewer here questioning what the final line meant..ie &quot;So we beat on,boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past&quot;...Surely it was THE GREAT GATSBY'S obsession with the past,even as the future beats away, and Daisy's disappearance from the past into the present, that was responsible for his terrible demise at the end!! Tell your Professor that's the obvious answer to his 20 year question..We should each learn to deal with our own past darknesses. The tragedy of a person like Gatsby is that it becomes an obsession resulting in a sad ending...Also, this is without question a monument to the language, the second reason it is such a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, born back ceaselessly into the past&quot;.Surely one of the most apt and, to the reviewer who claimed no one can understand it, clearest conclusions to a novel. The Great Gatsby is a novel about the pursuit of a romantic ideal. Gatsby/America pursues its ideals in vain. For all our optimism, for all the pure belief in the ideal/the green light/the orgiastic future, it recedes before us, year by year. It is unattainable, it does not exist, it is but the projection of our past desires (for Gatsby, read the Daisy of his past, for America, read the untarnished new world). Still, no matter, we will keep trying, we will row on, boats against the current, our goal folornly already behind us... we are born back ceaselessly into the past.As for the anti semiticism/racisim - Tom is a racist, but is clearly an unthinking ignorant racist - did Fitzgerald really need to expressly condemn him? The condemnation is implicit.Perhaps the professor referred to in the first review had his own political agenda. If so, i suggest he read Roth's the Human Stain."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel takes place in the 1920's and is based on some of the things that happened in the earlier part of F. Scott Fitzgerald's life. I felt that The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was an amazing novel for many reasons. Some people felt that around the first fifteen pages or so were not needed, but I thought that the pages helped me a lot with understanding the setting. It was incredible how well written this novel was. Every page just keeps pulling you in deeper and gets you more interested. As I got into the book, I had to think twice about whether it was a true story or not. If you read this book straight through like any other book, you will think it was well written and had a good story line. However, this book is much more complicated then it seems. There is symbolism throughout the whole book that you should lookout for. Once you identify it, you will have a whole new understanding of what this book is really about. I loved the way that this novel was such an easy book to read because one idea just flowed to the next. Most books that are considered classics are relatively difficult to read, but this really wasn't. It was really amazing how you could relate what happened in this book to what happens in everyday life today even though it is a completely different time period. For people who like reading good literature, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave. It's the story about spoiled rich people with no meaning to their lives. If this is the best of the author's works, I won't read any more of his books. There are too many truly good books in the library."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave. It's the story about spoiled rich people with no meaning to their lives. If this is the best of the author's works, I won't read any more of his books.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1920s novel of The Great Gatsby really is. It is quite comical to know the many dissimilar viewpoints there are because from several people, they praised the book and had said that it was one of their favorites, whereas others opposed it stating otherwise. So honestly, I unable to take any of their opinions of what they thought of the book into consideration, thusly I had to read it myself.When I first heard that my literature class and I had the opportunity to read The Great Gatsby, I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. Honestly, the way he expresses his writing with such perplex detail isn't the smartest approach an author, who supposedly is seen as one of the greatest American novelist in American Literature, should make. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A bunch of rich snobs complain about how boring life is while putting down or bullying poorer people.

To be quite honest I have never been more disappointed in a book before. I heard many praises about this book but when I actually read it I kept asking myself what is wrong with so many people who think this is a great book...I guess it's because the title of the book has the word great in it.All it's about is this guy who becomes way too obsessed with a so said 'golden girl' and just dedicates all her accomplishments to her. It's a book about doomed marriages that ulitmately results in infidelity (what a surprise). It's no wonder the book is classified as a tragedy."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great American Novel, some say. Difficult to understand because it was written in the language of the times, say others. It is neither. I borrowed this book because it was supposed to be a classic. Instead I found it was lacking in sympathetic characters, focus, meaning (aside from the very obvious, played-to-death 'everything is superficial' theme), and thoroughly unabsorbing. From the moment it started out, it rang false. It begins with the narrator (Nick Carraway; even his &gt;name&lt; is mediocre) giving the reader a lot of pointless information. Do we need to know that he looks like a painting of his great-uncle? He goes over in very abstract terms, what he got out of the experience that this book is about, which would have been infinitely more meaningful toward the end. I'm sorry that I have not read any of Fitgerald's other works - I hear &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; is supposedly better - but that leaves my opinion unclouded by prejudice. This book is amateurish, meek, and clumsy. Where is the elegant prose that other reviews go on about? The most I can say about this book is that it ends correctly, though somewhat predictably. For marginally better books on the same era, try PG Wodehouse's Jeeves or Blandings Castle series. They may not be quite as serious, but that can be a good thing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I truly, truly do not understand how and why this book is considered a classic novel. Excluding foreign works that put this book viciously to shame, even for an American novel, this is not an extraordinary achievement. I'll admt, however, that had this been called a short story, I should have more respect for it; but it is considered a novel! one of the greatest novel of all times, one reviewer wrote! Anyone who believes that has never read a single \\"great\\" book in his or her life. Read \\"The Man Who Laughs,\\" \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" anything by Chekhov, \\"Les Miserables,\\" \\"War and Peace,\\" \\"The Magic Mountain,\\" \\"The Decameron,\\" or even \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and then come back exclaiming this is \\"the perfect novel!\\" It is not. It's wretchedly unorganized, sloppy, more shallow than a puddle of water quickly drying in the sun, poorly written, overly ambitious, and in everyway wanting. I was not forced to read this for highschool, I did for enjoyment, and though I found the work enjoyable, it was enjoyable in the way that a movie is enjoyable: a brief moment of delightfulness. \\"Long Journey into Night\\" had more literary qualities than this, and that's a movie. I do not mean to sound harsh in this review, but I wish American readers had the ability to recognize great work. But as I was commenting on earlier, even as an American novel, to place this swill on the same level as \\"true\\" American classics such as \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" \\"The Awakening,\\" and \\"Walden\\" is an insult to the genre.

I read The Great Gatsby in my senior year of high school, and of course, it was not particularly my favorite book. If someone asked me why I did not like it for the first time, I would say that I was not concerned about the author's language but the plot of the book.About a year after I had read the book, I chose to read The Great Gatsby for the second time because I wanted to know what other people meant when they referred to Fitzgerald's \\"beautiful writing.\\" Even though I chose to read The Great Gatsby, by myself, I did not expect to get something different out of it. However, surprisingly, the second time was so much better than the first time.Before I read this book for the second time, I did not understand what my English teacher meant by \\"beautiful writing\\". I do not want to say that it is the best book that I have read in my life, but it has descriptive writing that keeps people's attentions. I can say with confidence that it is a well-written book that has \\"beautiful writing\\" and engaging characters. I can picture Gatsby's parties and what Daisy looks like because of the metaphors that Fitzgerald uses in his book.I consider The Great Gatsby one of the \\"greatest\\" American novels because it not only entertains people but also leaves many questions. However, I looked at other reviews from the Amazon.com, and I was little upset that some people did not appreciate Fitzgerald's writing. My advice to high school students who did not enjoy this book is that they should try to read it outside of school. I guarantee that everyone will have a different reaction to the book the second time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway was born into a well-to-do, wealthy family, and lived the life of privilege. Attended the best schools, wore the best clothes. So after he graduates from the University, he informs his father that he plans to move East to learn the bond business, and that's how he ends up in West Egg, living across the way from Gatsby. Nick knows nothing about the man, except for the fact that he throws lavish parties almost every day of the year - complete with celebrities in attendance. However, when he pays a visit to his old friend Tom Buchanan's place, and meets up with Miss Baker, a friend of Tom's wife, Daisy, he discovers more than he ever intended. Soon Nick is caught up in a friendship with Gatsby, one that involves covering up the affair that Gatsby and Daisy are secretly having with each other, as Tom looks on angrily - becoming more and more determined to break it up each day, at whatever cost.I usually am a reader of mysteries and teen fiction, but lately I've really gotten into the classics, so I thought that I'd give THE GREAT GATSBY a whirl. I was not at all disappointed. THE GREAT GATSBY has now become one of my favorite books. F. Scott Fitzgerald is truly a literary genius. His character development involving Tom, Daisy, Nick, Miss Baker, and Gatsby is utterly marvelous, and the plot developments keep the reader enthralled with the lives of the rich and privileged from the very first page to the very last. This is a book that should be read by all, young or old.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is one of the all-time greats. No other book out there fleshes out the pre-World-War-1 era like this one. Everyone knows the story is about a man who amasses a lot of wealth by various dubious means, solely to please Daisy, a socialite that he has his heart set on. Daisy had rejected him once before in favour of a social equal, Tom Buchanan. But poor Gatsby. No matter how high he rises, he is doomed. When he takes the blame for a hit-and-run murder committed by Daisy, he is murdered by the victim's husband. Gatsby is an anti-hero. His main fault is that he has fallen in love with the wrong girl. Fitzgerald was very brave to write this book since it took such a blatant shot at the \\"American Dream\\" and the shallowness of the idle rich. This book is classic that will endure for a long time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is written superbly. Fitzgerald does an amazing job of creating the feeling for his reader of being there with his characters. The characters themselves are purposely soulless people who have chosen to chase after the emptiest form of the American Dream, capturing its trappings without any of its sense of accomplishment. The characters and story are gradually exposed as you make your way through the story, learning who the characters are and how they became the way they are.Long after you finish the novel, you still feel transported to another time and place when you think about it. A wonderful American tragedy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A lot of people tend to say The Great Gatsby is an overrated piece of literature, however I agree with the majority that considers it one of the finest pieces of 20th Century American literature (or literature from any period, from any country for that matter). The story is pretty familiar to most so I won't summarize it, however if it's possible for you I highly recommend listening to the 1984 audio cassette version narrated by Frank Mueller (who was and indeed still is probably the greatest audio-book reader anywhere). Mueller's rich and inflective voice is a joy to listen to; he makes the story's prose -- already inherently poetic -- even more beautiful by greater life by stressing certain words/phrases and changing his voice slightly for each character.This book seems a little short but it accomplishes a lot for what it is. It's a simple basic story with a lot of complex symbolic meanings, and that's probably why it gets studied so much. If you want further fascinating reads, a biography of Fitzgerald's turbulent life (he died young at 40) reads like a true-life allegory of his stories.So, definitely read the book! Definitely listen to the tapes! Definitely watch the 1974 Redford film NOT because it's particularly well dramatized but just for the great costumes and period settings. After watching the movie, even though I didn't think it was a good one, I still picture Robert Redford as Gatsby, the shrill Mia Farrow as Daisy, and that one dork whom I can't name as her husband, Tom.A special treat might be the 50s version starring former heartthrob and current dead actor Montgomery Clift. He gives a subtle, nuanced performance compared to Redford's \\"it's okay if I can't act well in this movie because I'm good looking!\\" portrayal."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of the better books that I have read. The Great Gatsby by Francis Scott Fitzgeralds. It is a novel that will expand your intellect and is also a very popular book that a lot of people enjoy reading and find it easy to understand. The book was published in 1925, and the setting takes place in 1922. The narrator, who is also one of the main characters Nick Carraway is a fairly young man from Minnesota who went to an Ivy League School which is also known as Yale. After the war he moves to New York and he works in the city. The other main character Jay Gatsby young man alittle older than Nick he is very rich and is a very mysterious person. He dosnt allow people to know his true identity and people make up stories about who he is but no one in the beginning has ever seen him before. He fell inlove with Nicks cousin a while ago her name is Daisy and she lives across the pond from him. He ask for Nicks help throughout the story to try and get back with her. Nick in the beginning gives advice that his dad has given him and talks about his life and what he enjoys about it. Is this book he doesn't critisize other people and just tells the story as it is.Nick is learning business that's why he moved to New York. The house he has in rented which is right next to Gatsbys house, he throws parties nearly every night. One day he goes to visit his Cousin Daisy and her Husband, he meets a young women who seems to take well to him her name is Jordan Baker she is a profesional tennis player. She said that her and Gatsby used to date before the war. Gatsby now asks of Nick to arrange a meeting with him and Daisy at Nicks house. By this time Nick has met with Gatsby a few times and they are becoming more familuar with eachother. Once they have the arrangment and Daisy and Gatsby are reuinited this is where all of the problems begin in the novel. Gatsby's true self begins to reveal once he starts seeing Daisy the relation ship between Nick and Jordan is getting stronger while the relaiton ship between Daisy and her husband is weekening. Daisy's husband is having an affair while he is with Daisy with a women named Murtle she is the wife of a guy who owns a gas station in the middle of the town that Gatsby often travels through. Gatsbys affair with Daisy tends to get him into some trouble along the way it is a exampl of love and affairs and what happens to them along the windy road."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What's not to love about this book? The glitz of New York in the 1920's barely overlays its moral decay. Our ambiguous narrator, Nick, is repulsed by this at the same time as he is complicit in every event of the story. The distant and pining figure of Jay Gatsby, who longs for a woman he can never have, represents the belief that money can buy anything and the purposelessness that would occur if a dream were fully realized. As a near-perfect example of modern literature, Gatsby uses symbolism itself to show that symbols only hold the meanings with which we vest them. For example, the symbol of the eyes is so haunting because it infuses the story, but has no fixed meaning or context. As long as this novel remains a beloved classic, America will never fully be able to divorce itself from its past."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Obviously so much has been written about this great classic of American twentieth century letters, that my renderings will hardly add to the pantheon of acclaim and recognition that this wonderful story invokes. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of one who writes so well that he makes it seem easy.Like his contemporary Hemingway, he had the ability to make shocking statements without exclamation or over-emphasis. Also, his narrator is in a way a step removed from the central story, although having his own demons and hang-ups; in the end he is an irreplaceable part of Gatsby's sad ending.The story transports the reader into the 1920's, when bootlegging and infidelity were taboo but evidently commonplace. Idealistic love, and its dissolution, are at its core. This makes the novel timeless. Daisy Buchanan (the central female character) represents the type of ideal, rich, carefree woman that the 1920's is known for; Jay Gatsby the swashbuckling and debonair type that women sooned over; urbane and unaccountable. Perhaps the novel shatters the shallowness of those simple stereotypes. It is not by any account a feel-good reminiscence of the Jazz Age. bit something much deeper. The brilliance is that it makes you pine for the era while exposing the obvious superficiality present within it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a small thought, but GG is more pertinent today than the year of its publishing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"i cant believe people buy this book, it is soo boring i dunno how they rate this to be up with the other classic great books of the world... but this is just stupid"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Along with Catcher in the Rye, this has got to be one of the most overrated, self-indulged pieces of \\"literature\\" ever written.

The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book: It lacks depth of any significance. The descriptions are minimally imaginative, and never spark excitement. And the characters? The characterizations, the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions, are all simple and don't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling. Supposedly, for example, the several main characters in the book, most notably Gatsby, have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips, but are afraid to grasp it. But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short, this book, while having a decent plot and overall structure, was boring, because the writing is boring. If The Great Gatsby was a serious attempt at good writing, then it is evident to me that Scott Fitzgerald had never in his his life experienced any significant passion or the thrill and thunderburst excitement that is the reward of spirited creativity."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Bought this book because it was recommended as a great american classic.Once I finished reading it, I threw it into the \\"poubelle\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Title: The Great GatsbyAuthor: F.

Aside from being traditional bourgie literature about the convoluted drama of rich people and not-rich-enough people, it makes several displays of Fitzgerald's attendant racism; not only in his caricatures of blacks and Jews, but in his character Tom's discussion of the excellent \\"scientific\\" book he is reading, \\"The Rise of the Colored Empires\\" by Goddard, a thinly veiled reference to \\"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy\\" by Stoddard. One could dismiss this as Tom's racism and not a reflection of Fitzgerald if it were not for Fitzgerald's constant stereotyping of blacks as clowning, ill-spoken servants. One could add a taste for highly inappropriate adjectives such as \\"niggerish feet\\" and \\"noisy niggery street fairs\\" in his other works.One may ask, if this is a Great American Novel, which America are we speaking of? Certainly, Fitzgerald's sentiments were shared by many people in his time, but I would like to think that we are progressing as a nation.

Since i found there to be none. I would not recommend this book to people.I found the author to put to much detail into the things that I thought were unnecessary, and definetly not enough in the aspects that I thought would have been important. And from the beginning of the story I was confused and lost to as what was going on and where he was. The way we writes just didn't flow in my head. I could not grasp what he was trying to say and what he was attempting to show me. When he would talk about one person, I would think he was talking about someone else, and I was completely lost as to who he was or the relavence to the story. I got the feeling that the narrator was schitzo. or something along those lines, just from the way he seemed to jump around and completely change. But I am not totally sure on that.I understood that Gatsby was a very important man, he had a large effect on many people around him. But I could not get over how Fitzgerlad wrote about him. I had such a hard time figuring out what was what. Gatsby was a very wealthy man. As I go on reading others reviews I am beginning to understand that there are three settings and they are simply there so the reader and be in awe of how Fitzgerald writes. I was not in awe, I was very bored through the entire book.I am very picky with the books I like to read, they have to hold my attention from the veryt beginning, or else I just set them down and don't pick them up again.

If you are rich and money if no object to you then you would see it as a non-fiction story. But if you are like the majority of other people around the United States, then it would be fiction. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this \\"great\\" novel that everyone proclaims it to be, which by some and sometimes many will tell you the opposite.The greatest book ever written in American Literature is just a man (Gatsby) who claims to be in love, but looks to be more obsessed, and is trying to win back his lost love (Daisy). Nick Carraway tells the story in third person. He tells of his summer spent in Long Island, New York with the rich and the richer. Nick describes in a very wordy way how each major event of the summer unraveled and played out. With love, suspense and heartbreak, Nick takes you in and even when you try your best to pull away, you just cannot.It is not so much the book is great as it is addicting. As human beings we are all curious, and one proverb states that curiosity kills the cat. People love drama, and that is what Fitzgerald perfectly describes in his novel. After fulfilling your curiosity with such descriptive and sometimes complicated wording, some might come to realize that there was nothing great about Gatsby all along. Sure the book maybe interesting but that is because people cannot keep their nose out of their own business. People are curious about other relationships and flings and try to dig deeper into them. So just as in the Great Gatsby, you find yourself digging in for more dirt on the romance of Daisy and Jay.Once completing the novel, you can see the resemblance to Jay and other people in the modern world. Mr. Jay Gatsby was the pioneer of rich people who swoon the females with his money. He is not great; he is just a bootlegger and a liar, just like a lot of people you might be familiar with in Hollywood. And Daisy Buchannan, what is there really to love about her? She is a shallow, gold digging swine that seems like she needs a taste of what it feels like to have no money. If you watched the movie like I did, then you'd hope she was poor to begin with. Jay Gatsby is nothing but a fool in love and Daisy is just a fool in love with money. Nick Carraway, well he is just a fool who cannot keep his nose out of where it doesn't belong.The ending had me wanting more though, wanting to know what in the world just happened. A relationship ended abruptly with no closure, well if this in fact is take from certain events from Fitzgerald's life then I most certainly feel sorry for the many. The end could have been as worded longer and complex just like the rest of the book. But in my opinion Mr. Fitzgerald just got lazy and decided to end the book at that.The Jay Gatsby was as great as claimed to be, then so is everyone who hustles for a women (Donald Trump, me and every other rich non-attractive male with an overly-attractive partner) is great. And if that is true then so be it. I would like to be known as a great person too and have my memory forever etched in the annals of American Literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What a wonderful book this is, capturing the essence of the ambition, lust, love and gay abandonment, not only of the 1920s, but of the human spirit itself. Widely regarded as a classic of modern literature, Fitzgerald manages to capture something very American, very modern, very sublime and truly timeless in this novel; from the relatively simple narrative of romantic yearnings, to the greedy ambitions, the lost loves, the complex enchantments, and the underlying despair; this is a journey of life.This book for me is just too much. Take the exchange between Nick and Gatsby about the 'past', and following 'lost dreams';- \\"You can't repeat the past\\" (Nick). \\"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can\\" (Gastby). Can you? I still don't know. How about the early quote of \\"the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the shortwinded elations and abortive sorrows of men\\". A dark promise of things to come. And what about the exhileration and excitement of the \\"returning trains of my youth\\", near the end, where Nick decides to leave the 'big smoke' in New York, permanently tainted in his mind, for the wide plains, the homely townships, and to escape from the shallow, superficial and 'messy' lives of the Big Apple pretenders.I won't spoil you with intricate details of the story, if you haven't read it and you want to understand modern literature and the modern western world, you have to read it. It is as simple as that.This book is a unique expose of the human spirit, the western dream, the love and despair of life; quintessentially 20th century and quintessentially beautiful.I wish I was seventeen and could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is a pure genius. The Great Gatsby was beatifully written and completely captured the 1920s and its American Jazz Age. On the surface, Fitzgerald's novel seemed simple, but after a months study on it the book revealed so much more. Only a literary mastermind could have come up with such a subtle novel that came to be more complex and insightful than expected. Fitzgerald's characters is what brought life to the book. Nick, being the narrator, showed sensibility in the novel. Although Nick represented the middle class people striving to upgrade their status, he maintained his ground. Through the experiences that he had gone through being with the high society, there was a major turning point for him. Nick realized that that corrupt and shallow class had absolutely no morals. From there he moved back West, too afraid that he may experience what Gastby had experienced. Jay Gatsby on the other hand, was somewhat of an honorable mystery. He was a mystery because he was never seen directly, but mainly through other peoples perceptions. Nobody really knew him as a person and nobody knew his identity. Although, Gatsby was on a quest in search of something that meant his whole life to him. He wanted to re-live the past that he had with Daisy and didn't stop for a second to come back to reality no matter what other people had told him. Now Daisy was simply a basketcase and represented her society quite well. She was materialistic and extremely shallow, thus the name Daisy. She had played with people's minds and seemed to play with her own mind at the same time. The novel just came together very well with the connection of the seasons to Gatsby's dream to even the slightest detailing of the colour of clothing and even the vehicle's interior. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel was very insightful and well-crafted, but before making any first judgements after reading it thorough research will make you believe how great The Great Gatsby truly is."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The story of Jay Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Carraway had graduated from New Haven in 1915, had participated in the Great War and, returning restless, decided to move East and learn the bond business. In the spring of 1922, he rents a house in West Egg, Long Island next to the mansion of Gatsby - a mysterious host of large and extravagant parties.It seems that few people know anything about Gatsby, so speculation is rife. Gatsby is wealthy and powerful, and knows how to get things done. And yet, while many flock to his parties, he seems to have no friends, only business associates. A man of mystery.Nick Carraway's second cousin, once removed, is Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and Tom (and their daughter Pammy) live on the more fashionable East Egg side of Long Island. Nick had met her husband Tom at New Haven and Nick calls on them soon after moving to West Egg. During his visit, Nick also meets Jordan Baker who tells him that Tom has a mistress, and finds that here as well that Gatsby, his parties and his wealth are a topic of discussion. There is a lot of restless energy here, as well as a sense of dissatisfaction, of boredom and of wanting more from life.Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress, lives with her husband Tom near an expanse of land known as the Valley of Ashes. A wasteland of sorts, between New York and Long Island, constantly under the view of an advertisement for an oculist.\`But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.'Through Nick and Jordan, Daisy is reintroduced to Gatsby. She had been engaged to him before her marriage to Tom, back when he had no money. Gatsby still loves Daisy, and hopes to recapture this past romance.\`\`Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. \`Why of course you can.''Unfortunately, for Jay Gatsby, he cannot repeat the past. And a series of unfortunate coincidences and tragedies obliterate his future as well as that of the Wilsons. It's of no consequence to Tom and Daisy, the destruction that they cause and retreat from. They live in and for the moment, without loyalty and without care.\`They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made ...'\`Her voice is full of money', he said suddenly.' And money talks in this novel, but it has to be the \`right' sort of \`old' money. There is no place for a parvenu like Gatsby, and there are few mourners at his funeral.It's been forty years since I last read this novel, and while I remembered the story fairly well, it had a different impact this time around. The first time around I wondered how people could be so fickle and shallow, this time I was more focussed on how Fitzgerald manages to complete such an unsettling story within fewer than 150 pages. All versions of the early 20th century American Dream portrayed in this book are flawed: those who can see the flaws can do nothing and those who strive to live it are doomed to fail. Equality is not realisable.And if I read it again? Who knows what I'll think of it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's a powerfully written classic with uncommon, often devastating insight on the human condition, worthy of all the praise its earned for generations. The kind of book every idealist (myself included) should read, regardless of what we're idealistic about (love, God, country, ourselves, etc.), and a story so fundamental that it makes you rethink who you believe you are. It may be set in the Jazz Age, but the lessons will always be relevant, no matter the era. Fitzgerald's economical prose is second-to-none and makes the book highly re-readable; and most authors could write for a lifetime and never come up with as haunting, and true, a climactic line as \\"I'm thirty - I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fell in love with F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant novel, The Great Gatsby, when I was in high school. I was captivated by the lush, lyrical prose that was such a distinctive characteristic of the novel. I think that Fitzgerald has given us a searing, powerful take on the rich dilettantes of the 1920's. He slowly and skillfully reveals the shallowness and callousness of these people, as they manipulate and deceive everyone. It seems that Fitzgerald's heroines were always reincarnations of his real wife, Zelda. It is clear that Gatsby has hopelessly romanticized the superficial and hollow Daisy Buchanan. He has elevated her to a pedestal that she does not in any way deserve. Yet he is determined to pursue her and his dreams, at all costs.Fitzgerald is unmatched when it comes to character studies. He has used his own real life experience among the elite, to peel away the beautiful artifice and show us the truly ugly, heartless soul inside these people. Daisy and Tom are unhappy and unfulfilled people. Tom uses Myrtle to escape from the boredom and inanity of Daisy. He could care less if it all turns out badly. Consequences, morality and decency are not qualities that one finds in the likes of Tom and Daisy. They take what they want and try to steal moments of happiness at the expense of the humanity of those who are manipulated and played like chess pieces. Life is a game to them, a game to be played out in grand style and if someone gets crushed in the process, so be it.Fitzgerald finds his own voice in his narrator, the conscientious and astute Nick Carraway. He is the observer, watching the carnage and emotional wreckage unfold before his eyes. Through him, we see the horror of what Tom and Daisy do to those who have the misfortune to those who cross their path. Initially, Nick is enchanted to be in their company, but by the end as he surveys the tragedy and destruction that has been wrought, he is repelled and wants only to put as much distance as he can between himself and these monsters. Fitzgerald's own ideas and thoughts are expressed through Nick. It's a masterful way of illuminating the reader. Nick is the moral compass in this novel. He sees the truth, the ugly reality of what makes up the rich and famous, their lack of character, their emptiness, their need to lose themselves. In the end we feel the way he does. The beauty and lavishness of the lives of these people are just a brittle exterior, covering up the hideousness that lies underneath.As I read this novel again, years later and much older, it has taken on a whole other dimension. I have enough life experience now to truly appreciate the dark and sinister reality that can lie behind beauty and wealth. It is now a richer experience, because Fitzgerald's novel is timeless. He provided a stinging, harsh critique of the kind of people he knew all too well, of an era, a time in which people satisfied their greediness at the expense of others. The book can never become outdated, because what it says about people who have too much money and time on their hands with too little humanity, applies to generations through the years.This is a seminal work, a beautifully crafted tale about a time that was captured forever in these richly drawn characters. Fitzgerald had the most distinctive style of writing I have ever experienced. No one else has ever even come close to his genius. He can dissect and carve out the essence of his characters using the most lovely prose. His descriptive phrases still leave me breathless. I am only sorry that he died prematurely in 1940 at the too young age of 44, thereby depriving us of the privilege of reading more of his magnificent writing. We must make do with what he was able to give us in the brief time he was on this earth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is nearest the perfect novel our country has produced. The first twenty pages represent the smoothest prose to be found in a modern novel, and introduces the ideal narrator, Nick Carroway, truthful, dryly humorous, accepting, nonjudgmentall, kind, modest, and likable. The story moves along briskly, though not big on magniloquent ideas. Rather, the story is a chronicle. It etches in stone the Jazz Age, with all its superfluities, excesses, and bubbly froth. It has every American theme--the nostalgic look backwards to aristocracy, the striving for success, the have's and have nots, the intersection of the old and new, the loss of hope for those who can't keep up with their dreams, and the bumptious, hyperactive quality that supposedly characterizes our country. There is rarely a paragraph that does not have wit, poignancy, and the eye of the narrator registers all with a detached discernment. Indeed, the overarching consciousness and morality of Nick Carroway may be the best part of this great novel. Through Carroway, the action of the novel moves along, giving a moral ascendancy to all the sordid and comic activities he views. The novel is uniquely evocative, rousing in the reader feelings of humor, sadness and regret that only the best art can, so that the reader himself experiences a sense of yearning for all that has passed, for the romanced past, just like the protagonist, who seek vainly to regain it. And the last lines of the novel are amongst the most poignant ever written. Damon LaBarbera, PhD"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Personally this is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later. I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be. Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).Everyone's life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon's success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being). Even Myrtle's sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death. All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched. Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known. Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies. Does this make him a liar, or worse.Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs. Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them. Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact. While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy's wealth allows them to do.Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don't know. Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier. Better than the whole lot he states. But can some who is completely a fabrication be great? The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don't know about Gatsby.Enjoy the book. It's a great read that has multiple layers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This story of the 'lost generation', those who came of age in time to fight in WWI and, if they were lucky, returned home to find that everything had changed, especially themselves. This generation was no longer content to stay in the small towns and cities that their families had lived in for generations. The young men did not want to enter into the family business and settle down with a suitable young woman from nearby. The young women were not content to stay in their parents' house and wait, they wanted out in the world to 'do something'.The story is told, not through the eyes of Gatsby but through those of Nick, a young man from the midwest who has settled in New York to learn the bond game. By chance he has rented a house on Long Island for the summer, a small cottage stuck among much grander mansions and, again by chance, across an inlet from a cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom, who, also by chance Nick had known slightly in college. Also by chance, Nick's neighbor, the mysterious Gatsby had been one of Daisy's many suitors before she had settled down with Tom. Nick soon finds himself swept into the glittering, glamorous world of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom. He is made an unwilling witness to Tom's infidelity, the one sided romance of Gatsby and Daisy and finally to the tragic results of it all.THE GREAT GATSBY is a very American story, one that depicts the American restlessness, the desire to be more, better, different from all that has come before. As with many books that are assigned reading this one is often forced on an audience that is too young to appreciate it. Like many others I hated this novel when I first read it (I was an 18 year old college freshman) but found that it stuck with me, unlike many other assigned books, long after the final exam. Over the years I have read it several times and each time discovered something new, a different aspect of the novel becoming the 'point' of the story.This is one everyone really should read at least once, perferably a couple times, in their lives."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have just finished this book and it is a very pleasant read. The 1920's have always intruiged me and this book has made me even more hungry for stuff from this decade. I love Mr. Fitzgerald's method of writing, almost poetic in nature but borderline overly-sentimental (although the Age of Excess as the 20's were deemed may have aided in this extra drama).The way Fitzgerald characterized the rich is also very interesting. From Tom Buchanan to Jordan Baker, these rich social elites are wonderfully crafted with complex personalities. I love it! I also enjoy the the descriptive detail given to each scene...its amazing.Overall..a stunning piece of work that I would readily reccommend."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is so simple, and so brief, and it's not really about much more than a wealthy, mysterious, lovesick man who throws parties to attract a girl he loved and lost.But, it's amazing.F. Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith. He knew how to use the english language, and in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before. He was a painstaking writer who went over every sentence over and over again, and his exactness shows.That's not to say that the book is flawless--there are whole books that exist just to list the book's faults, especially in its chronology--but let's see YOU write a book this good. The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand. The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them. Just be glad it exists, and give it a read. It gets better every time, and you may find yourself wanting to re-read it almost immediately after finishing it.I know it's happened to me more than once."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Having reread this book for the first time in 20 years, I can confirm that there's a reason that it's considered one of the very best American novels. However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby's love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn't mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald's skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby's quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn't changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald's ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading, especially at such a bargain price."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Scott Fitzgerald, a monumental talent who only occasionally got things working right, made Gatsby great by the extraordinary invention of Nick Carraway. Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch: more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald's enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled. Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab's speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about. But there is much more here than historical accuracy. Scourby's voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral's text with both an actor's professionalism and a good reader's care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history. It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I listened to this book over a few nights with my wife, after having read it first some sixteen years ago. It is a masterpiece, and known widely as such, but what surprised me on hearing it was how the book I'd remembered as terribly romantic was actually rather clear-eyed and dark. My wife, who had never read it, listened spell-bound, and at the end burst into tears at the sadness of it. A word about Scourby as reader - he is restrained but emotional, captures the personality of each character with a slightly different tone, and - most importantly for me - brings out the fact that the closing pages, which are often quoted out of context as deeply romantic, are in fact painfully cynical, a voice of disenchantment about the cost of America, not its promise. A masterpiece on the page and on tape. Can't recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm troubled that many young people in these reviews don't seem to appreciate this novel. Even when &quot;forced&quot; to read it in high school, I loved it. I've read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it's better than I remembered it. I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami's book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up. This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that's not perfect. I have to agree -- it's not just the plot, it's the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later. Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby's parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea. For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend. It's so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory. Don't miss out on this one. If you didn't like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time I encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" it was as an assignment in a high school English class. My recent re-read occurred after my son had read it in his high school English class. The reread brought back memories of a form of academic study from which I have been separated for many years.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an excellent book in which to study the writer's art. In this short book the reader can detect a collection of symbolic details which make the story much more than the tale which appears on the surface: the ash heap, as a symbol of the waste of American society; the green light on Daisy's dock, which means so much to Gatsby as a symbol, until he again meets Daisy, when it again becomes, for Gatsby, as for everyone else, just a light.The characters all play their roles in the development of the story. Shallow figures fill Gatsby's parties, but show their true level of concern for him when they all absent themselves from his funeral. The class distinctions between Daisy, a true upper class maiden, who can never lower herself to accept Gatsby, the aspirant to a class rank which wealth and parties cannot buy. Gatsby's source of wealth is hinted at by his association with Meyer Wolfsheim, the gambler who fixed the World Series. Like others, he will associate with Gatsby in life, but has no time for him in death.The unnatural core of Gatsby's world is illustrated by his act of moving east, rather than the traditional westward migration, in order to achieve freedom and advancement.Tom and Daisy Buchanan represent old money, which will not accept Gatsby and, in the end, destroys him.Nick Carraway is the one character in the book who develops his own moral sense. His role as narrator permits us to see Gatsby's world through his eyes. It is he who sees, and is repelled by, the rotten cores of Gatsby and the worlds in which lives and into which he aspires. He sees the corruption deep inside Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Most of all, we see the innate goodness in Tom. Observing, but not entering Gatsby's world, he is able to understand and judge it. His final evaluation of Gatsby's world is seen when he abandons it all to return to his native Midwest.As I re-read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I remembered what I had not liked about it the first time I read it. The causal acceptance of infidelity seems at odds with what I have always viewed as the ideal as well as the reality. As one studies the commentaries of this book, with all of its symbolisms, I often wonder if the symbols were really in F. Scott Fitzgerald's mind as he wrote the book, or whether they are constructs of later commentators. Either way, they give the book a depth which so many others lack. When my son speaks of other books he reads in English class, he always says \\"It's no Great Gatsby.\\" The more I think of it, few of novels are."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have always looked forward to reading the classic book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. When I finally had time to read it, I wasn't disappointed. The Great Gatsby, written in 1925, is a fictional tale that takes place during the American Jazz Age. The story is set in the eastern U.S. and follows the journey of a young man named Nick. The book trails Nick from his home in the West to his new life in West Egg, New York. Nick becomes involved in the social scene is West Egg, which is mainly centered on the weekly extravagant parties thrown by the incredibly wealthy and strangely mysterious Jay Gatsby. As the book progresses, Gatsby's past is slowly unraveled. Nick witnesses Gatsby's gradual admittance of his significant secret. He discovers that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful socialite, trapped in a miserable marriage to an unfaithful husband. Though Nick does not want to be involved in any way with the illicit love affair between Daisy and Gatsby, he is gradually takes a larger part in Gatsby and Daisy's dangerous romance. When Jay and Daisy decide to declare their love to one another, it leaves Gatsby in an unforgettable and risky situation that changes the lives of all involved. The Great Gatsby was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It included a beautiful love story, danger, suspense, tales of true devotion and friendship, and a wonderful, thought-provoking commentary on the society in post-World War I America, a time of excess and confusion. I have learned several lessons from the novel, whether they are about loyalty or remaining true to oneself. I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of thirteen because of some parts of the novel that might be difficult to grasp. The Great Gatsby is a truly wonderful book, and sure to be enjoyed by many for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I question whether I should even write a review of a book I dislike which most people, even most of my friends, seem to adore. What it comes down to, for me, is that all the characters, even the best of them (namely Gatsby) are amoral, and the worst of them are vile. I ended up reading this book for school twice. The first time, in high school, I finished it and thought, &quot;I must be missing something,&quot; so I bought and read through the Cliffs Notes, and then said, &quot;Well yes, I knew all that, but so what?&quot; In college I was assigned to read it a second time, and that time I got more substance out of it. The book will never be one of my favorites, though. I just haven't got enough cynicism in my soul (at least not yet, anyway) to look into a moral vaccuum and find much enlightenment there.Perhaps I should read it a third time; it's a short book, after all. I'm older now, and I do get the point in a way I couldn't have then--Gatsby falls in love not with a real woman, but with his own dream vision of her, and confrontation with the real thing shatters him. (Then again, Don Quixote did the exact same thing without making me dislike him.) The equating in Gatsby's mind of love with money is also worth understanding as a very American hang-up, but it does just make him seem pathetic. And yes, I know that's the point.I also concede that one reason I disliked it was the sheer glut of tragedies I was forced to read in school. I find that I have more patience for unhappy endings in fiction now that they're not being forced on me. (Heck, I read Dostoevsky for fun, now). But unhappy endings need not be the same thing as nihilism. Gatsby's universe is a highly nihilistic one, a world so far gone that even the saddest ideals seem priceless simply for being ideals.Perhaps it's the kind of cynicism the book represents--it's not &quot;grumpy old man&quot; cynicism like Vonnegut or Twain, which at least feels earned and honest. No, this is youthful &quot;look how worldly I am&quot; cynicism, the sort that drives us as kids to write bad poetry and wear lots of black. Perhaps that's inevitable--the characters ARE all young, and the book is about decadence.It may also be the humorlessness of the book that sets it aside from Vonnegut and Twain. I enjoyed de Laclos's &quot;Dangerous Liasons,&quot; where the protagonists are both insidiously evil, but at least the cynicism there is laced with black humor. Gatsby carries an unrelenting air of &quot;I'm writing something important, dammit!&quot;It's not my cup of tea. You're free to like it. Most folks do."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As you can tell by many reviews which surround this one, our world is filled with minds who probably feel that the height of pathos is reality tv, or having to wait in line more than 5 minutes at an ATM.But about Fitzgerald--I'm reminded of Eliot's phrase \\"infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering...\\" (paraphrasing). His descriptions and evocations here are gorgeous, tender--and most of all subtle, which is why Gatsby is lost on so many modern readers. All of this novel is excellent and parts of it absolutely shimmer--Nick's description of the way Gatsby smiled at him. Look at this...\\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced---or seemed to face---the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far a you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\\"Who wouldn't want to believe in that smile?Or take, for example, the scene in which Gatsby shows his closetful of rare, extravagant and wonderful shirts to Daisy and Daisy weeps....not because of his sartorial excellence but because she knows even at that point, in her heart, that she will forever be stuck with that clod Tom.This is about the American Dream, and how the pursuit of it can kick the living s**t out of you....how friends come and go...and how society often rewards generosity with disdain.I beg you to read this book, because it is good for your soul.Just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There are two Kindle editions of The Great Gatsby, both at the same price.Unfortunately the edition I bought, from Old Landmark Publishing, has a number of minor transcription errors. The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence. There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are two Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try theScribner Edition(the one with the stark black and white cover)."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I read it for the first time, I could not grasp its essential which is what the real love is all about. It was only after few years later that I understood why this book is classified as such a great book that attracts so many readers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first picked up this book off a list of requirements. The first few pages were a bit hard to understand, and I began to think that I wasn't ready to read it. But when I actually deciphered the passages, it became clear that every word had a meaning behind it. The book showed the faults that gradually weaken human beings. Must read!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A well written book about a wealthy man in pusuit of the woman that he once loved. Observed mostly through the eyes of Nick, the neighbour, the Great Gatsby brilliantly sums up the idealism of the roaring twenties.A touching love story and some wonderfully written extras, including Mrs Wilson and Jordan. Tom is also a great villain type.Not as good as it is cracked up to be, or anywhere near for that matter. Balzac has written similar story's which are all vastly superior. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to get very caught up in his descriptions sometimes, spilling out metaphor after metaphor describing someones beauty. This doesn't all fit so well in a book under 200 pages.Never the less, very good, certainly worth reading. Not a book for the ages however."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At first when I started reading this book, I thought it was very boring. Then as I read on I got so hooked on it and whenever I read I never wanted to put it down. I think that this book was great in portraying the realites of love in life and the way that people learn to live with money and without it, just as people do today. Great Book!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald did a great job with the novel. Bruccoli made it better. This version is helpful in understanding the tremendous symbolism of the book. There is so much to learn from this book.I would recommend this version to anyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A friend of mine couldn't believe it when I told her that I'd never read The Great Gatsby. After reading recently for the first time I agree with her. The imagery that Fitzgerald uses is unforgettable and the story is just mind-boggling. Another book that shouldn't be missed!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I loved this book! Sure the first chapter is boring, but the rest of it is great. This is a difficult book to understand, but if I read it again I'll enjoy it more for the new information I find. I even gave a copy to a friend of mine so she could read it. One thing troubles me. Did Daisy drive past her husband's mistress' house on purpose, or was just on her way? If it was a deliberate act, then it seems like she meant to kill her. Or am I just completely insane?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yes the first 25 pages is really quite astonishing and it's difficult to continue with your eyes open , it's a classic so i guess you have to make an effort to keep them open if you want the fruits. The description is through the eyes of a cynical, mysterious and a wierd man which is why it gives the whole story a different outlook, but that what i enjoyed best, this book it written so differently from what we're used to read, the man gatsby, his stories - all taken so cynically by the narrator nick, i love the way he puts it and then how he ultimately becomes so credible that he takes everything as it is given by gatsby. Gatsby's lust for money and love for daisy is icing over the cake, the end's just a little sad but that makes the book a classic. I think it's a must for the lovers of classics and to those who want to write in future, it's a piece of the finest writings i've read. If you're looking for a plot or continuous reading i would not suggest the book.This book is a masterpiece when it's writing and chharacterisation is concerned."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am not surprised that this book falls into the category of one of the greats of American literature. The eloquence with which Fitzgerald writes with is somewhat rare, however the story would not have worked had he not. I was required to read the novel for my English class, and although I despise analysing literature I found the story impossible to understand without analysing it. It's a plot that you don't get engrossed in, but one that you eventually want to know the outcome. Recommend it to anyone? Yes. It's worth the read. Rave about it? No. It's not worth arguing if you meet some opposition."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I usually hate the books I have to read for school, but this one was the best book I have ever read. Fitzgerald writes this novel remarkably. It is awesome, but to get the &quot;full experience&quot; you have to look for symbols and stuff. The depth of this book is remarkable. You have to read this book. Tragically, it truly portrays the American Dream for what it is. The characters are wonderfully discribed. This book is surely the best American novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's Gatsby is one of the triumphs of American social commentary-as brilliant as it is deep, this poignant insight into the glittering superficialities of the jazz age holds a timeless message about the elusive nature of the American dream. Look beyond obvious plot details and into the intricate web of colors and name symbology to fully appreciate this book. To all the disappointed high schoolers out there, grow up before you read this novel and learn to appreciate this writing for what it is: a nostalgic tribute to a changing society, not an adventure novel for your shallow entertainment."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What can I say? This is one of those novels that is so beautifully melancholy and tragically romantic as to inspire countless additional readings. F. Scott Fitzgerald has the most unique and surprising way with words. This book not only moved me with its lyricism but left me often with a sort of physical feeling that I simply cannot find words to explain.This novel says so much about the emptiness and excess of the jazz age as experienced by the wealthy leisure class.Fitzgerald so wonderfully portrays the idea that it is the STRIVING for greatness that counts in life, because once it is reached, it can never possibly live up to the grandeur that one envisages in dreams. In many ways, this book suggests the end of the American dream, and while Gatsby himself is not far from reproach, he represents the desire in all of us to be something better. He is both flawed and beautiful; lonely yet eerily surrounded.If you want to be moved, read this book...and really pay attention to the language and the mood; it may very well change the way you see the world."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby holds a special place in my heart. Like Nick Carraway, the narrator, I am a Midwesterner that ventured out East to Yale and returned somewhat disenchanted with the rhythm of life on the East coast. So there are personal reasons for me to identify with the novel, in addition to Fitzgerald's unusual brilliance and mastery of the English language.This was not always the case. Many people-- some of them very intelligent- often faulted The Great Gatsby for being 'soft' or 'too easy to read.' This is not intentional academic snobbery-- how often have readers taken up a facile book without coming away satisfied? Indeed, the critics of Fitzgerald's time did not take him seriously for similar reasons-- I myself fell within this skeptic group until I reread the novel four years later after heavy exposure to the other literary lights of that time.Having now read The Great Gatsby approximately twenty times, I have come to recognize the unique power of the novel. It is, as described in the introductory essay, a complete miracle. It is a miracle of social criticism as witnessed by the unsurmountable gap between old and new money; it is a miracle (one might almost say an inevitable result) of the modern schism between the age of hard-nosed science and pure romantism; it is a miracle of story-telling, combining Hemingway's lucid economy with Faulkner's innovation and power. The result is Fitzgerald's characteristic 'magic voice,' which has yet to be duplicated by any author since.And above all, it is a good story. At the heart of the tale is the use of a partially-involved first person narrator (in the form of Nick Carraway), combining the power of the first-person POV with the sweep and scope of the third person narrative. This stroke of genius becomes even more evident as parallel story lines develop, resulting in the convergence of the two paths and the famous closing scene with the now-transformed Nick brooding on the deserted beach.There is so much to this book that it is impossible to list all that I admire. Yet paradoxically, unlike other masterworks like Absalom! Absalom!, it is possible for everyone who reads The Great Gatsby to view the work in its totality. It is so natural that it is almost as if Fitzgerald did not write it, and rather, the work appeared completed and perfect of its own volition-- a masterpiece for everyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am sorry to have waited so long to read this masterpiece. F. Scott Fitzgerald's crowning achievement is a relatively concise, easily readable gem of a story, which goes much deeper than the average genre fiction (obviously), but not in a dull way.It is very easy to picture oneself as Nick, the protagonist, attempting to piece together this strange character, Jay Gatsby, and the elaborate world he inhabits. Character development is beautifully accomplished as the book progresses, and there is no wasted scenes or characters. In fact, there is a great deal of substance to the entire story, despite its focus on the lack of substance for the characters presented.The Great Gatsby will help you understand the lives of the fabulously wealthy in the 20s, but more importantly it will help you begin to understand the real world, and what is really important. Gatsby's &quot;Green light&quot; is each of ours as well, if we would only see it.If you have a soul, you will love this book, and either way, it will certainly make you think."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel has been characterized as the quintessential American novel, and even as &quot;THE&quot; American novel. Whether or not I agree with that characterization, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short but dense tale is a masterpiece. That said, there is not much I can add to the years and years of analysis and praise. This book is simply stunning.I will not rehash plot details here, but I will make a few comments. I studied this book as an English major at college, and just reread it for fun 10 years later. I remember reading it as a student, and learning about all the symbolism present. If you look for it, you can find symbolism contained in every paragraph. A few symbolic themes I remember studying were those of colors, the weather, religion and the Bible, and numbers. I remember learning that different colors represented different traits. White, for example, supposedly represents purity, while yellow represents artificiality. Therefore, the name Daisy is itself a symbol: a daisy is white on the outside and yellow in the center. Accordingly, Daisy appears to be pure but inside is tarnished and artificial.While it is fascinating to study all the symbolism in this novel, this time I read it purely for the story. And the story is more than enough. Strip away all of the symbolism, and this would still be a masterpiece. This is the tale of a twisted perversion of the American dream--one of Gatsby's ambition to amass a fortune in order to win over Daisy. Yet he will never win over Daisy, for she will never love one who has to earn his wealth. It is the story of Gatsby's failure to win even one true friend, despite the fact that his house is always filled with people, and everyone &quot;knows&quot; him. Even the narrator only arranges Gatsby's funeral out of a sense of obligation and pity.This slim masterpiece is beautifully and concisely written, and heartbreaking without ever being sentimental. This book has survived 75 years worth of critical analysis, and it still going strong. In another 75 years, people will still be studying this grotesque manifestation of the American dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book in high school for a class and thought it was one of the most boring pieces of crap I would ever read. I now realize how absolutely wrong I was. In some ways, I think it is impossible for anyone who has not had to make a living to understand so I forgive my past opinions as the inexperienced feelings of an immature mind.This is a book for all of those who work for a living and yet meet with those who are affluent who never have to worry about a thing. I found it enthralling."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time I read this book I was a sophomore in highschool and I had no choice about it. I read the book and didn't enjoy it and felt many of the same emotions as the other kid who read it and said it was predictible and annoying. I breezed throught the book, often skimming, and was done, and dissapointed.Fast forward to the present day. I had been thinking about how The Great Gatsby is considered a classic, and how i didnt enjoy it at all. I decicded to read it again, carefully trying to asorb some meaning.And I found it.This book is really profound, a great work. The characters all fit together so well, and the story just takes you back to another time.If you are 14-18 years old, and just read this book to read it you wil not enjoy it. I think I just wans't mature enough to appreciate this work before. Don't judge this book by the first time you read it. Take the time to read it again and think about it; you will love it.A good analogy is how a diamond in the rough just looks like glass on the beach, sanded and hidden in a fog. Only when the diamond has been processed is its value apparent, and only when you take the time to process a book of this magnitude is it's value appreciable."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Even a jealous Ernest Hemingway had to concede that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a gem. Re-reading this book nearly 100 years after it was written, I realize that no one else has better captured the essence of 20th Century America, nor described it as eloquently. Not a single word is wasted in this work. The last lines are an amazing summation of not just this novel, but of human existence (they are engraved on Fitzgerald's tombstone). &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; are the only books about America that are even in the same league as &quot;Gatsby,&quot; but they are not as brilliantly conceived and executed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am one of those \\"freaks\\" who makes sure to read this novel at least once a year. It brings me a sort of solace.This is as close to a Salinger novel as one can get. Moral lessons spoken thru New York City in the early 1900's.In this case we have the author and his 2nd cousin, a worldly woman who steals hearts and refuses to let go.Gatsby accomplishes everything he can create in his mind, but he cannot compare to what Daisy demands. She is noy human it seems, and Gatsby cannot keep up, no matter how hard he tries.This novel was required reading in high school, and thank God for that. Even after my 12th grade english teacher pounding into my head the symbolism of the eye-glasses on the billboard in the city of ashes. And also why Gatsby was a \\"heroic figure\\".Basically, this novel ends the only way it can. Death is necessary and we all will perish. But sometimes we die a bit too soon.No matter where I am in my life, this book always sets me straight. What will be...will be.Gatsby could not have lived any other way. It's all good."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"No more perfect American book exists. Jay Gatsby pursues the American dream with a single minded zeal and the closer he gets to his dream the emptier he is. The greatness of the book is both in this theme and in the way Fitzgerald makes Gatsby stand for all of us Americans. In his later works Fitzgerald falters but here every last detail is in its proper place. The narrator Nick is the perfect voice for this story. Through his eyes we may see that Gatsby is not all that Gatsby wants to be but like Nick we let ourselves be seduced anyway. The most superficial creature in this book, Daisy, is the object of Gatsby's lifelong obsession. She is about as weak as that flower and no more complex. Only Gatsby with his undying ability to dream which is unmatched by any character in fiction and the reason we all love him can imagine she is anything more than the common flower of her namesake. Everything functions and happens exactly as it should. No plot, I suggest, can be repeated by more readers. I put this in a tie with Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises for greatest book by an American. Hemingway's book is equally great though for quite different reasons. I think in his next book Tender is the Night Fitzgerald is trying to cover Hemingway's terrain but unlike Hemingway Fitzgerald does not really belong in Europe. Hemingway uncovers what it is to be American by showing Americans outside America and in contrast to Europeans. Fitzgerald never brings his Americans abroad in contact with anything but each other. But in this book he is brilliant. I just wish he would have stayed put."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I finally read \\"one of the greatest American novels of all time\\" as I've heard The Great Gatsby referred to. That statement may be a bit hyped up but it's defiantly a good read. Not a happy ending but some good lessons about wasting today chasing dreams from the past and what happens when we aren't happy with what and who we have now. Plenty of intrigue and drama will keep you reading. Most of the characters display the ugly, selfish side of human nature which contributes to the authenticity of this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"An absolutely beautiful book. Fitzgerald successfully mastered the words that cover these pages in such a way that connects to humanity. He has a way of wording things so that the past seems so current. The story seems to come from within.Fitzgerald adds little touches that helps the book seem so genuine. Even if you don't find the story line moving (which I did) there is no way to not appreciate the elegant writing style that is so Fitzgerald.It is a must read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I chose the five star rating because this book has so much meaning in multiple ways.

Yes, show us the &#34;evils&#34; in the world, but then show us what the alternatives are. Show us the answers.

Personally, I think \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" to have that honor. It is still a timeless classic with an interesting story and intriquing setting and time period.F. Scott Fitzgerald has a knack of creating images within the story that has a subtle symbolism to the story such as the large decaying billboard with the spectacles. You get the imagery and feeling that the spectacles are watching your every move.Well- written book on an interesting time period.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Every time I reread this incredible book, I discover something knew for myself. The Great Gatsby is truly Fitzgerald's greatest achievement - the writing style is incredible and the storyline is heartbreaking.

(\\"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\\")Fitzgerald did a masterful job producing the setting, defining the characters, and connecting the reader viscerally to the conflict.I appreciate the context in which Fitzgerald wrote his defining piece, i.e., he was dealing with personal difficulties. It is evident Fitzgerald channeled his emotion into the book.Fitzgerald also had an absolutely terrible first title (i.e., On the Road to West Egg), which would have doomed the book to obscurity. Fortunately, he had an exceptional editor that worked with him to get it right."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a deceptively simply novel that can be taken as a tragic love story. However, it can mean much more than that. One way to look at this novel is that it portrays the rise and hope of America and its eventual loss of innocence. Attempting to interpret the symbolism and arrive at a deeper message makes this story much more satisfying."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby as a summer reading assignment for 10th grade English class. I was on vacation at the Jersey shore, and, as I lay in bed in the evenings, sunburnt and calm after swimming in the ocean all day, I discovered a thrilling new world. The world of seductive glamour and heartbreaking tragedy. The story has stayed with me, more than 30 years later. I've re-read Gatsby many times, and have thought about it throughout my life. The words of Nick Carroway, the narrator, who tells us the wisdom his father imparted to him as a child...basically to never forget the advantages you were born with, and that there are others who were not born so lucky. This is the story of America. It is also the story of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He was the not-so-rich, not so aristocratic, lover of rich girls and aristocrats. He lived in the world of the very rich, and heard the money tinkling in the voices of the rich girls he met in prep school, and then at the Princeton dances. These are the girls that melded into his greatest heroine (or, perhaps, anti-heroine) Daisy Buchanan. Daisy lives on the the top of the heap of all of the Fitzgerald girls. Well, perhaps just a notch underneath Zelda, the real-life Mrs. Fitzgerald. Gatsby was the beginning of an obsession for me. I went on to read everything by and about Fitzgerald. One of the most exciting parts of my first visit to Paris at age 18 was discovering a collection of his short stories that had never been collected in book form. In college, I spent many evenings browsing the stacks of the BU library reading the biographies of FSF. Although all of his stories provided enjoyment, and I would recommend them all to any budding romantics out there, it is Gatsby which is closest to perfection. So many wondrous details. I believe they called it \\"A Novel WIthout a Hero.\\" But Gatsby is the hero, because he dared to believe that he could re-capture the first rush of young love. It's like capturing a falling star in a milk bottle. And it's something we all long for. To keep the magic of first experience. The act of reading this novel for the first time is an act of magic. Do not pass it up."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Jay Gatsby lives in a large mansion on the water in Long Island, New York, circa 1925. He hosts enormous parties each weekend attended by hundreds of people whom are uninvited and do not even know him. But that does not bother him. He is the perfect host, always making sure that his guests have everything their heart's desire. Nick Carraway lives next door and works in the City selling bonds. He is originally from the midwest but has relocated East to seek his fortune. He is befriended by Gatsby and others in elite social circles including a college friend Tom Buchannan and his wife Daisy, who is also Nick's cousin. But the world appears smaller and smaller as Nick discovers that Gatsby is in love with Daisy and that they dated once, years before, prior to her wedding to Tom. Gatsby has never gotten over Daisy and spends his every minute in an effort to win her back and prove his love.Fitzgerald's best known novel is filled with love, hate, intrigue, and friendship. He describes the frivolity of the time as contrasted with the sadness of human lonliness and insecurity. What seems to say so little given that it is a very short book, really says quite a bit in what it does not say. Romantic relationships that are described as happy clearly illustrate the dispair and sadness that is truly being suffered by those that are not truly in love with each other. Platonic relationships that seem losely connected actually describe tight friendships that are closer than others that portend to be strong.With each reading of this novel more of what Fitzgerald meant to convey comes through. It is the type of novel that grows with the reader. Reading it at different times in ones life will change what the reader gets out of it and enjoys. It is a timeless classic that continues to get better over time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is extremely good reding material for High School students. It will help them in improving his comprehension as well as their grammar application. The story is a great treat for adults."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I was seventeen and believed I knew things about literature, I wrote a review that both dismissed this book, and talked childishly of how a teacher reading too much into it, and demanding explanations from everything about the book, had made the text boring, and poor. I deleted that review, and now, six years later, returning to the book, and reading it in one sitting, I have come to an entirely new conclusion. After literally hundreds of books, from Hemingway to Faulkner, to Joyce and Woolf, to Kerouac and Heller, the poetics of this book, of Fitzgerald's writing, is to be marvelled and enjoyed.The story of Jay Gatsby, told through the eyes of Nick Carraway is a wonderful experience that every American, nay I say, every human being should experience. This is a text of utter beauty, filled with the poetry of life in it's lines. It moves us forward into the realization of the failure of the American Dream. It is a tragedy, it is a romance, it is a story of class, it is the story of an American soul seeking both victory and redemption. The writing erupts from the page like sparks from sparklers, each page burning with radiant descriptions, powerful imagery, and insight that you wish was constant in the literature of today.The Great Gatsby is a timeless novel, capable of being enjoyed by anyone, black or white, rich or poor, American or European or Asian. It is a novel that goes beyond that of a moment in history, and becomes a part of the soul. It captures more than the heart of man, but the heart of life itself. To recommend this book would be to say that this book needs a recommendation, but, if time and history are not clear indicators of its greatness, than it's opening pages should be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In whatever context this book is read, it holds its place as a literary masterpiece, for a menu of reasons - each reader has their own. A powerful fable wrapped in a gripping story, eloquent poetic prose that ebbs and flows with the rhythm of a story filled with subtle intelligence and suspenseful tension. Long after the last page is turned, its poetic message lingers like a bittersweet fragrance. A book to cherish."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A wonderfully intricate story, told in Fitzgerald's most polished prose style, which confronts issues of materialism, identity, dreams, self-worth, and mortality. This story is as relevant today as it was when it was written almost 80 years ago for its denunciation of, and simultaneous admiration for, the moneyed class and the stupidity which so often accompanies wealth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am hooked on audio books.

I was so excited at the prospect of listening to Tim Robbins narrating The Great Gatsby, a book I have wanted to read for a long time. I am a third of the way through and am terribly disappointed. This is the first audio book that I am struggling with. I am a huge fan of Tim's on-screen work but he is \\"performing\\" here and it's distracting.

In this Fitzgerald is a genius. Using as few words as possible, Fitzgerald has richly constructed a story as fitting of the American experience in 2009 as it was during the Jazz age--all glitz and glitter, pomp and circumstance based on thin air, imorality, and chimeric dreams. The Great Gatsby as a novel is a great achievement. As a story, it is bankrupt."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book came in pretty fast and it was in a very good condition for being used. Happy with my order."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is not a bad book but it doesn't have the compelling story to me. I found the author very capable of crafting words, but I did not sense a \\"I can't wait to know\\" moments. Of course like all classics you have to over look the vernacular. The author also used a few words that I was not familiar with. This would make this book better for a more sophisticated reader. I am interested in reading other reviews by more learned people to see just how much I might of missed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"Pursuit of happiness\\"? More like the pursuit of money leading into happiness. The novel starts off with a dull beginning but soon develops into what is known as one of the greatest written novels during the First World War. In the Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the theme of importance of social class along with money status to show that Mr. Jay Gatsby is a symbol for the average American during the 1920s. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway who is a young lad living in West Egg, Long Island. Next to him lives the infamous Jay Gatsby who falls in love with a taken woman. Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan had met five years earlier and had fallen in love but unfortunately Jay left and was not able to contact Daisy for some time. After waiting for five long years Daisy decides to marry Tom who is one of Nick's friends from college. Sooner or later Gatsby and Daisy meet up again at Nick's house and fall in love all over again. Nick ends up being caught in a love tangle when he finds out that not only are Daisy and Gatsby having an affair but also that Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. In the end three people end up dead due to the entanglement, but it is made clear that Daisy's choice to stay with Tom is solely based upon the recently found news that Gatsby was actually a poor man who inherited money. This then ties in the theme of \\"money does matter\\" and the downfall of the American society due to a shortage of money in the 1920s seen on pages 40-41. I recommend this book to those who are interested in reading twisted romance novels with a little rising action thrown in."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The writing is pretty good but unfortunately that doesn't make up for a weak storyline. The plot is so far-fetched in places that it spoiled my enjoyment of the book. The ending was particularly trite and melodramatic. The fact that this book comes in at less than 200 pages long is good because if you don't like it, well at least you didn't waste a lot of time. This is the sort of book that other \\"celebrated authors\\" apparently think highly of but many \\"casual readers\\" don't really enjoy it and I am one of the latter. Sorry, but only 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The west was conquered and the midwest cultivated, so in The Great Gatsby set in the 1920s we turn our attention back east, where to midwestern narrator Nick Carraway and his neighbor Jay Gatsby the green light at the end of the Buchanans' East Egg dock seems to represent the fertile promise of America, and the dreams and the money that are supposed to make them reality. Some dreams, like the dream of recapturing a romantic past that never really was, become nightmares.Although he witnesses and participates in deception, including both sides of the Buchanans' infidelity, Nick wants to appear to be a reliable narrator, which he emphasizes when he says up front, \\"I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me.\\" Later, Nick identifies himself with \\"the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him, too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\\" Nick's authorial viewpoint sets the tone for his story and his observations of the brutish Tom Buchanan; his shallow and unsatisfied wife, Daisy; his class-climbing mistress, Myrtle Wilson; and the mysterious Jay Gatsby, the hero of the different unbelievable fictions he tells (when Nick asks him what part of the middle-west he is from, Gatsby responds enigmatically, \\"San Francisco.\\") A confused Nick hears solemnity in Gatsby's voice and sees sincerity in his look, despite the obvious prevarication.The most influential literal voice is that of Daisy Buchanan. Lacking the romantic substance for which Gatsby has idealized her as the symbol of his youth--his real youth--Daisy becomes a siren with a siren call. Nick writes, \\"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\\" Her friend, Jordan Baker, tells Nick, \\". . . and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .\\" Later, Nick mentions that the \\"exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain,\\" and \\"I think that voice held him [Gatsby] most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a death song.\\" Nick says of Daisy, \\"Unlike Gatsby and Tom, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs . . .\\" By contrast, Myrtle is earthy, with \\"an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continuously smoldering.\\" Tom, whose affairs we are told have included a hotel chambermaid, seems mostly unsusceptible to Daisy's voice, while even Nick notes its influence and Gatsby is destroyed by it and by his desire for the real past that every story he tells effectually effaces.A compact novel concentrated on only a few months in the lives of a few characters, The Great Gatsby is rich with symbolism. During his reunion with Daisy, Gatsby almost stops time literally by knocking Nick's clock down, but instinctively he catches it before it falls. \\"We all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor,\\" Nick writes. Gatsby even apologizes as though he had broken the clock and as though it were a significant loss that his countless money can't replace. As the reunion continues, Nick says of Gatsby, \\". . . in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.\\"Throughout, time is a consistent theme; it is part of what Gatsby futilely endeavors to recapture. He can reinvent a past in which he was \\"educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years,\\" but he and his means cannot recreate the real past. As Nick observes, \\"Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\\" He adds later, \\"Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.\\"The Great Gatsby reminds me of The Count of Monte Cristo. Both Gatsby and the count start life as ordinary men and, through circumstances and the determination to achieve a much-desired goal, transform themselves into extraordinary men, ciphers to all but the most observant of their fellows. One seeks to revenge a past wrong; the other ignores the present and tries to reinvent the past as though there had never been a Tom Buchanan and as though Daisy had never loved him. Both efforts take time and unlimited patience and money, but only one is successful. The count revenges his past so he can live better in the future, but Gatsby fails because he does not understand, or want to understand, that the past is written and that the future begins with the present.Somewhat lacking in heart--the only character who displays genuine emotion is Tom Wilson, Myrtle's despised husband--The Great Gatsby captures the jaded excesses of the post-World War I era and the American faith in time, money, and effort as the sources and creators of success. The novel also shows the greater power of circumstance and fate. I've read The Great Gatsby only once, but to appreciate its structure, symbolism, and richness would take several re-readings. Read once for pleasure, then read again to explore Fitzgerald's craft."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I always wanted to read The Great Gatsby but for some reason or another it always eluded me. Back in college, almost everyone had read this \\"great\\" masterpiece of literature. I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to sink my teeth into this novel and see once and for all what it was all about.The story was wonderful to read and its subject matter was appealing for the most part. The industrial age must of been a sight to behold. The author does an adequate job of detailing the age and the times of West Egg. Although the lavishness and splendor of the many parties that took place in West Egg were nicely detailed, I found the imagery somewhat sparse and lacking detail at times. The author does a great job of portraying his characters and their morals but for some reason I didn't find this in itself to capture my attention. The story line was so-so in my opinion and could of been better. But in the end, this novel was worth the read. I'm happy I had the opportunity to finally have read this book and eventhough slightly disappointed, say that I experienced what it must of been like living in West Egg during the Golden Age."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm not sure if it's possible to not like this book. It's eloquently written and interesting. A classic love story, that will remain timeless. If you were forced to read it in high school and didn't like it I suggest a quick revisit to the timeless tale. It was wonderful. I'd recommend it to anyone and since it's a short book it only takes a weekend to get through."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I remember reading The Great Gatsby in my high school English class and thinking it was boring. In retrospect, I think I was an idiot. Reading it ten years later was a truly amazing experience. Fitzgerald lays down some stunning prose and brings a lavish era of American history to life. I was struck with how that culture of excess in the 1920s seemed eerily similar to the mid 2000s. . . and right before another crash, nonetheless. Great book. If you tried to read it once and failed, try again. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's insight in this book cuts through the blinding American optimism of the time. Though at the time he wrote The Great Gatsby he could not have foreseen the economic and cultural crisis approaching in 1929, he is clearly suspicious and wary of the culture surrounding him, and the tone of this book expresses that he expects evil will come of it. His characters put their faith and their trust in unstable things- wealth, social superiority, commercialism, the power of culture- and their typical american idealism and ambition makes them reach too far for things they don't have, and they end up losing what they did have. Fitzgerald's narrator, Nick Carraway, is ambitious, but is not blinded by the glamour and excess of the society surrounding him. Nick is the only character who is actually grieved by the tragedies which befall the other characters, because he alone values human compassion above society and ambition. From a Christian perspective, this book shows what happens to culture and the individuals who make up that culture when Christian ambition and even basic humanity are sacrificed for social greed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is less about the American Dream and more about the death of a dream; a dream one holds in one's heart, for such an inexplicably long time, that it becomes something more than a dream, something ineffable and austere. Like the previous sentence, this book is permeated with ambiguous phrasings and sentimental, other-worldly prose - that is to say, Fitzgerald has a certain writing style, and chooses to imbue his novel with a certain unabashed romanticism.Most peoples critiques of the characters are incomplete. Sure, they have money, and that might make them frivolous or careless to a certain extent, but they all have depth and breadth. The characters only seem overtly despondent because we view them through the eyes of the narrator, a person who seems somewhat detached from things, as he should be, as the novel is essentially his recollection of events. The net effect is that the novel achieves sort of a dream-like quality. The most likable of the characters is the novels name-sake, Gatsby. I read somewhere that the original editor/publisher of the book had Fitzgerald omit much of Gatsby's biography - I would have liked to know more about Gatsby. That's the great trick of the novel, the reader wants to know more about Gatsby, and when his identity and his character is revealed, it can seem anti-climatic; but when we discover why Gatsby has amassed his wealth, created his persona, and built his estate in a certain place, we realize his true intentions, and recognize them as being the best of humanity, even if they are naive and romantic notions flush with sentimentality.The plot to the novel is interesting and includes one or two twists that make it feel like an urban legend.The main sticking point of the novel (for me) is that wealth does not create happiness, nor is it a means to an end. The wealthy face all the same problems, regrets, and insecurities as everyone else, with the added burden of having money.The novel is a relatively short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime. An excellent addition to anyone's general library. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Book was bent at corner, some writing inside.....otherwise, it's still a book, was read, now shelved."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I used this CD to supplement student read-alouds in my high school English class. Muller is an excellent reader -- he really brings the characters to life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I loved The Great Gatsby when I first read it in high school English class, and I still love it today. I reread it about once a year, and I never fail to be impressed by F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of language. Quotes like this - \\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\" - are just classic.The Great Gatsby is a story abut Jay Gatsby's quest to track down the girl he loved in his youth, and his inability to come to grips with the path her life has taken in the interim. It also follows narrator Nick Carroway, Gatsby's neighbor for a summer. But most of all it is a story about the American dream - about love, money and ambition - and a slice of life in the 1920s, full of wild parties and glamour and tradgedy."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the books that I read in high school that I have been meaning to re-read, in an attempt to see whether it would mean more to me when I was older, than it did when I was young and easily bored.In my mind the book is still OK. I agree that it shows countless flaws in the the character's pursuit of the American dream. I'm not sure which errors in judgement were more pronounced in this story - trying to solve problems and win love through money, or the acts of infidelity themselves.I was left wondering what I would have thought if I had been in the position of the narrator Nick Carraway. It seemed as if he moved to West Egg only to find himself in the middle of the affairs of Daisy and Tom Buchanan and then unexpectedly he became the confidant of J. Gatsby. How strange it would have been to be expecting to start a new career and life, and to be caught up in so much drama.In all, I enjoyed the story and I am glad that I took the opportunity read this classic again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald makes great use of color as symbolism in this book, particularly in the ironic use of the color white which represents innocence. It is to be noted, however, that if I hadn't had to do an assignment on the use of color in the book, I may not have noticed.As far as the story goes, I could not like any of the characters, nor could I understand their motivations behind any of their actions. I found myself questioning why they were willing to do so much for a woman who wasn't in the least bit interesting at all. This generally made it a read that I dreaded."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is a somewhat quick read. It is not a diffiuclt read, so it is reasonable to see why so many of us have or will read this work during our high school days.Our story's protagonist, Nick Carroway, is the real focus of the story, despite the book's title. Gatsby is merely the focus of Nick's observations. Beginning as a person of mystique and fascination to our protagonist Nick, Gatsby lives a life of luxary and prestige. Throwing lavish parties and seemingly on the top of the world, Gatsby is merely putting on a show. The lavish lifestyle he displays is meant to represent what can be achieved if you work hard to find the 'American Dream'. The whole concept of the American Dream is what this work is continually tied to, that Gatsby has a great number of skeletons in his closet and that he lives in rich misery because he cannot be with Daisy, his one true love.THE GREAT GATSBY is a book with a meaningful point, yet it is a somewhat dull read. While it certainly does not lack staying power, it is understanable why so many students gripe at having to fight their way through the sometimes tedious moments. THE GREAT GATSBY is great for some, but a chore for others."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While this is not a bad book, it is not the master-piece I expected. One of the reviewers before actually gave it a 4 star review despite the fact that she or he admittedly did not even finish it! This is probably what you'd call a biased judgement. The Great Gatsby is certainly an interesting book to study (as would be any book, in my opinion) but I cannot say I enjoyed it too much, even if the images and underlying themes are interesting. I have to say I read it in the Penguin edition, so I don't know about the preface of this one, but I found helpful the essay displayed there (always read these introductions and stuff AFTER you read the novel, otherwise it's merely a spoiler and it can't deepen your understanding of the book since you know nothing of it at that moment).Despite all this I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 stars, I hesitated longly between 2 and 3 to be honest."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"** spoiler alert ** I can honestly say that I expected to hate this book as it wasn't the type of book I would usually reach for, but as one chosen for me by my favourite book club I got to read it, and I liked it.So many cliches come to mind when I think about this book. Those phrases you've vaguely heard about the grass not being greener on the other side, that all people have their secrets, that even the seemingly happy may not be so, and that we all die alone.Whilst well written and beautiful in a literal sense, it was just such a twisted web of illusion and tradgedy where nobody ended up happy and it was possible that nobody ever really knew the truth about any of the other characters.It may be just me, but I found it a bit like a car wreck and I couldn't look away and finished it quite fast."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I know that lots of people consider this the Great American Novel, but to me it's too flawed to rank that high.The problems begin with the decision to have the story narrated by Nick, a minor character. The first page of the story is devoted to Fitzgerald's trying to convince the reader that Nick is a reliable narrator (\\"I'm inclined to reserve all judgements\\" -- how many people go around saying things like that, and would you believe them if they did?). For the rest of the story he has to arrange for Nick to be everybody's confidante and present at all the crucial scenes, even when his friends are committing adultery: he's there when Gatsby shows his girlfriend his shirt collection; he's there when Tom punches HIS girlfriend in the nose; he's there at the fatal auto accident, and it's awkward that he's not there when Gatsby gets shot.Then there are the story's underlying assumptions. Fitzgerald assumes that his (1930 WASP) audience will favor the old-rich Buchanans and dislike the newly-rich Gatsby, then tries to convince them otherwise. If you don't have that bias in the first place, a lot of the novel is a waste. And Fitzgerald doesn't seem to realize that Nick is old-boy-network too -- his bond-selling job is apparently so easy that he hardly ever mentions it.Then there's the 1930s racism. To present a really contemptuous picutre of the New Rich, he describes a car of rich African-Americans. And to hint at Gatsby's shady background, Fitzgerald brings in a Jewish racketeer (who, of course, describes his scams to Nick in detail - see paragraph 2).The purpose of all this is to teach Nick something -- that rich people can be jerks, I guess. Not that Nick does anything with the lesson, except write the novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While I understand this book is denominated \\"a classic\\" (that's why I read it), it was just an OK read (for me).I also just completed the online Sparks notes, and will readily and loudly announce just how much I truly missed in my reading. From the Sparks notes, I saw all the symbolism and historical implications that went whizzing past me. And from the perspective of literary accomplishment/social commentary, I am truly impressed.But again, I can't get past that this was just an OK read for me. I can't really say I connected with any of the characters (although Gatsby was clearly the most sympathetic).Frankly, I could have done very nicely without the overtly anti-semitic portrayal of Wolfscheim (and no, I can't excuse it, as simply an accurate historical reflection of the times).I expect that many will be offended by a lukewarm review of a recognized classic. But like spinach, it may be healthful to eat, but just not taste that good. I guess it depends on what you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book twice - both times many years ago. Twice because after reading criticisms of the work I thought I must have missed something the first time. Still, the impression that I have is that of a book with a limited artistic range. Yes he used his colors well, but to me they're tepid and there's not enough of them. I think I ended throwing a few of my own in, projecting into the characters a frustration with themselves having to operate on such a shallow level. Gatsby himself - the most complex depiction - even he couldn't convince me that his desires, drives, motives, emotions, were inspiring enough to merit a book of his own."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Follow my sarcasm. The author may have intended the same. The Great Gatsby - regarded as \\"great,\\" but to whom? Not the novel, but rather the subject of the novel - Jay Gatsby - who is the character central to the narrator's story. Through the eyes of the moral and perceptive Nick Carraway, we see Jay Gatsby from the narrator's point-of-view. But we also get glimpses of how he affects other characters. Is he the great party-goer that everyone wonders and gossips about? Is he a true, self-made millionaire we all strive to be? Is he a romatic at heart? Or is he nothing more than a phony and shallow swindler and roadside magician?Considered a compliment to Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" - one can see that the narrator delivers a little ethical punch as to why such opulent and destructive wealth can ruin a man. Perspectives of what makes a man great become the game of the novel. No one really knows the real Gatsby - no one, except for Nick.Having read it in high school and now again some twenty years later, I can see what makes it inaccesible for adolescence yet endearing and profound for adults; it is the rift between the opposites that a mature and experienced audience can all relate to. For Nick, it's about distinguishing truth from falsehoods; the deeply genuine from the superficial. For the rest, it's the pendulum swing of getting rich and disregarding the poor, the city and its \\"valley of ashes\\" over its affluent suburbs. Then for other charatcers - like Tom, Daisy, and Myrtle - there is the sometimes violent gap between love and lust. The themes of this novel are timeless and multi-layered; and it seems Fitzgerald made no attempts to disguise them. It's an easy read to get through in a day, but you could spend several weeks analyzing it.As for his style, Fitzgerald clearly attempted to write a simple novel with descriptions that are sometimes weaved with a demanding and moralizing inner voice. His dialogue runs deep with meaning, in that it's about what they don't say. While reading it, you have to remind yourself that the dialogue and descritption that is absent reflects what the author is not telling us - the characters themselves are absent from reality and what they are unable or unwilling to face.It's a step above realism, in that we have implicit opinions about culture and society through the eyes of his narrator which are balanced evenly among the aforementioned plot details and character actions. But even this lends itself to a good literary discussion. Can the narrator be trusted? Is the narrator in search of something greater? Is he fair? Is he leaving anything out? Gatsby, afterall, \\"represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn,\\" as he states on the second page. The foreshadowing lures you into wondering why. What has he done to anger the narrator? And yet what makes him \\"great\\"?As a period piece, it's undeniably an essential read to the Jazz Age canon. Otherwise, the recurring themes make it highly relevant to today's issues of greed, shallowness, and loss of faith. Decide for yourself whether the destructive avarice still rings true for Long Island, New York, for society in general."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel typefies everything one would expect from a great novel. It's got romance, suspense, wit, humor, and of course, the story's not over until someone dies fighting for love. The Great Gatsby really is a page turner. In fact, I became so absorbed into the book that I would not realize that an hour has gone by before my eyes. yes, it's THAT good.The story is simple, really. A man from humble beginnings, Gatsby, meets his wealthy mentor, and when he dies, Gatsby inherits his fortune. He then goes south and meets a southern debutante, Daisy, from a prominent southern family, and they fall in love. Gatsby is then called off to war, during which time Daisy goes off and marries Tom. That's all the background you need to know, since revealing any more would spoil the delightfully disturbing ending for you.This novel truly personifies one man's quest for the American Dream, even if it is a bit obsessive complusive. Hats off to Fitzgerald for doing such a thorough job of exploring the depths of each character and making them all relate in the end. His unique writing style, including numerous repetitions of symbols, is what adds to his flare. For those of us who are a bit impatient, don't worry, this is perfect for you. Fitzgerald explores all the aspects of a major storyline with as few words as possible, allowing the characters to speak for themselves. As you read this, you can almost picture the motion picture that it would make, thus making the book simply that much better to read.i would recommend this book to anyone who is literate."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a nice read, although not particularly enthralling. Hence, the non-commital length makes this book worth the time. Fitzgerald does offer an interesting glimpse into a cross-section of 1920's life in New York. Perhaps his perspective seems subtle because of it's relevance to today's society. It reads like an Hollywood movie, and may be more useful to the foreign reader in understanding part of American society."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Timeless writing, lost like the quality of dream. The searching spirits, striving for what they may never, spiritually, attain in this world, where self-delusion motivates, social tendencies can seem shallow. Friendships; empathy amid the cold but natural human tendencies. Incorruptible dreams amid corruption. The quality of character questioned. Observant, non-participatory narration, depicts the beauty, the waste, the prejudices and insecurity, fragility; time passing.It's indeed a deep book; many shades. Honest, romantic, beautiful, sorrowful. Emptiness found in the richest vistas. It has a resigned tone, but with affection for the failing of Gatsby, confronting the dream that has died, and is always dying. It's a Greek Tragedy really.I can't get the actor Robert Redford out of my head for Gatsby, because he was just the perfect casting for this bygone age. If u like this classic, u'll like the slower Brideshead Revisited by Eveleyn Waugh, and Donna Tartt's more recent, student classic The Secret History."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"feel that the sentences may go on and on and on sometimes but I could not stop reading! Have wanted to read this my entire life and have not been disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Great novels are about things. The things they are about are provoking thought or providing illumination on some aspect of the human heart or the human condition. Additionally, a great novel will always evoke an emotional reaction in the reader, whether good or bad. Gatsby was intended by the author from the start to be a serious work of art for adult consumption, Fitzgerald was reaching for greatness. While books like \\"Harry Potter\\" or even \\"Lord of the Rings\\" may be a fine entertainment, in the end they are just a collection of ingeniously crafted plot points with relateable and entertaining characters. There is nothing wrong with this, people need and enjoy pap, but sometimes it's good to have a book or even a film challenge you to think about things more deeply.For any high schoolers \\"forced\\" to read this, let me say this. You will not \\"get\\" this book. This is not due to any intellectual or moral deficiency. A 17-year old Steven Hawking or Einstein would fare no better. This is not because the book is even slightly difficult to read, comprehend, or follow. On the contrary, the book is an easy read that does not have difficult language or elaborate plot intricacies. Many of you might still like and enjoy the book highly, I know I did in high school. Many will intellectually understand the themes or symbollism, because they are not complex, in fact they are very simple and straightforward, which is what makes this novel so great. But you won't really feel it in your heart, because when you are younger you don't yet have the tools to fully appreciate this book. Do yourself a favor. Reread this book after the age of 30, and just let your mind soak it in for the pure enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is not a book for me. I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull. It was really hard to get into. This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday. He then befriends Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress. I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book. There wasn't really a plot. This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it. The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not. Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot. His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable. This book was just basically about affairs. I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot. He was just there; nothing important. I don't understand why this is a classic..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Prior to starting this novel, I was convinced I had read it some time in school while I was growing up. Throughout my public school education, we had read a variety of classics from Steinbeck, Dickens, Hemingway, Miller, etc. So I really thought I had read this one along the way. After a couple of paragraphs, I realized that I hadn't, because I think I would have remembered the different feel this one seems to have from most classic American literature.The length of the novel alone is enough to show you that it's not quite the same as some of those other novels. Fitzgerald seemed to have more of a sense of what to cut out and what to include than some of his contemporaries, because at no point during this reading did I sit and think \\"Will you just get ON with it?!?\\" I'm sad to say that I have done that with plenty of other authors, so I was a bit worried I'd have that reaction when going through The Great Gatsby. I very happily enjoyed this novel and hope to read more of Fitzgerald's work in the future.The book itself is the tragic tale of our title character, Jay Gatsby. Having never been satisfied with the life he came from, Gatsby invents a new self and goes about trying to find the person he wants to be. Along the way, he meets Daisy, who becomes the big driving force in his life. I think in today's day and age, we might call Gatsby a stalker - he's obsessive and goes so far as to buy his house in Long Island because of his ability to see Daisy's across the way. While this would seem creepy if we were telling it from a modern perspective, it strikes me as being rather sad. Gatsby goes from only knowing he wants to make money, to knowing he wants to make money for Daisy. At one point during the story, he even says that he decided doing things was less important than telling Daisy about all the things he wanted to do. It's really a sad case of lost boy syndrome, in my book.Something that really stuck out to me throughout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like. This theme carries through to the end when we learn that our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who is truly there for Gatsby in his time of need. While Gatsby isn't a model citizen, he doesn't seem all that scandalous to me, and certainly doesn't deserve the rumor mongering that follows him throughout the course of the novel. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm looking at it from a modern perspective, so his actions don't seem any worse than things we see on TV on a daily basis.I picked this book up for Banned Books Week, and found it rather amusing when I was investigating the reasoning behind the banning of this book. It was basically for language and some mild sexual content, which is just ridiculous. I certainly didn't see any bad language when reading it, and the only references to sex were along the lines of \\"so and so left the room for awhile\\". Again, maybe it's a more modern perspective, but those things are just silly. I'm totally against the banning of books anyway, so I guess I've got a skewed perspective twice over.The only questionable thing for me is really the behavior of Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan. I found Tom to be annoying, as arrogant as he is described, and a bigot to top it off. It's made worse by the knowledge that men like Tom did exist, and to an extent they still do. Still, that's no reason to ban a book, it's just a reason to dislike Tom and root for Gatsby.I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time. It's a shame we lost him all too soon, because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I was reading this I kept wondering how it could be a classic.

It is is not a very long book, but it truly captures the time, and upper crust New York life. The characters are wonderful and the plot moves quickly. There are references to many things that happened in the 20's and issues of the time. The ending was pretty anticlimactic as well."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic that can be appreciated decades after its publication. The mysterious Gatsby looms over the lethargic beginning, but as he comes into focus the novel becomes enthralling. The mysterious Gatsby is at first depicted as a wealthy, powerful man, but shocking irony reveals the truth. Gatsby's love for Daisy has driven him to an extravagant lifestyle. Gatsby, once portrayed as the wealthiest and most powerful man in New York, was nothing more than a hopeless romantic. Gatsby is further berated - Daisy's wife, Tom, accuses Gatsby of criminal activities and involvement. Nonetheless, Gatsby and Daisy still meet privately on several occasions, and Gatsby's ornate portrayal of Daisy is not fulfilled. Over the years, Gatsby has exalted Daisy with his immense wealth and imagination.The overarching theme throughout the novel is exactly that mentioned above. Gatsby's exalting of Daisy has turned her into nothing more than a possession in his mind. This can be paralleled to the American Dream, the desire for success, prosperity, wealth, and a family. Gatsby can never have Daisy because of his immense wealth, an ironic cynical idea that was likely portrayed since this novel was written in the midst of the Great Depression. Another theme parodies the constant quest for money in America. The upper class, repented by Gatsby, is motivated by greed and desire. On the surface, the upper class appear superior an powerful, but in reality they are so desperate that they seek wealth to fill the hole in their personal American Dream.Overall, the Great Gatsby is a timeless classic, brilliantly written on multiple levels. The entire storyline brilliantly parallels and satires the quest for wealth, needs, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is elegant yet precise. As previously mentioned, the beginning, though lethargic and descriptive, is still intriguing. At first, the verbose details may seem extraneous, but it proves to be a great beginning to an amazing novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I think, or I glean, that American high school students are required to read this book, held up as a shining example of national literature. Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate.

There also many other symbolisms in this story for things such as God and distance.All things considered this is a great book it has a very good plot, lesson and the writing style, length, realism, etc. are superb.

The amount of symbolism used is very impressive. This book is definitely a American Classic. Everything that is written in his book has meaning and depth. All of those who enjoy a great read, especially one they can reflect more upon, should read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One of the most famous novels to come out of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby is a tragedy of a man whose pursuit of the elusive American Dream leads to his destruction.Gatsby, as seen through the eyes of Nick Carraway, is a larger-than-life self-made man with a dubious background, whose opulent parties at the brightest-lit mansion on West Egg precedes even the man himself, and who looked the part of \\"an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\" In this fleeting impression Nick has of Gatsby at their first meeting, there is a sense of a buried identity under the artifice that is not quite successfully kept from view.Gatsby is obsessed with Daisy, Nick's married cousin, who becomes more a symbol of what he wants to possess, but which ironically loses its significance when it is within reach.The novel is complicated by Nick's narrative, which is never reliable, and like Gatsby's identity, never quite stops shifting, and oftentimes displaces the focus on Gatsby to become more revealing about Nick. That we never get a true picture of Gatsby or Gatz, is perhaps the strength of the novel as a modernist text, in the way it sets questions about identity and the construction of it in place."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald is such a poetic, transcendent author that you are moved through the nuances of this tragic and yet fulfilling story in an extravagant and engrossing manner. The story itself is deep and captivating, despite being about emptiness and loss. I loved it, one of the greatest books of all time in my opinion. And worth rereading again and again, as new meaning pop out constantly, and new treasures are constantly exposed.

I know that I was supposed to read this in high school, but can't remember if I did or not. Regardless, I finally picked up another copy and read it again. There is not much else to say about this timeless American masterpiece. The writing is stunningly good, the symbolism is inspiring, and the characters are sympathetic despite their gross materialism and hollowness. This book resonates as much with our own time period as the Jazz Age that it is set in.On the surface, this is a book that tells the story of a tragic love story. Simmering just below the surface, the novel is a first-class commentary on the hollowness of the pursuit of money and things. Gatsby is at once admirable and pathetic, rich and the poorest of men. Finding purpose beyond the material world is the only thing that can differentiate us and him.If you read this in high school and remember not liking it, try it again. Books that are force fed often taste bad going down no matter how good they are. This is a great book and one that I will read again and again over the years.

I got it from the library.I was expecting bells and whistles, stars, hearts, explosions, so forth from it. This is one of those novels bright eyed twenty somethings mention in gasping tones when people ask them about \\"what changed their lives.\\" But to me, it was not much more then a sad, sparse love story. There's a delicate artistic undertone to it that propels it into the range of \\"art.\\" The \\"eyes of Dr. T Eckleton\\" (sp) were a powerful and disturbing image, and Fitzgerald's descriptions of the industrial wastleands of West Egg were horrifying and stark.

Over the last three years I have slowly developed a taste for it. Because I am such a novice to literary analysis I am not sure how beneficial my review will be, but I will give you my thoughts on this important work. I never had to read this book in High School but I decided to read it in preparation for teaching a High School history class on the 1920's. F. Scott Fitzgerald's book is an important social commentary on his own time. For that matter there are things in this book that are applicable to the world that we live in. It is is a book that is essentially centered around morality and the woes that come to us when we throw off moral restraint and embrace hedonism.The 1920's was a fun period in many ways but it was also bloated. This was an age defined by crime, the tearing down of old social mores, and excess. F. Scott Fitzgerald has strong feelings about this issue. The characters are hard to like and yet they are hard to completely hate. The main character, Nick Carraway, is a small town boy that moves into a nice neighborhood in the city. He is relatively naive in his understanding of the world. He is attracted by the glitz and glamour of city life but soon finds that he is confronted with moral dilemmas that place him in an uncomfortable situation. His cousin Daisy is a fun-loving swinger who seeks, fun, thrills, and financial security even though she is not happy. She is silly and frivolous and likely stands to represent the spirit of the era. Her husband is an arrogant, bloated, racist, hypocrite who expects his wife to live by standards that he himself does not keep. His attraction to racist ideology reminded me that it was in the 1920's that the KKK was expanding as well as the eugenics movement in Europe. Jordan Baker, the friend of Daisy and the girlfriend of Carraway, is the quintessential carefree Flapper girl that was fun to be with but not necessarily \\"the marrying type.\\"Gatsby is the center of the story. He is the wealthy neighbor of Nick. I thought that Gatsby was the hardest character to analyze. He is at certain points a likable character and yet while he is a better guy than Tom, he seems to have become caught up in the lifestyle he has made for himself. He is empty and hallow and seems to lack a strong moral compass. At times he is commendable and chivalrous. It makes you believe that underneath what was apparent was a person who had the potential to do well. Yet the way he made his money and the seedy, gritty nature of his business showed another side to Gatsby. Nick becomes a friend who feels both admiration and disgust. The most interesting character is not even a character but a pair of eyes on the billboard in downtown New York City. The T.J. Eckleburg sign is in my opinion representative of the eyes of God who sees the entire scenario and silently watches everything.The book was well-written but one of the negative aspect of the book for me was the fact that there were places where it was easy to get lost, and a few times I did become disoriented as to what was going on. The book is thick with symbolism and I found this to be both unique and cumbersome. I am sure there is so much to this book that I was not able to really explore. I was hoping that I would find a unique passage that I could have my students analyze but the book did not really offer a section that was reflective. For example: Dostoevsky in his book \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" has the great writing called the \\"Grand Inquisitor.\\" This is a piece of literature that can be isolated from the book and examined as it provides great insight into the issue that Dostoevsky is attempting to address. Fitzgerald chose not to do that with this book. However, despite these small issues I am certainly interested in reading more of Fitzgerald's works as it is apparent that he has a lot to say to his generation whether they wanted to hear it or not.The Great Gatsby gives us the message that not everything that glitters is gold. The 1920's look fun and carefree but not everybody thought they were a healthy time. It is message about the emptiness that comes from opulence and indulgence and warns not only his time but every generation of the danger it brings. Wealth and power often bring corruption and while they appear enticing they offer very little. It is a warning of what happens when people throw off moral constraints to rush headlong into a life of pleasure and party. Overall, the book was well done and gave me a good look at one of the ways that people living in the 20's saw their own time. School textbooks tell a \\"Disney\\" version of history where everything is good and everyone is having fun. The Great Gatsby challenges that idea by offering another perspective of the time. I think this benefits students to enable them to see events through various sets of eyeballs. Needless to say, this is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book takes a slice of a certain aspect of American life and holds itself up to inspection. What is love? How does expectation versus desire affect who we are and what we do?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote TGG, it was during an age of social elitism often built on the backs of crime and underhand dealings. Gatsby builds wealth by illegally moving alcohol, and many other elite members of society in the book are also involved in seedy rackets.To understand this book, its subtle humor, its deep tragedies, and its social mores requires only one question. Should the rich be allowed to do whatever they want just because they are rich? Fitzgerald answers this question in an elegant love story turned all wrong.Consequences have actions, and misbehavior is often punished.Gatsby is rewarded for his avarice by loaning his car to a murderess.The fact that Daisy gets away with murder is rewarded by endless hell with her psychotic husband.It is a great book if one can get past the fact that almost no character has much of a redeeming quality. It is a lesson in life, written as much to educate as entertain."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby hardly needs an introduction...This is simply my favorite book of all time - from the first time I read it, the characters were etched in my mind forever and the story-line is simply unforgettable - it will haunt you forever. Every self-respecting reader owes it to her / himself to read this incredible book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"James Gatz tried, like Franklin, to improve himself, and succeeded, but he was not required to build America. Instead, he became the Great Gatsby, moving like a Homeric Gyad among the party-goers of East and West Egg. His money came from a dubious &quot;gonnegtion&quot; with the wolf (Meyer Wolfsheim, rather than Lanski), to whom he had presented himself in his uniform, covered with medals, because he lacked the cash to buy clothes.Like many an able lad of plain background (North Dakota) Jay encounters the leisured class, particularly the beautiful and popular Daisy (she loves me, she loves me not). Supposed to wait while he went to war (that one again), she marries into Buchanan money and has a daughter. Jay comes back to hover around the green light at the end of her dock and build a life &quot;founded securely on a fairy's wing.&quot;We are treated to a catalog of party-goers parallel to the catalog of ships in the Iliad. The denizens of the two Eggs are more fragile than heroic. Jay makes his move for Daisy, who nods back and forth between him and her husband, Tom. The significance of the daughter seems to escape Jay totally (what's it all about, Jay?).Finally, one horribly hot evening, Daisy, driving Jay's car beside Jay, runs down and kills her rival for Tom's affections, Myrtle Wilson. Tom, driving in a subsequent car, tells Wilson, Myrtle's husband, whose car it was. Wilson shoots Jay. Tom never finds out the truth, and Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, walks away from the entire irresponsible crowd.This writing is a fictional story from the mind of the great F. Scott Fitzgerald and is not a document of American society. Perhaps people like his characters have existed, but America is bigger than he. If the shoe doosn't fit, don't wear it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In the wonderful book, The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the suspense never ends. The character the book is revolved around is a man named Gatsby. In the first part of the book Gatsby does not take the role of a main character. No one knows much about this man Gatsby except that he owns a house on the Long Island Sound and hosts many parties. Gatsby is a very rich man. He has servants take care of his house and himself. He also owns an enormous house with a pool. Sometimes Gatsby even takes people up in his hydroplane. When referring to a hydroplane he means a seaplane. Gatsby claims that he is rich because of a large inheritance from his family out west. Gatsby is also a self made millionaire. He also states that he made some of the money in the oil and drug business. Gatsby is a mystery that many people gossip about. Many people say that he supposedly went the Oxford while others disagreed and said he lied about that. Other rumors that circled around the neighborhood are that he was a soldier and killed some Germans. What Gatsby did is for you to find out? Gatsby's true character finally comes out during the book. He becomes good friends with the main character Carraways in the book who eventually finds his true character. In my opinion, Gatsby is a very discreet person not sharing any of his secrets with anybody. Gatsby meets this woman Daisy who is married to Buchanan. This is where the story unfolds."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is the classic novel known as the American Dream. I thought that in some ways it represented what everyone in the United States wants. I thought that in the beginning it was really really boring but in the secone half of the book it became a little bit more interesting. I think that overall it was an okay book but I don't think that I would ever read it again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story of one man's struggle to find happiness during the booming 20's. He surrounds himself with wealth and throws parties he does not attend to bring back his one true love. This story captures life during the 1920's very accurately and shows that wealth can not buy a person's love or happiness."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway, a young man in the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, relates the tale of his friend, Jay Gatsby. The story follows Gatsby's search for an unattainable ideal of love through wealth, eventually leading to his downfall. This novel portrays the very spirit of the 1920's, also exposing its dark side. Very well written, but a dull plot. It failed to draw the reader into the story, nor did it make the reader really care about the characters."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful tale of an era. It is intriguiging, suspensful, and a well-written novel. The TNT movie of this is just as great!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is my opinion that &#65533;The Great Gatsby&#65533; is Fitzgerald&#65533;s bestwork. The novel brings the glitter of the jazz age back fullforce. The devil-may-care freewheeling lifestyle carriesthe reader along with the young man Jay Gatsby (the maincharacter of the novel) in his sad search for love and riches.The story is also narrated in the third person which I reallythought gave the novel more perspective. Also a greattouch was the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg looking downfrom the billboard; it is a classical symbol. The book is agreat read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The protagonist takes you through the highs and lows of 20th Century high society. The protagonist, introduced to polite society by an acquaintance (Gatsby), shows you the landmarks and windfalls along the road to dinner parties, and points out the many trappings of culture and conscience that befit a beautiful young fool surfing the upper crust of industrial-age America.Much of this book draws from the writer's own life, as he watched his own wife suffer from many of the same symptoms of society as his book's characters; obsession with the trappings and trimmings of the social elite; greed and spite; treachery and manipulation;alcoholism and insanity. This genuine point of view is distilled by careful selection in a tour de force o the ballroom lifestyle.The author's style relies heavily upon narrative, and his descriptions are potent. He mingles Western cultural artifacts (billboards, warehouse districts) and signs of life in America's dustbowl (parked cars) to spot the low and high income parts of metropolitan culture like the warm and cold spots in the river. All in all, this is a book which draws its power from subjective interpretation of the narrative; very little is decided for the reader, who feels much like a back-seat passenger in Gatsby's car, listening in and seeing the sights."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I decided to read The Great Gatsby because it is a classic, and when I was supposed to read it in high school, I got the Cliff Notes instead. The story still did not impress me much, but it is a short read and well worth it in the end because the message is one we can all learn from. Gatsby is in search of his true love, which is something all of us look for in life - that relationship of heroic proportions that seems almost surreal and timeless. Perhaps the last page is the best clincher of the book: \\"Gatsby believed in the green light (true love), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...and one fine morning ----- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" How true it is...beat on my friends."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A good but not great book. I support Clifton Fadiman for not including it in his list of books for The Lifetime Reading Plan. I really wouldn't bother reading heavy symbolism into it, magnifying its importance with nonsense. Yeah, people are greedy and selfish, okay, so?The main characters are wealthy, mysterious Gatsby, wealthy and self centered Tom Buchanan, Tom's wealthy and self centered wife Daisy who Gatsby is in love with, and Tom's no-class adulterous girlfriend Mrs Myrtle Wilson.It is a short book, and a quick and easy one to read. It holds your interest because of the subject matter - love, betrayal. Most of the characters aren't likeable, they are dislikeable. It is one of the most overrated books of all time because it is often called one of the greatest books, which it definitely isn't. Can anyone seriously put this little story up against War and Peace, or Brothers Karamazov? Come on. You don't have any great characters here. But it is an interesting story that earns its three stars out of five."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I believe novels should be accessible to people of all tastes, from those who prefer history and biography (as I do) to those who prefer science fiction. Truly great novels transcend personal preferences and that is exactly what the Great Gatsby is-- a story of human nature, set in a time of recklessness and ambition that seems to parallel, in some ways, our world today. It is written with soft prose and vivid imagery-- the examples are too numerous to be listed here. As most know the plot, I won't delve into that, but just to add that, considering this shouldn't be a spoiler, one question I have always wondered (and wished to the contrary) is, &quot;Why did Gatsby have to die?&quot; Despite his surely illictly-garnered fortune and reckless nature, the reader cheers for Gatsby, who is far from perfect, but represents a small part of each of us. That is truly the magic of Fitzgerald's piece and I hope, especially if you've never read it before, that you find a little enchantment yourself."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There are only two books that resemble America, our past, our present, and our future.There are only two books that tackled the issues so subtely, and with so much imagination, they are nothing short of classics.The Great Gatsby is one of them;Huckelbery Finn is the other."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can you imagine a man rummaging through newspapers for years in search of a single name? Can you imagine a millionaire who would give up everything he owns just to be with the girl he loves for another second? Joe Gatsby is such a man. After years of fruitless searching he has finally found the girl again he loves more than life itself; and he is determined to win her back, no matter what the price might be.In my opinion Fitzgerald does do a great job in portraying New York's high society of the 1920's. As the plot carefully unfolds the reader gets to know more and more about the protagonist's past and can consequently form his own opinion not just about Joe Gatsby, but about a whole class of society.I would recommend this book to adults of every age. Fitzgerald uses a variety of different symbols and a rather elevated style which is not always easy to understand upon the first reading. However, I think that one should take the time and let oneself be enchanted by a storey of love and betrayal that will be unlike everything one has read before."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Every once in a while, it is important to go back and read a classic, to remember what it takes to make a novel memorable. THE GREAT GATSBY is an example of perfection, both in prose and in plot. As such, it is timeless.In this book, author F. Scott Fitzgerald perfectly captures the energy of that moment when the Gilded Age was ending and the Jazz Age was beginning. Set among the estates of Long Island's elegant North Shore, Fitzgerald illustrates why \\"the rich are different from you and me,\\" a classic line straight out of this novel.Treatises have been written on whether Fitzgerald was the best American author of the 20th Century. Regardless of the conclusion as to whether he was the single best, there is no dispute that he belongs in the pantheon of the writing gods. To read GATSBY is to lose oneself in Fitzgerald's lyricism.So, re-read THE GREAT GATSBY, and enjoy what it takes to make a book truly great."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated and vivid Jazz Age tale describes the rise and fall of a charismatic character and the society around him. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Heart of Darkness. Both are first person narrations of the downfall of fabulous, ambitious social outsiders. And \\"Gatsby\\" points to the heart of darkness in American life, not only in the shady and criminal wellsprings of Jay Gatsby's wealth - and, by implication, perhaps, all wealth - but also in the coldness and cruel indifference of the privileged classes in the social hierarchy.The story touches on many traditional American themes. The loss of innocence and the seduction of the new world by the wicked old one - roles often assumed by America and Europe - are here played out here in the second-favorite context of heartland versus New York, as the young sons and daughters of the Midwest are drawn into the web of the old, worldly, moneyed, Jewish metropolis. As the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes, not only does he hail from around Minnesota, but so do the other major characters - Jordan Baker, the Buchanans and Gatsby (and indeed Fitzgerald himself). Fitzgerald's America is different from today's. Whiter, much more parochial and homogenous, and smaller - Carraway uses the terms west and midwest interchangeably, whereas today west means LA not Chicago. Yet it is still familiar and its concerns regarding the struggle for success, the discovery that its attainment need not mean happiness, and the fickleness of social approval are as pressing today as they were then. The role of money is not as primary as that of acceptance and prestige, and certainly less important than in many 19th century European novels where it is a true nexus. Here - as in the lives of the super-rich today - it is mainly just a way of keeping score. The themes of remaking oneself, of moving and making a new start, and the gap between one's newly constructed self and one's enduring personal reality are likewise as topical (and American) as ever. The lurid denouement also has a flavour which is all too familiar today and is reminiscent of any number of recent classic American violent scandals among the newly rich - cases like Harris-Tarnower, the Menendez brothers, OJ or Ted Ammon.Obviously, many of these issues were of direct personal import to Fitzgerald himself, yet \\"Gatsby\\" is a truly mature work without a trace of autobiographical flavour. Fluidly and assuredly written, it has stood the proverbial test of time, while many contemporary and later works have begun to date or are entirely forgotten. The epigram at the start is perhaps one of the funniest to preface any major piece of fiction (although Fitzgerald - or his editor - chose well in not using it in the title). Yet for all its merits, \\"Gatsby\\" is a slighter work than its reputation suggests: a novella, perhaps, but it has the feel of a short story. The Great American Novel it is not, but certainly a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Firstly let me say I found this book unusually interesting and unlike many &quot;classics&quot; easy to read. The tale is a romance, Jay Gatsby longs to be with Daisy, a girl from a different social world that he knew for a short period of time mamy years before. On a different level the book describes the pointless existence of the idle rich and their dissatisfaction with their lot, although set in the 1920's it is still applicable today in many ways. The characters Fitzgerald paints are shallow and undeserving, having achieved their wealth through inheritance or crime. The author clearly is critical of his creations, but at the same time seems to be entranced by their mixture of style without substance. My one dissapointment was the lack of any character I felt I could identify with or empathise with, even the narrator Nick Carroway came across to me as having few if any endearing qualities. Probably just my personal prejudice in a novel rather than any literary requirement."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book is called the Great Gatsby but the story is really focused on Daisy - surely a precursor for every 1940s femme fatale. She may have been called the original obscure object of desire. Jay Gatsby hungers for a past where he was happy with Daisy. But is she is part of the moneyed world which is entered by crime or by inheritance. No one really earns it. Fitzgerald seems at odds with the American dream of wealth, but attracted to the glamour and excess of it.The lack of a moral compass in financial matters, can also be seen in the directionless lives of the novel's characters. Gatsby uses his fortune in an ill fated attempt to bring back Daisy. The narrator has empty affairs with people in his office. Daisy and Tom \`smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money ... and let other people clean up the mess.' The author seems attracted to fame and fortune, and yet horrified by it. There is no moral centre in this universe.A very sad novel that has haunted readers for almost 80 years."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"My high school English class read this book this year, and at first I figured it would be like the other not-so-interesting books we had read, and that I'd just get the Spark Notes. However, the few people in the class who had read it before raved about it, so I decided to give it a shot. I found it a little hard to get into, but as soon as I did I absolutely fell in love with it, and it has become one of my all-time favorite novels. The honesty and accuracy that Fitzgerald writes with makes The Great Gatsby a timeless piece of literature, and the social comments that Fitzgerald makes are as relevant today as they were in the 1920s. I can honestly say that The Great Gatsby allowed me to see society in a way I never had before. If you read only one book this year, make it The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is another classic that everyone should read again - after having read it the first time in jr. high school - as an adult in order to truly appreciate it.The story is now part of American Mythology: Jay Gatsby, mysterious millionaire, Oxford graduate, WWI hero, is actually a naive midwesterner, recreated and transplanted in Long Island to regain the love of his Fantasy Golden Girl. What he should have known but didn't is that rich girls don't marry poor boys.Gatsby is American ingenuity, determination, zest for life and innocence ripped asunder by American cynicism, banal materialism and bigotry."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"With &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald takes us into the life of Nick Carraway, who - at the height of 1920's glitz and excess - has just moved to the East Coast with the hopes of getting in bonds sales. Detached but forever present and trusted by the characters, Nick tells the story of Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic neighbour who throws lavish parties, and Daisy, with whom Gatsby is infatuated. As the story evolves, we are slowly given insight into an odd love triangle, the penalties of excess, and who Jay Gatsby really is.The Great Gatsby is a smooth read which maintains its capacity to be called a classic throughout the ages, despite having been written 80 years ago. The themes it investigates (infidelity, greed, class struggles, etc.) are as timeless as Fitzgerald's wonderful prose, and the carefully interwoven and surprising storyline makes for an exceptionally entertaining read as well. Although I would struggle to call this a &quot;love story&quot;, as some have, I would certainly concede that it is a story about love. More than just a love story, though, it deals with the ramifications of infidelity, the consequences of infatuation, and the effect wealth and security has on it. Fitzgerald's statement can be found in simply considering where everyone is at the end, and what they have done to be there. Is that justice?A welcome read for everyone. True classic.Matty J"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I hate this book, always have but it is required reading for one of my classes this semester. The price was very cheap (five dollars max), it came within a reasonable time, and was in perfect condition although it was under \\"used\\" and rated as \\"very good.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The story takes place through the eyes of Nick basically an on looker.The era in which the book takes place is part of the attraction. It is the 20's and money is big. People are rich and notorious. Living in huge houses, throwing extravagent parties, and cheating spouces are common. Intertwined within all these themes is a tragic love affair. Written so elequently that the prose just flows off the pages."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of Americana. I read this book in high school, of course this book was assigned to us and boy did I love this little tale of murder and love in the Roaring '20s. Gatsby and Daisy's secret passion for each other kept this book a page turner, it's intriguing and i love the twist ending, if you don't like this book then there is something desperately wrong with you. One of the best books I've read, the first is The Catcher in the Rye. I hope teens are still reading this in high schools today. Classic, great style of writing from Fitzgerald, flows well and easy to read. Buy The Great Gatsby today!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of the better theme portrayals I have ever read. FSF states, with a singlemindedness, that in the 1920's, the American dream was corrupted by business, industry, misconceptions, and not living in the present. Also, the narration mirrors that of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because both narrators are full of contradictory ideas. The first line of Gatsby reads as follows: \\" In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I have been turing over in my head ever since.\\" Shortly after the narrator follows by saying that his father helped him to realize that he should reserve all judgements. But throughout the novel he is constantly judging every single person, and is ambivalent to every single person.In summation, The Great Gatsby is a good book, but is overhyped and does not have that great of a plot."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book, I dont see the need for highschool students to be reading this. Personally, I dont believe that they have the mind for it. He or she is not mature enough to understand the value of this book. They dont see the agony Gatsby goes through. The lust he has for Daisy and wanting her more than every material object on this earth. He puts this girl in his mind and he cant get her out. EVen though he is well aware she is with another guy, that she may or may not truely love. Either way he wants her but cant get her and he feels his life is not complete without her. So many adults do that today, teens dont understand, their idea of \\"love\\" is spelt with l-u-v. They just dont get it. If you are in highschool, your gonna hate it, read it when you have grown up. And if you are a teacher dont force these kids to read this, it will be worthless and they will probably never pick it up again dont ruin this for them!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"OK - so it's a \\"classic\\" book. Great story, wonderfully rich prose and fantastic imagery. You might even say it was an allegory of its time. And you might even call it The Great American Novel. It even has a tragic ending.My only real beef with this book is with the characters.First off, what is up with the lame protagonist Jay Gatsby? Is he for real? What a plonker. He is every bit as wet as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and Heathcliffe in Wuthering Heights. I thought those kind of wimps only existed in ye olde English literature but here is another one of these love-sick fools turning up in American literature.What this genre of classic literature needs is a hero who really knows how to sweep a girl off her feet. A man who races motorcycles at dangerously high speeds, knows kung-fu, has a bad attitude, no patience and can find all the cool late night bars. If he has Style and Nice Teeth then so much the better. Now that's a proper hero. What we don't need is another clown who doesn't know how to chat up girls and doesn't have the balls to go after what he wants. Gatsby's problem is that he's a wimp and he doesn't know how to have fun.And what about the other characters?Nick Carraway: what is up with him? He just seems to drift hopelessly through life observing all around him without actually having any sort of impact on the world.Jordan Baker: a hot chick to be sure, but also stuck up and prone to telling porky pies.Daisy Buchannan: uninspiring, boring and wishy-washy No real hero would waste his time with her.Great read but a shame I couldn't identify with any of the characters. In fact I didn't really care a damn for any of them. And it certainly didn't make me want to live that version of the American Dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel is useful to those teenagers who wish to seek the American dream of becoming successful and make a great deal of money. Reading The Great Gatsby gave me a look into what the High Society of the early 1920's was like. To many, this era was not really that important because World War 1 had ended years before and the world was just trying to get back on its feet. I thought this time to be dark and mysterious.F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of a young businessman from the Mid- West, living in one of the many posh neighborhoods along the coast of Long Island, was brilliant. The main character, Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, brings a sarcastic, yet genuine truth to the secret life of the rich and powerful. After waiting for a while, Nick finally meets the man named Gatsby. Despite all the rumors about the way he acquired his money and all the illegal actions that he might have taken part in, they become very good friends. The storyline continues and blossoms into a few love triangles, adultery, and murder. Reading this book will be an advantage to those students in high school who wish to do well and succeed in life.Some say that this Fitzgerald's novels should not be required reading for high school students. However, I believe that reading them can be life altering. The Great Gatsby allows you to take a glimpse into the lives of the rich and powerful. Within the walls of this aristocratic society there is great despair as well as great success. Fitzgerald is trying to send the message to those young enough to realize that money and power are not everything. Also, when power is obtained, work hard to keep it and do not let other things distract you. This novel is exceptional and should definitely be used in the classroom."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the top classic novels of all time. It is fairly familiar to most people and instantly recognizable when its title is said. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, was very detailed in his writings and used a lot of imagery and emotion in this novel. It takes place in the early 1920's in the heart of New York. Near Long Island, Nick Carraway (the main character) rents a house here and lives for the summer of 1922. In his time of living here, he has heard about the wealthiest, most popular, and most luxurious man in all of Long Island, Jay Gatsby. This man is known for his lavish parties, extreme amount of money, and a bad past. Come to find out, these two are connected in some way from their past, and will be reunited through different meetings. Jay turns out to be Nick's next-door neighbor, and through a series of events, both bond strongly.This all sounds like a good plot, and a good read for anyone, including high school students (like myself) on up. This however is not necessarily the case. Although I am in an AP English class that is more of a college level class, I found this book to be hard at times to get through. There is too much that goes on that strays away from the main plot and main point of the story. I just simply found this book to be boring. It is not a book that young adults should read. It is very drawn out, long, and detailed. It uses very sophisticated language and is written with very much detail. The only reason I found this book difficult to read was possibly because I had to keep myself from nodding off. Respectfully, yes it is a classic and should be read, but maybe for college students or adults instead of teenagers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is book is one of the best books I ever read. Fitzgerald's drunken mind was at its best in this one. The illustrated version is the best. I never knew women could even get in that position.

READ THE BOOK and save the Rice Krispies."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There is little to say about this &quot;classic&quot; that was written over a half a century ago. Not as timeless as some would have you believe. Not as bad as others my age would have you believe. Read it if you are really patient."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In this book the reader is introduced to Nick Carraway who describes his friendship with the new millionaire in town, Jay Gatsby. Jay has changed his surname and become rich all in the vain hope that can rekindle an \\"old flame\\" i.e. his long lost relationship with Daisy who is now a married woman. There is nothing \\"Great\\"about Gatsby or this book which is considered by many to be \\"The Great American Novel\\". The reader does have some sympathy for Gatsby as he engages in a futile attempt to relive something which only exists in the mothballs of his distant memory. I give this book 5 stars because somehow it made my High School English teacher decide that it was worth reading so 60 teenagers had to go out and buy this book. That is a very clever Marketing Ploy!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gosh, what can I say about The Great Gatsby. This classic book, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was a required novel that I had to read for my Introduction to the Novel class. It is a story about a man that discovers that he wants so much more in life than most people had. He wanted success, wealth, and a trophy wife. Put in the lovely Daisy Buchanan, the woman in which Jay Gatsby found his love of wealth and his love for her. However, to thicken the plot, Daisy is already married to the cold, hard Tom Buchanan. When Tom finds out about the affair between Daisy and Jay, he throughs a fit in a deluxe suite at the Plaza Hotel. But what does Tom have to complain about, he is also engaged in an affair with his mistress, Myrtle. It is through Myrtle's early death that Jay Gatsby's life also ends in sorrow. One pitiful scene occurs before Gatsby's death, he is waiting outside Daisy and Tom's bayside home, dressed in a pink suit, hiding in the shadows in case some emotional fireworks go off. The Great Gatsby is a fine classic, and it is quite thought provoking about life in the 1920's and today. No small wonder that my English professor wanted the class to read this novel. Even though we are a small class of six people, we certainly had about to say about The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\`The Great Gatsby' is a novel that attempts to probe into the heart of the American Dream. Implicit in its portrayal of the subject, the novel uncovers the pragmatism and the callous indifference that characterize the thinking of the individuals of the society then. Through the lucid writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, we see the lofty ambitions of Gatsby and Daisy being played out. Gatsby, in order to get close to Daisy and propel himself to a higher social stratum, lied to her about his background. Daisy, on the other hand, took to Gatsby because of his stint at Oxford.The American society of the 1920s saw a steady rise in prosperity of the nation and the standard of the living of the people. It was a period of hedonism and extravagance, with the Americans \`believing in the green light' and striving to \`run faster, stretch out their arms farther' to reach out for their \`orgastic future'.The novel is short and sweet, but it did not resonate very well with me. Perhaps the author positioned himself too remotely and distantly from the story, resulting in a failure to present a more impactful depiction of the \`Jazz Age'. This novel has also been touted as one of the most representative American work of fiction. But upon careful reading, I did not find an extremely distinct \`American-ness' in the novel.

Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you. Though I still feel unable to relate this story very well. But different people have different opinions."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Are you people stupid? This is one of the best books ever written"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I first heard that my English teacher gave us the opportunity to read \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part. To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied. I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal activities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareans play, a tragedy. Although I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is pieced together well, in stormy plot, but lacks excitement towards the ending. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but that wasn't the case here.All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself. But truthfully, if you, as a reader, define Fitzgerald's archetypal storyline as great as its title; that is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Prepare yourself, because the following is a less than glowing review of a revered classic. Yes, it's true, I am making myself vulnerable to all sorts of negative votes to express an honest, yet negative, opinion on a &quot;classic&quot; book.But first, a little plot overview. This is a tragic lovestory told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a Midwestern transplant to New York who happens to live in a modest house in a very rich neighborhood. He is the narrator, but most of the action is happening with other principal figures, most prominently J Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious figure who has gained wealth quickly from questionable means and goes to great lengths to win the heart of the woman he loves...who happens to be Nick's cousin.The story twists and turns and describes Gatsby's high-rollin' lifestyle -- which would make a great episode in today's world of MTV Cribs -- and melds together several love stories with a great description of the &quot;bored rich&quot; living in the 1920's. The story is very entertaining and moves you along quickly.So, if this were a novel I picked up without knowing anything about it, I would probably be glowing and gushing all over the floor about it. But it's not. It is &quot;classic&quot; literature whose merits to fit into that category seem to be in debate. Well, here are my two cents.Some of the arguments that I have seen for this book's greatness are its beautiful language, Fitzgerald's economy of words, and the portrayal of the Jazz Age. And to that I say, first, that yes, the language is very good and I liked alot of the writer's descriptions, but they simply did not blow my doors off like other classics seem to. My personal grade would be a B+.Secondly, hey, economy of words is great, and I appreciate that an author is able to express him/herself succinctly (as opposed to many non-classic current authors,) but that in and of itself is kind of like an add-on benefit for me, like if the car dealer throws in some customized floor mats or something. That's great, but it's not a deal maker-or-breaker.Thirdly, I appreciate the portrayal of this period in history. But I really don't care that much about the bored rich in that period of history. By reading some reviewers' comments, you would think that this would be akin to learning about the hardships of Western pioneers or the tribulations of flood victims or something. It's just not that captivating of a topic to me to carry a story, but I guess that is personal preference.So, to summarize. I liked the book. I give it four stars. But it has a wagon-load of expectations that it is carrying, and I just felt like I was missing something when I was reading it. And perhaps that just means I don't have enough edgukashuns to &quot;get it,&quot; but this feeling seems to be a common one among other readers, even those who have finished high school.Go ahead. Commence with the negatives."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If you're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby (a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people's mouths as a &quot;classic&quot;), read the yellow pages instead.

Every word is so carefully chosen, each element so intricately interwound, you can't help but feel your also glimpsing into Fitzgerald's very essence as you thumb the pages. While I'm not going to review the plot, it's actually a simple story of love's power and the human desire to be more than we are. The real strength is the way Fitzgerald draws you into a world of the bored rich and let's you see every detail through the eyes of the narrator. Gatsby himself is the essence of a tragic fugure. So rich, so powerful, yet even he can't have it all. Maybe my love for this book comes from my identification with Gatsby. How he was determined to become successful and acheived his goal. Read this book, read it slowly, savor the language like it is a fine port. So many things happen at once, you need to move through it carefully, so you don't miss any nusances. Finally, I noticed that many other &quot;reviewers&quot;, mostly pimple faces high school kids, absolutely hated the book. Don't be fooled. There is nothing boring about here. I read it in High School, I'm now an attorney, and absolutely loved it even then. The book is just too rich to be appreciated by many kids who refuse to take the time to look below the surface. They want a fast plot, simple language and an exciting story. That's all they are capable of handling since they are exposed to crap like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot; Anyone who didn't care for the book is just showing their own shortcomings and lack of intelligence.

Perhaps not as significantly in recent years, but it is still an important facet of our culture. It is the idea that everyone and anyone can attain prosperity and wealth in this country, even if you are penniless. This dream, however, does not hold as validity as it used to. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sharply criticizes a materialistic society by juxtaposing the lavish lifestyle of Gatsby and the more commonplace existence of the character of Nick, illustrating the decline of the American Dream.Along with his current extravagant living arrangements, Gatsby's original rise to fortune also contributes to Fitzgerald's social criticism. Gatsby is first introduced as what may seem to be the paragon of American prosperity--living in complete and utter opulence. However, as the novel progresses, it is revealed that Gatsby, in an attempt to win the heart of Daisy, had become prosperous by bootlegging alcohol and by trading stolen securities. Prosperity is the epitome of what the American Dream can amount to, and, while most accomplish their objectives through hard work and integrity, Gatsby illegally finds his way around to immediately gain that elite status. Fitzgerald illustrates Gatsby's illegal rise to fortune as a reflection of the American mindset of that time, sharply criticizing society of cheating its way towards fortune. Nick advocates Fitzgerald's beliefs of American society through his judgment of the higher class. Nick is always the bystander of the social scene, as he is Gatsby's neighbor and watches the festivities from his own home, suggesting him to be more of the everyman than the decorated man. It is Nick who notices the socialites are ruthless in their undertakings to attain fortune, and it is also Nick who criticizes them for it, asserting that it is their doing that the American Dream has diminished in integrity. Gatsby and Nick both characterize the common American mindset of the 1920s. Where Gatsby is depicted as the end result, however, Nick is more of the everyman who judges socialites for their lavish behavior and ultimately exposes the decline in the integrity of the American Dream.F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is often dubbed as the great American novel and has been considered a classic for many generations. After reading it, I can surely see why. Many of the books that we are required to read for school are easily dull and hard to interpret. The Great Gatsby, however, is an interesting read and more importantly, it is interesting to read again and again. While it can easily be deemed a period piece, reflecting upon 1920s society, the major theme of the novel can greatly be relevant to today's materialistic culture. I have always interpreted the American Dream as being the concept of working hard and doing whatever it takes to achieve prosperity. Perhaps now, you don't need to work hard. With corruption, politics, and immoral actions in today's society, many people only have their eyes on the prize, and not on what it takes to get there. Fitzgerald only saw the start of an ongoing downfall when he forecasted of the decline of the American Dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I won't repeat any of the previous rave reviews, but I will make a couple of suggestions for those struggling with this book.First, I've taught this book over 20 times, and find that with proper guidance most students can at least see the artistic mastery, if not appreciate the text.Second, if you are having difficulty with the text, try to draw some of the key scenes. Yes, sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and a box of crayons and sketch the following scenes: chapter one when Daisy and Jordan are sitting among the French windows, chapter two with the description of the Valley of the Ashes, and chapter three with the description of Gatsby's house. As you read continue to notice the way that colors and sunlight play a dominate role in the book.Third, read chapter 7 in one stretch and if possible assign roles to each speaker. I argue that this chapter is pretty much self-contained and could be considered a novella within the novel. There is more action, irony, and plain literary fun in these 50 odd pages than most longer novels.Fourth, if you still don't get the novel, AND if you are being forced to read this book for high school English, pick it up again once you turn 30 and have had life jade you a bit. I, too, didn't really get it until I hit 30 and could identify with Nick's thinning hair and ever diminishing list of single men to hang out with as we all speed onward towards death in the cooling twilight."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written book. Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the sheer magic of the writing. Fitzgerald spins sentences of such wonder, such clarity and honesty, that we are left to do nothing else but shake our head in amazement. Jay Gatsby may be a great mystery, he may be the Great American Dream personified, but if he sparkles, then the novel itself shines.Nick Carraway has decided, at twenty-nine to 'go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.' By chance, he finds a cheap house, a 'weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month' that is nestled amongst the huge mansions of the rich. He doesn't know it to begin with, but he is neighbours with Jay Gatsby, The Great Gatsby.Gatsby holds parties on the weekends, grand affairs of cocktails and party dresses, his house filled to the rafters with people, some invited, most not. He is endlessly hospitable, allowing his alcohol to be drunk, his food to be consumed, his pool, his books, his home - they are open to his guests. Guests, not friends.He is a mystery. Nobody knows why he has these parties, though everyone attends. Just as nobody knows how he made his money, or who he really is. Gatsby, when he enters Nick's world, refers to him and everyone as 'old sport', a distancing technique that is prevalent throughout the novel. 'It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.'But he is not completely unknowable, though the romantic beliefs about him are accurately held. No, Gatsby is more and less than the stories that surround him. He is in love, his mansion lies directly across from that of Nick's cousin, Daisy, an old flame he cannot let go. At her jetty a green light winks across the water, and it is this that Gatsby watches on lonely nights, nights which are filled with people who mean nothing, or nights he spends alone.Gatsby is mysterious and alluring while he remains unknown. When his love for Daisy is revealed, he becomes more known and less ethereal, his character growing from an enigma into a person. It adds warmth and humility to his personality, and is something beautiful. 'He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could 'come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.'But it is when Daisy 'becomes his' that Gatsby's character loses its shine and lowers to the ground. He is now a normal man, with the same strengths and weaknesses as everyone else. Perhaps there are more weaknesses - it is hard to consider cuckolding Tom Buchanan an admirable quality. Gatsby represents the dull, ordinary routine of a dream realised, that failed glow of actualised fantasy.Nick's presence in the story has its own plot, but it runs adjacent to Gatsby. Perhaps Fitzgerald's greatest inspiration was to make Nick a 'supposer', to remove Gatsby from the immediacy of intimate narration and make him the refracted imaginings of Nick. 'I am one of the few honest people I have ever known', Nick says of himself. But Gatsby isn't honest, so how can an honest man understand someone's whose life is built on fantasy and deceit? More importantly, can an honest man understand someone who exists - has created himself - out of a love that has fallen into the past? He can't, which is what makes Gatsby, and Nick, so interesting.Gatsby's love lies in the past. Fitzgerald refrains from sentimentalizing Gatsby as a younger man, but it is evident from the text that the sadness of his - our? - lives comes from an unwillingness to leave the past and live for today, or better yet, the future. Gatsby is sad and melancholy, a friendless man who wants a friend, an unloved man who wants to be loved. But can a man who only looks backward expect love or friendship in people that necessarily live in the now? He can expect it, but it won't happen. Romantic, yes. Fulfilled, never.Fitzgerald's writing is beautiful, both understated and grandiose, mellifluous in its gentle rhythms. 'On the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.'It is worth noting the quality of Tony Tanner's introduction in the Penguin Classic edition. He goes to some length to show that part of what makes The Great Gatsby such 'A classic, perhaps the supreme American novel' is what Fitzgerald cut out of the piece, not so much what he left in. He analyses passages in the first draft and their remains in the completed piece - it becomes clear that Gatsby can survive only as a mystery, with as little exposition as possible. So many times, what Fitzgerald cut was explanatory dialogue or comments from Gatsby, which would have dramatically weakened the piece. We cannot and should not know Gatsby, even when he becomes 'known' and explained by the text. He must remain a cipher, such that we can impress upon his impressionable facade anything at all that we wish. I say facade, because we cannot probe deeper into what Gatsby is. The Great American dream? Perhaps - but what is he, even with that? He's a mystery, and so is the dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As Americans, we have the God given right to be blond, blue-eyed, rich, beautiful and to get what we want when we want it. It's our Manifest Destiny. Gatsby knew that then. And, we know it now.Much like today, in the America of 1925 all things were possible. The country, having only recently been born yet again following its latest Baptism of Fire, was in its second or third childhood. As in previous reincarnations, progress was fast. The USA was now the most powerful country in the world. Women could vote. Negroes were driving their own cars. Radio, much like the printing press before it and the Internet after it, was providing access to whole new classes of people. Farmers in Iowa. Pennsylvania Coal Miners. Cowboys. Truckers. They all wanted their piece of the pie. And the pie was growing like wildfire. The stock market was setting record highs on a daily basis. Fully a third of the population was new immigrants. Joe Kennedy, the son of an Irish immigrant, was making his fortune running scotch into the US through Canada. Italian immigrant, Al Capone was getting even richer selling bootleg booze made right here in the good old USA. These newcomers proved that it was possible to get rich overnight. If they could do it, anyone could do it. Why, a poor man could even aspire to becoming president of the USA. Old Abe proved it was possible. In America, a man like Gatsby, if he had enough money, could even win over a Daisy Buchanan. It was possible."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby was a bootlegger and a penny stock hustler. He was \\"great\\" only in a delusive sense. Thus the title of Fitzgerald's celebrated novel is ironic, and that is something to keep in mind when reading it.But Gatsby is seen as a step above the tony East Egg society that lived in their plush estates across the Long Island sound from his nouveau riche mansion--at least that is the revelation that narrator Nick Carraway eventually comes to as we learn from his famous line, \\"They're a rotten crowd. You're worth the whole dam bunch put together.\\"It is ironic and proper that Daisy Buchanan, the wispy, languid and privileged beauty escapes blame for the tragedy near the end of the novel. It is her class that had always escaped blame, that had always lived on in its narrow-minded, greedy luxury. We can see their class--the Buchanans and their crowd--as Eloi-like children of the robber barons. Although Gatsby was dishonest and a criminal at least he had some gumption. And in the end we see he had some sense of integrity and courage as well.He is \\"great\\" then as compared to the listless, privileged people who had inherited much of the vast wealth that this young nation had accumulated during the westward expansion following the Civil War. Gatsby's failing and the failure in general of the rich was that they knew not what to do with their leisure and privilege. Gatsby threw lavish parties and affected an air of mystery while the Buchanans indulged in racist and class war philosophies while they pursued adulterous affairs and the mind-numbing qualities of drunkenness.When I first read this as a young man I thought it was a rather mediocre novel. The infidelities that so drove the story were commonplace to me at a time past mid-century, and I really missed the deep irony that Fitzgerald intended. The Great Gatsby was not \\"great,\\" that much was obvious; but that he was great relative to the Buchanan crowd was what I missed. He serves not only as the \\"up from poverty\\" character so often seen in Jazz Age and depression novels, but he is a more deeply realized character. Not a brutal man like most bootleg operatives, instead he is almost a dilettante bootlegger, yet a hugely successful one, so much so that hardly any of the details of his business now occupy him; indeed one of the reasons that I mistook his character upon a first reading is that the actual reality of the lifestyle of those who fed the speakeasies is not in the novel. Fitzgerald was more interested in the social life of the degenerates and how they looked upon social climbers like Jay Gatsby.Nick the modest narrator is in-between. An educated man of the upper middle class, a graduate of Yale, he represents the objectifying device in the novel. We see everything through his eyes and through his sensibilities. Initially in ambivalent admiration of both his cousin Daisy and Gatsby, Nick eventually becomes disillusioned with their differing but shallow lifestyles and their shallow values while he comes to realize that while Gatsby is a cut above, he is still a man with a tragically limited vision.In short, The Great Gatsby is an indictment of the Jazz Age and its easy money mentality with attendant moral corruption. Perhaps this is why it did not sell well when it was published in 1925--the jazz agers were not interested in self-portraits--but now has become a stable of American literature, and certainly Fitzgerald's most read and most celebrated novel.Fitzgerald the man may have borne witness to the excesses of the Roaring Twenties but he did not learn its lessons. He died young in Hollywood in 1940 of a heart attack, an alcoholic trying to write pot boilers for magazines and scripts for B movies. The tragedy of Jay Gatsby in some strange way may have foreshadowed the tragedy of F. Scott Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Like most of its current readers, I was exposed to \\"The Great Gatsby\\" through high school and college cirruculum and was impressed by both the way that it distinctly and vividly portrayed a certain time and place while still offering a timeless take on love, loss, hope, and human nature. It is a powerful story and one that stays with the reader long after the last page is turned. It deserves the praise it receives from academics and general readers alike for managing to seem highly relevant when it is read even in today's world, as the themes it touches on, universal and yet uniquely American, resonate as much today as they did when the book was first published."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is part of a four-volume series of books by F. S. Fitzgerald produced by this publisher; the other three being The Last Tycoon, This Side of Paradise, and Tender is the Night. The Great Gatsby is of course, the most famous of them all, and probably one of the most famous novels of American literature. Written before the economic growth post WWII brought riches to everyone, this book provided the American masses an in-depth glimpse of the lives and loves of the rich and famous. The book here revolves around Nick, his friend Jay Gatsby, the love of Gatsby's life, Daisy, and her shallow husband Tom. Gatsby rose from poverty to become incredibly rich thru means both scrupolous and not, and then spends his thoughts and energies pining after the beautiful Daisy. Every aspect of his life is devoted to enriching himself and/or his stature in the Long Island community he has transplanted himself into. All for naught are his efforts as the book ends.This book did not begin that American literary genre of books that critique the rich, but coming out at a similar time as Veblein's \\"Theory of the Leisure Class\\" this book is the perfect fictional complement to Veblein's nonfiction account of the rich and their vices. Here, in these pages we see the sins of alcoholism, adultery, pride, arrogance, jealousy, shallowness, and irresponsibility that are allowed by a wealthy lifestyle where much idle time allows for many dishonest thoughts. At first unpopular, this book eventually became the mainstay of classrooms that it now is. Hollywood and modern American literature has mimicked the themes and often storylines of this novel; think soap operas, the Kennedys, and Danielle Steele novels. Overall, the book is a classic, worth reading and having, though it does not get this reviewer's vote as the best book of American literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"+++++This interesting novel was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 to 1940). It takes place during \\"The Jazz Age,\\" a term Fitzgerald actually coined. This period of the early-to-mid-1920s \\"was an age of miracles...an age of art...an age of excess, and...an age of satire.\\"The novel is about Jay Gatsby (whose actual name was James Gatz), a newly wealthy Midwesterner-turned-Easterner who orders his life around one desire: to be reunited with Daisy Fay (she's now married and known as Daisy Buchanan), the love he lost five years earlier. His quest for the American Dream leads him from poverty to wealth and then into the arms of his beloved. By the end of the novel, we get to see the ugly side of the American Dream.There are many socially insightful themes evident in the story. Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.Something else that this novel is known for is its \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\" As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated. Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:\\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\\"This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author. The most helpful for me were the \\"explanatory notes\\" that explained key terms in the novel. Here is an example:\\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens. See map [that has the caption \\"Long Island: East Egg to Manhattan].\\"Finally another interesting thing about this particular book is that its cover (displayed above by Amazon) has the original dust cover that was on the first published novel. This is \\"the most celebrated--and widely disseminated--jacket art in twentieth century American literature.\\"In conclusion, be sure to read this engrossing novel to discover for yourself why \\"Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century!\\" As well, also discover why the social insight found in this novel is still highly relevant for the twenty-first century!!(first published 1925; this particular novel published 1996; 9 chapters; 175 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book has come back into the limelight in the post-Enron, post-Tyco, post-Refco, post-Worldcom, post-Adelphia world of ethicless business. Like the major rich characters in this novel, today's ruthless robber-barons, cheat on their wives, demean their employees, spend money lavishly on conspicuous consumption. But Gatsby never gave a million dollar party like the head of Tyco did.So much is similar: no one knows where the rich people's money is coming from. Everyone assumes there is something illegal about a few people having all the money and the poor people being pushed further into poverty. But, no one seems to be doing anything about it.When General Motors steps away from its commitment to employee pensions, and United Airlines, and IBM, this book becomes more and more contemporary. Even more so when executive pay rises in the double digits every year. Tom Buchannan, the adulterer in this classic, would fit right into today's business elite.Gatsby himself is mysterious at first, but his background in the First World War is revealed to be similar to that of many of today's veterans who returned from Vietnam, or Iraq, to find that the rules of business had changed, and for the most part, there was no effective enforcement.The real lesson of this book is that the wages of sin is death. Gatsby dies in a case of mistaken identity. His death is triggered by Buchannan's infidelity. This is a message America needs to hear.I had to read this book in high school. And I watched MTV, and the Dukes of Hazzard, and the Flintstones. But that was before Enron. I read this book again after the Internet bubble burst, just like the stock market imploded in 1929, shortly after this book was written, sweeping millions into poverty. And I read it a couple of times since Enron was looted for billions of dollars and sank into bankruptcy, leaving many of its employees without pensions or savings.I think it is a classic because, aside from little things, like air conditioning, which had not been invented yet, the book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.By the time this book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets. If they read the book during the depression they would have been happy that Gatsby got what was coming to him.What will you think of him?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" was an interesting book, about confused love, scandalous affairs, and gallant parties.

Though its language isn't as easy to follow as today's modern language is, the book still retains its clarity.Aside from its ability to enthrall, The Great Gatsby also addresses the American problem of superficiality and greed.

This copy includes the sections; &#65533;Forward&#65533;, &#65533;Preface&#65533;, &#65533;The Text of The Great Gatsby&#65533;, and &#65533;A Brief Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#65533; by Matthew J. Bruccoli, \\"Publisher's Afterword\\" by Charles Scribner III, and (very useful) &#65533;Explanatory Notes&#65533;, \\"Further Reading\\", and \\"Publisher's Note About the Author\\" in addition to the novel. The added material is useful and informative, providing the reader with welcome information on various aspects of both the author and book.The book is quite faithful to its time period, presenting a world uniquely of its own, a world content to be defined as the 1920s. There are many historical inclusions, creating an atmosphere of unexpected reality. The author also sticks to his thoughts concerning social matters, being sure to complete and keep up any attempted efforts in the area.The literary style is very involving, not giving a hint of boredom or disinterest in his work. His countless corrections and drafts prove their worth in the masterful storytelling ability of its conceiver through the work. However, Fitzgerald displays more than a few discrepancies regarding geographical and chronological matters. The style the contributing author, Bruccoli, presents conveys a sense of at least slight disinterest in the topic, damaging his rather valuable additions. Scribner presents a style that is slightly over praising, but does contribute meaningfully.The chronological and geographical discrepancies detract little from The Great Gatsby, as its true worth and meaning are presented in the lives and actions of the characters. In conclusion, The Great Gatsby is a very pleasurable read and deserves its classification of literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story about a group of characters that all see things in the wrong perspective. Gatsby, the main character, lives an illegal life for the love of a silly married rich girl named Daisy. Daisy thinks that ignorance will get women far in life. In my opinion she is pretty ignorant her self. Tom, Daisy's husband, thinks that money and power gives him the right to do what he wishes to do, including hit women and cheat on his wife with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is also married and hopes to one day live a glamorous life with Tom, but Tom is lying when he said he would leave his wife for Myrtle. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, is a depressed man that looks at life as though it were covered in ashes. The others live in West Egg also known as New York, the city of sin. These confused individuals all have one thing in common and that is that their outlook on life is all wrong.In the story I found that F. Scott Fitzgerald used colors to help express the characters. He did this by using the green light outside Gatsby's house to show that he had money; he used white dresses that Daisy, Daisy's daughter, and Jordan wore to show they were rich. The Valley of Ashes is a gray gloomy dark depressed place. The author did this to describe the setting more clearly to the reader. I enjoyed the color coordination in the book. The colors make this book more interesting and unique.The characters were overall selfish people that really did not care much about anyone else. Gatsby's love for Daisy clouds his mind and the facts that Daisy is married already and has a child. Their love affair could jeopardize Tom and Daisy's marriage and the daughter. Tom cheats on his wife regardless that there is a child involved. No one in the story really mentions anything about the welfare of the child. Everyone seems to be much too involved in other things. George just wants to up and leave so bad that he overlooks Myrtle's feelings. Myrtle hurts George to the point of depression, and won't even go to a church when his friend suggests it to him. Daisy leads Gatsby on, knowing that she can't and won't leave Tom. Nick's need to be friendly to everyone blinds him to the point were he can't prevent the tragedies that occur when it's possible to do so.If I could change one thing about the book The Great Gatsby it would be Gatsby's love for Daisy. The whole love thing between Gatsby and Daisy dose not make sense at all. I would change this because Gatsby's love for her leads to tragedy. Gatsby could have done better. Gatsby was a strange guy that did too much for too little. Gatsby let himself be taken for granted.I would recommend this book to anyone that is selfish or someone that looks at love, money, power, or dreaming as though this means everything in the world. These things may be good to have but, like in The Great Gatsby, too much can lead a person to his end. This is a book that made me really think about the consequences that result from selfish actions. This book has a great message about life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While in high school, a number of people prodded me to read The Great Gatsby and I never took their advice. Now that I'm in my freshman year of college, I've started taking a greater interest in reading and decided to finally pick up a copy to read and, I must say, I've been greatly satisfied.The Great Gatsby is an amazing book with a tragic character (Gatsby). F. Scott Fitzgerald has created a masterpiece by building up Gatsby as an incredibly successful man with one tragic flaw...his wealth and ambition is fueled by his love for Daisy.This is truly a great book and one that can definitely be read in just one sitting. I highly recommend you read it, if you haven't done so already."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby has been one of the most inspirational books to me. I have actually found it easier to find things fascinating after reading it. This is a great American novel about the \\"American Dream\\" and is one of the most real and thought provoking readings I've ever done. It ranges from romance to even some action that keeps you turning the page. This book is already considered a classic and though it may be slow moving in the beginning, you'll appreciate it once you get through the book and understand that the points that the author has made definitely provokes your mind to think about things in real life. To say the least, this book was inspirational to me and I see it more than a good read. It creates a fascination that not many authors can create. If you're looking for an inspiring book about the American Dream... look no further than \\"The Great Gatsby.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If you could pick any type of book, what kind of book would you like to read? Great Gatsby is a book that I would highly recommend to others. It maintains a readers interest, and also tends to be a thought-provoking book. The characters throughout the novel seemed to be almost as real people. With the plot fulfilling everything you could ask it to be, and with an unexpected twist. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald developed the novel thoroughly throughout the entire novel. The way in which he utilizes every aspect of the book to keep the attention of the audience is remarkable.As you can tell I admire the author's writing gift, with each and every character having characteristics that are possible to relate to people in real life situations. The main character was Nick Carraway, and he seems to be a very studious, and intelligent person. Along with this main character, the author added in many other characters to help makeup his cast. The main focus of the book was Nick's wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby. He is a mystery to many of the people around his area, and everyone wants to know, or find out about him. The other characters that the author develops are all of an authentic and credible nature. The writer explains each character with just the perfect amount of information, and in a way in which the reader can feel as if he understands how each character thinks.Along with the creative nature that he introduces, and maintains his characters throughout the story the author makes the plot thicken with wonderful ploys. The author made very unique descriptions of everything, no matter how large or small throughout the scheme of the novel. He manages to seduce your thoughts by keeping the story running through your mind, even after you sit the book down for a minute. This way of writing was very elaborate and tended to make an obvious impression on the reader.The author manages to keep the readers interests in the plot and develop the story very elaborately. Throughout the development of the book, there are new things being entered into your mind, which tend to keep you thinking. This makes the reader stay on his heals, and wonder what may occur next. Even until the end of the book you wonder what will occur next.I would definitely recommend this book to others. It will make you want to keep reading, and even think about the book after you put it down. This is the kind of book that will keep you coming back for more. I would give this book a try; who knows, you may even find a new favorite author."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As Hunter Thompson said about this book, read it and see &quot;how the big boys write.&quot; Fitzgerald had a tragic sense of the world that is always there behind the money and bright surfaces of his characters. His ability to convey this melancholy is nearly supernatural. What more can be said about this book? This is the writing of one of the greatest writers that ever lived. His talent was so great, not even his self-destructive nature could dim the light. His Jay Gatsby is still so classically American, and this novel is one for the space capsule."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I suppose we could go on forever telling you how great this story is.

It was poorly structured, the story is unclear and it is not very memorable. Its the type of book in which once you have read a chapter, you immediately forget what had just happened due to how dull and boring it is. When my yr.11 class whined to our teacher over how much we hated this book, she replied with &quot;This is english advanced..you're not going to read fun,interesting books in english advanced..you're going to read boring, old novels&quot; i don't recommend this book for people aged 17 and under, as there are better and more interesting books (for this age group) out there."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, codswallop. This is nothing more than a romantic tale of Fitzgerals's longing to be one of the moneyed aristocracy, some of those people who had been around for a while. Was he happy to have talent and wealth? No, he wanted to be up there on the hill with the rich. What a cop out.Scott Fitzgeralds said to Ernest Hemingway \\"the rich, you know they are different to you and I\\" Ernie replied \\"yes they've got more money\\" and I reckon just for once that old braggart Ernie had hit the nail on the head.So what does Fiztgerald do, he has his hero Gatsby mysteriously get some money but no that is not enough because he is not part of society and he can only look at his long lost loves window over the water. It's the dilemma of the untouchable in India the Commoner in England buts its nonsense. Its not American its just because Scott was a whoos. This is not literature its Mills and Boon.You know in your heart I'm right"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is perhaps the most boring book I've ever been forced to read. Each of the characters is dull and predictable; you can guess in the beginning what the end will be.

Makes me wish I'd pirated it instead of wasting my money."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"For years I have seen this book on every list of great, must-read books. I finally got around to it, and I was left confused and incredibly disappointed. At no point did I really care about any of the characters or the plot. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for something dramatic or enlightening to occur. Nothing ever happened that made me understand why so many critics, scholars, and avid readers adore this book. I am an educated woman and was an English major in college, so I don't think this book was \\"over my head.\\" I would gladly read Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Steinbeck, etc. over and over again, but I don't think I'll read Fitzgerald ever again! The Great Gatsby is an oxymoron because it is NOT great!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of those novels you hear about your entire life and finally get around to reading.What a bore.The stilted language is like trying muddle your way through Beowulf in Middle English.Save your money if you're just dying to read this book and get a used paperback version."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a fiction novel that took the world by storm. Nick, Jay Gatsby, Tom and Daisy Buchanan, Jordan a tangled mess of social relationships, some intended for love, some for friendships, others stemmed from old running love. Nick lives on West Egg, near the Gatsby mansion, Gatsby a man whom Nick comes to know well, as well as possible.Gatsby throws huge social gatherings that people come to even if not familiar with the man Gatsby himself. Nick goes to these gatherings and soon meets Gatsby and becomes friends of leisure. When reading of these lavish parties of Gatsby's F. Scott Fitzgerald makes you feel as though you have been there and wish to stay one second and leave the next by feelings of discomfort. But yet you will want to continue to read to see what is in store next.Gatsby throws these gatherings in hopes of meeting Daisy once again, for in the past they were lovers. Tom, who is Daisy's husband, is also Nick's old college buddy, is clueless of Gatsby's intentions with Daisy. Which Tom himself is not so faithful to Daisy. Nick agrees, not so whole heartedly, to help Gatsby and Daisy meet. As all of this falls into place Tom continues to see a mistress by the name of Mrs. Wilson, a woman who is married to a mechanic living in a dreary place. Meanwhile Nick starts to fall for a flirtatious and wildly mannered Ms. Jordan Baker. The parties continue to exist, and the company continues to fall into a social web of deceit and denial. As this all takes place you feel for Gatsby because of his longing for Daisy, but are struck by a weak appalling feeling for the way he seems to go about his business.As the story continues to fall into place some find true love, some find old love, while others find the truth. The plot thickens as a death occurs causing an uproar of suspension of motive and a scandalous cover up causing suspension and tension among the old acquaintances.F. Scott Fitzgerald throws twist and turns at you in this novel just when you think nothing else could happen. He has quite the talent for hooking a read and slowly reeling them in to feel every slight bump and jerk before reaching the shore, or the end. Which leads to another misfortunate death in the novel that was a great mistake, but yet made a great ending to a great novel that will have you intrigued from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I use this book as a college student for the course of \\"Critical Thinking Skill\\" . Easy to follow and to understand."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"awesome book, this is the best fiction work i have ever read, i highly recommend it. This work is about love lost and romantic tragedy. It really makes you feel for the main characters and the void in their hearts. If i saw the movie, i might just cry."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Somehow I missed having to read this in school, and perhaps that was a good thing. It seems that most times when books are assigned reading students are not always in a place where they can appreciate a novel. However, this true classic was one I could not put down! The language was brilliant and the characters well-developed and interesting.The story basically revolves around Daisy and Jay Gatsby, two people who met when they were very young at the close of WWI and fell in love. Unfortunately, Gatsby did not have the wealth that Daisy required for marriage and she married Tom Buchannan, a man obscenely wealthy - and spoiled to boot! Gatsby, rejected and heartbroken, invents himself anew and aquires the fortune he feels he needs to win Daisy. But he never acknowledges that time moves on and people change - and Daisy wasn't the woman he thought she was.None of the charcters in this book are very likeable, with the possible exception of the narrator. All are spoiled, rootless, careless, inconsiderate, and unconcerned with the consequences of their actions. Yet, all are tragic figures as well, and deeply unsettled.Reading through this novel, it is hard not to imagine F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't writing about himself or people he knew. It is hard not to place Zelda in the role of Daisy. And this makes the characters come to life in a huge way. It is so easy to become swept up in this story, to be on Long Island that summer in 1922, to be at the parties at Gatsby's house. A beautiful, tragic, and certainly classic novel!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When Fitzgerald wrote \\"Gatsby,\\" the Great Depression was still several years away. World War I, only a few years past, seemed already a vague memory to the men in the story. Parallels in Fitzgerald's and Gatsby's lives are not so subtle, and if \\"write what you know\\" is the best advice a writer can take, Fitzgerald here takes it and runs with it. Reading the book as a teenager, as many people do, left me with no particular feelings, but experiencing \\"Gatsby\\" again as a middle-aged man, I can more fully appreciate Fitzgerald's lyrical talent with words and the themes he explores. Loyalty, longing, and living for a dream that has, without your noticing, already slipped away. Frank Muller's wry narration gives just the right kind of touches to the many characters.This is part of the George Waters \\"re-experience the classics while commuting\\" series.George Waters"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"note: please read the actual book to fully experience before seeing this review (which might in some ways ruin the EXPERIENCE of the story for you) because this book is truly special in my view as a readerThe Great Gatsby, narated by Nick, a young man who moved into the West Egg (the place in Long Island for the \\"newly rich\\") from the Mid-West, about his next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby who represented \\"everything for which I [Nick] has a unaffected scorn\\" yet whose character is \\"nothing short of gorgeous.\\" Gatsby is the embodiment of the ideal American, wealthy, handsome, young, and a dreamer.While living in a house of luxury and hosting extravagant parties with hundreds of guests, Gatsby seeks a long unseen lover, Daisy, from his youth in the midwest before he went to the Great War (World War I). The idea of Daisy is represented throughout the first half of the book by a physically distant but emotionally near green light at the end of a dock across the lake outside of Gasby's house.When Gatsby finds out that Daisy is Nick's cousin, he proves himself to Nick and tells Nick his life story (which no one truly know and even from told from Gatsby's own mouth, can't be fully believed) for a favor from Nick to arrange a meeting between him and Daisy. Although Daisy, living in the East Egg (the wealthier side of Long Island), is married to a wealthy and mucho but cynical Tom with whom she already have a daughter, Gatsby nonetheless ignores the present and focuses more on making the past (a past with only he and Daisy) the future. Gatsby dwells in the past, the life he could have had with Daisy, and is focused on bringing it back while ignoring what is.Gatsby's image is in many ways, larger than life, and so are all his beliefs. His character is indeed gorgeous for its rarity and capacity. The great Gatsby, is a incredible young man who has the tangibles but wants the intangibles, who physically lives in the present but emotional lives in the past, and who dreams about the future while pursuing the past. Gatsby, his subtle but incredible character, opens a knew level of conscience and understanding towards the vast human nature and the world in general.The Great Gatsby, while showing several divisions and struggles of all the characters between society (the East Egg and the West Egg) and geography (the Midwest and the East), the core of the book, dreams, possibilies, freedom, and Gatsby who represents all, brings us all together. The book is nothing short of Great."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book & I felt the main ideas which were to be presented were quite interesting. I liked the fact that it was based upon the \\"american dream\\", and reading of the author's perception definitely was keeping my attention. Though I liked the book, I felt it was too long for the information that was to be given & could have been a lot shorter, getting to the climax quicker. It was a bit confusing at times because of the way the author presented it, going back and forth between one of the main characters lifestyle to his past lifestyle, explaining it along the way. Yet, I did respect the great deatil presented by the author F. Scott Fitzgerald considering it gave you a vast understanding of all the characters and the multiple settings described in the book. I am a sucker for love stories, so the idea of the main character, \\"Gatsby\\", doing all of this out of wanting his past relationship with his object of affection \\"Daisy\\" back, made me feel with him, and put myself in his shoes. This was another reason why I thought it was worth the many pages of description. It kept you wanting to read more in order to find out if he would get the girl or not. I would recommend this book to others being that I had a good time reading it, yet I did feel it is a bit biased. If you are not interested in the time period as well as the basis of again the \\"american dream\\", it may not keep your full attention. Otherwise, I do strongly suggest this book to others, it was a great read, and it really gets you thinking!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is a wise guy from New York in a time where dishonesty brought lots of prosperity. He and his counterpart, Meyer Wolfsheim, are involved with plans and schemes that the narrator, Nick Carraway, only can guess at. Gatsby, however, has an endless love for his ex-fiancee, Daisy. Daisy left him for Tom Buchanan, who is a superbly stuck-up jerk from Long Island.Each of the main characters, Gatsby, Nick, Tom and Daisy, are comparable to elements. Gatsby is Water, because he lives on the water and throughout the end of the book, it is constantly raining. Wind is related to Daisy because she seems ephemeral and untamable, flowing in and out of Gatsby's life. Nick can be paralleled to earth because he is steadfast in his beliefs and morals. The final element, fire, belongs to Tom because of his flaming temper and his tendency to explode at people. At times, the language of the book can be tough, but the pain is eased by the glossary of words and phrases in the back. I enjoyed this because of its nagging requirement to think and uncover and allude to God, the history of the world, and the beginning of the book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was not in the high school English class that had to read this book.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest works of our time. Fitzgerald's portrayal of the money, romance and scandal remains unmatched to this day. The story is about the lives of two men Nick Carraway, and Jay Gatsby, and their high class lifestyle back in the Jazz Age in New York. This tale about how Gatsby tries to rekindle the love that him and Daisy Buchanon, who happens to be married. once had. Being the story is not too predictable and keeps you wanting to know more, this is a great read.The greatest thing about The Gatsby is that it's not as long as an encyclopedia lokie some books; it's a fairly quick read. But none the less, it's a good book. You know it's good when I actually read the book, I hardly ever read anything! What separates this book from the other love stories and makes it a masterpiece is the way that it's not too conceptual or corny. On the other hand the book's also not as conservative, the storyline's like of a soap opera's. This book is great because it's relatable. In the book you can see the materialistic attitudes of America in the 1920', in how they were not evenable to see that their wealth will be short lived and though this is set in the 1920's New York, the same hopes and desires of the characters still applies today. The Great Gatsby is one book that everyone should read, because it's not boring and it's definitely not overrated like some other books. Everyone should pick up a copy of this book. It lives up to the hope."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book that I absolutly hated. I could never get in to this book. It was so slow and I could never pay attention.

Upon finishing the novel found myself contemplating who was driving whose car, who was kissing who, and who shot who. Then an incredible idea dawned on me:I couldn't give two $#!ts. The book is a confusing roller coaster ride of creepy behind the scenes love affairs, convoluted past relationships, and the inconsequential and oddly enough santimonious attractions to mysterious green lights,wealth, and a never ending desire for the ultimate twentieth century American ideal: A big house, a big wallet, and a big Rolls Royce in the driveway. Twenty pages from the end when I discovered that the old windbag Gatzby had been murdered (YES!!! I do take pleasure in ruining the ending to millions of eager readers out there), I closed the book and ended the worhtless drivel once and for all. All in all, I have to say that I don't take any shame in saying that the only satifaction I got from reading the book was when i found out that Gatzby is dead.

In fact, this book is a model of how NOT to tell a story.The tale itself is excellent; compact and full of surprises and irony. But it is submerged in such a wordy, tedious, self-absorbed monotone that the reader can only appreciate it in retrospect, when they have dragged it out of the muck, shaken it free of detritus and seen its bare form.Prose, be damned.

The language is vulgar and archaic, with words such as &#34;gay&#34; and &#34;excitement&#34; used completely erroneously. Fitzgerald could not even be bothered to spell gaiety correctly, though I suppose that is as much his editors' and publishers' fault as his own. This book was unpopular when it was written and is unpopular now, so why do we teach it in our schools? Do we really want our children to emulate ANY of the characters or &#34;virtues&#34; conveyed by this book? First, we have the main character, Nick Calloway, who is so spineless and passive that he doesn't speak up even when it would have saved Gatby's life. Next, we have Tom and Daisy Buchanan who are so out of touch with reality that they can't even realize how pathetic their marriage actually is. Last, but certainly not least, comes Jay Gatsby, also known as James Gats. Gatsby is living a seventeen-year-old's dream whichwould be fine, if he were seventeen rather than thirty, but is total folly at his age. Besides these few specific characters, the cast as a whole demonstrates a blatant disregard for laws big and small, from abolition to murder."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I hated this book with a passion.

My advice- don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Considered one of the best and most important books in English, Francis Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the few intellectual novels that are at the same time widely popular. The writer's vivid descriptions of the Jazz Age ranks as the best, and his language and character development can be understood by young and adult readers both.Published in 1925, this book has many events inspired by Fitzgerald wealthy life. The narrator --and one of the main characters--, Nick Carraway, like his creator, is a young man from Minnesota educated at an Ivy League School (Yale), who moves to New York after the war. At the same time, the main character, Jay Gatsby, also share many things in common with Fitzgerald. Both are young and sensitive, and, what is more interesting, is the fact that they have a very romanticized vision of wealth and love, and felt in love with a young woman when in a military camp in South.Nick starts his narrative telling that his readers an advice his father gave him, telling that when he feels like criticizing someone he should remember that he is not in a position of doing so, because he has had many advantages in his live. Beginning with that, it is sort of a disclaimer as if the writer is telling that in his narrative he is just portraying a story, rather than making judgments on the events and people. Smart movie -- since most of the novel reads like a big criticism against the lost of the American Dream, due to money and corruption.Nick is learn bond business, and lives in New York. He rents a house in the West Egg district. His neighbor seems to be wealthy and happy -- he is throwing parties in an everyday base. One day he goes to East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband. He meets young Jordan Baker, a young woman who claims to know his neighbor. He is Mr Gatsby. She also tells him that Tom has a lover.Days later, Jordan invites Nick for a meeting and tells him about Daisy and Gatsby. They used to date before the war. And now, the man wants that Nick and Jordan arrange a meeting for him and Daisy at Nick's. Once the couple meets again, the tragedy starts in the characters lives.By telling this American Tragedy -- and loss of American dream -- Nick is very contradictory. To begin with he is making judgments -- not following his father advices --alternating moments when he is very objective, and moments when he seems to give his own interpretation of the facts. What also has resonance in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the nostalgic tone adopted by the narrator. He seems to be telling about the end of a civilization that no longer exists, and at the same time he feels guilty for its destruction.On another point, Nick/Fitzgerald is criticizing the hollowness of the upper classes. This is the part when the book has a sociological --and not only literary-- interest. The West Egg citizens represent the noveau rich; while the East Egg ones are the aristocracy. The newly riches are vulgar and have no social grace or taste. Gatsby is his most effective example of that. But the aristocracy, on the other hand, lacks heart -- they don't care if hurt other people. Ironically Gatsby's best qualities (love and loyalty) are what lead him to the tragedy.\\"The Great Gastsby\\" is a very short and entertaining book. Written with beautiful language and extremely well characters. It is a passionate and unforgettable portray of a civilization that doesn't exist any longer -- like something gone with the wind."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't think &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a perfect novel, but it is better than most I have read. I enjoyed the story (in as much as a story of this kind can be enjoyed). Reccomended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel started out very slow and elongated a plot that beomes tedious to read. The pace picks up toward the middle and devolops a decent ending. I felt Fitzgerald could have been more manifest in the book's overall meaning and sumed up the general meaning in fewer words. This book is not all it's hyped up to be yet a decent novel. I might have enjoyed the book a little more if it hadn't been put up on such a high pedestal. If you decide to read this novel, dont go into it with high expectations. However the author does do a good job of tying the book up together in an organized fashion."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a classic novel which almost everyone has heard of. It is often read in English classes and sometimes read on one's own. If you like novels from this time period, the 1920's, this book is one you must read. But if you are like me and prefer modern novels, let me suggest not reading it. The plot is quite simple, a man who has finally made his fortune is attempting to win back the love of his former conquest who married to her station while he was on duty in the army. This man will do anything to impress his boyhood love and goes as far as moving close to her and living an extravagant life with many parties in the hopes she will come to one. She avoids him, either wittingly or unwittingly, and he is forced to seek help from her cousin, a mutual acquaintance. He ends up getting in the middle and it is all a big mess, but you will have to read the book to find out how it ends. Fitzgerald shows the time period very well in the materialistic and secular sense. The plot is very well thought out and the use of foreshadowing and symbolism is very evident as one reads. It is a good book to read if you are interested in the time period or in romances of the bizarre sort. Unfortunately, if neither of these things catch your eye, it isn't a great book to bother with. It is tedious and slow reading. If you prefer more action, or perhaps more of a mystery, let me suggest a modern book. Or if you simply like to read in plainer language with a faster flow, read something else. If you are planning on reading this for a class, read it. It is educational in the sense that one learns a good deal about the 1920's and symbolism from it. But otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In the beginning of the story,Nick Carraway is introduced. He has moved from the Midwest to New York to get rich becoming a stockbroker.This is talking about beauty and trust. I would recommend this book to a friend who enjoys soap opera- like drama. This story contains affairs and murders that are common in soap opera shows. ."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I think Fitzgerald has the smoothest-flowing prose in American fiction. That's why I got so absorbed in this book -- even though some of the characters are people I know I wouldn't especially like in real life. I found myself questioning myself &quot;Why are you continuing to read about these fatuous individuals? Do you really care what happens to them?&quot; But I couldn't put the book down. I felt I was right there, actually participating in the storied 1920's decade, albeit a certain slice of that famous decade (which many liken to the 1990's). That's the magic of good writing.While Great Gatsby brings a distant generation to you, today's young generation (or a certain slice of it) comes right to you in &quot;Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf&quot; by Asher Brauner. In a similar way, this book has a hero you don't especially like at first, but the whole story is so engaging and the humor is so charming that you can't put it down either."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought that the book was very interesting.

Portraying a mans obsetion and an olusion. The excesses and carelesness of the rich, delightful to read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a very smooth and entertaining book. A classic of twentieth-century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald carefully picks his words as he depicts the breathtaking and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his ventures and strong efforts to proclaim the love of the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. A tragedy that is melancholy but funny; light but insightful; and most of all, it's about something everyone can relate to: almost delusional kind of love that in the end, whether rightly or wrongly, robs life of all its purpose and vitality. Fitzgerald very eloquently writes a wonderful novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he includes in every sentence is admirable. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become part of the novel and associate with the characters; as well as be able to imagine the story and picture it perfectly down to the very last detail. His use of figurative language in this piece is what makes it flow and sound like poetry. He created somewhat fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can appeal to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing and one can run through the pages like the waves through the sea. The book is so entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Wouldn't read Fitzgerald after the obligatory HS Gatsby tour. Boring progressive high school teachers of course praise a \\"cautionary tale\\" that warns about the \\"meaninglessness\\" of the \\"American Dream\\" (progressive trademark attached to that phrase) as if there were a mass disorder everyone who doesn't subscribe to their pablum suffers from.Then, I read the short stories collected in Flappers and Philosophers and a couple of novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned. Well, Fitzgerald had quite the cool imagination. I tried to re-read Gatsby to see if my opinion had changed.Leave Gatsby to those who think The Catcher In The Rye is a great book. Catcher was written by a phony using the subjective voice of a phony adolescent surrounded by straw-phonies. Fitting choice of protagonist.Nick C. is not much of an improvement on Holden C.Fitzgerald can really write, so 2 stars. Read Flappers and Philosophers, This Side of Paradise or The Beautiful and Damned instead."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The author of The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzergerald. The theme of this novel is the declining of the American dream. The falling action of the story is a tragedy because the Gatsby, Wilson, and Myrtle Wilson die in the story. The setting of the story is in Long Island. West Egg and East Egg, which are both next to each other, are fictional places in the novel which are near New York City and are both separated from each other by a river. Nick Carraway, who is the main character of the story, narrates the story so well and is Gatsby's friend. A green light, which is in East Egg, can be seen from West Egg.In the plot, Nick drives to Daisy Buchanan's house in order to have dinner with Daisy Buchanan who lives with her husband, Tom, who is arrogant, and tall. Nick then drives to New York City with Tom and Myrtle, whose husband is George. They go to this party, which has a lot of people invited, in an apartment in New York City. After some time in the party, Tom punches her wife in the nose because her wife said that she would say Daisy a lot and because she was shouting when she said that. After many days, Gatsby sends a man to Nick's house in order to give him an invitation to Gatsby's party. The Owl Eyed man, who is a strange character, realizes that the books in Gatsby's library are real so he tells Nick and a few others that the book are real; however, Nick and the others probably don't believe that the books are real. After a long period in the novel, Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom go to New York City in order to go into a big building. After they leave the building, Daisy accidentally crashed her car into Myrtle Wilson who died at this time, so George Wilson, who loves her wife so much became angry at Jay Gatsby because he was in the car that hit her wife. At the end of the novel, Nick Carraway sits on the beach in West Egg staring at the light, which is in East Egg, on the other side of the river.There is a billboard in the story with a picture of a face of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg wearing glasses. The picture on the billboard is one of the symbols, which represents God staring down at the American people, in the story. Another symbol includes the valley of Ashes between West Egg and New York City. The valley of ashes represents the poor people. The green light is another symbol in the novel; it represents the Gatsby's hopes and dreams in the future.I believe the story is very interesting to read, so I would recommend others to read it. I enjoyed reading some parts of the novel very much such as when Gatsby told Nick Carraway about the accident between the yellow car and Myrtle Wilson and such as when Owl Eyes were talking about the books in Gatsby's library with Nick and his friends. George Wilson is a very interesting character because he is the only one that murders a person in the novel after getting angry after Tom tells George who killed his wife. Owl Eyes is also a very interesting character because he came to the funeral and Nick Carraway did not know that he would come to the funeral and because he crashed his car into another car. The wreck of his car was conspicuous to chauffeurs."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this in my tenth grade English class. Fitzgerald accurately describes the shallow and superficial Eastern culture during the roaring twenties in a style of writing comparable to no other author. A definite must read for all those fascinated with American history and culture following World War I. Easily the closest thing to the Great American Novel yet."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have to say, that as is the case with many regarded literary classics, Gatsby took awhile to grow on me. Four years in fact.As a junior in high school this was required reading. I remember reading it then, checking out opinions on it before getting around to it, and becoming somewhat excited with the conversation and debate that would inevitably follow the assignment. I found the novel then, in complete contrast to my opinion now, to be a completely boring and pointless read.Last year as a college sophmore I decided to give it another go. Enough time had passed where I forgot many of the details of the piece that it naturally seemed like a good idea for a quick read. The lingering first impression of Gatsby, along with the seemingly endless amount of opinions contrasting with my own, convinced me that this book was worth a second shot.Without getting into various personal (and probably subjective) interpretations on the many themes and symbols throughout, I simply have to say that I now regard it as one of the best books ever written. While the aforementioned aspects of literature (themes/symbols) play a large part in distinguishing this book from many others, for me it was the prose and the story itself. It's just too bad it took some personal growth and a bit more patience to finally appreciate it- I can't even go on about it because I loved it so much."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Melanie VelaAmerican Literature IIMs. KroneJune 2, 2005Book ReviewThe Great Gatsby is a fictional novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.It is a story of one man's desperate attempt at rekindling a past relationship with a beautiful woman named Daisy. She is a wealthy materialistic woman who, due to the difference of social classes, does not marry Gatsby, and while he is shipped off for war, marries a more wealthy man. The real conflict is set off when Nick Carraway, a distant cousin of Daisy comes to visit for the summer. He tries to help Gatsby win back Daisy, who has now become a very wealthy and popular man by throwing large extravagant parties. This leads to drama and conflictThis book is Fitzgerald's life in a couple hundred pages Fitzgerald is Gatsby in many ways. Gatsby moved to New York in hopes for fulfilling a dream and so too did Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald met and fell in love with a woman who would not marry him due to the fact that he had no money. He wins her over by becoming a famous author. The alcoholism that is portrayed in this play by the party guests reflects Fitzgerald who became a heavy drinker.The Great Gatsby was Fitzgerald's attempt at being remembered for a long time. It has always been his dream to be great. Gatsby was Gatz attempt at being great also. I think that is why Fitzgerald entitled his book The Great Gatsby, because Gatsby was supposed to be a great, popular guy who made something of himself. However, Gatsby wasn't great since everyone used him and his main goal to win over Daisy failed.This book was good in ways that the storyline was interesting and that the ending was very suspenseful. I also liked how Fitzgerald made the narrator a truthful and moral man as the narrator because it allowed the reader to trust that his details of the characters were right, and to trust his judgment which also allowed seeing the characteristics and personalities of each character. Fitzgerald's in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words. It at times did create the mood, but for the most part, it created a boring faade upon the reader. It was slow and the real action of the book occurred late.Overall, this book wasn't so good. I would not recommend the book to those who like action or drama in every page. The whole story was just one jumble of words that bored the reader page after page."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, a fiction novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a book about romance and the struggle to attain it. The main character and narrator Nick Carraway looks back on the romantic heartaches of Jay Gatsby. Gastby is a wealthy, white man in New York City who longs for the love he once had with Daisy. However, Daisy is married to another man, Tom Buchanan. The book centers around this love triangle and the materialistic society that wants to bask in Gastby's fortune. The mood of the book is very dark, pessimistic, and vapid as set by the purposelessness and carelessness of the wealthy and its tragic ending of both Myrtle and Gatsby. Only Nick Carraway's honest view of life breathes hope into the book's sense of tragedy.Personally, I found the book to be rather sad and depressing. Overall it was entertaining but you couldn't help feeling sorry for the character of Gatsby towards the end of the story. I disagree with how Tom and Daisy seemed to make a mess of people's lives, theirs included, to only leave and let other unfortunate people deal with the repurcussions of their mistakes. Daisy was a woman drawn to money and sophistication. And during the book states that she hopes her daughter grows up to be a beautiful fool, when in reality, Daisy was a fool herself. She constantly let men and their powers by money influence her love and because of this I came to resent her the most of all the characters. It didn't seem fair to me how she killed Myrtle and proceeded to live her life with Tom as if nothing had changed. And it astounded me how Tom could then lead Myrtle's husband, Wilson, to believe that it was Gatsby himself who had killed him. This book only taught me that the great love of money, power, and respect can influence people to do horrible things. This is something you tend to see more and more in society whether you're in the year 1920 or 2005."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a dramatic novel that deals with the aspirations and dreams of some people and the way they affect relationships with others. The book's theme is complex yet one that most people can relate to; hope, the passing of time, undying love. The novel takes place in early 1920's New York; normally looked at as a decadent period, where money and partying were ways of life for a generation of young people who knew no other way. Among this crowd stands a group of people (our main characters) who, despite not being susceptible to this way of life, are very much a part of it, and, in some cases, are trapped in by it.The novel is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway. Long a Midwesterner, he travels to New York in his late 20's to become a bonds dealer. He settles in the \\"West Egg\\" district of Long Island, which, in the fictional geography of the novel, is divided into two boroughs - West and East Egg. He is quickly drawn into the circles of anonymous parties thrown by faceless rich people. His only real contacts are his distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her racist, sexist husband, Tom Buchanan. He soon befriends his very mysterious \\"Trimalchio\\" (party host) neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and slowly but surely is caught in the middle of a drama fueled by broken dreams and sincere hope.Once used to the language and literary style of the book (which is very different from more modern writing) this book is very addictive. The imagery is beautiful; often, the very human characters say or do very memorable things, and the storyline is perfectly paced. And many of the issues the author mentions (but does not try to present explanations or solutions for) are still relevant today; class differences, lost love, alienation. And the fact that 80 years have passed since this period does not take you out of the story or dialogue; often, the situations in the book could just easily have happened today.Overall, The Great Gatsby is an excellent book, easily worth reading by anybody. It tells you a lot about the period it was written in, and even tells you more than the generalities often associated with this period; it probes that not everyone in the Roaring 20's were so willing to throw money out of their car windows and hop speakeasys; the characters in this book are struggling with problems in society many people are still struggling with today. I definitely recommend The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I especially enjoyed Fitzgerald's intricate portrayal of Jay Gatsby as the American hero, a self-made man who accomplishes the American dream of rising from \\"rags to riches,\\" but who is ultimately incomplete because the one thing for which he desires, Daisy, is unobtainable. Daisy is restricted by social conventions, duty towards her husband, and also by the death of Gatsby, and therefore can only remain elusive as a dream. The irony of expectations is not only reflected in Gatsby's story but also in the \\"boom and bust\\" consumerism and mass production of the Roaring Twenties. On the outside, the Roaring Twenties seemed like an endless age of consumption, wealth, and happiness characterized with an easy-going \\"get-rich-fast\\" mentality. However, corruption also flourished during this era. Prohibition heightened organized crime and introduced bootleggers and \\"speakeasies.\\" Anti-foreign sentiment ignited a new Ku Klux Klan. Union workers and farmers fell into poverty as the result of rising prices. On the outside, Gatsby seems to have it all: extravagant riches, elegant parties and friends, and happiness. However, on the inside, he is incomplete without the one whom he loves so dearly, Daisy. He searches in vain to obtain her as his own but she is ultimately outside his grasp. Fitzgerald weaves his own cynical views into the novel and gives a thorough examination into life in the 1920s, providing a realistic outlook for the reader. His intricate portrayal allowed me to experience the positive and negative effects of the 1920s without actually being there. I can easily see why The Great Gatsby has often been revered as the \\"classic American novel.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've never been a fan of books that most people tend to overlook as classic, yet this one is an exception. What's wonderous and sad about this book is that Gatsby is a human being. How can anyone compare Gatsby to a human being? He is a robot isn't he. After all, no human would exploit himself to the degree that Gatsby would. Yet it's part of the American culture and tradition to be a shameful exploiter in the first place. Think about all of the \\"me-tooers\\" that you've known in your life. It would be most disingenuous to \\"not\\" recognize anyone that exploits himself for profit. Yet Gatsby is the biggest exploiter of them all. He is the epitome of that \\"American Dream\\" He is that big fish in the school of fish. Fitzgerld writes so eloquently yet so tragically the life of one such \\"big fish\\" in this book. It is a part of capitalism to \\"at least\\" take notice to what the big fish are doing. Who in your lives represent the big fish. Is it the mass media? Is it Rush Limbaugh?All in all, when we end up reading the Great Gatsby we end up relating to some of the characters in the book. Maybe you're the \\"conservative\\" Tom Buchanan. Maybe you had a past affair with someone and would do \\"everything\\" to win her heart. Maybe you try to be like Nick. Although I'm not WASP, I end up relating to some of the characters in the book. I actually almost cried when Gatsby's father wrote the letter to Nick at the end explaining the dillemma his son was in. I felt Fitzgerald was doing a great public service by exploiting the true misery that wealth brings and how it corrupts the soul. In closing, this book has helped me adjust to American life and warrants me to read mor Fitzgerald books.P.S.

Fitzgerald (1896-1940). Fitzgerald's original purpose for writing was to become wealthy and to impress his new wife, Zelda Sayre. Soon after his first book was published, he realized that he liked writing so much, he would make it his life-long profession.The Great Gatsby is a book that tells us the way of life and love during the twenties. The book's main character, Nick Carraway tells of life, from his 30 year old male's perspective. Nick, living in the lower middle class, moved east to New York in search of riches, but what he finds, is an unexpected wealth that will change his view of life forever.Fitzgerald wrote this book to present the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age. The twenties marked the decade where the American economy, and status levels, peaked. The rich were very rich, and the poor, very poor. Fitzgerald compared and contrasted these two groups very well. I believe what enabled him to do this was that during his life-time, he experienced both being rich, and being poor. Throughout the book, Fitzgerald contrasts the rich and the poor's status level. Through Nick, he talks about how the rich were looked up to and the poor were looked down on, with the exception of Nick's very wealthy next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick admire's Mr. Gatsby, he tells us this by writing about him, &quot;He has an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.&quot; In the same way, Mr. Gatsby treats Nick like he treats everyone. He is able to see past status and money, and look straight into the heart. As the story continues, Nick becomes Mr. Gatsby's best, and only true friend.This book also illustrates the racism and rivalry between blacks and whites during this period. Nick tells us about this as he is driving in Mr. Gatsby's Rolls Royce. &quot;As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chachauffuer, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.&quot; Fitzgerald emphasized the race struggle many times during the book. One time, near the end, a fight breaks out over love. Jordan, exasperated at the immaturity of the two men, intently said, &quot;Come on, we're all white here!&quot;After Mr. Gatsby's death, Nick Carraway decided to travel back to his homeland in the west. As he was reflecting on the past few years, he suddenly realized that Mr. Gatsby had not only been a good freind, but also an excellent mentor. Mr. Gatsby had been trying to teach him by his example that money has little or nothing to do with wealth. Wealth comes from your heart, not your pocket.Though I thoroughly enjoyed the book, Fitzgerald's writing was very new to me. At times, it was confusing or did not seem complete. I must say however, Fitzgerald did an excellent job at answering all of the many questions that were brought up during this story. I now understand why his books were chosen to &quot;Speak for the 20's!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just dont get all the praise heaped on this book. There are some good passages, but in the end it left me sorely disappointed. Compared to Garcia Marquez or Proust just doesn't have a way with words. And shallow characters are given better treatment in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Despite its brilliant description of the American Jazz Age and its equally skilful characterisation, The Great Gatsby is primarily a novel of ideas. Underneath its simplistic overtones, lies a novel rich with both physical and symbolic action. Gatsby, the main character of the novel, is possessed by a magical fascination of wealth -- the substitution of attractive but false goals. In other words, he believes that youth (represented by his object of affection, Daisy) can be perpetually recaptured if one can merely make enough money. In this sense, Gatsby's vision is like the American dream itself. However, Nick, the narrator of the novel, is able to perceive and objectify Gatsby's idealism. He is capable of seeing clearly into the self-destructible nature of Gatsby's fascination. The novel's success is partially due to these two opposing sets of values and their clear, unambiguous nature. To fully appreciate this novel, I'd recommend reading scholarly critiques for a better understanding. You'd be surprised at how much this novel entails."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's prose style and tone are magnificent. He is a brilliant, unique writer in his use of language. If I were judging him on his use of language, it would be 5 stars, easy. His use of the language to me is as unique as Shakespeare, his narration as beautiful as Hemingway. But for plot development, oh the tragedy! His book begins slow (not too slow for those who like detail, though) and just as it builds to a climax--it ENDS! &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; has one of the most anticlimatic endings I've ever seen. Some books essentially have &quot;no ending,&quot; that is, no neat,tidy happily-ever-after ending. Those books don't bother me; their endings add to the emotional punch by leaving a sort of emptiness. But THIS book's ending was just hollow. It seemed that just as the book got exciting, it ended on a flat note. Here's my advice: for brilliant prose and truly original writing, in style and content, read Fitzgerald's &quot;This Side of Paradise.&quot; It has all of Fitzgerald's writing genius, but a fully developed storyline."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway having graduated from Yale and fought in World War I has returned home to find a job. Being unsettled, he decided to move to New York to learn the bond business. The novel opens early in the summer of 1922 in West Egg, Long Island, where Nick has rented a house and seems to be unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg. Next to his place, is the Gatsby's mansion. Shortly after his arrival, Nick travels across the Sound to the more fashionable East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy Buchannan and her husband, Tom, a hulking, imposing man whom Nick had known in college. While Nick is there, he meets a young woman golfer named Jordan Baker, whom Daisy wants Nick to be interested in. During dinner, the telephone rings, and when Tom and Daisy leave the room, Jordan informs Nick that the caller is Tom's woman from New York. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom's marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.As the summer continues, Nick turns his attention to his mysterious neighbor, who hosts weekly parties for the rich and fashionable. Upon Gatsby's invitation, Nick attends one of the extravagant gatherings. There, he bumps into Jordan Baker, as well as Gatsby himself. Gatsby, a gracious host, remains apart from his guest; more of an observer more than a participant. As the party winds down, Gatsby takes Jordan aside to speak privately. Jordan is greatly amazed by what she's learned from Gatsby.One day, Nick and Gatsby take a trip into the city and there Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, one of Gatsby's associates and Gatsby's link to organized crime. On that same day, while having tea with Jordan Baker, Nick learns the amazing story that Gatsby told her the night of his party. Gatsby, it appears, is in love with Daisy Buchannan. They met years earlier when he was in the army but could not be together because he did not yet have the means to support her. In the intervening years, Gatsby made his fortune, all with the goal of winning Daisy back. He bought his house so that he would be across the Sound from her and hosted the elaborate parties in the hopes that she would notice. It has come time for Gatsby to meet Daisy again, face-to-face, and so, through the intermediary of Jordan Baker, Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to his little house where Gatsby will show up unannounced.The day for the re-acquaintance of Gatsby and Daisy finally arrives. Gatsby makes sure that everything is perfectly prepared, and wants every detail to be perfect for his reunion with his lost love. When the two former lovers meet, their reunion is slightly nervous, but shortly, the two are again comfortable with each other.. Later on, the three move the party from Nick's house to Gatsby's, where he takes special delight in showing Daisy his meticulously decorated house and his impressive arrangement of belongings, as if demonstrating in a very tangible way just how far out of poverty he has traveled.When Nick, Jordan, and Tom take a drive one day, they discover that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom's lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle's husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then turns the gun on himself.After Gatsby's death, Nick is left to help prepare for his burial, only problem is that no one seems overly concerned with Gatsby's death. A telegram from Gatsby's father indicates he will be coming from Minnesota to bury his son. Gatsby's funeral hosts only Nick, Gatsby's father, a few servants, the postman, and the minister at his gravesite. Although Gatsby, during his lifetime held high popularity, at the time of his death, he was completely forgotten.Nick, after everything he has experienced, heads back home to the Midwest."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book was a spark not version of the book, and it did not state that ANYWHERE in the description of the book. i am highly disapointed because i now have to go out and buy the actual book. it was very a big disapointment. i will never buy something from amazon again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"AM I THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HATES THIS BOOK?!?!?!

Gatz is from a lower class Midwestern farming family who falls in love with the wealthy well bread Daisy. The two are unable to marry and live happily ever after as they are from vastly different backgrounds and social status. Gatz enlists in the military and upon the end of his service is befriended by a wealthy benefactor who employs him \\"in a vague personal capacity\\". Gatz's employment provides him the opportunity to see the world, and experience life on the other side of the social strata. His adventures allow him to reinvent himself and upon the death of his benefactor, Gatsby purchases a mansion on Long Island, near the now married Daisy, and begins the process of recapturing her favors.On Long Island, Gatsby is known for the lavish parties and ongoing entertaining at his mansion. The east coast rich and famous are regulars at his parties but no one knows the origins of his wealth or his family background. Unable to connect Gatsby to his riches, the socialites create their own version of who he is and where his money comes from. Meanwhile, Gatsby pursues a meeting with Daisy in an attempt to woo her from her marriage; now that he has attained the wealth that will certainly please her. Will the good guy get his girl . . . you'll have to read the book to find out.The story is narrated by Nick Cassaway, Daisy's cousin and Gatsby's neighbor. It's a brief story that's easily read but I'm not quite certain what makes it such a classic. The novel does depict the role that class and social status played in American culture during the early 1900 - and still - but I can't say this was a captivating or enlightening read.

This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities. I bet there really are professors out there who think that this is a daring, explosive novel.

While perfect reading for an english class, this book just doesn't have too much going for it for most contemporary readers. Fitzgerald stuffed as much symbolism as possible into such a short book, and gave us a pretty good picture of &quot;the roaring twenties,&quot; but it was overall pretty boring and pointless. I think that this, like The Catcher in the Rye, is one of those books where either you love it or you hate it.The ending to Gatsby was amazing, and really worked to fit the whole thing together, but for me the book itself was just a dreadful waste of time to read. I'd recommend skipping this one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is so good. It is a wonderful story of wealth, dreams and love."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Now I realize that most reviewers loved this book, but I just have to go with my instincts here. The book was boring. Plain and simple. None of the characters was really likeable, there was no great plot to speak of, and overall just dull in tone. Sure Fitzgerald is an accomplished writer and the novel is descriptively and grammatically great, but it takes more than that to make a classic. And sadly, this book fell far short.If you're a high school kid getting force fed this crap, you may emerge with a negative view of the book upon completion, which will mostly be greeted (from your teacher) with, \\"Well, you just didn't understand it.\\" A little inside info for you (from a teacher). Most educators teaching this are not necesarily doing so because they personally like the book, but because some genius decided Gatsby was a classic and needed to be shoved down the throat of every kid to graduate high school. But the teachers will pretend they like it and if you didn't enjoy it they'll say you just didn't get it. Oh no, I got it all right. I just wish I hadn't. So don't feel bad if you disliked the book. There's nothing wrong with you. And I completely agree.To be fair, the book isn't awful, so I gave it 2 stars. I guess my biggest beef with it is just how ubiquitous it is in public education. It seems every single high school kid has to read books like this just because someone said it was a classic. Meanwhile, ACTUAL classics like the Iliad, Odyssey, Inferno (and even a little exposure to the Bible wouldn't hurt) are left untouched because they're too old or not American. Gimme a break."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. in New York in 1925. The book is about the American Dream and the failure of the attempt to reach its illusionary goals, especially the Gatsby's. The attempt to capture the American Dream is central theme to many stories of all times. For Gatsby, the dream is that one can acquire love and happiness through wealth and power. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 - 1940) was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He was an American short-story writer and novelist. The Great Gatsby is considered as Fitzgerald's finest novel.The story was set in New York and Long Island in 1920's. Nick Carraway is a young man working as a bond broker in New York. He is used as the narrator throughout the story. Nick acts as an insider as well as an outsider. He eyes everything that is happening in between, but has no intention to interfere. I think he chooses not to lose anybody close to him in the story. This arrangement makes it easy for Fitzgerald to give the audience detailed inside information and to back out as an outsider as needed. The core character, Jay Gatsby, is a character that longs for the past. He devotes most of his adult life trying to recapture it and he finally pays his life as the price in his pursuit. When he was young in the military, Gatsby fell in love with the beautiful Daisy, but he could not marry her because of the difference in their social status. So he left her to acquire wealth. When he got the wealth legally or illegally, he moved near to Daisy, who has already married to another wealthy man, and threw extravagant parties every week hoping Daisy might show up one day at the party. Finally, he set up a meeting with Daisy through her cousin Nick. Fitzgerald uses Gatsby's personal dream to symbolize the larger American Dream where all have the opportunity to get what they want.Nick is a multi-functional character to the author. He uses Nick as the approach for Gatsby to Daisy. The author naturally arranges all these. Gatsby cannot accept that the past is gone and done with. Nick once attempts to show him the folly of his dream, but Gatsby innocently replies to Nick's assertion that the past cannot be relived. For Gatsby, his American Dream is not material possessions, although it may seem that way. He only comes into wealth to fulfill his Dream, Daisy.Gatsby believes that he is acting for good beyond his personal interest and that should guarantee success. However, he is terribly wrong. He is so determined and so blind that he would do anything to get Daisy, even covering her up for the fatal accident. His dream never comes about and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it. The idea of the American Dream still holds true in today's time, which is wealth, love, or fame. But one thing never changes about the American Dream. That is everyone desires something in life and strives to get it. Gatsby is a good example of pursuing the American Dream.A society naturally breaks up into various social groups over time. Members of the lower statuses constantly suppose that their problems can be solved if they gain enough wealth to reach the upper class. Fitzgerald believes in his story that many people interpret the American Dream as being this passage to high social status. They believe once reaching that point, they do not have to worry about money any more. Though, the American Dream involves more than the social and economic standings of an individual.It seems that the more Gatsby tries to obtain, the less he ends up with. The saddest part of Gatsby is the funeral, which symbolizes the ultimate failure of Gatsby to ever achieve what he has wanted. The women he loved and died for was not present. None of the people who frequented the parties over the summer showed up. Wolfsheim, whom Nick believed to be a close friend to Gatsby, refused to attend. The idealism conflicts with the materialism and is torn apart. However, it is his father who lives at the bottom of the society, who is the most natural and native person in the story, whom Gatsby has never mentioned about, finds his way to his son's mansion for the funeral. What greatness of a father's love is in contrast to the love that Gatsby died for? That is the love of eternity. The father loves his son no matter his son is rich or poor. At this moment, both the idealism and materialism are eclipsed by the truthfulness and naturalness. And that is why Nick was tired of the life there, the carelessness of the people, and the corruption of the society in the American East. He decided to head back to his origin, to the more natural and traditional American Mid-West.Gatsby possesses an extreme imbalance between the material and spiritual sides of himself. Fitzgerald uses him as a portrait of the ultimate failure of the American Dream in that individuals tend to believe wealth is everything. Maybe what Fitzgerald wants to say is that a nation cannot operate solely on materialism. The spirits of individuals are the true composition of a nation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Very disappointed in this book, which is supposed to be a classic.

Gatsby is fascinated by the beautiful, the rich, the flashy, and his goal in life becomes to be part of that world. At his core, Gatsby is deeply lonely and has no one with whom he can share his vision and his dreams. All around him disappoint him in the end."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word \\"love\\" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for the other characters. He always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again after that war. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. Disciples of Fortune,with a similar theme, is another inspirational book that I read with The Great Gatsby for the month. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Written for a generation that was brought up on Haratio Alger's formulaic juvenile novels, F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby\\" dispels the myth of the American Dream. If you want to read a rags-to-riches story with a happy ending, you had better read something by Jackie Collins. Jay Gatsby is a tragic antihero who rises from humble beginnings to flamboyant riches while chasing a single dream. Nick, the narrator, describes Gatsby as having an \\"extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in another person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\\" If money cold by everything, then Gatsby would have been the most fortunate of men. Unfortunately, his dream became an illusion. On Gatsby's deathbed, Nick ponders that Gatsby \\"paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\" The reality of the situation is that Gatsby is a man in love. His life was a concerted effort focused solely on winning Daisy back: acquiring wealth, buying the house across the bay, throwing his lavish parties, and befriending Nick.Gatsby is tragic because he, like everyone else, suffered from loneliness and wanted to experience authentic caring. He thought he found that in Daisy. He spent his life building wealth, mostly illicitly, in a misguided scheme to bring Daisy to him. Money was not his end but the means to his end. The people with money, represented by Tom and Daisy, do not care about authenticity or love: \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smash up things and creatures and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their mess for them.\\" In a classically tragic ending, death is abundant. Not just people, but dreams. Gatsby's image of Daisy that Gatsby built up is now completely dead. The reality fails to live up to his expectations. The reality of the situation is that Gatsby was a man in love with an image. While Gatsby concentrated all of his life on winning Daisy back, the nouveau riche could not see beyond their own enjoyment. Told with an eye for cynicism, The Great Gatsby is an American classic and beautifully written; any group of lines can be extracted and appreciated on their own merits. The message of the Great Gatsby is just as poignant today as it was in the Jazz age."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald explores social dynamics in The Great Gatsby. It's worth tracking the character development time and time again in order to better understand inter-and-intra-personal dilemmas. Fickle Daisy, egotistical Tom, and detached Jay allow a close up view of people that are in reality much different from their superficial appearance. Reading The Great Gatsby has trained me to recognize facades, and penetrate them, to realize better relationships with people I might otherwise have misunderstood. Much is made of the colors in the book, the environs, and the historical context, but I've found the greatest value in trying to relate to characters whose actions and images are polar. A good test of whether or not you've penetrated the facade is if the characters' actions start to seem logical from their standpoint. It took a second read for me to get to that point."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"For years, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has been my favorite book but this book has dethroned it. I found myself enjoying it for how each sentence was written as much as what the story was, that was being furthered by it. I enjoyed every part of it, though it would be difficult to become bored with such a work that is so short. Don't miss understand, I do not think it too short, but just right."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I pretty much had my mind made up about this book going into it. Having read numerous spoilers over the years (Gatsby is, after all, everywhere) and having just finished two depressingly weary previous novels of Fitzgerald, I was braced for another unredemptive drag through the dust with yet another hoard of hard-drinking, adulterous characters. And, in essence, that's exactly what it is. But there's more to this one than just that. I wasn't more than a chapter in before I could tell this was something different from anything else Fitzgerald had done. It's lighter, less self-indulgent, and as a result a much more piquant and incisive study of character and culture. A large part of its difference is the narrative voice, which is thankfully far away from the Avery and Anthony of his earlier novels. For once, we have a basically decent character objectively observing the crumbling of the immoral rich. It's not a book I would enjoy reading over and over again, but there is a magic here that makes me understand why it is so beloved."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"JUST MY OPINION.....While I do find the content of the book enjoyable,it has been somewhat agitating to read because too many times in the book,a sentence lacks commas thus making it difficult to quickly and clearly understandwhat the sentence is trying to express.For Example: About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed.While this one is pretty easy to understand, would it kill to put a comma between \\"o'clock\\" and \\"the\\"?So... \\"About three o'clock, the quality of Wilson's blah blah blah...\\"This is one of the hundreds of the problem in the book.Maybe it's just me, but this book could be a lot better with some copy-editing.

The narrator is Nick Carraway who lives next door to Gatsby on Long Island and is present for all the major moments in the affairs of his friends.It seemed odd to me that these people wanted Nick to witness their sordid conversations and assignations. The author seems to want to give Nick a romance of his own, but Nick's relationship with Jordan is never fleshed out. The focus is on Gatsby, a person I both disdained of and championed. He is rich and throws huge parties, but the people around him are hangers on who know nothing of him and enjoy spreading rumors about him in his home, while also eating his food and drinking his beverages. He cares nothing for these people and is only having the parties in order to draw his love to him. Sadly, when he needs them, these people do not come and he is alone.This is another classic which I found myself disappointed in. I expect that for books to become classics, there must be something remarkable about them, but I didn't find much to remark on with this book. It was not as difficult to adjust to the cadence and style of writing of this author and this era than other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really enjoyed reading Fitzgeralds Great Gatsby in class. I'd always heard of it but never actually read it so I'm glad we had to read it in english. The thing I enjoy most in a book is it's description, I like feeling like I'm actually there in the room with a character, and in Gatsby I was able to do just that. I love how detailed he is in describing the different locations they travel to and the people they meet.I liked how it exposed the corruption and manipulation that comes with the power of money. Well not to say that all people with large amounts of money are corrupt, because Fitzgeralds clearly showed that even Myrtle who was poor and lived in a shabby home can be just the same as the rich and spoiled. It just goes to show that money can make anybody do crazy and dumb things. Like Tom and Daisy for example, they're infinity for excitement lead to the death of three people and yet they were able to back away clean of any remorse because of there status in society. Also there is George who was the most innocent of them all but because of Tom and Daisy's carelessness was driven to become a \\"madman\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've read this book at three different stages of my life: when I was a teen, when I was making the transition into adulthood, and when I had an active social life in part of a club scene. Each time I read this book it had a different meaning, and I've enjoyed it more as I've aged. I swear, reading the descriptions of the gossips and drunken flappers was made relevant by my having to deal continuously with their modern counterparts. As for the book itself, it's a good story, and the ending is especially nice if you like feeling down after reading. It's a fine book, well worth picking up again when it's no longer \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It has been a while since I read a book in one sitting. It has also been a while since I first read \\"The Great Gatsby\\". Since then, I read articles and saw movies about F. Scott Fotzgerald and his wife Zelda. It is hard not to draw some similarities between Fitzgerald's best work and the way his own life ended. Without going thru the plot, this is all american story about difference between old money and new money. Not all rich are created equal. It is also a story of obsessive love that will not let go. Can a man love so much that getting rich in order to be close to the woman of his dreams can consume his entire life? How much does it take for a person to understand that one cannot live in the past? Love story is set in it's moment, time and place. Once any one of the components is not there, love is not the same or there is none at all left. And then of course, there is pure love and there is recklessness - way of using people and there emotions as means of reassuring ourselves - with always disasterous outcomes. This book talks about all of that in a way that feels like being said in one breath. Storytelling is so compelling and language so beautiful, you cannot put this book down until you are finished reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had forgotten how delightful and evocative this book is--or perhaps it just all went over my head back in high school.It has made me think of three things: devices that compel the reader forward, the way a story folds, unfolds, and reveals, and death in the novel.The thing that propels the book forward--the mysterious Gatsby--is introduced at the very beginning. Although this initial mystery does not take us to the end of the novel, nor is it even a particularly revelatory device, the mystery does get things going, giving Fitzgerald the space to lay out his characters, their place and time, and the voice of his narrator.Once we get to the bottom of the Gatsby mystery, once we learn Gatsby's history and motivation, the story continues to unfold. And the real telling of the story, the real events, surround the characters and their clashes with one another, with their desire and the things that either get in the way of their desire, or the things that the satiated desire reveals. And it is in this wanting and getting that the real story takes shape.And then I wonder about death in the novel. I suppose I wonder this because I just finished Moody's \\"Ice Storm\\" and I feel as though the death in that book was somehow unnecessary--not that I can imagine the novel completing itself without the death. In fact, I don't know what else would complete the book. But in the particular instance of Moody's novel, the death seems too convenient. Even in Gatsby, death comes not in the messy, senseless way of real life, but in the meaningful (if only for the protagonist) way of fiction. But of course, that it exactly what it is."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This story is by far the greatest piece or fiction ever by an American writer. I am a high school English teacher and as such have read many novels, none however, compare to this work.The characters are interesting, they come alive off the page. The story is compelling, so much so that you will be tempted to read the book cover to cover in one day. It also made a great movie.This book will stick with you for years to come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; may at first glance seem to be merely a book on the idle rich in New York. They hold parties, get into arguments, become unhappy in love, and unhappy in life in general. However, in the end, one feels sorry for these tragic characters who represent not only the small group of people who they are, but everyone. They are all of us, searching for what makes us feel complete, whatever that may be. We too wonder at the green light that glimmers off in the distance that we just can't reach."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have to agree with Mr Vogt (2/15). The negative reviews make me question the quality of the books that people read these days. The lyrical quality and economy of the writing are enough to make The Great Gatsby worth reading. And Fitzgerald's commentary on the &quot;American dream&quot; through the ironies of Gatsby's journey and ultimate fate really resonated with me. And the last two paragraphs....wow!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Perhaps one of the best works of the early 20th century, it is the epitome of all that was the Jazz Age. Fabulous wealth, extravagance, and romance. Still, the characters, especially Nick, seemed a bit 2-dimensional at times, and I personally wished that I could know more about them. Still, the book is a work of art and displays a powerful message, that there is no American Dream. None of the characters ever succeed to attain what they desire, due to personal failings or external forces. An essential read, but a hundred extra pages would have made it a near-perfect book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After reading many other classics, i found this one to be surprisingly not boring! This is one of the best books i have ever read. The style of the piece is great. The novel is concise and very straightforward. I really enjoyed it and i hope that you will try it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Many feel that Fitzgerald's best, and in some cases only, quality is his beautifully written prose. While this is indeed one of his amazing features the hope and optimism he touches upon in his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, is even greater. In this case the master author uses a society, his society, steeped in cynicism and hedonism, full of careless people who break things; yet shows us true flawless beauty and hope. To this reader's eyes The Great Gatsby is no tragedy at all, but instead a treatise on the nature of hope.&quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--&quot; And after experiencing such a wonderous work, this humbled reader also sees his green light."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book written for romantics. It is a prime example of how greed can control and destroy lives. It is told from Nick Carryway's (Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's cousin)point of view. He is more of a spectator and observer than a part taker; this allows the reader to get a better understanding of what is taking place. It starts out slow and confusing, but once all of the scandals, parties, and affairs begin to take place there is no way the reader will be able to put it down. Jay Gatsby is a poor army man when he falls in love with Daisy, and she is a wealthy woman that doesn't want to change her way of life when she falls in love with him. So she marries Tom Buchanan, a wealthy business man, that can provide her with the life style she wants; to Daisy money is everything. Gatsby decides to spend the rest of his life doing anything and everything to become rich and the kind of man Daisy wants. Once Gatsby and Daisy's lives begin to entwine several years later there is nothing to stop them--at least they think so. Every character goes through trials and heatache that cause the reader to get so emotionally involved that he feels as though he is there being a part of everything taking place. Everyone should read this book because it contains mystery, love, death, and betrayal; all of the concepts that make a novel truely interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"We all are attracted to glamor;some of us live in the past. We can all learn things from this book; like, how corrosive money can be, when love is gone we should move on, and that we all live some kind of misguided life. It's the book Bret Easton Ellis, Tom Woolf, et al, have always tried to write but never managed to come remotely close to. That's why, dear readers, it's still with us today. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Ernest Hemingway, who had a lifelong love-hate relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald once described Scott's talent as &quot;perfect and delicate as the wings of a butterfly.&quot; Yes, and that is what the lucky readers get in The Great Gatsby:that wonderful, exhilerating, lyrical delicacy shadowed by tragedy. I keep re-reading this book. It contains four or five of my favorite scenes in all literature: the scene of Daisy on the couch in the cottage with the breeze billowing her dress; the car accident at the party when we glimpse this dancing shoe emerging from the car; the great passage about &quot;those thrilling, returning trains of my youth&quot; and the scene where they're getting drunk in the hotel. There has never been a better, more subtly written drunk scene. Many have called Gatsby the best American novel of the century. It's not hard to see why. It's got everything in it. And it still stands, fresher than ever, as the great sad story of the American Dream gone sour."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I can only attempt to redeem the view many earlier readers on this board held of The Great Gatsby. This book is a classic and has been so well loved for so long by most types of people because it's so very easy to read. Fitzgerald has quite a lucid prose style; he's not a minimalist like his friend Hemingway but he keeps his writing concise. Gatsby can be read very easily by the skilled reader; I'm fifteen years old- I read the book first when I was fourteen- and have read the book five times since then, sometimes in a matter of hours. If you want to read a book that's hard to get through, pick up D. H. Lawrence and Kafka (who are both masters of writing in their own right). It kind of makes me sad to see how illiterate many of my peers are- I'm not sure if it's our generation or just the adolescent's innate desire to COMPLAIN constantly. But Gatsby is a work of art because of the way Fitzgerald turns the lives of these shallow people into an art form that flows easily into the reader's subconsious."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book interestingly enough tied right into F.Scott's real life story with his wife Zelda. He does such a great job explaining his version of the American dream, or nightmare if you will. His depiction of the roaring 20's and materialism left me a great catharsis of anger but also of sympathy towards Jay Gatsby. The whole novel ties into one idea and never leaves it for one moment. Even the words F.Scott used were &quot;full of money&quot; This book is almost like a commentary on the american people of that era and also the American Dream deferred. Great book, one of Fitzgerald's best."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grown in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer\\" (4)\\"When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness\\" (21)\\"The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world\\" (68)\\"It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.

The first: thick, tedious prose, tiny font, 800 pages of 18th, 19th century drama. The second: a theme so blatant it sits beating the reader on the head, neglecting the fact that stories still have things called a story. Most fall into one of those two situations--thick or preachy.Not Gatsby. Oh no. Gatsby falls into neither classic trap. You can read it in a day and enjoy yourself doing it. Actually, you can read it in a few hours and enjoy yourself just as much as if you were rereading The Hobbit or Harry Potter. Then, once you've finished, you look back and see, to your wonderment, how powerful and deep The Great Gatsby really is.And that is only part of Fitzgerald's success.The entire work is highly precise. Every word has its reason for being there. None are wasted. The themes are embedded in precise locations so as not to jump out at the reader and consequently distract them from the story.Speaking of the story, Fitzgerald does what many classical novelists fail to do--tell one. Fitzgerald told a story about this man, Gatsby, who invented himself. As a result, he told a story about following dreams, and ambition, and living life, and viewing life, and carelessness. But he told the story about Gatsby, and the people around him, first.In that way, he avoided theme device, and plot devices, and made for an impeccable, enjoyable, thought-provoking read. Thus, five stars from me for the best classic I have ever read, The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"+++++This interesting novel was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 to 1940). It takes place during \\"The Jazz Age,\\" a term Fitzgerald actually coined. This period of the early-to-mid-1920s \\"was an age of miracles...an age of art...an age of excess, and...an age of satire.\\"The novel is about Jay Gatsby (whose actual name was James Gatz), a newly wealthy Midwesterner-turned-Easterner who orders his life around one desire: to be reunited with Daisy Fay (she's now married and known as Daisy Buchanan), the love he lost five years earlier. His quest for the American Dream leads him from poverty to wealth and then into the arms of his beloved. By the end of the novel, we get to see the ugly side of the American Dream.There are many socially insightful themes evident in the story. Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.Something else that this novel is known for is its \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\" As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated. Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:\\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\\"This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author. The most helpful for me were the \\"explanatory notes\\" that explained key terms in the novel. Here is an example:\\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens. See map [that has the caption \\"Long Island: East Egg to Manhattan].\\"Finally another interesting thing about this particular book is that its cover (displayed above by Amazon, be sure to click on \\"see larger image\\") has the original dust cover that was on the first published novel. This is \\"the most celebrated--and widely disseminated--jacket art in twentieth century American literature.\\"In conclusion, be sure to read this engrossing novel to discover for yourself why \\"Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century!\\" As well, also discover why the social insight found in this novel is still highly relevant for the twenty-first century!!(first published 1925; this particular novel published 1999; 9 chapters; 180 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I enjoy reading about people and places in existance prior to my lifetime. This book offers the best read for insight into the aristocractic society in the 1920s. While I did not find the characters to be likable, I believe their story to be interesting and a likely sampling of that period of time in the cities of America. The novel is an easy, fast read and worth the time if you are interested in expanding your knowledge in Classic American Literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is F. Scott Fitzgerald's cynical take on the decline of the American Dream in the 1920s. Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Fitzgerald believed that Americans had become obsessed with the desire to accumulate great personal wealth, and that desire corrupted them. In \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" the title character tries to impress his lost love, Daisy, by throwing extravagant parties at his Long Island home every Saturday night. The reason why Daisy and Gatsby never got together in the first place was because they came from two very different social classes, which is why Gatsby eventually resorted to a life of crime in order to make enough money to capture Daisy's affections. Unfortunately for Gatsby, Daisy is nothing like the amazing woman he has built her up to be: she is selfish and shallow until the very end, and her actions ultimately end up costing Gatsby everything.The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's next-door neighbor. At first Nick is drawn in by all the glitz and glamour that the New York lifestyle has to offer, but eventually he becomes disgusted by the behavior of this so-called \\"elite\\" group of people. Nick also becomes involved with Jordan, a friend of Daisy's who comes across as being beautiful and charming one minute and then cold and unfeeling the next. In a way, Nick sometimes acts as Fitzgerald's voice in this novel, describing his bitterness about the lack of morality that is plaguing the nation. At the end of the novel, Nick has become so disenchanted by everything he has witnessed in New York over the course of a single summer that he decides to return to his home state of Minnesota, where life is much simpler and moral values are much more intact.I think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is just as relevant to today's world as it was when it was originally published. Fitzgerald's readers will have a lot to contemplate after they finish this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book's rating on Amazon has lowered significantly for the simple reason that generations of high school students have been forced to read it. Hence the young review below who hysterically complains, \\"it could have been shorter.\\"Simply put, it's not an adolescent's book. It's a novel about the tail end of youth, not the beginning. All the characters have reached a point in there lives where the party has begun to die, and find there is little waiting for them in the light of day. Thus they are perfect metaphors for the Jazz Age, for capitalism and America itself.It's also one of the most stunningly written love stories ever written, conveyed in a completely opaque manner. Fitzgerald expresses characters' relationships with little more than snapshots, gestures and tones of voice. The way that Daisy kisses Gatsby while her husband is in the other room. The way that the Bucahanans talk to each other in the kitchen of their house. It takes a brilliant writer to use such opacity to his advantage.Fitzgerald basically defined American tragedy with this novel. The mixture of ambition, romanticism and shame that constitute Gatsby make him perhaps the most archetypal tragic figure since Oedipus. It's simply a great book and nothing more."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What makes a good book good?I know what I think, but empirically, there should be some guidelines. So I googled, \\"What makes a good book good\\"...The very first result is a book here at Amazon called:How to Good-Bye Depression: If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday. Malarkey? or Effective Way? (Paperback)by Hiroyuki NishigakiGo ahead, google it yourself. I'll wait.And please read the two paragraph editorial review. I promise it will be the best thing you've read this week. There's just so much to love. Can we talk about that book instead?*At fourteen, The Great Gatsby was my first love.Twenty years later, it's still my favorite, perhaps though for different reasons.The central theme is simple--you can't recapture the past.What's also notable is how this story is so very American. Gatsby, the American archetype, was a poor man in love with a rich girl. Through whatever means he employed, he made a fortune. He reinvented himself and showed up again to win her heart.The idea of being able to be anyone you want to be, or being to change your life mid-course, is an (almost uniquely) American characteristic.Having money, though, is equated with moral flaws. Fitzgerald hammers the point home that people with money are careless: Careless about things and about other people.I vacillate between favorite characters. Usually it's a tie between the narrator, Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby himself. Gatsby is the modern tragic hero.If you haven't read it in a while, pick it up again. You might find something new to like about it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Someone much more read, much more important in the world of letters, and much more famous, was asked a simple question -- what is the greatest American novel that you have ever read? Without hesitation, this author of conceivably a few candidates for such an accolade, blurted out the answer -- and without any embarrassment or any second thoughts -- the book is \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" That person was Fitzgerald's friend and foe -- Ernest Hemingway.To any young person reading this book, I can only suggest that you swallow every word, understand that each is placed in a precise place for specific reasons. Tight --a term used by the 1920's meaning drunk and which Fitzgerald may have been much of the time while writing this novel -- describes the writing style of this classic. Nothing wasted. Nothing but pure and calculated prose delivering the reader with crisp, succinct and pithy portrayal of its characters and issues.I will not discuss the story. Hopefully, a new reader reads the book without reading others' interpretations. This is a classic. This is a great read. Take this book for a slow and enjoyable ride.You will finish the book, close the cover, and say to yourself what Hemingway probably said, \\"Now that's a novel.\\"And, like many other readers of this book, you may very likely open its covers again and again in your future. Good books entice you to read them over and over.His sales prove that the book has been read multiple times. It has sold more than 10 million copies. Selling over 10,000,000 copies is something which most writers dream of doing for all of their books in their entire career -- something which few can proclaim. This book meets that criteria by its one copyrighted version. Amazing.Sadly, this book today -- in the United States alone -- sells 1.66 books a MONTH for every book sold during the LIFETIME of Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald unfortunately never got to see his work appreciated the way it deserved/deserves to be. In some respects, Fitzgerald's career is as sad or sadder that the protaganist in his greatest novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I do think it is a very good example of what good construction of a novel is. That might be why people think it is a soap opera instead of being the solid writing that it is. The main difference between the soap opera and this is a soap opera doesn't really incorporate an opinion about it's characters although it does construct situations that are meant to reach the lowest common denomonator. In this story, as opposed to soap operas, it does have a cut off point where you can not notice certain details of the story that change the significance somewhat, mainly, Fitzgerald's opinion of his characters and how they play. There has never been a character in a soap that is portrayed in such a knowing way than the narrator. What's so interesting is how he can insinuate certain things about the main character with the words he says. I would be interested to see how little kids react to this book and how older people do because of children's tendency to take everything literally and older people's ability to see through the lies, or half-truths. It really is a good novel and I don't want to actually detail the plot because I want you to discover it without my introduction. I will give you the main character, though, the title character is named The Great Gatsby, but his real name is Gatz and he becomes an aquaintance of Nick, the main character who sees himself as objective and fair, and his cousin Daisy Buchanan who's married to Tom. That's all I'll tell you, read it and have fun, it's a short read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book for people ages 12 and up. It really captures life in the 1920's in a way that leaves you breathless. This book is not made for optimists; its ending is very depressing. This resolution, however, is needed in order for the reader to receive the full impact of what the author is trying to say. Fitzgerald does a remarkable job of using symbolism of many aspects of the book. It is the symbolism that really makes the book the great book it is. The only negative aspect of the book is the extensive vocabulary Fitzgerald uses in certain sections of the book. It is good to have juicy vocabulary in a novel, but the author just saturates his book with these vocabulary words. This takes away some of the interest in the reader, for they will spend some time pondering what the author was talking about. Overall, the Great Gatsby is a wonderful book for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is certainly one of the finest American novels there is, as pertinent today as it was when it arrived, if not moreso.

Nick becomes, well, disillusioned with the 'glamorous' life Daisy and Tom are leading, he realizes how shallow and corrupt they are. Gatsby isn't dull, he's a fascinating character study. Don't you see how he's trying to recreate the past, but can't? Even Daisy is full of symbolism- like the name. A daisy is white and pure looking, but on the inside (like Daisy) it is yellow- which stands for sickliness, corruption, etc. This is also a beautifully written book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was a study of the nature greed and ambition, and what they lead to.

Fitzgerald writes in the most crystalline prose, as somebody said, and if one is looking for something mesmerizingly well-written, this novel should be approached. However, I give it only four stars because eventhough I can relate to Nick Carraway's perception of Gatsby, and his opinion of him (his dream is very noble, and he lives in a fantasy world, never letting the outside world crush this), I'm still perturbed and annoyed by the rest of the characters. I will have to read it in another time, so as not to feel under AP pressure as I try to interpret/analyze it. Finally, I believe the story is moving once one remembers all those disgustingly superficial and supercilious people do have souls.When I started this book , the Jazz Age fascinated me, but now it kind of disgusts me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitgerald's Great Gatsby is truly a work of art. His use of figurative language in this piece is what makes it flow and sound like poetry. He builds the characters to the point where you feel you had met before. This is no easy task in a book that is under 200 pages long. Great book to have and read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Rich man Jay Gatsby has everything he could possible want, money beyond imagination, a waterfront house on long island sound, and parties at his mansion day and night. The one thing his life is missing is the one thing that he desires most-Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby tells the story of greedy upper class people who have only desire to get more and further distance themselves from the lower class. Jay Gatsby throws all his extravigant parties but has only one goal in mind-attracting Daisy. Her husband Tom is already wrapped up in an affair with low-life Myrtle. The Rich folks' treatment of each other and disregard for others is at the center of Fitgerald's novel. Other themes to look for are his use of weather to set the mood of the scenes, use of colors(especially yellow and green) to foreshadow upcoming events, and the disparity between the upper and lower class. I recommend this book to all young and old, as it is a classic read that everyone should experience at one point in their life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"About 20 years ago I decided I'd start reading some of the books which had been assigned to me in school, and which -- for any of a number of reasons -- I'd either never finished or never started. Gatsby was one of them, and is now one of my all-time favorite books. I re-read it about every 2 years, and always derive something new from it. It is truly a book of which the reader's perception will change as the reader evolves, and I recommend it to anyone over the age of 14."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book the Great Gatsby was a wonderful book it tells about one mans trouble and stuggle just to be with the women that he loves. Gatsby reinvented himself so that he could win back the heart that belonged to Daisy, who had married Tom Bucchanan when Gatsby left. gatsby thought that if he became rich that maybe he might get her back. Tom himself had not been all too faithful towards Daisy for he had another mistress. a fight explodes leaving Daisy all shoken up and she ends up doing something that Gatsby ends up taking the blame for. The end of the book is very tragic and leaves the one telling the story(Nick)with the loss of a friend,and the hostility of others.Don't miss this book about loss and tragic love."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Before I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\", I had no prior knowledge of its content. It seemed from the people that I talked with were either fascinated or disappointed with its' story line. So my thoughts were mixed about the author and what he wrote, however, once I read the book I was quite pleased with the story and its' narrator, Nick Carraway, and the experiences he had with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby.The book is essentially filled with love-hate relationships and suspenseful twists, which enlightened my curiosity page after page. It is no wonder that this book is being used in school curriculums as a required reading, for its material is interesting for many young minds because of its wide range of adventure, mystery, romance, and ambition within the book that kids can relate to in one aspect or another.Furthermore, upon reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I would recommend anyone with virtually any reading level to jump at the opportunity to read it, for not only is F. Scott Fitzgerald one of our finest writers, his book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an American classic, and also the book may enhance your perspective of what New York and its people were like in the nineteen twenties."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After having the coolest kid (Nate) referring it to me to read, I did. It was an absolutely astounding book. Aside from Perks of Being A Wallflower, the best book I've read. Even the film was wonderful. Almost exactly like the book, so that was great.It was pretty interesting to read the differences, I suppose, in society and such in contrast with today's. Definitely 5 star quality."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What more can be said about this extraordinary work? It truly has everything--the universal American themes of success and money, finely drawn characters, perhaps the most doomed love story ever written, and finally, a bitterly tragic ending.I first read this book over 30 years ago at a time when I was first discovering Fitzgerald's genius. However, I have since found myself coming back to it again and again. The mood Fitzgerald's words generate is like nothing else I've ever experienced in literature, with the possible exception of the writings of Isak Dinesen.In &quot;Gatsby&quot;, a sense of impending doom seems to loom over the entire story. Here you have a hero whose only goal in life is winning the love of a boundlessly shallow and self-centered woman who can never be worthy of his affections. Daisy's persona, combined with the world of money and carelessness that has produced her and her kind, can only lead to tragedy for Gatsby.A masterpiece ..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What a joy it has been to return to a book such as \\"The Great Gatsby\\" after an absence of thirty years. I last read this book as a teenager and, although I enjoyed it then, it is a real delight to an adult.In essence, the book outlines the life and lifestyle of Jay Gatsby who lived on Long Island near New York City in the 1920s. His background is shrouded in some mystery with various reports that he has been a killer, a bootlegger and a fixer of baseball's 1919 World Series. However, the key to his background is unrequited love for Daisy Buchanan who he knew at the time of the First World War and before he was sent away to France. Unfortunately, during his wartime absence, Daisy has married someone else and Gatsby is left yearning for her company. He throws vast and extravagant parties in the hope that Daisy might drop by and their love can be rekindled. His love rules his life as, across the water from his house, he can see the distant green light at the end of the pier at Daisy's home. This distant light epitomises his love for Daisy; it is far away yet still burning.Without wrecking the plot for those readers who may not be so familiar with the book, Gatsby's life ends with pain and misery and no renewal of love. In this sense, the book takes on the character of a Shakespearean tragedy.I can recommend this book to all readers of great fiction. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" has a timeless quality. It has endured for decades so far and will endure for many more to come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book is an American Classic, although my title most likely is not. I haven't even read any of the other reviews, but I would wager a large sum of money that at least one, if not serveral, contains the words American and classic.I have struggled long and hard and write a review for my all-time favorite book. I just never felt that I could do it justice. I doubt anyone really can. Part of the reason why I feel that this book is the American Classic is because it elevates American Literature to a level that few other novels can bring it.Just read the book and avoid the movie."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Some works of art are so engrained in our popular consciousness that it's almost impossible to judge them without the interference of all our collective baggage we bring as we approach them. Gatsby is a classic example. Having read the novel ten times over the last twenty years, I have enjoyed a certain distance and just as importantly the opportunity to compare different impressions at different stages of my life. The result is that I am even more impressed with the novel than all the annoying hype and commotion that continues to follow the novel would allow me to have. Without boring you about all the themes that have been hashed over and over, I would like to point out that there is a great question the novel asks us: Why does the narrator Nick have sympathy for Gatsby while loathing all the other chasers of the American Dream? It seems that Gatsby is a contradictory fellow, part ruthless dreamer zealously selling his soul to afford himself the trappings of fame, popularity, and glory. However, Gatsby, unlike the other ambitious characters in this novel, has a certain innocence and vulnerbility. Also, he is a true believer in his own delusion that if he can live a life a wealth and afford parties, he will overcome his childhood limitations and win the love of others. It's his craving of others' love that makes him sympathetic. In a way, he's a spiritual cousin of Citizen Kane who, for all his gaudy possessions, simply wanted the unconditional love represented by &quot;Rosebud&quot; on his sled, the embodiment of childhood belonging. Nick the narrator has the sensitivity to see this wounded child in Gatsby and reserves judgment against him.Gatsby's pathological hunger for attention and popularity reminds me of all the people who go on Reality TV shows, hoping to promote themselves and be seen by all, grabbing their fifteen minutes of fame even as they debase themselves in various types of tomfoolery that showcase America's blind ambition and back-stabbing competition. Many years earlier, Fitzgerald saw how dangerous it was to blindly embrace American images of success without self-knowledge and without a moral code to keep us sane and he wrote about this theme so elegantly in Gatsby, a masterpiece that transcends all our limiting preconceptions we bring to it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book in the world. However, I've not finished Tender Is The Night, yet. I've read Gatsby maybe three times, and am now working on my fourth. Each time I fall in love with a different character with thier faults. The book is simply gorgeous. Fitzgerald was a master, despite all his personal faults. I would recommend this to anyone who actually enjoys books. If you're going to read anything ever. First read the Bible, and then I recommend Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's not a type of book I would normally read. It's got a good story line, but it's from a time I'm not familiar with. Except for the narrator, the characters are a bit weak. The story is not really about Daisy and Jay, but how they impact on the narrator's life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Best American novel of all time. Better each time I read it. I will continue to read this book once a year because I find something new every time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Very good book well written. One I will reread. Not for children.

Jay Gatsby's realization of what Daisy has become is tragic. I want to yell at Tom, shake Daisy, tell Nick to do something more. When you can fall into the world of the story and think your voice is loud enough to change the inevitable, you've made something powerful.I'm sure a lot of people will watch the movie when it comes out.

Flowery language, moderately interesting story line. Skip the book, get the movie."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"May I throw a pebble into the pool? The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as a great novel and has been widely acclaimed as such, but having read through it twice I cannot agree. I am merely a well read person and lay no claims as to literary erudition but this book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing very adjectival with constant use of metaphors, some of which seemed trite and effeminate. In addition the story moves at a slow pace, particularly in the first half of the book where there is much description and virtually no action. Obviously Fitzgerald depicts the period of the early twenties with prohibition allowing quick acquisition of wealth, but the fact that Gatsby returned from military service penniless and alone makes his construction of such a huge fortune in a few years seem unbelievable, even in that era. Gatsby is the least believable character in this whole novel. For much of the time he is a shadowy figure moping around in his infatuation with a woman he was parted from for five years. His behaviour verges on that of a love-sick teenager rather than a war hero. Of course the book depicts the decadence of the wealthy during that period superbly and at times the prose is beautifully descriptive, but the \\"Great American Novel\\" ???"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The ending seems quite abrupt, but that's not necessarily bad. The only thing that annoys me about this book is that the protagonist doesn't seem to have much depth. All of the other characters in the book are much more fleshed-out than the first-person narrator and it bugged me that it felt a bit hollow.Still good though."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A classic is a classic is a classic. There's no disputing why people still read this great American novel, and I was moved this time around more than ever. I originally read this work in college, and only mildly \\"got it\\". Actually, I wondered what the fuss was all about, but maturity brings wisdom and reading this now, in middle age, makes all the difference. Actually, in today's terms, Gatsby is the 1 per cent. (Need I say, this read couldn't be more apt due to one of the presidential candidates?) The prototype could not be better. Both Gatsby and his wife, Daisy are so shallow, not minding the eventual fate that meets them. Of course, Nick Carraway is a great witness to that demise. Written in the 1920's, it proves classics remain this way for a reason: good story matters. Good characters matter. Only so many books today meet the test."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A little bloated; overrated classic.

I definately give it a perfect 10!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Much like Demian, by Herman Hesse, the Great Gatsby offers a very human story about a Man torn between the various pressures of life: conformity and individualism, facade and substance. Nick is a silent narrator, he watches, but he's not completely quiet. This novel may appear convoluted and confusing, but it is truly pure and honest. It makes no judgement of morality, grace and sin, nor does it favor idealism or cynicism. The main character wades through an insane and typical world, and outsider and a member. A paradoxical romp, The Great Gatsby explodes a realm of utter humanity, a thing few novels accomplish, although many try."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of my favorite books, and I have read it over and over. It's sad how Gatsby appeared to have everything he wanted, but in reality, the one thing he wanted (Daisy) was just out of his reach.

END"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"During my college years, I was forced to read The Great Gatsby, and I must say that I'm glad my professor chose to force this masterpiece on me. It is my all time favorite book. Fitzgerald's last three final paragraphs could stand alone by themselves and they would still be considered a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am now reading F.Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby for the fifth time. Each time that I read the work, it yields more gold. In many ways this novel is a metaphor for a failed American Dream; however, it is only one possible dream. I am not so cynical(yet) to believe that there is only one dream. Martin Luther King's dream of service to humanity is certainly a viable one that remains. Gatsby's only flaw was that he loved his mental projection of Daisy--his ideal woman. But the Daisy he loved and the real life Daisy were as different as night and day. The real Daisy was shallow,self-centered, and materialistic. Daisy could not love because Daisy was not really a person. Instead, she was a one-dimensional imitiation of a human being; her husband Tom is her male counter-part; neither one is a whole person. Yet, as Nick tells us &quot;They could always retreat into their money.&quot;In many ways, Gatsby has as much relevance today as it did for the twenties. In our super-materialistic, name brand society peolpe are brain-washed into pursuing Daisy-dreams of designer clothes, prestige cars and bigger, better houses.Maybe, Gatsby even has moral and ethical implications: To pursue the empty god of materialism(Daisy) is to choose death. &quot;Gatsby turned out alright in the end.&quot; At least, he found a reason to live and a reason to die(even if it was misguided).The Great Gatsby captures the emptiness of an American Dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A short book, a simple story, but Fitzgerald does things with the English language that few human beings have ever been able to do. This novel floats ethereally through the mind and settles in a place where it refuses to be dislodged. It is a pity that it is on almost every high school reading list because it is worth much more than the simple distaste that comes from most required reading. And what might be simple can also be classic. This is one of those books that resonates stronger and stronger with each succesive re-read. The movie (despite Robert Redford's presence) does the book absolutely no justice."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is certainly a period piece that pays tribute to the excess of the 1920s. But more importantly, Fitzgerald's writing style is an excellent model for fiction writers looking for examples on charcter development. The author's descriptions are vivid, enticing, brutally honest, and, as far as I'm concerned, flawless. A beautifully tragic book and a must-read for any serious scholar of American literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The setting of The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald plays an important role in the development of the novel. The unique way that Fitzgerald never refers to a specific year or era leaves it up for you to decide when you would like the novel to occur. Most people assume that the 1920's would be the most likely time period for the book to take place, but it is just as easy to say it took place in 1990. The way Fitzgerald did this leaves the book for the reader to enjoy as he or she so likes. Fitzgerald did, however, describe some of the setting. The West Egg and East Egg are perfect examples of this. He does not go into great depth to describe the shapes, colors, and proportions of these locations, but rather the characters surrounding them. During most of the book the characters you follow show you the atmosphere they are in, again leaving it up to the reader to chose how these places look. Fitzgerald's writing technique leaves it open for the reader to use their imagination more than any other book I have ever read. Usually when comparing a movie from a book I can think in my mind what I thought was similar and different. However, this book made it hard for me to disagree or agree with any of the scenes in the movie because Fitzgerald left it so wide open. Overall I think it was the best way to do it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"On the surface, this is a simple novel, not unlike many Romances-with-beauty-and-money. But the magic of the book resides in the depth of the context in which the story unfolds: the restless prosecution of money which characterizes Americans (in general), and which in this case would also buy love. It is a Romantic story in the strict sense of the concept.The novel evolves with agility, elegance, and freshness. Jay Gatsby is a new millionaire who desperately tries to recover his beloved girlfriend of old, now married to a bully and also millionaire man. The narrator is a neighbor of Gatsby, Nick, who is witness to Gatsby's efforts to reconquer Daisy Buchanan. Eventually the lovers reunite, but of course happiness lasts little, and the events unfold, as another reviewer has aptly put it, like a Greek tragedy. Social conventions impose themselves, and finally Realism triumphs over Romanticism. It all happens in the Twenties, when American society rapidly evolved towards the hedonism and materialism that characterizes much of it today. It is undeniably a great novel and it will last not just because it reflects neatly the American character, but because in the end it speaks to any manifestation of human nature. Say: back when you were a young person, and your loved one turned you down, didn't you dream of becoming rich and successful and THEN getting the girl (or boy)? How did it turn out?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is the story told from the view of Nick Carraway, who just moved from Minnesota to New York to learn about the business. His next door neighbor is a man named Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious man whom Nick meets at the party, which was held at Gatsbyfs residence. Nick learns that Gatsby has a lover, Daisy, who was married to Tom, and Gatsby asks Nick to help him. Nick holds a reunion at his house and Daisy sees Gatsby there, beginning their relationship.The story is set in New York and its during the 1920s. The title character, Gatsby is a wealthy man who earns his money through some criminal activities, and he does it only to make Daisy falls in love with him. He does anything to make Daisy his.The major problem in this novel is when Tom finds out the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby. Even though Tom is cheating on his wife, he becomes outraged on Daisy and Gatsby, and it leads to the end of the novel, tragedy.I recommend this book to those who like money, romance, and who wants to see the life style of the rich! People who like the classic genre would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at this novel. I had been meaning to read it for many years, and everything I had heard about it left me thinking that it was the great American novel and that Gatsby was a Svengali. I was surprised at how sympathetic (and rather pathetic) Gatsby turns out to be, I was also pleasantly surprised at the accessibility of the story itself. The writing however is a complete delight, the first person observations work well and the style is completely captivating and believable.None of the characters are completely sympathetic but nor are they outrageous.Overall an excellent, accessible read. Don't be put off by its \`classic' reputation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald was a writer who truly understood that &quot;writing is revision.&quot; The story of the Great Gatsby covers an era of decadence and lavish living that most of us can't imagine. But within the glitter and excitement, he weaves a tale of loves lost, struggles with personal demons and upward mobility. There are some descrepancies within the story but, beyond that, the writing is phenomonal.Fitzgerald takes the English language and plays with it, subtly. Giving us beautiful phrases and lingering images that were quite exciting in his day. As we live in an age of hurry up and hurry up, reading his work is a real pleasure. It's a fast read but you don't want to run through it. You must savor each word, the masterful phrasing, while enjoying this classic.I give it a thumbs up. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"THE GREAT GATSBY is one of those books that people either love or hate with no inbetweens. There are many who consider THE GREAT GATSBY to be the great American novel. I wouldn't go so far as to say that, but there is no question that it is a great book and a classic piece of American literature. The book evokes a particular time and place like very few writings can. The words in the novel flow together like cool water in a fresh-water mountain stream. However, what I find most amazing about THE GREAT GATSBY is that even though the novel doesn't have any truly redeeming characters and has a plot that is pointless and somewhat predictable, the story unwittingly sweeps the reader into the world in which it takes place so that before one realizes it, the story is over and the book is finished. Not very many stories can do that. It's not difficult to understand why Andy Kaufman loved this book so."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Need I say more? It seems inane to review The Great Gatsby because of its proverbial timelessness and consistent crowd of faithful readers, especially at my age and lack of literary experience, but it also seems blasphemous not to pay homage to Fitzgerald by indulging in his brillant novel. He intertwines the moral value of the rich vs. the poor in the early 1920's, and the general thematic virtues of life in an exceptional storyline. Fitzgerald tactfully constructs the plot throughout the majority of the novel, resulting in a crescendo of clashing characters and settings, but then slowly extinguishes the tension with a calming resolution. Several literary philosophies/movements are threaded throughout and it is an extraordinary read. I suggest it to anyone who likes classic literature or just books in general."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In general, I was pretty impressed with the movie version of The Great Gatsby (with Mira Sovergno-- sorry, don't know the spelling of that). There were, however a few moments within this picture that I was vaguely disappointed in.For one, a large portion of the acting was over the top and very unbelieveable. The man who played Gatsby is perfect in terms of appearance, but it is obvious that he has either never read the book, or that he had a misinterpretation of what Gatsby is like. He played him too cocky, and even when he tried to act unsure of himself, it still came off to arrogant. However, Gatsby wasn't the only character that I found myself displeased with. Jordan's appearance wasn't at all what I expected. I had personally pictured her as a longer haired blonde woman, and looking more sporty as well. In contrast, I believe that the people who played Nick and Tom were absolutely perfect. I was especially please with Nick-- he did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the character, and seemed to fit very well into a surprisingly nonchalant character. However, there were a few parts of this movie that was very impressed with.A major portion of the movie rendition of the Great Gatsby I was happy with was how true it stayed to the book. I found myself questioning if anything was changed at all, and I don't think that I found one single part, other than the fact that it had to be cut down in order to make into a movie. I know that this is a very hard task to accomplish, especially since so much happens in the book, and I was extremely pleased.In general, the combination of a good script and so-so acting made me have an overall neutral feeling for this movie. It was entertaining, but I obviousley enjoyed the book much more.Thank you, Mr. Mr, for making me read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Mr.M:The movie, The Great Gatsby was about a love...square was it?

Five years before the story takes place in the 1920s, Gatsby met a lady by the name of Daisy. They fell in love, but Gatsby had to got to war. Daisy couldn't wait for him, so she married Tom, a wealthy man, yet has been cheating on her with Myrtle. She is a lower class, rather fanatical women who is married to Wilson. This whole story about how money corrupts people and their loves, is told by the perspective of Nick, who becomes Gatsby's closest friend.The movie was very closely related to the book, even using some of the same dialogue in parts. Yet the book seems to have more foreshadowing than the movie. Events such as when the car crashes in front of Gatsby's house after a party of his is not included. The casting has its ups and downs as well. Characters such as Daisy and Gatsby shined in their performance. Daisy had a flowing, yet somewhat ditzy attribute about her that made her perfect for the role. Toby Stephens has a tricky role to play being Gatsby, yet he pulled off the ambitious, prosperous character. One character that was not cast correctly was Tom. In the book he is described as a huge, muscular man who is forceful and rough. Martin Donovan was not much larger than Gatsby, and did not have the stature of a football player.The director, Robert Markowitz, must have done his research on the 1920s, because even the music had its place. The jazz background music brought to life the scenes, which were all very colorful. Gatsby's house had rich colors, such as gold and red, to portray all the money he had. The dressed that the women wore were just right. Myrtle did not wear the type of dress that Daisy would have. This was right on because Myrtle was part of the lower working class, and Daisy was an upscale woman.All together, I was very impressed with the movie. It was closely related to the book, which would make it easy for one to understand, even if they hadn't read the book...yet. The movie kept my attention throughout the entire time I was watching it, it never became boring or repetitive. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has every had interests in well directed, suspenseful dramas with a bit of action."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Mr M's Movie Review: The Great GatsbyThe movie opens with the death of Gatsby and the falling of the precious cufflinks to the bottom of the swimming pool. About five years ago Gatsby loved and wanted to marry Daisy, but couldn't because he was too poor. Finally he has earned enough money, but Daisy is already married. The Great Gatsby is the story of upper-class society in the 1920s and the interactions between a group of people.Nick, played by Paul Rudd, was what I expected Nick to be like when I read the book. He was short which I think was supposed to show his unassertiveness and also he just looked controlled and exactly like the character I had read about before. Gatsby was played by Toby Stephens, who did a good job. The only thing I didn't like about his performance was that he reminded me of a really sleazy guy. When his smile turned to the side, he looked like he was trying to sell you a car or something. Overall I thought the cast was well chosen except for Gatsby because he seemed like a jerk.The movie seemed very accurate to book (themes, characters, symbolism, plot). It was really neat that when the two cars reached the setting of Myrtle's house that it was all dark and gray and colorless. This was a change from the bright colors the rich and symbolized the difference between the two classes. Another similarity involved the mood of the scenes. Most of them seemed to fit very well, like when Daisy cried over the shirts and was like a little kid touching all of Gatsby's possessions. This scene is supposed to give a feeling of materialism, and it's done very well. A major difference between the book and this movie is that at the begging of the movie it shows Gatsby being shot in his pool. I think the purpose of this was to get the movie of to a faster start before the introduction of the characters.One major problem with the movie was that it switched narrators about half way through. Instead of being from the perspective of Nick, it switched to Gatsby and Daisy's perspective during their affair. This is a little confusing because in the book Nick is informed about their relationship from other people, and that information is changed depending on who's telling it. By changing this part in the movie, it takes away a certain character development that is given through the way they talk to others.An aspect of the movie that really impressed me was the camera movement towards the end. Although seemingly insignificant, this detail can create different feelings depending on the quickness of the movement or how much waiting time is allowed. After Gatsby is shot the camera goes from his body to his killer, Wilson, to the police officer, to Nick, and finally to the sky. This sweeping movement gives the viewer a new piece of information every time it moves. Also, the scene was relatively calm and relaxed, as the event was an inevitable conclusion. I really liked the music of this movie. It seemed to enhance each scene by making some of them more dramatic or warning the viewer when something bad is about to happen. That's a quality that a movie can have that a book can't, it can use sound and visuals to bring the plot to a different level.Overall the Great Gatsby was a well-adapted movie of a book and used the extra senses to create feelings that weren't apparent before. The director's knowledge of the themes, moods and characters was obvious through the careful presentation and flowing scenes. One area in which this movie could have been better was some of the details like nick's perspective seemed a little different or untrue to the book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was a very good book that I'd heard quite a bit about,but I never had the chance to read it for whatever reason. Now that I've read it, I'm glad I did. The book did disappoint me a little; I wanted to know more about Mr. Gatsby. It was explained a little about how he got his money, but I wanted to know exactly how he got it. I guess it really doesn't matter, I was just curious.I found the beginning of the book a little slow, and I had a hard time staying interested. Once Mr. Gatsby was introduced I couldn't wait to continue reading. I don't really know why; I guess it\`s because he's the title character. He brought an excitement to the book that wasn't there before.I didn't really care for Daisy and Tom. They made me fairly angry, especially Daisy. It's like she doesn't care about anyone but herself, I can't stand that. Tom, on the other hand, is just a bully. He does what he wants to and doesn't care about the consequences or who is effected by his actions.I would have to say my favorite character is Mr. Wilson. I kind of feel sorry for him. His wife doesn't respect him and he loves her anyway. He shouldn't, and he probably wouldn't, love her if he knew everything about her. I like Mr. Wilson because he just does his thing at the station, and he lives his simple life. Meanwhile, his wife is out living like they're millionaires, which they are not.Overall, I really enjoyed the book quite a bit. It wasn't extremely exciting, but at the same time I couldn't put it down. I guess I just enjoyed the story even though I would have liked it to go more in depth in certain areas. I would definitely recommend it to someone else."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read The Great Gatsby while in high school. I thought it was wonderful at the time, but I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now that I've read it for the second time. The story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan enthralled me from beginning to end. Written during the Jazz Age, which is also the story's backdrop, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the tragic and decadent love story of an impoverished officer who seeks wealth in an attempt to woo Daisy. He also happens to want to obtain a respectable place in society. However, Gatsby's attempts to obtain both Daisy and richness beyond his wildest dreams backfire and he soon falls from grace in a poignant conclusion that brought tears to my eyes.Someone once asked me if I wanted to be like Jay Gatsby -- if I wanted to aspire to things beyond my means and want someone who will never be within my reach. And that is the reason why this novel touched me so much. It spoke to me. Gatsby is one of the most compelling characters ever written. And the love story is quite a sad one, but I think that that's what makes it memorable and special to me. And the fact that the story is narrated by a third character -- Nick Callaway -- makes the reader appreciate both sides of the coin, though Callaway is quite vocal about his own observations and prejudices. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true American classic. I have read it twice and will no doubt reread it at some stage in the future. I cannot recommend this American classic enough."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This story starts out relatively slow, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It tells the story of Jay Gatsby who tries to win back the love of Daisy Buchanan with his money. The story is narrated by Nick Carroway who views all aspects of the rich. Whether it's the front that Gatsby puts on or the deception between the Buchanan's, he views it all. The American Dream is the theme throughout this novel which seems to be what every character longs for. Overall I would definitely recommend this novel because many people could learn a valuable lesson that the \\"American Dream\\" is not all that its cracked up to be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Scott Fitzgerald has been showered with praise and celebrated as one of the great authors of the century, and deservedly so. His language is remarkable because he uses quite an extensive vocabulary with the utmost precision, and is able to create vivid characters with a few succint phrases, a few strokes of the artist's brush. However, there are two things that strike me as odd in this novel: the &quot;prologue&quot;, that is, the first few paragraphs, which must have been written after the rest of the novel had been completed. This is a strange and ambiguous opening, and I am not sure that it is very good. And secondly the ending itself, because closure is brought about by introducing an accident (Daisy running over Tom's mistress). Somehow this is not satisfactory, at least not to me, because it avoids a final confrontation between the characters. Here Fitzgerald may as well have sent down a bolt of lightning to kill someone! People's fates in literature should be decided by themselves or by some other character, not by something beyond anyone's control. Why? Because that negates that character is fate and action; in fact, EVERYTHING in a novel should stem from character."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was a great story about six or seven really messed up people whose lives' get thrown together. Inevitably, the story ends in tragedy. Really, the story centers around the main character's dream to find a relationship. This dream ended in adultery and murder. The character, Nick, from which the story is told from in the first person, gives this conclusion,\\"His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him....Gatsby believed in the (dream), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"In a sense, the story is a dark account of humanity's failure to achieve happiness in pleasure, relationships and money. In trying to achieve these things, mankind ruins lives. In the end, we find that the wealthy, popular Gatsby only has three people at his funeral. While the number of people at a funeral is not a marker of success or happiness in life, it does show that attempts at popularity, wealth and power does not add up to much in the end."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read the Great Gatsby for school in my junior year of high school and loved it.

Fitzgerald's prose is heartachingly lyrical, the story tawdry and the times legendary. I have read it thrice now and it only gets better.For those who want a basic plot sketch, here is my take:Wealthy man (a bootlegger?) Jay Gatsby moves into a mansion across the bay from his former lover and throws a continual party in hopes of winning her from her husband. The carnal excesses of the Jazz Age ensure that this won't end happily for anyone, including the seemingly detached narrator, Nick Carraway.Kids, skip the Cliff's Notes and just read this one. It's short and beautiful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The great Gatsby is a book about rich people and how there lives are not what they seem at all. it is told by a &quot;outsider&quot; Nick he is like the boy looking into the fish bowl and the fishes are the rich people Gatsby or daisy. it is very interesting and gives a good view of the 20's. i give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I consider this book to be the greatest American novel EVER. Don't take my word for it, however, read it for yourself. Even if you end up not liking it, I think everyone should at least read this book. I also think many people don't see the depth that there really is in this book. It's not just about love, or romance. It is the persuit of a dream, a dream that is not all that it seems. A dream that is represented through one character, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is an illusion. Read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It was a fast paced, thrilling ride through all the love and mistakes that we make. A brilliant novel by Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recently have had some time to sit down and enjoy the book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jay Gatsby, a rich man who is very into money, faces many tasks during this 1920's Jazz Age that he lives in. He is in love with a beautiful woman named Daisy Buchman. The two if them end up confessing their true love for each other. This book comes across a lot danger, suspense, love, and friendship scenes. It was a very interesting book that kept my interest all throughout the book, although the start of it was a little bit boring. I would recommend it to people that have read his past novels and to people above the age of 13 or 14 because some concepts are harder to grasp."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is the classic American novel; period. It tells the story of Gatsby, the dreamer, and his fall from the world of fantasy to the world of reality; two worlds that for him were one and the same. Gatsby stands for the dreamer in all men; that force which we must use yet restrain. He reminds that while it is imperative to dream, we must live in reality. This story tells not only of that philosophical message, but of adventures among the rich, and provides a commentary for the society of the Roaring 20's. No book ever written provides as much insight to human nature as the Great Gatsby, and no book that ever will be written will either."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Extremely enjoyable and intrically written novel. Gatsby a self made, yet pretentious, man tries to regain the love he lost. The problem is that he is in love with Daisy, a married woman and extremely shallow. His story is narrated by Nick Carrraway, the only truly virtuous charcter in the novel.Unfortunatley,Gatsby is no match for the old rich and is done-in by Daisy's husband Tom, a brutish oaf who exploits Daisy's shallowness to his own advantage. Gatsby's new wealth is no match for the power of old wealth and the hanger-ons that loved Gatsby's parties could care less about his demise.Fitzgerald's development of characters and plot is truly masterful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One of the best book I have ever read. A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A rich man, a middle class man, a tennis player, an adulterist, a confused freeloader of a wife, and story that involves them all in a toned down but twisted sort of way. At first glance this book seems to revolve around a love interest between Nick,(Our middle class man) and Daisy, (Our tennis player) while Gatsby (the extremely wealthy man) is our third party who's fancy parties help them together. But slowly this novel turns, and sends the reader into a situation where Nick Carraway is a third party in the Great Gatsby's life, and a love situation that will have the reader hooked....."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel's best point is Fitzgerald's writing style. Having such a light and lucid pen, Fitzgerald manages to describe scenes in such a way as to make them come to life. He is also very subtle in his use of sarcasm (mostly demonstrated through the narrators remarks on those around him). This ornate style is in contrast to the spare quality of the plot. Basically, the story follows Nick Carraway's involvement in the relationship between Jay Gatsby and his --Gatsby's-- long time love (who is a married woman). It plays out in a way that is very similar to Greek tragedies (imagine Oedipus Rex). However, simple this may sound, it plays out in an interesting way, and is somewhat refreshing when compared to the modern day four-plot-twist-per-book style of writing (not to say that there aren't good modern writers; there are, of course).Another interesting aspect of this book is the idea of wealth, or the idealization of wealth. All of the characters involved in this story are either bent on gaining, or flaunting money. Gatsby throws lavish parties, and drives around in a distinctive automobile. Nick is looking to earn a fortune in the supposedly limitless city of New York. Fitzgerald even lays down a sort of classist line (through Gatsby's lips, I believe): &quot;The rich get richer, and the poor get children.&quot; It follows that within the book there are thin, nearly invisible, lines drawn between all the characters of different classes.I would recomend this novel for anybody who is interested in clever writing. I'd also recomend this to anyone who's interested in the expatriot writers. For while Fitzgerald is in contrast to Hemingway, they almost seem to compliment each other in defining the time period. I would also recomend this to anybody who's interested in classic american literature, for it is very much a hallmark American story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm not an avid reader, but I absolutely adored Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'.

I thought this book was extremely well written and perfect for any literature class."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm a high school student who read this book by choice, as we must read several books of our own as part of our English class.I enjoyed this book tremendously. Fitzgerald has an amazing talent for drawing you into the worlds of the characters. The characters aren't especially deep but perhaps that's what makes them so intriguing. At first when introduced to them, especially Gatsby, you might think &quot; Oh how shallow&quot; but when examining yourself do some of the emotions not feel strangely familiar?This book is proof that money does nothing but create a world that covers pain with a nearly sheer curtain that can be ripped by raw emotions, revealing universal human desires, fears and mortality.I will definately read this book again, certain to discover more and more each time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Called \\"required reading\\" by so many people...it better be good right? If it isn't than why are so many children being forced to read it? The plot is none too exciting, in fact it's rather thin and stretched. For me, it was not the reason that I kept turning the pages--it was the amazing use of the English language that kept me going. For once I agree with the educators, who say this is an American classic that should be read by all students...not for the plot or even the characters but for the way F. Scott Fitzgerald uses language."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book full of ironies. Gatsby was great because he was pure in his pursuit of love, yet as the tragedy unfolds, he had to pay for his &quot;greatness.&quot; Fitzgerald cleverly depicted a whole range of characters who are your typical everyday people with slightly accelerated and dramatic events happening around them. After all the book is set in the Roaring 20's.Gatsby himself was the touchstone character. He provided the contrast to all the characters around him. As one party scene in the book presented, most people were phonies - yet, Gatsby remained uncontaminated. He pursued love. And his failure was Fitzgerald's condemn of the world in which the Roaring 20's was, or rather how it always is.When reading this book, you see the society, you see your own life, and you'll see the fireworks produced by the deft writing that only Fitzgerald brings. It has something for everyone. And you'll see your bit of world, though less glamorous, perhaps, is no less colorful than the one painted by the author."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Thanks for the book.It's nice to get the book that is so cheap.And the cover of the book is the same as this one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book during my sophomore year in High school, and just like any high school student I thought it was boring just from looking at it.

By epic I mean I didn't expect it.Truly after this book I was hooked on and recommend it to any. I do agree with my High school teacher, this book should be mandatory.

I find myself going back to it, rereading passages and discovering something new each time. I found the book totally relevant to our time; apparently decadence and ignorance are timeless human qualities. ; )As for the characters, they are tremendously engaging and presented in an un-heavyhanded way by Fitzgerald. They are almost like puzzles to be solved by the reader, in our own personal way.I myself have mixed feelings for them all. I don't trust any of them; least of all Nick, who as narrator definitely has an advantage in shaping our opinions of the other characters. His \\"are you or aren't you\\" engaged status is revealed at the beginning of the book, and led me to immediately take his musings with a grain of salt. His treatment of Jordan smacks of milque-toast-style hypocrisy as well. Consequently, his \\"you're better than all of them\\" claim to Gatsby doesn't win me over; I found Gatsby to be a rather unlikable and shallow fellow. Gatsby was clearly in over his head in courting Daisy, but continued to do it, full throttle. Real love, or pie-in-the-sky hubris? He admitted that the fact that Daisy was desired by so many other men made him want her even more. This, and his inability to accept that Daisy may have loved Tom at some point hints that he is not really a man in love with a real woman, but rather a shallow twit infatuated with an ideal. And to think, that having money is all that matters, and not how one makes it. . . again, is Gatsby a scoundrel, or just naive?I only wish the book could have been longer and more fleshed out, but its streamlined approach seems to be exactly what the author intended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Story of the great gatsby is very good.

I find that many don't age well but Gatsby was actually a great read. Fitzgerald captures the embodiment of an era in this superbly written book.The Good: F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is what makes this story. The story itself while interesting and having its share of twist and turns is successful because of its delivery. Written by most other authors this could have been bland and uninteresting. Fitzgerald's prose and his examination of this time period are where the real interest lies.The bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: A great read and worthy of the moniker \\"Classic\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have been slowly and fitfully working my way through the classic novels I last read in high school and college, in order to enjoy them without a term paper or final exam hanging over my head. In rereading The Great Gatsby, I was less concerned with the symbolic meaning of the gigantic eyes of T. J. Ecklesburg and more struck by the alien landscape of the ash field those eyes looked down upon. I was less worried about what the green light at the end of Daisy's dock meant exactly and just knocked down by the image of romantic futility painted by Gatsby waving his arms at that dock. In other words, I was more open to the experience of the novel as a great story, rather than great literature. I feel like Daisy and Tom, with their vapid shallowness and complete lack of compassion for other people, are as relevant representations of our culture today as they were of Fitzgerald's then. The American dream is still a powerful and myth that has not yet been debunked, and Gatsby could have been as easily victimized by it in the early 21st century as he was in the premiere age of the nouveau riche. The mark of a true classic is not that it is still being taught in college classrooms, but that it is still a recognizable and moving story decades after it was written."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Last night I turned to an old favorite, and another \\"school\\" classic - F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" This short but poignant novel paints a beautiful but macabre portrait of a period dripping in character, scandal, and self-involvement. Entirely unforgiving, Fitzgerald is faithful to his ideas and opinions, and shows no fear in humanizing his subjects. This is a novel that I am sure I will return to again and again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald had high hopes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" when it was published in 1925 -that were dashed by a tepid reception. The novel didn't have much critical support until the 1940s. Perhaps, in its own age, it hit too close to home with too much venom. Perhaps the Roaring Twenties, when liquor and money flowed freely, are romanticized in retrospect, and the novel's prevalence of casual dialogue gets more respect now. H.L. Mencken called it a \\"glorified anecdote\\", and, indeed, that is how \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is presented. The narrator recalls an experience he had among friends a couple of years earlier. As a story, there isn't much to it. It is how characters perceive one another, how they wish to be perceived, and the simpler and indifferent reality that comment on an age, as well as on the immutable social nature of humans.Nick Carraway, a man of prominent family who came East to do something vague with bonds, narrates the tale. Nick took a modest house on Long Island, next door to a magnificent mansion owned by Jay Gatsby, a man whom no one knows anything about, except that he throws magnificent parties with all manner of glamorous people in attendance, constantly, which people like just fine. Across the bay, Nick's second cousin Daisy Buchanan lives with her husband Tom, and it is at their home that Nick meets a professional golfer named Jordan Baker, whom he doesn't respect much but takes up with all the same. It is through a series of social gatherings that we get to know this group of people and that Nick eventually becomes friendly with his mysterious neighbor, Mr. Gatsby, who has plans to reclaim his long-lost love: Daisy Buchanan.It struck me that the prose is not very literary for a pre-War novel. The story unfolds in scenes and through dialogue. But it has a merciful brevity that I associate with that era. The lack of extraneous detail and background earned my admiration. Fitzgerald focuses on the interactions of the characters and ignores what goes on in between. This is one slice of their lives, the bitter slice that Nick remembers. It's interesting that it is Gatsby who evokes the readers' sympathy, even though we know little about him and Nick disapproves, though holds a begrudging admiration, of him. Amid the hypocrisy, ambition, and shallowness of these Jazz Age bon vivants, Gatsby is confident is his ability to re-do the past. But when Nick concludes that \\"we beat on...borne back ceaselessly into the past\\", he speaks of himself as much as of Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Although it is widely regarded as a novel about the delusiveness of the American dream, 'the Great Gatsby' is relevant to any post-modern time and place. The concept is such: people's desires and aspirations are, more often than not, founded in nothing but their own head. As, in this novel, Jay Gatsby pursues his first love, Daisy. He works his way out of the lower-class and, through crooked business, becomes wildly wealthy. Gatsby buys a large mansion on Long Island, directly across the water from Daisy and her new husband's, and throws fabulous parties for the socialites of New York in order to garner Daisy's attention. Even after discovering Daisy to be married, he never questions whether she still loves him, and he begins to pursue her, inevitably starting an affair.Gatsby is not in love with the real Daisy, he is in love with the idea of Daisy. He believes in the American dream that he can accomplish anything and does in fact accomplish great feats. But his dream is inflexible and not open to discussion. He is in love with a figment of his imagination; the dream of the beautiful young girl he fell in love with as a child. He clings to the hopes and dreams of his childhood which leads to inevitable tragedy. Although Daisy does care about Gatsby, she is essentially an unfeeling narcissistic person who cares more about her image and social standing than anything Gatsby could ever offer. Hardly the angelic creature that Gatsby so idealized throughout his life. Even after having these facts shoved in his face, Gatsby refuses to believe:\\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\"If you were to change a few specifics and locales, 'The Great Gatsby' could easily pass for a novel of our time. In fact, Fitzgerald is one of the first to so eloquently characterize a person like Gatsby; someone whose entire life is so completely a product of their society."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I didn't fully appreciate this in high school when it was required reading. Now that I am older I decided to read it again. This time I was able to absorb the book from an adult perspective. The story could be set in modern times, the language would be slightly less refined though. The characters were well developed, and their motivations were clear. It was an insightful read with a tragic feel throughout.Must read!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of my favorites because the prose is beautiful and the twists of the story are natural. So often authors kill off characters in an attempt to make the story more compelling and dramatic, but it comes across as unfitting and trite. Fitzgerald's seamless storytelling makes the climatic ending realistic and meaningful. He wastes no words even though he gives you a full visual image of everyone in the story. Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be read and studied for centuries.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"it is one of the most beautiful pages ever written. Although I recommend TGG to everyone and frequently give it as a gift, it's a shame that so many people are forced to read it in high school as that ruins it for a lot of folks; although I guess just as many people discover it through that forced feeding."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a novel about class and ambition, not true love. Gatsby is that rarest of Americans, a rags-to-riches self-made man. He worked his way up from poverty. But he isn't happy. Why? Because he did it all for Daisy, and yet the web of American society (a supposedly classless place) prevents him from ever having her. Thus he is tragic. Gatsby may be amoral, but why is he so? He was born poor but ambitious and then he became successful and it killed him. The very top is out of reach, even if you get there. It's a fool's game. If Gatsby were set in today's world he might aspire to be a Donald Trump-like character. The tragedy (and farce) of our society, which Fitzgerald realizes, is that Donald Trump was born rich.People who read this novel as a love story are missing the point. Gatsby is not in love, he is infatuated with Daisy because of what she represents. Many people confuse this with love (in literature and in life) but that is a terrible mistake."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Even though I have not gotten very far in the book, the quality of the book is brand new, it has a decent price, and it came in the mail just in a few days."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read this book about 25 years ago, it was great then and still great now. The excesses of the 20's have greater resonance now than they did in the 1980's.

It remains among my favorite books and I am looking forward to the movie.It is not a perfect book but it is a perfect story with an unforgettable character.

Fitzgerald skillfully exhibits his disgust with the patrons of the roaring twenties and their disgust for the up and coming &quot;bourgeoise.&quot; Not only that, The Great Gatsby is interesting! The shattered dream of Jay Gatsby is one of utter horror. It really makes you wonder what kind of society we live in!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Alright, as you can probably figure out, I wasn't so fond of Gatsby. I went in, as most high-schoolers do, forced to read and understand yet another \\"great\\" novel, one of the other classics, and steeled myself for the worst. 'This book can't be that bad', I thought. 'I mean, it's a classic. People the world over rave about it, it's been a top seller for the last couple decades. That has to mean something.'Now that I've read it through I find myself disappointed. Yeah, I understand that Gatsby is about the rise and fall of the American Dream and not getting caught up in the past and even how much our past affects our future. But other than that, to me it reads like a biography of Fitzgerald's life, with himself in the starring role. I mean, really: the young man who started life poor, who worked his way to the top and falls in love with a beautiful, rich, and not-all-there socialite who turns down his love in favor of a life of luxury. It doesn't seem surprising that this was written only a few years after his marriage to Zelda - who nearly did not marry him because he couldn't offer her the security and luxury of wealth! It disappointed me very much to think that this classic of literature is a loose story of FItzgerald's life. I understand writing what you know, and I've written enough to see the power of writing the stuff you understand, but that's just ridiculous.The language of this book doesn't really read like a true view of Nick Carroway, the supposed narrator - instead, to me it felt more like I was watching a home video shot over Nick's shoulder with Nick providing occasional narration. Fitzgerald over-characterizes certain characters, giving them true form and personality, almost to the point of nausea - in the first chapter alone he has dedicated an entire paragraph and a half to a description of how wonderful Daisy was and how men all over fell in love at the sight of her - and this is supposedly from the mouth of her cousin! I didn't get much of an inage of Tom either, but Gatsby you knew to the point of wanting to slap him every single time he said \\"old chap\\" because it just gets annoying. As for Wilson and his wife, the catalysts and the reason for the book's ending? Didn't get much of a description of them either.Fitzgerald's skill with emotion is supposed to be one of the reasons that this book is so well-known and loved. But the ending is the only bit that got a good reaction. I was disgusted by the rest of the story, and I hated it. He did have skill with emotion, he did make you connect with the story, but it is good to have such pure and total disgust of something?That's pretty much the sum total. If you want to really, really feel with a story, Gatsby can do it. Love it or hate it, you'll be at the extreme, I'm finding. If you want a story chronicling what is typically considered to be the American Dream and it's ups and downs, this book also is probably a good choice as well. But I would definetely not recommend it for reading outside of those two reasons, whether those be for school or work or just curiousity. If you want a good classic, read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer or Gone With The Wind or even The Odyssey or Iliad, but not this book.I hope this review helps somebody."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The prose is beautiful, which I did enjoy.

I enjoyed the way the book ended and it made me think about the events that lead up to it all.While it was a worthwhile read, there are a lot of other books I would recommend before this one, just a personal opinion."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book is a little pocket edition, not a full size book with the original art on the cover as I thought."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was chosen by a book club I belonged to. I had originally read it in high school (over 10 years ago), but at the time I thought it was so utterly boring that I couldn't keep up so I had no idea what was happening. I didn't remember anything except for the Green Light. Reading it now was definitely a different experience.I thought many of the characters were very shallow. Tom, Daisy, Jordan, even Gatsby. They were lounging rich folk with too much time and money on their hands. Even before I found out that this was set in a hot Long Island summer, i felt like they were so lazy. During the story NOT MUCH HAPPENS. A lot is revealed about the characters, but action wise, not much.We find out that Gatsby, is NOT so great, that Gatsby and Daisy loved each other at some point, we see a lot of drunk driving, and lavish parties, and the beautiful glitzy life of Roaring Twenties young rich Americans. We see no self-control, or depth.Even Nick Carroway, the narrator, turns out to be a VOID of a character. Rather then someone who takes action, he is the one whom actions happens to. He gets invited to a party, so he goes. He walks into a room and people talk to him, and he doesn't say much in return. People ask favors of him, but he never asks anything. He seems to be dully OKAY with everything, and have no strive for anything. He is a vessel through which secrets are revealed and are passed on, but he has no secrets of his own.Skimming the book after I read it, I see a lot of foreshadowing (which of course I had no idea when reading it the first time). For example, when Nick came to Tom and Daisy's house, and Daisy was lethargic and not talking to anyone until Nick mentioned he lived next door to Gatsby, then she started speaking. Also, when he was at the party, he heard rumors of Gatsby being a bootlegger, and later this also revealed to be true. A green light, for \\"go.\\"What this book does is splendidly, in flowery descriptive language, capture a snapshot of one sector of society during the 20's. You really get a feel for the clothing, the hair, the way they behaved themselves, the interactions between people, the music, and amusements. The word choice absolutely helped when reading - I was really able to capture the scene, moment, emotion behind something. Exquisite word choice by Fitzgerald.So, did I like the book? Not very. I liked the setting, the era, the language, but the characters were vapid, lacking emotion, initiative, or drive. And the more we find out about these people, the less you like them.I definitely don't think this book should be read in High School. So much of what happened was so minute that its easily missed by teenagers. This book can really only be absorbed by adult readers. Even so, if I didn't have it on audiobook I was probably have a hard time getting through it because it can get dull at times.I should probably mention that I listened to the Great Gatsby on Audiobook. Unabridged, performed by Tim Robbins on 6 CD's. The story itself was the first 5 CD's. The 6th CD were readings of letters that Fitzgerald wrote to his publisher about this book and other projects he was working on. They were interesting little insights into the author. Tim Robbins was a very good reader. They even threw in snippets of Jazz in the beginning and end of every disk, which was a nice touch. Of course, I also took out the hard copy from the library, which I skimmed for comparison.At the book discussion we all agreed that we would have liked to see two things: 1. A follow up to this story, after the great depression, to see what become of them and their money, and 2. an alternate ending - one in which Gatsby is ok. What then? Very curious."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"True it is a required read for 9th grade lit. It is a quick little book.

I first read this book as a teenager for fun and remember disliking it immensely but later not remembering why. Now that I ave reread it I realize what that is. The type of people described and the way they act irk me. They are well off family surrounded by people that dothings to each other with no feelings. They just keep hurting each other without caring about the consequences.In the beginning of the book it is very boring and does not become interesting until Gatsby becomes involved in the story but the way people act towards one another.I do not really see the beauty in this story but I do see commentary on society I just do not agree with it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"That's my fatal opinion of the book.

F Scott Fitzgerald is my #1 favorite author. He knows how to display a scene so vividly that's unlike most authors. His books can render much emotion in a small way. This book is the presentation of pitiable people and displays people in a realistic light-people with flaws and worries, not characters that do one bad thing and that's it, or characters that are all angel or all villain. The whole book is rather sad in my opinion. Nothing seems to be particularly happy or motivating and then ends on a tragic note. Yet Fitzgerald weaves a web around the reader that makes him want to continue with the rainy-day feeling and leaves you with a sad/wonderful/bittersweet/memorable book.And that is how it is."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby has achieved legendary status in the American canon because it plumbs perpetually attractive themes: unbridled ambition, wealth, power and their inevitable diminution in the face of the most powerful human reality of all-that these are like springtime blooms, satisfying, evanescent and ultimatley to no purpose. For that alone the book is worth reading time and again, ironically rather like the Bible."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I find it interesting that so many of my Goodreads friends have this marked as 'read' but very few left reviews. (Goodreads is an online reading club/website) I felt a little stunned when reading this book as well. It wasn't at all what I expected. For starters is only 180 pages.The Great Gatsby - To me the title is sarcastic, condescending, and empathetic. It's a story about a man who \\"...paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"Gatsby told lies about his life to win Daisy. He then created a life to make those lies a reality. In the end nothing mattered. I was all a lie. Gatsby was a disturbed, obsessed man. The fact that no one attended his funeral showed that everything had been made up, superficial - he lived a life of smoke and mirrors.I'm glad I read this and may pick it up again some day. I'm afraid my reaction to it was based on preconceived notions."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"the underside of the American Dream laid bare by a master of modern prose. Daisy Buchanan, beautiful, utterly superficial, parisitical symbolizes the bankruptcy of the American Dream. Many came up after but no-one described the glaring, loud, cruel 1920s better."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was, of course, not the first time I have read this classic - it is probably the fourth. I have to say that I was not as blown away this time as I have been in the past, but it is still a great book, a classic, a stellar example of the Great American Novel. It is also a very teachable book, with many interesting points for readers - the glamor, the romance, the wealth, the dreaming and longing for somebody to love. But what struck me hardest this time was that the book is primarily about loss and illusion and defeat. Gatsby, as great as he was, did not get what he wanted. He may have even wanted something that could never have existed for him. It is a deeply disillusioned book, with a bleak view of romance. In this story, unlike in Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence\\", true romance does stand a chance against the crushing weight of social pressure. In fact, despite all the romancing that is going on, there does not seem to be much real love between any of the characters, except for Gatsby's obsessive love for Daisy (she responds to the power of his passion and personality, but how does she really feel?), and the camraderie between Gatsby and the narrator.The whole story is as fascinating to me as it ever was. 'Fitzgerald was capable of writing some of the most graceful and beguiling prose that anyone has written. And the character of Gatsby, that embodiment of American dreaming, that rags to riches guy, that smooth gangster with a nave and loving heart - he was probably FSF's greatest creation, and one of the greatest creations in American literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As readers of my reviews know, I rarely bother to make comments about classics. However, I recently read an interview with Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times. She commented that her \\"favorite occupation\\" is rereading The Great Gatsby every year. I haven't read Fitzgerald in probably 20 years, but I was inspired to read this again. I was amazed to be reminded how magnificent this book is. Simultaneously of its time and timeless, it is a masterpiece of prose style. I may not reread it every year, but I will read it many times again, I'm sure."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word \\"love\\" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for any other character. He had always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact the he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation.Recommended stories are Disciples of Fortune, The Scarlet Letter, Why The Caged Bird Sings, in the sense that they go to add to this rich theme."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Like many readers, I first encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in honors American Lit in high school. Unlike many readers, I enjoyed most of the literature assigned in high school and college, but \\"Gatsby\\" has always stood out in my mind, even among the classics, as a stellar example of the writer's art. Fitzgerald crafts every sentence with the precision of a diamond-cutter and takes more care with his story's overall arc and balance than any other novel I know. Each character is vividly drawn and speaks in a highly distinctive voice. The symbolism is perfectly pitched, neither too heavy-handed nor too obscure. \\"Gatsby,\\" like the United States, is about money, and as such is perhaps the quintessential American novel.Whenever I get tired of mediocre writing and the poor to non-existent editing one sees in today's fiction, I re-read the 160 exquisitely wrought pages of \\"Gatsby\\" to remind me of the heights to which novels can aspire."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a great classic and doesn't need another review, but regarless I felt I needed to add my word.I just finished this book and it is the first time I have read it.

Once I began reading, I couldn't let go, so I stayed with it far into the night. Since then I have kept my hard-bound copy, and I feel compelled to delve into it once a year or so. I'm always newly amazed at how GOOD a story it is! The Great Gatsby is a stunning novel, with believable characters, wonderfully haunting descriptions of time and place, and a a fascinating plot with a shattering ending. Once you read it, you don't forget it.PS: The film starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern was great, too."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is hands down one of my favorite books of all time. What a wonderfully written and poetic story. Fitzgerald did not live long enough to enjoy the success of this book, but he would have been proud to see it so well received now. Best ending of a book ever, and some of the best characters ever written. In my opinion Gatsby mirrors Fitzgerald, and is completely fascinating if not sad."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of those novels that you have to read to the very last page to really enjoy it. It is a very simple story in terms of plot, but it's a very complex game of riddle as for its protagonist. There is, in my opinion, a subtle game between what's obvious and superficial and what's hidden and more deep, that's were the novel caught me.I'm a bit surprise that so many reviewers define the characters as to be shallow. Sure, most of them are maybe one-dimensional, but that again plays with Gatsby being so complicated. Because this is the essence of the book as I see it: Gatsby might be a superficial man in his ways and his attitudes, still he feels there's something more deep and worthwhile in life and he thinks he found it in Daisy. And so he pursues his dream to grasp that deeper, most important of thing with what means he has. Which are shallow things, the things he has around him, which dwell in his world and people around him consider valuable.This is what I liked in this novel. Both Gatsby and Carraway feel there is more to life than what they see around them, but unfortunately our means to achieve that deepness - that happiness, if you will - are inadequate, most of the time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is a great book because it captures a certain age -- youth in the Jazz Age -- so well. Even though it was written 80 years ago it seems fresh today. The only comtemporary novel that comes close is Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which even includes a reference to the similarity between youth culture in the 20's and today. How much has really changed? Read these two great books and compare -- great writing that deserves the highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"By avoiding period references, Fitzgerald's brief fable of doomed love and the American psyche takes on a dream-like, ageless quality. His attention to details of characterization, rather than setting, avoid dating the book and help give Gatsby as much significance in our time as it had in the Roaring 20's.Reading this novel, one is struck by the references to disturbing trends in our own times: the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and their desperate search for meaning in their lives, shady fortunes won and lost on the stock market overnight, andthe frenzied quest for personal satisfaction while ignoring the needs of those around us.Yet Gatsby is redeemed -- as we all are, as America has been for over 200 years -- by his belief in a better future, a perfect life that is always just around the corner. It is this quality which ultimately makes us understand and love Jay Gatsby. It is most certainly what draws me back to this slim, quiet book year after year,with so many other bigger, louder books clamoring to be read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I like to think of myself as an open-minded person, willing to embrace any good story that comes into my life, as long as there is some meaning behind it. Hell, there doesn't even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all. The Great Gatsby has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think. Of course, that is only my opinion and I can't tell others what to think.When I began reading The Great Gatsby, my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read). I knew that it was considered a masterpiece. I saw that it was number two on the Modern Library's 100 greatest novels. Yet, I didn't roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Callaway, a middle class man who moves back East into a wealthy neighborhood. The book opens with him at his cousin's house. A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters. We meet Tom, an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man. We meet Daisy, Tom's wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl. Finally, we meet Jordan. Jordan is Daisy's good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman. They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.In the scenes that follow we encounter Jay Gatsby, who is supposedly the hero of the story. He is the American Dream. He is the typical \\"rags to riches\\" story some of us might envy. He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him. Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from. He throws large parties and invites Nick to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Gatsby has no interest in.The reason Gatsby engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Daisy, (Tom's wife). He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Tom. Tom, meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel. I won't reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Tom, Daisy, Tom's mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress's husband, Mr. Wilson. If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you. Although by that time, if you are like me, you won't really care. The narrator, Nick, meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.The Great Gatsby fails on so many levels. I don't know where to start. The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic. I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different. I read the Cliff Notes and it still did not change my opinion. What good are symbols when their meaning doesn't really add to the depth or meaning of the story?Another major failure is the dismal writing style. I couldn't stand it. To me, it seemed Fitzgerald just wanted to show off his vocabulary. I don't have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story. Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional. I didn't feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending. I have said this in other reviews I have written. How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don't even care about? It is impossible. I really didn't care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces. Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was. Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.The Great Gatsby has been said to mean things varying from \\"Social Stratification\\" to \\"Religion\\", to the seven deadly sins, and so on. Rest assured that I don't rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great. I did not hate this book, but as a \\"classic\\", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read. In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times. If I had to some up The Great Gatsby in one word, it would be \\"empty.\\" If I could have one more word it would be \\"hollow.\\" You be the judge. The only thing more mysterious than Jay Gatsby, and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered great by anyone.Grade: C-"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Reading the negative reviews of this book depresses me. What is it about high school education that makes kids hate books? How can we stop this? &quot;In my younger and more vulnerable years...&quot;It's especially sad because The Great Gatsby is a wonderfully written tragedy. Gatsby and his doomed love for Daisy is cast against the deco backdrop of roaring 20's New York, which is vividly rendered by Fitzgerald. It is a period piece, and there are things that are definitely of that time, but there is much about it that is timeless.I want to encourage anyone who read this in high school and was made to hate it to pick it up. It's a very brief read, and is worth your time. Maybe the passage of a few years helps clear the high school myopia about great books like these.And if you were lucky enough not to read this in high school, pick it up now!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Although published seventy-five years ago, Fitzgerald's masterpiece remains as fresh as the day it appeared. It could have been written yesterday. It is as perfect a novel as one is likely to find in American literature; not a word is wrong or out of place. The choice of a second person narrator gives the reader wider and greater appreciation of the characters and events. At the center of it all, of course, is Jay Gatsby, bootlegger, liar, party-giver, doomed romantic. His love for Daisy Buchanan, his &quot;incorruptible dream&quot;, is the only genuine emotion felt by any of the characters (excepting narrator Nick Carroway, whose loyalty to Gatsby is touching), all of whose superficiality is buried beneath the glitter and gaiety of the Jazz Age, the endless parties, the extramarital affairs, the endless-flowing booze, the accumulation of wealth and things.This edition of the book features critical commentary and notes from Prof. Matthew Bruccoli, the world's foremost Fitzgerald scholar."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Don't get me wrong I have a tender spot in my heart for Gatsby, but I try not to kid myself that it is one of the greatest American novels of all time. No what it is is one of the most accessible serious American novels of this century. This said it must be acknowledged that serious flaws exist in this novel. The style and structure are self deluding in that they hark to established reader responses. Nick is a crutch for Fitzgerald in that he needed this neighbour character to make the distant yet close tone of the novel easy to write...this character device is old hat, check out any of the more noirish so called pulp novels of contemporaneous times. Indeed the whole cast are just finely worked cliches (and it is not just that they have become so due to TGG's popularity) and an excuse for Fitzgerald to address what he is really after the American dream. Oh well it is just this atmosphere that we're after as readers, we love it and can't get enough of it. The problem is that we then pat ourselves on the back and say we're reading a masterpiece. No a masterpiece causes us to question deeply our own held beliefs and offers insight, not as the GG does which is serve up ideas which are just ever so slightly below the surface in everyone...No it is just too easy, the ideas are never really represented on several intellectual fronts so that when we finish the gg we cannot help but have on some level an empty feeling. Maybe as a cynical/demanding reader I'm the outsider, but this book always leaves we looking for more. More than the trite Nick can hand me anyway."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As a non-American I am led to ask: so what's all the fuss about? A quick scan of a sample of reviews shows this to have been widely read by school children from the USA. Hence the focus perhaps on its meaning for greater Americana, that love of country through literature, pride and patriotism through a rendering of one of the grossest periods in the history of large decadent societies. I found it a very ordinary novel with thin shallow characters set in a context that countries like the Philippines or Bolivia would be made to wear with shame: corrupt, tarnished, cruel, trashy. Yet because it's the USA we are repeatedly told about the book's accurate depiction of a significant period of history (or words to that effect).Yes, I agree with other reviewers that he could write good descriptive prose. But who can't? (I mean, I hasten to add, among worthy recognised writers.) That alone, great literature does not make. But this thing has Americans seduced, especially their literati. There is no hint that Fitzgerald was an intellectual, or that he delved into very complex areas of personal psychology abutting an overpowering government, economy and social structure. He seems merely to have liked to live, with and without Zelda, the kind of life he almost extolls here.Not enough for me I'm afraid. I only bought the thing because at the fin de siecle it was rated in one of those lists of 20th century literature at #2. Mind you, the judges were all Anglo-Americans and almost all the 100 finalist novels - apart from an odd few like Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude, were from USA or UK.To me it is very ordinary. 3 begrudging stars."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's not as though I haven't read The Great Gatsby before. Like so many others, I read it in high school and tolerated it, letting the experience of being forced into the book color the book itself. But as years have gone by, I've often thought the book deserved a fresh read. And now, whether it's because I'm older, I gave it more benefit of the doubt, or I'm just a wiser reader, I finally understand what an incredible work of fiction the novel truly is. A far more complex and nuanced book than I remembered it being, Gatsby is neither a love letter to the 1920's nor a pure screed against them, and that sense of ambiguity and complex feelings is part of what makes the book so moving. It's hard to find characters here to admire; from our narrator, whose claims of his own honesty and lack of judgment are quickly revealed to be less than accurate, to the apparently wonderful but ultimately shallow Daisy, and even to the well-intentioned but deeply flawed Gatsby, the characters all defy easy characterization, instead becoming symptoms of a moral laxness that permeated the times. And the prose - my god, the prose! The valley of ashes, the silent eyes of an abandoned billboard, the painful meeting of long-separated lovers - Fitzgerald does it all beautifully and simply, telling a massive tale in a surprisingly few pages. Singing the praises of The Great Gatsby hardly feels necessary - is there anyone who was waiting on my thoughts to change their mind? But it's the kind of book that demands such praise, leaving the reader in awe of its greatness after you finish its deceptively slim length."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"What goes on four legs in the morning, on two legs at noon, and on three legs in the evening?\\" the Sphinx asks Oedipus at the gates of Thebes. As the myth goes, no one provides the correct answer until the arrival of Oedipus, whose response of man reflects the stages of human life. The irony of a riddle is that its answer is crystal clear after its revelation. The answer is right in front of us, but often it takes a great work of art such as the story of Oedipus or in this case The Great Gatsby to help us understand our humanity.Many of my millennial students sigh or complain when they recount their first experience with The Great Gatsby. \\"It was forced upon us. My teacher kept saying how great this novel was, but she never explained why other than it depicted the Jazz Age.\\" Neither Oedipus nor prophet, I have provided some reasons as to why this novel deserves a second look from today's youth.As many have already mentioned, The Great Gatsby's narration is the voice of America. Post-modernist critics may object to that statement, considering that Nick Caraway, a young white Army veteran, comes from a well-to-do Midwestern family. While Nick differs both physically and geographically from most of my students, his voice speaks for Americans not so much for what he says but rather by what he doesn't. Nick listens. Confused yet excited by the \\"bright lights\\" of New York, he nonetheless is attractive to the main characters because of his honesty, integrity, and kindness, traits one would find in a counselor or a religious leader. Though confidential, the dramatic irony is that we receive a first-hand-account of the attitudes and actions of America's \\"gods and goddesses,\\" much in the same manner we encounter the tragic flaws of the keepers of Mt. Olympus. Shining a light on the closed world of the rich and famous is titillating to almost everyone.Another aspect of this novel that is overlooked is its length. Depending on the edition, the length does not exceed 235 pages (my edition is 182 pages), a major accomplishment considering its literary output. Published in 1925, Gatsby shines because Fitzgerald had learned from the failure of his play The Vegetable that Americans crave descriptive yet efficient writing that can be read in a day or two. Fitzgerald accomplished his goal, and like any great dramatic or cinematic feature, his audience--with some assistance--is able to digest the purpose or meaning of the story itself. The length of the text is appropriate for any student, but what is gleaned may depend on the stage of an American's life. Note, my previous statement is not contingent upon age; rather, it is my observation that Americans form deeper opinions about the American Dream based on their experiences in pursuit of the American Dream. This is the last idea I would like to explore in the next paragraph.The topic that is of central concern to this novel, and one in which makes this novel worthy of merit, I tend to believe, is Fitzgerald's criticism of the American Dream. This may be a generational shift, but many of Generation X males measured their worth based on their ability to become \\"self-made\\" millionaires through Ben Franklin's proverbial (yet ironic) schedule of hard work and dedication. The Dream (dream?) worked in stages: Young man falls in love with blonde goddess who comes from a renowned (wealthy) family; next, he begins his Arthurian quest to woo her by demonstrating his valor in battle. Returning, he whisks her off her feet, marrying, and then carrying her on a white horse to her castle. There, he consummates his marriage with his fertile wife, leading to their first-born son, who can carry the name for generations. The only catch is that the Dream takes money--lots of it.For my generation, this was the single greatest fear that men encountered: failing to achieve the Dream. There was no other option, and because of it, that is why Gatsby, a penniless veteran, perverts the means of achieving the Dream by entering the world of wolves known as the criminal economy. Like the narrator, we disagree with Gatsby's decision, but we can sympathize, especially for returning veterans who often struggle to find gainful employment. Nick understands this point better than anyone because he comes from a \\"connected\\" family similar to what Tom, Daisy, and Jordan have. Who today has a family who can fund one of their children for an entire year to find himself in New York? While no one likes to use the word \\"victim\\" to describe any group today, the fact remains that players such as Wolfsheim, Tom, Daisy, and the party goers exploit Gatsby's ambitions for their own personal illusions.Looking at the narration, the terseness yet beauty of the text, and the overarching theme of the American Dream, one cannot help but reexamine this literary pearl, as readers did of course after Fitzgerald's death. In the past, much of the discussion regarding this novel has focused on the following questions: Has the green, flickering light known as the American Dream passed? Have more Americans resorted to \\"questionable\\" practices in order to obtain the Dream? These are reasonable questions for my generation, but for a younger post-Socialist generation, their next question may not pertain to finances nor social status but rather personal identity. Before another generation reads Gatsby, maybe they should ask the following question: How do I define the American Dream? It might be too post-modern for my generation to swallow, but millennial Americans must now find happiness on their own terms in a world that we have not left better than our parents did for us. The old definition of the American Dream killed Gatsby; it would only be too prudent to steer a different path, for our children and for what remains of our time on Earth. Thankfully, it is not yet evening and I have not grown a third leg!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had not read this novel for some 20 years, remembering it only as an excellent American novel. A recent rereading was a revelation--this is indeed one of the world's great novels, as close to perfection as the art of fiction comes. The minor character point of view gave the characters and the action the truth of objectivity. The characterization framed the characters, though not extensively developed, vividly within the parameters of the theme: Gatsby's and our nation's loss of innocence and the loss of our ideals in the pursuit of wealth. Though set in the 1920's, the novel's message is as relevant now as it was then, perhaps in the dedication to greed today even more so. There is an economy of action in this short novel that Fitzgerald distills into the very essence of what he needs to deliver his message: James Gatz of North Dakota is the embodiment of the American dream, callow, superficial, idealistic, noble and grand--the symbol of this nation's promise of the better life, and how it has become corrupted into a glorious and empty dream. Few novels, in their rapid progression from beginning to conclusion, cause the reader to become aware of the quality of the writing itself, the choice of words, the descriptive details, the to and fro of prose rhythms. \\"Gatsby\\" does on almost every page: \\"Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver,safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\\" Daisy:\\"Her voice is full of money.....\\" That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it...high in a white palace the king's daughter,the golden girl...\\" Nick Carraway's;\\" I'm thirty,\\" I said. I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.\\" The last 3 paragraphs of the book are simply magnificent, an eloquent, powerful, gloriously appropriate conclusion to a great novel.

He lures us with his simple but misunderstood characters. And he finishes it off with his incredible ability to paint a picture of a decade so out of control. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; tells the story an incredibly wealthy man (Gatsby) who is somewhat of an oddball in the socially aggressive environment of New York in the twenties. Through the narrator, Fitzgerald gives us the insight into Gatsby's true character that others in the novel either don't pick up on, or ignore. The only thing I didn't like about this novel is Fitzgerald's ocasional use of the cheesy metaphor that other's find so eloquent. However, I'd have to say that this was one of the more enjoyable books I read this past year."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby has become, deservedly so, one od the most widely read, widely taught novels ever.

Not being one blessed with the ability to produce stirring speech on command, I decided I would record myself reading from a novel.The first novel I selected from my parents' rather diverse library was &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; I'd never read it before, but I deemed the first few paragraphs worthy of representing my voice to my online friends. So I recorded myself reading them out loud. The book enchanted me. The sound of the language alone prompted me to record nearly three pages before I retired to my room to devour the complete novel. It's now 5:51 AM, and I, having just finished reading this wonderful work, am confident that F. Scott Fitzgerald will join the growing pantheon of my personal favorites.

Scott Fitgerald in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy American. It is also a fine representation of the American dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Gatsby is the typical wealthy American in the 1920's who lives the life wanted by all Americans. His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Daisy was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Gatsby tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Daisy. His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald's use of symbols is what represents most the books' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Written in the 1920's, F. Scott Fitzgerald's 240 page novel, \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" tells of a love story gone wrong caused by the desire for material objects. The story describes Mr. Gatsby's life as he tries to regain his past love, Daisy, who left him because he was not wealthy enough. She, as well as many of the characters in the book, was only concerned with wealth, so she married another man for his riches. Mr. Gatsby tries to do everything to regain her love. He spends his whole life becoming wealthy so that he may sweep her off of her feet and get the past back. Mr. Gatsby is a foolish man trying to repeat the past, who does not realize how superficial and shallow Daisy is. He is only concerned with her beauty. The storyline of this book is shaped similar to a believable soap opera because of all the lying and cheating that is going on between many of the characters. This book is full if symbolism, which cleverly reveals many different aspects of the story and characters. Several of the examples of symbolism are so subtle that they require a second or third reading to even notice them. This great love tragedy is smoothly written with a storyline that leaves you desiring to read further. This story is thought provoking and simply amazing. This is a brilliant novel and I recommend it to everyone. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a timeless classic written by an incredible writer."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I apologize for many of the close-minded high school students who decided to vent the fact that they hate everything they read in school on this website.I am sorry to say that I am a high school student, who had the pleasure to read this book last year. It is truely amazing how one book can get a kid my age so engulfed in the concept of reading. Everything about this book is wonderful to me. The symbolism throughout the whole book just adds to the tragic story of Jay Gatsby and his inability to let go of a past life that has haunted him for years.In short, this book deconstructs the basic American dream and reveals it as a desperate attempt to cling to memories of a love that is, and always had been out of Gatsby's league. The superficiality of his new social status is made extremely lucid by symbolism as simple of Gatsby's pool. The pool had never been used by gatsby himself, it just sat in it's place to be used for nothing other than show, much like Gatbsy himself. The money he acquired(through illegal ventures) had never been about himself, but only about the hope that somehow he could prove to Daisy that he had become an upscale man. The hope that somehow the past would could be not forgotten, but re-lived ultimately led to Gatbsy's destruction, as he failed to realize his own desperate and hopeless quest for wealth soon enough to save his soul. The way Gatsby is depicted paints two portraits of one man, a man who has everything; a fabulous mansion, money, cars and all of the other worldly possessions one can hope for, and the other; a man who has everything but what he desires most, the love he would give everything up for. In the end, Daisy and friends are revealed as nothing more than snobbish drunks, and Gatsby remains the shattered man who always strived to do better for the ones he cared about, the ones he loved.How any person who reads this book and does not appreciate it for the wonderful story it tells is beyond me. Kids these days seem to automatically hate any book they are forced to read in a school environment, and it is a shame. Perhaps if high schoolers could look past their own superficialities and accept a book for what it is, than many would be better off."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I love this book. Initially, it can be somewhat hard to follow because of the narration, but Fitzgerald is such a master storyteller that it doesn't matter; you just can't put the book down.

Before you embarrass yourself by knocking this book, please keep in mind that it was #2 on the 20th century fiction list For those of you with your nose too deep in the Grisham and King to see for yourself, let me point out a few things that make this such a great book.First please note the economy of the words of the storytelling and the lyrical language used by Fitzgerald. It is a novel that tells a remarkable story without a single excess word. (S. King take note---a book does not have to be 1000 pages---get an editor, Big Guy) Also note the the cleverness of having the narration from Nick's point of view, which adds a lot to the book because of the interplay between Nick and Gatsby. Notice also how Fitzgerald handles the timeless themes of money, power and class, while telling a great story. Even if you don't have time to read the whole book, just read the last page. It's as good as anything that has ever been written.Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a strange book because it seems that every American is forced to read it in high school, and yet its lessons are most meaningful and appropriate for people who are much, much older. Fitzgerald's main message seems to be that those individuals who think big and dream big will eventually be crushed by their headstrong romantic ambitions, and that golden memories from the past--no matter how achingly seductive and promising in retrospect--can never be recaptured.How depressing! What high schooler wants to be exposed to these dreadful (if true) life lessons, especially so early in life?Therein lies the rub. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a benchmark work of American literature that is primarily read by youngsters who are too young to appreciate it, and it is ignored by oldsters who might truly connect with it because they, in their old age, dismiss the novel as some sort of stale required reading for adolescents.But let's now look at what the two groups might like, and then dislike, about this fascinating 1925 novel.LIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) It's a short read.2.) It's a famous work written by a famous author.3.) It's a clear, clean, tidy read.4.) It offers little complexity or contradiction (at least on a superficial level).5.) Nick Carroway is cool, and Jay Gatsby is REALLY cool.6.) Fitzgerald's gifts of description are amazing, especially those of the Gatsby mansion and its parties.6.) The book's mini-lessons are tidy, potted plants: (a.) money is bad; (b.) it sucks being the outsider; (c.) pay attention while driving, lest you mow down a mistress; (d.) don't bother Googling your ex-girlfriend and buying a big house across the bay from her big house.DISLIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) Nick Carroway's narration is a little too suav&eacute; and complex for its own good.2.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.3.) Except for a few parties, one DUI, and one murder/suicide, nothing happens over nearly 200 pages of text.LIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) It's a short read.2.) Nick Carroway's narration is agreeably suav&eacute; and complex.3.) Scores and scores of textual passages in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" are arrestingly beautiful in their imagery, simplicity, and lyricism.4.) The oldsters know good-hearted, hard-charging successful people who eventually crashed and burned, just like Gatsby did.5.) The oldsters like looking back gauzily and wistfully on the splendor and health of their youth, no matter how things actually turned out.6.) The bastards win out at the end of \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" just like in real life.DISLIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:1.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.2.) The pivotal automobile accident is just a tiny bit forced and convenient. (See for example p. 151 of the 1995 Scribner paperback edition--how can Daisy swerve to pass an ONCOMING car on a two-lane street? If the approaching car is ONCOMING, there is no need to swerve--just to keep driving straight.)3.) Why did Gatsby let himself be killed by the raving George Wilson? Wouldn't Gatsby, who purposely ordered his car with the damaged fender to be entombed in his estate's garage, get the hell out of Dodge? (Tom and Daisy did.) Are we meant to believe he gave up on life because, after one bad afternoon and a car accident caused by Daisy, he would give up on five years' worth of empire-building and let himself be assassinated?4.) Overall, the book doesn't quite fit together seamlessly. It fails to be perfectly harmonious, internally and thematically.In sum, this is a masterpiece stuck uncomfortably between two places: the hearts and minds of the young, who have not yet lived long enough to endorse the timeless truths of the novel's grim central message, and the hearts and minds of the old, who might indeed recognize the value of its teachings, but skip over the text because they consider it to be fodder for juvenile minds.The text's tragic inability to succeed in one or the other camp reminds us of two similar and heartbreaking failures: of Jay Gatsby, who had all the material goods and all the street cred, but still died young, broken, and alone; and of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was perhaps the most naturally gifted author America ever produced, but still died young, broken, and alone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Quite simply, the best American novel of the 20th Century.Fitzgerald was a genuis and this is his masterpiece, his gift to American literature. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is an awesome yet deceptively simple story that explores the frustrations and passions of an entire generation through the words, deeds, and thoughts of a few complex characters. There is so much just below the surface of this book, you can easily read through it and miss the depth. But it is there, to be discovered under Nick's watchful gaze. You have Gatsby's fabricated fabulousness, a persona he's created with his own self-serving mythology. But there is so much he hides, so much he wills Nick to discover.You have Daisy's flightiness and selfishness also hiding her true self because that's how it is for women in her world--fake, flighty, frothy, lacking in substance. She knows the rules and she plays by them. Jordan, Nick and others--their truth is more obvious to us (i.e., Jordan is a cheat). But everything is tragic here, it is a fasade built on Eliot's famed &quot;wasteland.&quot;I can't stres this enough--this is a book that must be read, reread, and analyzed countless times in order to understand what an extraordinary achievement it is. It is poetry."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Although F. Scott Fitzgerald's book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; may seem a tad superficial upon the first reading, it really is quite a gem when examined closer. There are many important and significant symbols that are so intricately and subtly woven into the story, that only a careful reader would be able to catch them all. Fitzgerald makes excellent use of colour symbolism in things such as Gatsby's clothing and car, and the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, place symbolism, in regards to East Egg, West Egg, and the Valley of Ashes, and time symbolism, which can be caught when one looks at the timeline that the book follows. Fitzgerald's seemingly shallow depiction of five characters in the roaring twenties is really a symbolic masterpiece and a classic novel of the twentieth century. A must-read for any deep reader, or anyone who wants to become one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am an English teacher, and I bought this to aid in my classroom discussion of the novel. After receiving this version of Gatsby, I discovered that our school library had a copy read by a different narrator. I listened to both, but Alexander Scourby's reading was much more entertaining to my 11th graders. The other version put them to sleep. I highly recommend Scourby's reading of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It should come as no surprise that F. Scott Fitzgerald is a Midwesterner who came to New York City to try his luck. Many great New Yorkers came from outside the City (PT Barnum, Robert Fulton, Alexander Hamilton, etc.). However, their fresh perspectives of Gotham--something a native might overlook--allowed them to see things in a different way. Nick, the narrator of THE GREAT GATSBY, is also a Midwestern boy who comes to New York. In Jay Gatsby, Nick sees someone alluring, mysterious, dazzling, intimidating, aloof, and shady--all those qualities associated with Jazz Age New York. And the population of Gatsby's parties, like the population of Roaring 20s New York, are money-, power- and sex-hungry, yearning for celebrity, and, in many cases, hollow people who drink too much.For all the drinking, Nick's view (and therefore Fitzgerald's) is incredibly sobering and clear-eyed. Caught up as he is in the excitement, he is often repelled by some of it. THE GREAT GATSBY, in my book, contains some of Fitzgerald's most lyrical writing. In form, character development, and plot, this book stands out as just an important book of early 20th century American literature as anything by Steinbeck, Dos Passos, or Dreiser."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I decided to reread the novel in light of the pending release of the 2013 film. So glad I did. I was once again instantly absorbed into the story, the expressive language and the emotion with which it is written. I'm sure that the new film will pale in comparison, but I am excited to see the story brought to life nevertheless. I can always return to the pages if I find anything lacking."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'll admit that it's not what I exp expected but I am glad I read it. I think the movie that's coming out soon should be great."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I remember really enjoying this book in high school, but now reading it again six years later, I enjoy it even more! Fitzgerald's prose is absolutely beautiful and I found myself highlighting several parts that were exceptionally brilliant (don't worry, the highlighting was on my Kindle). I could barely put the book down, and I hadn't realized how much essence of the story I missed while I was in high school. Definitely worth a read or two, as it is not only a great representation of the way writing should be, but also an enthralling account of fiction. (Besides... you should read it before the movie comes out in May :))"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Reading for the second after High School and it is much more romantic and deeper than I remember it being! Also has a great sense of humor..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was skeptical about finding an Everyman's edition of Gatsby, but it was indeed accurate. Very happy to have a copy to go in my Everyman's Library."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Well written. Interesting. Poignant. Timeless. Romantic. Stylish. Pristine Etiquette and Grammar. A lesson in how to be, act and live. I've read no less than 5 times and I'm sure I'll read it again..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I love the way he writes. This is a quick read and still makes you think. I'd love to read a more detailed version about Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I originally read this book in high school, but I purchased this e-book to refresh my memory for the new Gatsby movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio coming out in the near future. The only thing it refreshed about my memory is that it's an extremely boring book with syntax that is hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I wanted a reading for my cellphone version of kindle, and this was a great option for me to read on spare moments."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can't believe I waited as long as I did to read this one.

I am glad to have such an opportunity to indulge into the g greatest literary work."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"An easy read that keeps your interest. The only thing that would have made this a better book would have been a little more detail about gatsby and Daisy's present relationship."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I love this book. It was the only one i liked in high school. If you have never read it you should!!! So much better than all the other book s it high school.it has love and mystery and scandal"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Somehow I had completly missed the Great Gatsby. I never read the book in High School or College, so I decided to give it a shot. It is a classic for a reason. The characters and setting are timeless. The pacing of the novel is perfect right up to the conclusion. Check it out before the movie comes out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Reading this book for the first time in more than 50 years,I did not experience a \\"visit to an old friend\\" that I had expected. I tried to read it casually which did not work. I intend to immediately begin to reread this book with more care, and will review it again when I have paid better attention to it. This is a book I have long wanted to discuss with an old friend who really is into the American Classics, and she has even taken college classes on F Scott Fitzgerald I don't know that I could get that deep, but I must have some understanding of it beyond characters I would think."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"So much drama ! Totally entertaining !! I was never bored , I loved it so much ! I would read it any day !!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Great glad I read it!Not sure what took me so long. I can check it off list. I can now justify watching the movie."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Great Gatsby and found it a quick and easy read. The themes of The Great Gatsby: wealth, beauty, greed and power mirrored the society of the Roaring Twenties perfectly. I did feel that one or two of the major revelations were dealt with too quickly and that more could have been done with them to add to the narrative. F. Scott Fitzgerald had a unique talent with words making his sentences beautiful and lyrical. I had a very clear picture in my mind of the world in which these characters were set. Also, through accurate, but succinct, descriptions I could imagine what they looked like, how they moved and spoke."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Through F.Scott Fitzgerald's penchant for superfluous verbiage, he created a window into the greed and power-hungry wealth of the tumultous 1920s."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I was in high school I had to read &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; and remembered really enjoying it. Now, many years later, I didn't find it as engaging or interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I adore this book for so many reasons. It's short. It's flawlessly written. It's totally complete in itself. Some sentences take the reader away, and the pitch is set so you have no idea how dense the stuff is that you're reading because it is so readable. THIS is how you write books kiddies."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Initially the book seems to drone on about nothing much, but stick to it. The message of the book and the intricatly woven, all-pervasive symbolism eventually becomes apparent. I would haved awarded five stars if soap opera plots held any interest for me. The book's portrayal of the stereotypical American Dream was excellent."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Man, this year in English has been a tough one! First it was Their Eyes were watching God...don't read it--it's in ebonics! Then it was the crucible (good but hard) then...the Scarlet Letter. So...when it was time for the next story, I thought how good can this be? Well, it rocked! It was so cool and well-written...read it, even because &quot;it's a classic&quot;...you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is rated #1 in the Random House list. So I decided to try it. When I read it and I really love it because it's interesting how Jay Gatsby love Daisy in Chapter 5. Chapter 1 and 2 is not very interesting but Chapter 3 to the end is very good. The end is the best.I just read it January, 1999. I think you should try it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a must-read! I had to read it for my junior english class, and loved it! You will totally get into the book, and it is easy to hate and love certain characters!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"THE BOOK IS VERY DETAILED AND VERY VIVID. I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE WITH GATSBY. I IMAGINED MYSELF AT ONE OF HIS PARTIES AND I FELT I WAS HAVING FUN WITH EVERYBODY THERE. GATSBY THREW SOME OF THE BEST PARTIES BECAUSE HE COULD AFFORD IT. I FELT REALLY BAD FOR GATSBY BECAUSE HE WAS ALL ALONE. THE BOOK MADE FEEL LIKE I KNEW GATSBY. I COULD NOT STOP READING BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS REALLY SAD WHEN ONLY THREE PEOPLE OTHER THAN HIS SERVANTS ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL. I THOUGHT OVERALL THIS BOOK WAS GREAT. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the authorized text, takes us back to the roaring 1920's. A story about a wealthy Jay Gatsby and his determined love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Every character is interesting and represents some essential lesson or dramatic point of view of the 1920's. Great novel, you must read it, and read between the lines for there is much to be learned from this superior work of art."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, by Fitzgerald, Is a wonderful story.

I love the imagery and the sometimes quirky characters. Can't wait for the new movie to come out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was surprised to find that this book was missing the copyright/publishing information usually found on the first page. I looked on Amazon and determined (after I had already received the book) that it was printed-to-order by Lulu publishing, an online single-copy book publisher. There printing was low quality: there were no page numbers, the font was too small (maybe a 9 or 10 pt.) and it has weird formatting. None of this actually prevented me from reading the book. I just finished it and enjoyed the writing style and story. But, the printing style was just annoying. I will be more careful in the future, when buying paperbacks from Amazon, to only buy from reputable publishers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was very surprised at how great this book looked. The outside was practically flawless and only a few pages were bent. Definitely satisfied with my order."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had to read this book for reading class and I was pleasantly surprised it gives wonderful details and has a great storyline. Well done F. Scott Fitzgerald"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I found this book interesting to read even though it was an assigned reading for school. I like this book becuase there was romance, even just a little, and because I liked the characters, Nick and Gatsby. I like when Daisy and Jay Gatsby's past was describes and how he rubbed in Daisy's husband about their romantic past. In the end, I felt sorry for Jay Gatsby because he was killed for a crime he did not commit and he was blamed for this crime by Daisy's husband. I also felt sorry for Jay Gatsy because he tried so hard to win Daisy back and Daisy ends up staying with her husband, even though she knows that her husband put the blame of the murder on Jay"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book in high school but when we decided to read this in my book club I realized I forgot almost the whole story line. I loved reading this and looking at the characters from a whole different perspective. This is an American classic and a must read for everyone. I think this shows that money does not always produce happiness."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Read this as a high schooler and figured it was time to take another look. Still a great story about intriguing characters."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is a wonderful character, extremely interesting, and the end is just so heart breaking! I read it to have a feel of how the movie would be, and I'm just crazy excited for the movie now! The book was so brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby continues to be popular (no doubt even more so with the moving coming this summer) because we all know the characters. The hero is just that, a hero but he's in love and will do anything to make his girl happy, which in this instance Gatsby thinks is money. Enter nosy neighbour, add a bad boy, throw them all into the same place at the same time and watch the fireworks. While the formula is a known one, it is F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing that makes the novel worth while. Please, please, please read this BEFORE you see the movie. It will no doubt be spectacular but all the more so with Fitzgerald's words swimming in your head."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"while reading the great gatsby over this past summer i did not realize the signifigance of the underlying meaning. after i read it a second time i began to understand the actual beauty of fitzgerald's masterpiece. if you ever want a book to sit and contemplate for a while then i suggest this one."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby crosses time as it depicts the careless indulgence that is embedded in our culture. There is a Tom, Daisy and a Gatsby in all our lives. Fitzgerald immortalizes America through his novel. We feel the struggle for independence, love, respect and acceptance that people of all cultures come to achieve in this country. We learn that we, those born and raised in this country must aslo struggle for these. Most importantly, though Fitzgerald brings us Gatsby. Through Nick's eyes our own soul begins to search, and we find that within each and every one of us there is a little of the vulnerable, mythical Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderfully written book that keeps the reader attentive at all times. This is actually the second time that I have read the book and I was still caught up in the story just like if it had been my first time reading it! I certainly recommend it the book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was interesting. The context was hard to understand at first, but we grew accustomed to it as we progressed. The beginning was slow but it soon picked up pace and was exciting. The story is almost like a soap opera. Fitzgerald uses large words to portray his thoughts and to give the book more detail. Overall great book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I think this is a good book but yet, a little confusing and hard to understand. I sort of understood it but I didn't for the most part. But I think this would have been a grrrreat book only if I had understood it better."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I started reading this book I didn't really know what to expect. But as I got further along I got more interested and was soon caught up in this great story. Gatsby resembles a typical American in search of fame and wealth. His love for Daisy motivates him to go in search of these two things. But once he achieves them it is too late, for Daisy is already married. He died a tragic death betrayed by all those whom he considered to be his friends."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I began The Great Gatsby with extremely high hopes of the great American novel. In truth, while well done, Gatsby is not as exceptional as many would have you believe. I think perhaps people have gotten to the point of lauding this book simply because it is the popular thing to do. I found it rather disjointed and mildly slow but the quote of the &quot;orgastic future&quot; and the &quot;mouth full of money&quot; are unforgettable and might be worth reading the book by themselves."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Book is filled with tons of symbolism but you may have to read it more than once to get it. You must take your time to really figure out the characters and their intentions."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The story was beautifully written but yet is so terribly tragic. Gatsby's desperate attempt to win Daisy's heart is so terribly vapid. Gatsby is a man with so little content, but yet so many complexities. Fitzgerald's writing style is so brilliant with the description of life on New York's Long Island. The shallowness and pure moral emptiness of the characters resonates throughout the novel. Gatsby dies for his own criminal sins, but also for the sins of the party goers. Fitzgerald voyeuristically brings the reader along on a joyride with Gatsby as his life spirals out of control. His murder stops the joyride not only for the party goers but for the readers as well. The lack of attendance at his funeral shows that he had no true friends, but that everybody, excluding the narrator, used Gatsby only for his money. The people of Long Island, including Daisy, are slaves to Mammon and this sickens Fitzgerald to the core. Fitzgerald through Gatsby questions American values, but American society in general. God in Long Island is replaced by advertising bill boards for eye doctors. The writing style is splendid and the story is captivating yet saddening. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is the greatest novel of the 1920's, and top five all-time in American literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can't identify good literature when they see it. Fitzgerald masterfully pulls off second-person narration. He crafted each sentence to create one legendary masterpiece. It's a complete story with each scene dependant on the next and written at a steady pace. Meaning, it contains three distinct parts, a beginning,middle and end, lacking tongue and cheek wordiness."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The only things that happened in this book happened in the last fifty pages. It's boring, and the only reason I read it is because it was an English assignment. The plot was dreary and I did not like it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book was terrible, and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would recommend buying a different book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One star is too many, but it is the minimum.The only reason I read this was for a class. I gave the teacher a stinker review as well.The books is a pointless exercise in futility about pointless stupid people. The only point to the story is that people with money are just as trashy, if not more so, than people without. The characters have no development, are barely two dimensional, do stupid things for no reason and face no consequences for their veniality.This books is the literary equivalent of being stuck in a window seat on a airplane for 14 hours next to a drunken, smelly creep with bad breath and smelly gas who talks at your for the whole flight about his pointless job. For being such a thin book, it is the hardest reading I have ever had to do.Of course, it is even more aggravating that the kindle edition costs $11 for a book you can get at a bookstore for less than a dollar."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It seems that complaining is the national pastime, and this book is no exception. It would apear that Mr. Fitzgerald was somewhat unhappy, and decided to tell the world, along the way gving the rest of us something else to complain about. The critisisms of the American dream, and of rich people are true certainly, but hey, we already knew that. He seems to veiw love in a distant manner, as if it never works out for anybody. Self pity is such a wonderful thing, isn't it. So, if your feeling the least bit perky, just pick up a copy, and soon, if it doesn't put you to sleep, you'll find yourself in a dreary funk."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I heard this book was a classic,a must read,so I read it.It was a bad book!
