In the book Three to Get Ready. Her books are funny and scary at the same time. I will really read more. The books made me want to be a bounty hunter if that isn't stupid but they did."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed the book and can't wait to see the movie. Stephanie Plum is quite a character, very enjoyable, looking forward to her next adventure."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a very funny book and the beginning of a very funny series. Stephanie is probably one of those slim, beautiful and really together women that all the other authors write about - but she doesn't know and she has all the fears and phobias that the rest of us can identify with! Her story is filled with people that make you laugh out loud and the men in her life are so on the edge that you will wish you had this particular problem. Enjoy the book and the series. These people really grow on you."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich is amazing! I love every character in this book. Her family is so easy to relate to. You can see your family in them. The book had me laughing and hooked all the way through. I was terrified and in hyserics at the same time. I couldn't put this book down, nor could I wait to get my hands on the next book about Stephanie. The way Janet mixes romance with mystery and comedey is perfect."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Very well written, great flow, fast paced, incredibly humorous. Janet Evanovich is the only author who consistently has me laughing out loud. The first in the Stephanie Plum bounty hunter series (Two for the Dough up to, Three To Get Deadly,...) One for the Money is a must read. The characters are vivid and colorful including Joe Morelli (cop and on again off again boyfriend) and Grandmother Mazur. This one leaves Sue Grafton in the dust. A must read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Can't believe I just started to read this series. Consider me joining the league of Stephanie Plum's fan. This book is such a winner!! I can't believe that somebody is able to write such a fantastically hilarious book in first person point of view but this book sure proves I'm wrong. Can't wait to start reading the next book in the series (already in my bookshelf) to meet crazy Stephanie, yummy Joe Morelli, and tough-guy Ranger ..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Okay, the book was sitting on my shelves for a bit just waiting for me to read. Finally I picked it up and started reading....little did I know that I wouldn't put it back down till I finished it! This isn't your usual mystery. Stephanie Plum, the main character, becomes a bounty hunter just because she is down to her last few pennies and can't live like that anymore. We follow her as she tracks down a man that has FTA (fled the area) to get some money but ends up solving a murder. The characters are hilarious and very unique. Everyone from Grandma Mazur with her blue spandex shorts to Uncle Vinnie and the \\"so-called\\" duck incident you can help yourself from laughing out loud during some parts. I would absolutely recommend you read this book and see what you are missing. You aren't a mystery reader without this one under your belt."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"breath of fresh jersey air!!!! major props to ms. evanovich for creating such a real, likeable, hilarious, vivid character! strong yet vulnerable, take charge and quick learning stephanie plum will absolutely delight your mind as you read this hysterical book in one sitting! the story is so interesting & moves so quickly (like a gazelle) you will want to rush out when you are finished with \\"one for the money\\" and get books 2-8! oh, and there's just the right smattering of romance. i loved! this book, i'm so glad someone told me about it!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a good book, not great but deffinatly a solid and entertaining read. I am reviewing this one after having read all seven books in this series. The first book is a short easy read that basically introduces you to the main characters you will see thru the rest of the series. The story line is good and well written but it only gets better from here. For me One For The Money was good enough to interest me in the second book and from there the plots took off! When I was done reading Seven Up i found myself upset that Hard Eight was not released yet. I am Jonesing to find out what happens next! I highly reccomend this book because it is the first, even if not the best, in a fantastic series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is the type of high spirited, funny, and smart women that you'd love to have as a best friend! You just know that you'd always have fun hanging out with this Jersey girl!When Stephanie finds herself unemployeed and after she's liquidated all of her furnature she turns to \\"Cousin Vinnie\\" for a job as a bounty hunter. Even with no experience in the art of chasing down criminals she soon finds herself carrying a gun that she's afraid to use. No only that,but she finds herself in situations where she needs to protect herself. With a crazy stalker harassing her and the need to for her to rake in some cash by bringing a murderer in, the storie takes a more serious twist and I found myself unable to put it down.Kudos to you Janet Evanovich! You wrote a very refreshing hit and I can't wait to read the others! Very funny, yet suspensful! This one gets a rare 5 stars from this girl!!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I came across this book because I was looking for books with a female heroine Private Eye. This book is the story of an ordinary blue-collar woman, who by chance circumstances, gets drawn into being a bounty hunter! She deals well with her circumstances, using ideas that ANY ordinary woman would have--she reacts in ways that any of us with no police background would--that's part of what makes this book so appealing. Almost every conversation in the book is so cleverly written, having smart remarks and double meanings--it's extremely enjoyable for anyone who really enjoys a &quot;double entendre.&quot; It's very rare to find a writer who can do this, other than a journalist with years of experience. My thought is that this writer grew up in the sort of environment whe writes in--namely, people cracking smart remarks all the time! I highly recommend this book (although it does contain off-color language, but used appropriately), and do now plan to read her whole series of books. Sadly, due to the off-color language, however, I will not choose it for my bookclub."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"It was suggested that I get my nose out of romance books and read something different. My friend suggested these. OH MY GOSH- I am hooked.I woke my husband up laughing so hard at parts of this book. The grandmother of Stephanie Plum is a riot. She says the kinds of things that we all want to say and don't dare. The main character is kind of a mess at times and yet somehow things seem to work out.If you want an easy to read, funny book; this is the book to get. If you want something with deap meaning and lots of themes, don't bother."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a person with character. Sheloses her job, sells some of her belongings andthis is when she decides to become a bounty hunter. Through trial and error Stephanie learns the ropes of bounty hunting. The relationship that goes on between Stephanie and Joe Morelli, who she is trying to bring in for jumping bail, is refreshing and funny. Must read book that will have you hooked on the Stephanie Plum series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book because of the reviews right here at Amazon and wasn't disappointed. I've just started to read her second book, &quot;Two for the Dough&quot; and hope that it's as good as the first. To go from lingerie salesperson to bounty hunter is quite a jump, and Stephanie does it with humor and passion. I related to her selling her &quot;stuff&quot; just to survive - been there, done that. But her resilience was something the &quot;weaker sex&quot; should be proud of. GO GIRL!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Read it! Stephanie Plum is a delight. I really did laugh at loud at this not-to-perfect heroine. It was refreshing to read about a character with real-life problems such as having to sell odds and ends to pay off bills. The grandmother character is a genuine hoot. I want more. Thanks Janet for a great read"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What happens when an out of work lingerie buyer becomes a bounty hunter with no experience? The results are hillarious. I laughed out loud. Great charaters, great fun"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Wonderfully full bodied &amp; funny! I am a big fan of mystery - especially the women writers/characters, and this book was refreshing and extremely well crafted for a first novel. Stephanie Plumb is gutsy, interesting, fresh and still human. I laughed out loud many, many times. The supporting characters are well defined, deep and humorous as well. In this first book it finds Stephanie experiencing enough financial difficulties to force her to seek employment with her less than savory cousin Vinny, as a bounty hunter. Even with no experience, she plunges ahead in her new found career choice. Buy this one today and you will be rushing out to buy the next one as soon as you've read a couple chapters"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is so fast paced and yet the author includes the little everyday items of living. Makes you want to order pizza to eat while you're reading the book! Especially if Morelli was delivering. The book kept me guessing to the end. Stephanie is so gutsy and yet so trusting. She and Morelli have such chemistry! Her grandmother is one of the best characters in the book. I have read other books by Evanovich and have always found her characters to be believable and funny, like you really know these people. What an enjoyable read"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm a mystery author, and upon reading this book, I experienced three overwhelming emotions--jealousy, an urge to run out and buy her next book, and an overwhelming fear that she's not writing fast enough on the future ones.."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Refreshing heroine and great repartee between Morelli and Stephanie. Visual and funny"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"laughed out loud in many sections, characters fun and I was interested in all of them, a little tough on battering but an enjoyable read. Looking forward to her next one being in pape"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I would rate &quot;One for the Money&quot; a 10, but only Tolkien ranksthat high with me. Still, Stephanie Plum is a Garden Stateforce to be reckoned with! Hilarious, fast-paced and nicelywritten, I found this a most enjoyable introduction to so-called 'crime fiction.'I'd pay full price for this book -- my highest praise!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's One for the Money was an excellent book! Meet Stephanie Plum, out of a job, and out of money. Meet cousin Vinnie, bail bondsman. Steph plus Vinnie equals bounty hunter. Her first assignment: bring in ex-cop Joe Morelli who is charged for murder. But bringing in her old high-school friend is harder than it looks. They characters Stephanie meets are one-of-a-kind and Grandma Mazur will make you cry with laughter!! With so many twists and turns, this book will keep you guessing!! So find a comfortable spot and start reading!! I finished reading this in two days, so see if you can beat me!! After you finish reading this, and are still quite interested in what happens next, then read book two, Two for the Dough. Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am not usually one for paperback thrillers, but a friend whose judgment I trust said I absolutely HAD to read the Stephanie Plum books. I will love her forever for it!!Janet Evanovich doesn't just concoct outrageously twisty plots; her work is also witty and her writing style enjoyable. Unlike the stilted dialogue I've seen in the few similar crime novels I've thumbed through, Evanovich's prose crackles. Her fashion-impaired, lovably inept heroine could never be played by Meg Ryan (keepin' it real -- a plus in my book!). The brassy, bawdy Stephanie Plum is the embodiment of every woman's most secret fears about her employability, love life, family and body, but despite her often-depressing circumstances in regards to the aforementioned fears, she manages to save the day and (sometimes) get her man. The characters are crisply drawn, never caricatured, and the plotlines are interesting if not always unpredictable. I've read two (&quot;One for the Money&quot; in one sitting, which happens very few times in a given year) and can't wait to get my hands on the rest!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I did not get bored with this book at all. It sucks you right in and you don't want to put it down until you are done. Stephanie Plum is a hillarious character; you really feel like you get to know her. There is the mystery, the comedy, the romance, everything in one awesome book. A great start to the series. I will be reading the rest of them."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Ok, so I judged this book (well, the whole series actually) by the cover....I love the bright colors and the clever titles! I read this book in one sitting and laughed all of the way through! Stephanie Plum and her \\"adventures\\" with Morelli and the \\"bad\\" guys were fantastic! I never knew what to expect around the corner (which is a problem for me with Mystery/Thrillers) and I was intrigued the whole way through! Heck, after reading this, maybe I could become a bounty hunter! I loved reading about the dinners with her parents, her pistol-happy grandmother, and her \\"romantic\\" encounters with Morelli (the boy who seduced her back in her school days). HIGHLY recommended book! I can't wait to read the second one and hope that Stephanie can get her guy!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was an excellent introduction to Janet Evanovich's newest character Stephanie Plum! All the characters and subplots are a riot! You must keep reading to find out what happens next and make sure you have Two for the Dough ready to start reading as soon as you finish One for the Money! You'll need more Stephanie Plum, Joe Morelli, Ranger and Grandma Mazur!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have found my new favorite author and fictional charactor. Stephanie Plum is intelligent, witty, funny, and vulnerable at the same time. The supporting charactors, especially Grandma Mazur, provide comic relief as Stephanie hunts down her man (or woman). Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series are simply put, excellent. Highly recommend grabbing all 8 books and go on a non-stop reading binge. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I ordered this book because someone mentioned it in a review of another book. I was looking for something different to read and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. I travel for my work and found myself laughing out loud many times, much to the surprise of the person sitting next to me on the plane. Light reading and fun. A bounty hunter who can't seem to do anything right and makes it even funnier when she has to explain herself to the people around her. Also a little romantic tension mixed in. I went right out and got the next books in the series. I've now read all eight and look forward to Janet Evanovich's next novel."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Somehow I missed Evanovich's first crime novel when it was published eight years ago, but it has been a pleasant suprise. Looking for someone to fill in to the gaps as I wait for James Lee Burke, Carl Hiaasen, and Elmore Lenoard to publish new books, I picked up &quot;One For the Money&quot;. It was an enjoyable and exciting read. I enjoyed watching Stephanie take on chasing bail skips as a new career and trying to avoid self destructing. I look forward to following her through later novels. Stephanie is certainly a peach, wait a minute, no she is a Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I truly enjoyed the main character of this book, Stephanie Plum. Her cat &amp; mouse game with Joe Morelli is also very exciting. My sister gave me this book as a book she had just read and thought I would enjoy. I read the first book in 6 hours and am now on the 4th book in just a week. These are books that you just can't put down."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is hilarious. I can't put these books down and can't stop laughing. A unique experience, you will love the Stephanie Plum series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie has had her car repossessed, her phone turned off, she's living off donated fig newtons, and she is just about to be evicted. She has pawned off everything she owns...her VCR, lamps, you name it. And she is desperate. So, she runs to her cousin Vinnie, who runs a bounty hunting operation, and black males him into letting her take one of his cases. So, she chooses the case about a man accused of murder because when...or IF she tracks him down, she will then get $10,000. Pretty simple, hu? Nope. He turns out to be the sexy charmer that took her virginity when they were kids. And he still has that effect on her after all these years! So...the chase is on. I thought this book was a lot of fun. I breezed right through it and it thoroughly enjoyed it. I really enjoyed watching this poor girl strive to gain respect and the money she needs to get her life back in order, and all the extra characters that pop up. She is silly, witty, strong minded, vengeful, and just a blast. I recommend this book to anyone! Romance lovers, adventure lovers, mystery lovers. Even thriller lovers. You will NOT be disappointed!! I am ready to start the second book to the Stephanie Plumb series. Can't wait!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is full of adventure and hilariously funny situations. You can believe that this might happen to this gal. I love the family angle."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"These are the most entertaining books I have read. You will fall in love with Steph and her supporting cast immediately! A must read for anyone who loves a good story!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I couldn't put this one down. It was great. If you are looking for a laugh you have found it with this one. I think there is a little bit of Stephanie Plum in all of us - at least I like to think so! Read it - you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book began my recent and VERY REAL addiction for Janet Evanovich's series. They read so fast, and I find myself literally putting the books down so I can laugh out loud and catch my breath. Her writing is just wonderful, and the relationship between Stephanie and Joe is brilliantly written. In fact, I can't wait until tomorrow to get the next book to see if they hook up again. Go out and get all the books in the series--I guarantee you won't be a bit disappointed! However, just as I will be after reading number six, you'll be disappointed because you'll have to wait for number 7 to come out."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed this novel. Well written, very funny. One word of warning for the &quot;thin skin&quot; crowd. There is a bit of obsenity in the book. While it is all in character, I could see some folks taking offense. I think what I like best about Stephenie Plum is that is a klutz and knows it. A great read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this book and I normally just read romance. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes great action, characters and a lot of humor. Stephanie Plum is so real and she is somebody you could relate to. I love the men in this story. I honestly have a crush on Ranger. Joe is ok too! Anybody will enjoy this book. I already went out and bought all her others in this series and can't wait to start book #2. GO AHEAD YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Maybe it was timing-but I loved this book! I read it in two days after spending my summer wading through two 900 page novels. I was desperately seeking an easy, breezy read. Does this ever fit that bill! Like many other readers, I couldn't help giggling out loud at some of the ridiculous situations Stephanie Plum gets herself into. This would be the perfect book for a long plane ride-as long as your seatmate doesn't mind your occasional outbursts!I look forward to catching up with the rest of this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The humor is REAL. Found myself laughing outloud. Down to earth characters that could really exist in the &quot;Burg&quot;. Fast moving action that keeps you from putting it down chapter after chapter. Can't wait to get my hands on the next one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book made me laugh and scared me at the same time. Grandma Mazur has to be the funniest charcter in this story. The scene where she plays with her grand daughter's gun had me in stiches. I don't think that I have ever laughed that hard at any other scene in a book. The story of Stephanie is great to. I like the way that she is not portrayed as a proffesional in the business of bounty hunting but rather a woman who falls into the proffesion because she needs the money. She makes the mistakes most amatures would make, but she does wind up being the hero, thus becoming a strong heroin. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys their mystery stories with a does of humor. I enjoyed this so much that I intend to read the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm a fan of Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries and her nutty detective, Kinsey Millhone. I heard that Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels were in the same vein, so I picked up One for the Money to check it out. After finishing it, I couldn't help but think what a pity.... The plot's pacing and the character development are truly excellent. Janet Evanovich does a fine job of fleshing out her story and characters to get you sucked into the action. The pity comes in that Evanovich can't seem to tell a story without using gutter talk. Grafton's infrequent vulgarian lapses are nothing in comparison. Evanovich impulsively injects offensive slang and crass imagery to the point of overkill - are the good people of Trenton really so base? Do they constantly talk and think like oversexed fratboys? The glut of sexual degradation in the book is embarrassingly tacky. Evanovich has enough talent to omit the prurient language, which detracts from the realism and charm of her writing and reduces her characterizations to crude caricatures."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After hearing so many great things about Evanovich's series, I decided to start with the first one. I must say I was very disappointed. The quality of the writing made me feel like I was reading a romance novel, with non of the romance parts. In addition, although I must admit I did giggle a few times during the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, I also only give 1 star to books that I can not finish), I really could not stand Stephanie, the main character. I have read many wonderful books where you are supposed to hate the main character. This was not Evanovich's intention, however. This was a book where you were supposed to be on Stephanie's side the entire time. All I could think of the entire time was how pathetic she was. And not even in an interesting to read about pathetic type of way. Please do not waste your time or money on this book..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have not read the book yet, but my daughter has and recommended it to me.Usually always enjoy the books she has suggested."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had read a lot about this series in reviews, but I had never got round to reading any of its installments. Not having any at hand, I decided I might well start with number one. I am having a pretty big issue with this book and, after researching a bit, I figured it's because I'm Italian and some things are just not part of my cultural background. The issue has to do with bounty hunting itself (which would probably affect my judgement of any book I happened to read in this series because, let's face it: that's what it is all about).All the things bounty hunters do and that Stephanie more or less successfully attempts to accomplish would be totally forbidden in my country. Stun guns, pepper spray (or any other kinds of spray, etc.) and such weapons are all illegal in Italy and it's not that easy to have access to a gun. I know all this is different in the US and I'm not criticizing, although the idea that anyone close to me could be handling that stuff within my range makes me pretty uncomfortable. To me only law enforcement should be allowed to handle weapons, provided they have proved to be stable and reliable people.Sticking to the book, I am having a rough time rooting for someone who's try to bring down someone else (criminals, ok, but still) by shooting at them, spraying them, breaking into their homes and cuffing them. And all of this not in the name of justice, but of money. I read and watch my procedural shows and I have no trouble rooting for cops, lawyers, medical examiners and what not, but I just can't root for a bounty hunter. Even if it's a sloppy one like Stephanie. Just like I wouldn't be able to root for someone who told on someone else to their teacher or on their neighbors for tax evasion. I can't find someone like that likeable. I don't appreciate this kind of war between individuals in the name of gain. At one point in the book, Ranger gets hold of the keys to an apartment because the super gives them to him. Is he really entitled to ask for those keys or was this just for the sake of the story? I sure hope my super, if I had one, would not hand out my keys to the first guy who comes claiming them. Even criminals have their rights. The same goes for Stephanie stealing Morelli's car. He should've sued her for that, especially since I take it that it will be blown up in the following part of the book (I've seen the movie trailer).Another issue is with the premise, not so much that Stephanie gets involved with all this, which does require a certain stretch of the imagination, but that someone who has a decent family with an average income would not receive support from said family. This is Italian bias again, and I realize that. But if I were out of job my parents would never let me get my car confiscated, my phone line or electricity disconnected and eat, as my only source of nourishment, figs or stuff covered with mold. Certainly they would not let me go out and put my life at risk instead of paying for my expenses, at least temporarily. To me the entire situation is difficult to believe.Apart from that, I'm still in the first half of the book, so I don't have an overall view of it yet. The writing isn't bad or boring, although nothing particularly exciting happens either. If all the books are going to be about catching this or that guy I don't think they'll be able to keep my interest. The humor is enjoyable, but nothing that had me rolling on the floor laughing, at least yet.Morelli is to me the classic macho I would steer clear from like chicken pox, I really can't find anything likeable about him, but I'll give him a chance to improve on me if I keep reading.Overall it's a light read with quite an amount of cliches (hispanic lowlives and so on). I can't give it any more than three stars."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One of the most boring mystery/crime novels that I have read. It was predictable the language was uninspired. I would highly recommend Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly over this author."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"So I do admit, I decided to finally read/listen to the book only because there was a movie coming out that is based on the book. And my #1 rule about books made into movies is, always read the book first. I liked this one, its classic chit lit, humorous, suspenseful, and a little romance and gore thrown in there. I just can't believe there are 18, 18! books in the series. I mean how much more could happen to her? I was a little disappointed there were any good steamy scene between Stephanie and Moreilli but I'm guess those are to come in the next 17 books. I also read a review where the person was lamenting about the spandex shorts, so I started counted how many times there were referenced. For the record, I think Stephanie only wore them about 4 times and her grandma 1 time. That wasn't even the most annoying part! I think it was the amount of times she used the word \\"probably\\" and there was no way I could count that. I actually could look it up on my kindle, its probably (ha ha) 100+ times.And also take into the face that the book was yeah published what 1994? I'm pretty sure I was still wearing spandex shorts, actually I'm positive spandex shorts were still in style. Anyways I think I'll probably (LOL I'm so hilarious) pick up the next one. Luckily these are so old my library has them in abundance. yeah for libraries!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After hearing so much about this series I decided to give it a go. Thankfully it was free.Stephanie Plum turns to being a bounty hunter because she lost her job and needs money. Yet has enough stashed to buy a slew of new bounty hunter items, including a $400 gun. Um, how about feeding yourself or paying your rent with that? You go after a wanted MURDERER in heels and a skirt? Three different times? Really? You are willing to sell your appliances to buy a car, but not pay your rent or buy food. You plan on spending the 10 grand you think you're going to get by bringing in someone on furniture and new appliances? What about catching up on rent, bills, and feed yourself? Yes, let's take a guy's car and see what happens.I'm not sure how Stephanie is supposed to be likable considering how much of an idiot she is. She is your stereotypical brain dead Jersey girl.Like others I found the sexism to be way over the top. Annoyingly so.Lula and Grandma were the only two characters worth hearing about IMO. I have zero interest in reading another book from this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My mom got me hooked. Being a Jersey girl I can relate to Stephanie Plum and her crazy family. This book was fast paced and funny. I could not wait to see what happened. I plan on seeing the movie and hope its as good as the book.

It is good fluff read but if you are looking for a true mystery, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first book of 18 is actually the worst. The book is what I would consider \\"pretty good\\" on it's own but AMAZING as an over all series. I truly recommend you read the whole series. Each book is better than the previous one. I cry from laughing so hard as I get into the double digits. This is a book you can't take seriously. It's definitely a light-hearted just for fun type of book that turns into a Lucy/Ethel comedy type of series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The book arrived very promptly and was in the condition stated in the description.

I have just finished 12 and can not wait to get 13 after Christmas!Check out Janets web page also for more info on the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Hilarious.

Don't read unless you want to be hooked."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I orderd the book \\"One For the Money\\"from Amazon as I have her whole set of 18[so far], but I had lent the first one out to my godmother, and never got it back. The books are fun, quick reading of a bounty hunter that needed a job, but is aways getting in trouble and calls for extra help from her boyfriend a policeman or another bounty hunter called Ranger.Other charactures include her grandmother, that loves funerals, and carrying a gun, her friend an ex-ho that helps her catch the bounty when she is bored, and her parents which solve their stess by eating and cooking, and finding boyfriends for their daughter.Do read books in order if possible,for her history. Stephine tells it like it is."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My cousin turned me onto this book and the entire series. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is such a multi-dimensional individual. Whenever she gets in over her head, the other characters are always right there to lend a hand. I promise you will get hooked on this first book which in turn will make you really want to read the rest of the series. BTW, I just learned they are making a movie about this first book. Can't wait until it comes out. Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was amazing!

Will keep you captivated. You will want to read all in the series! A quick and easy read on my iPhone Kindle App!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"You can't read the first twenty pages of this book and not get hooked. Shephanie is so much fun, and good company, and Morelli is a stud. By the time she told the canolli line I couldn't put the book down. Grandma was great."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"As a devoted Stephanie Plum follower, I enjoyed re-reading the first book of the series after seeing the movie. I wanted to go back and compare the movie with the book. I was impressed that the book and the movie were not quite as different as I expected. Can't wait for the next movie."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love the characters in this book. They are so fun! I also really like having an interesting mystery without all the smut and gore. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Maybe I will even see the movie."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Warning, you will break out in spontaneous laughter. Very witty, well written, fast paced and entertaining. Stephanie is a character that most of us can identify with."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This series is humorous, action packed and entertaining. The down side is the language. I would have given it five stars if the language was cleaned up. The characters are great and I enjoy the story lines. I particularly like that it's a series so I know what I'll be reading for some time now."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved every minute of this book. I want to do this for a living. From the cat & mouse game between Stephanie & Joe, to the craziness of her family, you can't help but love each character of these Stephanie Plum Novels. I am hooked!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money was a book chosen in my book group. I had read another Evanovich that I wasn't impressed with but this was a delightfully different experience. From the beginning I wanted to continue to read.This was also the first book I read on Kindle. One for the Money was a great introduction to a wonderful system. It held my place, went back and forth so easily.I am looking forward to continuing the series, it was so intriguing!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I liked the characters in this book and the plot. The book was quick reading. Would like to read the entire series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a blast! A fun, and irrevirent character surrounded by a perfect supporting cast of characters. I'm on # 11 of the 18 books!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A great mystery novel to disappear with. I didn't find it so addicting that I couldn't put it down, but I did enjoy following Stephanie as she takes on her first bounty hunting case. Funny at times and suspenseful at others, there's something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I don't normally read mysteries, but my local librarian suggested this series for me based on the type of romances that I like to read. I wasn't sure if I would like it but I did!Stephanie Plum has lost her job, and she is down to only some moldy bread and a beer in her fridge. With no other options, she gets a job as a bounty hunter for her Cousin Vinny. Her target is Morelli, a man she has a history with. He is a cop accused of murder and now on the run. Stephanie learns as she goes as she tries to collect the $10,000 reward. When she goes to see Ramirez, a boxer who is involved with the case, she realizes she is in over her head. Ramirez is a phsycho who has set his sights on Stephanie , and the one who keeps saving the day and her life is none other than Morelli. Can Stephanie capture Morelli and keep Ramirez at bay?The first person narrative is engaging. Stephanie's views on her life in New Jersey is hilarious. Her family adds a touch of humor and helps the novel not get bogged down with all the violence. I really enjoyed this novel, and I can definitly see how some romance will be in the mix in the next novels. I love a mix of mystery and romance, and this series seems to have it all. I look forward to reading the next books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read the majority of this book in one day. I just couldn't put it down.

The book (One For The Money by Janet Evanovich) was ordered on 6/26 and received 7/6 and was in the shape it was said to be. I will seriously consider ordering from them in the future."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a great summer read. Stephanie Plum is hanging on by a thread in her life as a single female. After a string of bad luck which has her losing her job, going into debt, and selling half her possessions, she decides to take a dangerous job as a bounty hunter. She bites off more than she can chew when she decides to bring in a cop accused of murder. She has never handled a gun before and enlists the help of a few helpful male friends, one being the one she's trying to bring in!

Very funny - I highly recommend. I am hooked on this series. Already read 2 and 3. I'm ready for the 4th in the series. Lots of suspense, action, humor, and even some romance. Light reading. Take a break from the routines and work - relax with a Stephanie Plum novel. You'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked up a \\"Plum\\" novel in a clearance pile at WalMart one day, brought it home and read it. The next thing I did was to find and buy every single one of the 15 (now #16 is out) books in the series! They're purely laugh-out-loud hilarious and I adore the characters. The only problem is there's not a new one every week for me to read! So I'm saving my complete hardback set in the bookcase for when I get older and have forgotten the plots, so I can read them all again! :)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've only read the much later entries in this series, so it's nice to see where it got its start. There was a good balance of silly and serious in this one along with a good introduction to the cast of characters. This was a fun read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Evanovich is laugh out loud funny. This book is a fast read. I can't wait to start her next one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first book in the Plum series about a Jersey girl out of work who blackmail's her cousin into a job as a bounty hunter.

This book sets the stage for the many books that follow in Stephanie's life as a bounty hunter."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a VERY funny book. Very easy relaxing read, great beach book etc. I look forward to reading more of the Stephanie Plum novels and hope they are as good as the first. The grandmother is a HOOT!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I first read this book 2 years ago after having listened to my family laugh about the characters for years. I have read and reread this series of books several times. They are hilarious.In this book, we meet Stephanie. She has been laid off and bribes her wierd cousin into hiring her as a bounty hunter.She has absoloutely no skills and her first job is a cop accused of murder, Joe Morelli.Turns out they have quite the history. And I don't want to spoil any of the laughs by telling you about their history, you have to read it to beleive it. This is a great book and you'll have to read the others, too. They are too funny! Great characters!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked up the book at my friends urging at how great it was. I usually don't have much time for reading but I needed something to read on the plane so I thought I would give it a try. These books are addicting. Since the trip two months ago, I have read 1 through 6 of her books plus Full Bloom, and Manhunt. I love Janet Evanovih's writing style. It is just plain fun."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"actually 5 stars is NOT enough for this rating. a friend of mine lent me her books (im in the middle of the 5th one right now) and i started these about a week ago. they are addicting and obviously fast past. i caught myself not wanting to put these books down so many nights i caught myself up until 3 in the morning because i needed to know more.Stephanie Plum has been out of work and she needs money FAST. she has a hamster rex and an apartment that she needs to keep (otherwise she'll have to have to move back into her parents house (yikes ~ even YOU wont want her to do that! youll be begging)in comes her cousin Vinnie, bondsman. she pleads for a job to bring in people who have skipped their courtdates, in otherwords Bounty Hunter. Stephanie soon learns she may be in over her head. she's staking out Joe Morrelli, a cop who shot a man and trying to prove his innocence. On top of that she has a boxer, rapist, lunatic after her.Does she get her man? you'll have to read to find out...i dont want to give too much away bu in these series you'll fall in love with stephanie! you'll actually wish you had a hamster! and i know i didnt mention her but you'll wish you had a Lula as a friend and for all the ladies out there ~ dont even get me started on Joe Morelli!! (mmmm...mmm....mmm!!!)these books have desire, adventure, silliness (there have been many occassions where you'll actually laugh out loud), and longing. The narration is so unbelieveable, pretty much through the whole book you'll feel as though YOU are Stephanie! The images are so vivid in my mind it's unbelieveable. it's like \\"That's how i am!!\\" \\"hahaha that's me!!\\"just make sure you start with the 1st book and dont skip around. Now dont think these books are \\"women\\" books because my friends husband AND her father also enjoyed these books as much as us....(and christmas is coming!!! (hint hint)i dont want to give TOO much away because the excitment may be lost but i guarantee you wont be dissappointed by Janet Evanovich's dear Miss Stephanie Plum. ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have been wanting to read Janet Evanovich's popular series starring Stephanie Plum for quite some time, and when the eleventh entry came out earlier this year and I realized how much catching up I'd have to do, I decided not to wait another minute to begin ONE FOR THE MONEY. And as I started reading, I just kept thinking to myself, \\"Why did I wait so long to read these books?\\" I was immediately hooked on Stephanie Plum, Janet Evanovich's lively, realistic heroine.ONE FOR THE MONEY introduces readers to Stephanie Plum, lingerie-buyer-turned-bounty-hunter from New Jersey. At the beginning of the novel, Stephanie's been out of work for six months. Her car is being repossessed, she's hocking appliances for cash, her refrigerator is empty (save for some hamster nuggets), and she's in danger of losing her apartment. Desperate for a job, Stephanie bribes her couisn Vinnie (who's into kinky sex and is desperate to keep that a secret from his wife) to give her a job working as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment: Pick up Joe Morelli, a cop accused of murder, and receive $10,000, 10% of the bond. Complicating matters is the fact that Morelli took Stephanie's virginity behind the counter of a bagel shop 14 years ago, and she still finds him irresistible. Add into the mix a crazy boxer who is harrassing Stephanie, two large prostitutes, and Stephanie's delightfully colorful and strange family--and you have a recipe for a wildly entertaining and tightly-written crime novel.Janet Evanovich's characters are expertly crafted. Stephanie is a tough-as-nails Jersey girl, who still manages to be vulnerable and funny and have a healthy libido--which makes her very realistic and lovable. The story is fast-paced; Stephanie's narrative voice is straightforward and clever, with just the right balance of toughness and sensitivity.And, even though you may scoff at the seemingly outlandish plot (out-of-work lingerie buyer becomes bounty hunter overnight), the best part of the novel is that Stephanie's story is entirely believable and delightfully fun. Evanovich has successfully created characters you really root for (yes, even the bad guys) in a location that couldn't be more perfect: the streets of Trenton, New Jersey, in bad neighborhoods where cars are spray-painted with obscenities, and in good neighborhoods where middle-aged women threaten to tell mothers what their adult children have been up to. Stephanie Plum is an unforgettable heroine, and ONE FOR THE MONEY is a fabulous introduction to her series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked this book up after reading a review of the 10th Stephanie Plum novel, and being a systematic person, I figured I needed to start at the beginning. What a treat! I'm so glad there are so many Plum books to look forward to!Evanovich gets Plum's neighborhood just right: a blue-collar enclave where people stick around after growing up and where your old classmate's mother threatens to tell on you to your mother, even though you're quite grown up. I grew up in such a neighborhood! And Plum's character reflects the place she calls home: tenacious and sassy, but also naive and inept at the same time. The other characters are well fleshed out and just as interesting.The plot takes Ms. Plum from one unbelievably dangerous yet wacky situation to the next, as she learns the ropes of the bounty hunter business. She meets obstacle after obstacle and mortal danger, but they just make her more determined to get her man. Oh, her empty refrigerator and rusty car help motivate, too.I am very much looking forward to seeing how Ms. Plum advances in her stumbled-into field of work!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One of the cardinal rules of mystery writing should be: Do not ever have the criminal hold a detective hostage and confess into a tape recorder. Sure as shootin' the detective is going to squirm out of the danger and nail the crook. Real criminals would shoot and be done with it. Real perps don't often feel the need to waste time in explanations, especially to someone who is going to be dead shortly.Mystery writers continue to use this easy way out, especially when it's obvious that the evidence adduced is insufficient to convict anyone of anything in court. This book is a good case in point. Perhaps the writer just couldn't think of another way to end the book.The characters are interesting enough, although Ms. Plum seems to be a clone escaped from Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series: smart-mouthed, tough, enduring. The plot, up to almost the end, is more than a trifle outlandish (a complete novice cutie pie hiring out as a bounty hunter in a tough city--NOT!). The atmosphere (Trenton, NJ) is gritty and mean; the descriptions of the Garden State capital would induce few readers to want to visit.The humor has its moments, although some asides seem misplaced, askew. Perhaps the subsequent novels from the series are improved, but I will probably never know first hand after reading this one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is the most hilariously witty bounty hunter ever created. Evanovich combines Stephanie's wit, with a fast paced adventure in which Stephanie is initiated as a bounty hunter by trying to bring in a vetern cops charged with murder--who happens to also be a childhood friend. Along the way, we meet two smart mouthed hookers with hearts of gold, a rapist/mysoginist boxer, and a mysterious superhero bounty hunter. After being shot, almost blown up, rooting in garbage dumpsters, and roundly humiliated by almost everyone she comes in contact with, Stephanie gets her man, and justice prevails all around. And she has fun doing it.The \\"sleeper\\" character is Stephanie's grandmother--the soul of a smart mouthed teenager trapped in the body of a traditional Italian grandmother. the first family diner scene is worth the price of admission all by itself!My only question is--why isn't this book a movie yet?"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading this book, I bought the entire Stephanie Plum series. Now this is a character I can relate to! She is a horrible bounty hunter and has real problems! She has problems with men, family, cars you name it. It is nice to read a book that is realistic for a change. I highly recommend this book and all of the rest in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was in great shaped when received...."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money- after reading the first one I am glad I found this great series to continue on with!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I downloaded this on my Kindle I got for Christmas!

Am anxious to start the 2nd."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, easy read. The characters are funny, down-to-earth and likable. Seems like a real American family! This book will seriously make you laugh until you have tears in your eyes.

I read the newest one first and enjoyed it so much I decided to go back to the beginning and get to know the background of all the characters! I am now truly hooked on this series and can't wait to start the next book! Bravo"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I don't think I've ever laughed so much while I've read a book. I think I related to this because I know what it feels like to need a job so badly you'll do just about anything. Too me the Grandmother makes the book! Could not put it down and I'm thinking I might skip the movie because the book was that good!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed the story, but I wouldn't have minded if the profane language had been left out. I found it to be unnecessary to the actual story."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Easy to read- great story and funny lines.

For those of you with ties to the Phillie,New York, New Jersey region, you know these people/places, so there's an added kick to the tale."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A cute series that is light but entertaining. A really good series to read when you want to relax and enjoy yourself"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"You've got to love Evanovich's main character, Stephanie Plum, who reinvented herself into a bounty hunter. Be prepared to laugh out loud at some of the antics of Plum's friends and family. Her grandmother was especially colorful when her primary entertainment is visiting viewing at the local funeral parlors.This was certainly a fun murder mystery with just the right amount of lust, violence and humor to make it extremely believable. Her description of the families and their location draws you right into the story. Highly entertaining escape."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Plum is so cool. There's no need for me to say more besides Evanovich is as cool as Plum. I'm going to purchase the next novel right now. I look forward to starting it immediately and by the way it's quarter til six in the morning."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this book and have reread it countless times!

Just fun reading, nothing intense, deep, or mind bending. Just fun that's it, and sometimes that's all you need."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was not a big fan of mystery based novels. Yes, I like Agatha Christy but that was as far as I went. Until I started reading the Stephanie Plum series. But I love the charaters that inhabit the world of Stephanie Plum. I am sure I know some of them very well. I especially like Grandma, Dad and Rex. Janet Ivanovich makes me laugh out loud as I am reading. Great humor, she really tickles my funny bone. I thank my book club group for putting me in touch with this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It is a great read.

So much so I ordered the 2nd and 3rd in the series.And will most likely order more of her books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Well written, with a plot that doesn't just move forward but drags you along with it, breathless. And FUNNY - you will drive the people around you crazy, constantly reading funny parts out to them. Until they snatch it out of your hands to read it for themselves.I have read the first eight of these books and have never been disappointed. So many writers have trouble keeping up the pace. Not Janet Evanovich.If you have never read a Stephanie Plum novel, I envy you. You are about to discover an author who will make you laugh again and again, and provide you with a book you will constantly recommend to your friends. This book - and the ones that follow it - are just THAT good."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Witty banter, fun mental pic.s of the good guys and the bad guys.

Looking forward to seeing the movie and reading #2!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I saw the movie first with my family who had all read the book and the movie was really good so I wanted to read the book and it was not a let down.... It had a great plot and characters you loved and wanted for yourself... I'm ready to start the next book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is a very good book. I started this series because I really like this author and am looking forward to reading all of the books in this series. I have a kindle that I am able to download these books within seconds so it makes it very fun and easy to read!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This first book of the Stephanie Plum series is a must for anybody who likes a laugh. It is sharp and funny and witty and introduces some unforgettable characters such as Grandma Mazur. If you haven't yet discovered the series, I envy you!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was utterly charmed by Stephanie Plum's auspicious debut. In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Janet Evanovich launched the career of everyone's favorite Jersey girl. Trenton-tough Stephanie is so broke she has to drink her last beer for breakfast. She manipulates her cousin Vinnie into letting her give the bond recovery business a try. She has to bring in Joe Morelli, an ex-boyfriend from her teengirl years. Her attempts to catch this cop accused of murder are hilarious, as has been the rest of Ms. Evanovich's winning series. Great book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is like you and me. She has money trouble, her car just got taken away by the repo man, and she's behind on her bills and rent. So, upon hearing that her cousin Vinnie's got an opening at his bail bonds company, she reluctantly goes there so she pull herself out this financial abyss.And so Evanovich begins her hilarious Stephanie Plum series. The thing that differentiates this book from many others in the genre is that Stephanie is a normal person. She's not a sleuth or a PI. She's a bounty hunter trying to learn the trade and stumbles into much of the information she receives to help catch Joe Morelli, the rogue cop who she must bring back to justice.Another plus is that Evanovich is a master at hiding the finale in this book. Once I finished the novel, I just closed it and said, &quot;WOW!&quot; It was totally unexpected.All that being said, the book is extremely well written. Evanovich has a flair for description and the reader feels as if he/she is there with Stephanie, sniffing out the clues to catch Morelli. Another bonus are the hilarious minor characters, Lula and Jackie. They are a couple of prostitutes Stephanie meets. Their confidence and brashness is a nice contrast to Stephanie's timidity.So, to conclude, if you haven't read this yet, you are truly missing out on one of the fresh new voices in the mystery genre."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am a reader, a lover of books. I decided to check out One for the Money, and I could not stop laughing. I never laugh like this over a book. I get a chuckle or two, but Stephanie Plum is SO hilarious I can't read it in public! You want to have fun? Yu want to laugh out loud and read a good story? Read Ms. Evanovich's work. I'm on number Three and enjoying it every bit as much as One and Two. Ms. Evanovich I know you can get tired of the same character, get burned out. But I'm begging you to NEVER stop writing Stephanie Plum mysteries. I haven't had this much fun ever. Please consider putting a warning label on your work. CAUTION: Contents may lead to spontaneous, uncontrollable laughter. Thank you for the Plum series! Breezee, a FAN forever!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Hmm... I always looked at a Janet Evanovich cover and think, this must be one of those bland female mysteries. Then one day, I met a fanatic of Evanovich who introduced me to the series, and I swear, I laugh and laughed. Stephanie is not the heroines where you want to marry, but rather one that you'd want a bottle of beer and and movie with."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am always so excited when I find a new series of good mysteries! Janet Evanovich has done a great job in portraying a funny, gutsy heroine who does what she has to to survive. From driving her graffiti-d Nova to learning to use a gun, Stephanie Plum is equal to any situation life throws her (with the possible exception of the mamas in the Burg!). This book is fast-paced, funny and just plain fun. Excellent summer (or anytime you need a lift) reading!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Anyone who doesn't like this book has NO SENSE OF HUMOR. This is not (repeat: NOT) a serious, gritty mystery a la Sue Grafton. This is a completely fun book, pure Godiva chocolate. I have given this book to many people, all of whom loved it and bought the others in the series. You really can't go wrong with Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Always on the lookout for either a good mystery/detective/police novel or a light humor book, I was pleased to find one book filling both roles. One for the Money mixes light, realistic characters and a fun, yet exciting, storyline. Stephanie Plum goes from unemployed to a bounty hunter and doesn't do it without hitches. Realistically, she runs into some problems that would happen to most people trying this line of work. There is the suspense and twists that a good mystery novel exhibits tempered with the romance and fun characters( Stephanie and Grandma Mazur) that I am sure you will enjoy, no matter if you are a man or a woman."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I never enjoy a book fully when I don't care for the side characters. This series has two of the best: Rex, the hamster, who knows to enjoy a night on the wheel, and Grandma Mazur with her quirky sense of humour. I love them to bits."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What I love about the Stephanie Plum series is the fact that the humor is never self-conscious. With some books you get the feeling the author is saying, &quot;Look, I just said something funny.&quot; Never the case with these! It's rare to find books that make one laugh out loud, but these never fail. I just hate having to wait a year in between books!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Our book club read this book, and what a great selection! This book was a lot of fun. I found myself laughing out loud, then biting my nails then trying to figure out what exactly was going on. The characters are rich, fun and the mystery is a good one. It'll keep you turning the pages and wanting more. I'm hooked on the series, and have already grabbed the second book! Stephanie Plum is an original, and a realistic woman in today's world. Can't wait to see what she does next!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"At first I wasn't sure if I would like it, but once I got with the groove, I realized I was reading a hilarious book! The ending was wrapped up a little quick for me, though. I'd like to see Stephanie's skills develop more as a sleuth, whether a lucky one or not. Too often our heros spring full-grown from the author's imagination (i.e. Sherlock and Poirot), and we have no clue where they started. That makes them unbelievable albeit enjoyable at best. I am still a bit tentative about Evanovich's ability to keep this going, but I am going to give it a try."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich is now my favorite author.

She is tough and soft at the same time. As she embarks on her new career as a bounty hunter, the fun and action begins. I read the second book in this series before I read this one.

But I now have the perfect set of books (One for the Money, Two for the Dough, and Three to Get Deadly) to give to every friend, acquaintance, and person standing near me in the same bookstore. I've read this book several times and still laugh out loud every time. I recommend it to everyone. I intend to have my more mature high school students read it as well. Thank you Janet Evanovich.

She goes to work for her cousin Vinnie, picking up bail jumpers. Problem is, most don't want to be picked up. Bigger problem? Her first assignment is Joe Morelli, a cop accused of murder. He's also a man whose philosophy toward women seems to be use-them, lose-them. At least that's how he treated Stephanie years ago.Stephanie's first assignment makes for a great story and leaves you hungry for more! Great characters, wonderful set-up."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first half of this book is great. The characters are quirky and entertaining, the mystery is involving, and the book moves along at a nice pace.The second half of the book is where things fall apart. One problem is that what I'd call the second half of the book is only 30 pages long. It's almost as if Evanovich was under pressure to wrap up the book and get it to the publisher. Now, this book isn't the first murder mystery to suffer from the \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" type of ending, and it's still a good read, just not up to a 5-star level.Then again, with this price and this genre, you're probably not looking for \\"Dr. Zhivago\\". It is what it is, and it delivers that well."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"&quot;One for the Money&quot; by Janet Evanovich is the first book in the Stephanie Plum mystery series. It's about Stephanie Plum, just another girl who needs a job, finding work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie. The book is filled with hilarious characters you'll love, and a couple you'll hate, and overall it's a very great read. I read it in one day, it was so good. It was my first Janet Evanovich book, and I can't wait to read the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th! If you like crime or mystery (it's definately not as heavy as Grisham), than check this one out, I think you'll like it. It isn't a bestseller for nothing.

I plan to get the entire series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is out of work, her car has been reposessed, and she has no money. She resorts to eating dinner every, single night, at her parents home. Until of course she gets a job as a bounty hunter. All she needs to do is try and stay alive as she catches people who have jumped bail, and she'll collect $10,000. It sounds easier than it is. Her first job is to nail Joe Morelli. The person who nailed her when she was 16. You'd think it would be easy trying to nail someone whom you know (or knew), but with the sexual tension between the two of them, Stephanie may have bitten off more than she can chew. Way more.This was an interesting first mystery in the Stephanie Plum series. With all of the hoopla, I thought that this would be some sort of work of art, but I wasn't too impressed. My word of advice to potential readers: If you don't have a sense of humor, don't buy the book. The mystery takes somewhat of a backseat to the humor."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is my idol. After encountering some hard times with money, she gets a job as a bounty hunter, because she has connections (her sleazy cousin Vincent). She has no idea what she is doing. She's not good at what she does. But she does it regardless. Her first real case is to track down Joe Morelli - a local cop who also just happens to be the man who deflowered her in a bakery when they were teenagers. He's wanted for murder, and is now running from the law. Stephanie's job is to find him, cuff him, and bring him down to the station. Finding him is tough enough, but resisting his charms when she finally does is a whole other story. I read this first book of the series in about 2 days. It's one of those books you shouldn't read before going to bed, because you'll forget to GO to bed until you're finished with the book. I have read every book in the series since, and while they are all great, none of them compare to the first one. I work at a bookstore, and I have recommended this book to about a dozen customers, and they have all come back for the rest of the series. I haven't heard of one person who doesn't like it! There isn't even one character you will dislike, because they are all great, from Stephanie's crazy, occasionally gun-toting Grandma Mazur, to Lula, the wild prostitute she befriends. Heck - you'll even fall in love with her pet hamster. If you are looking for a light, easy read and a good chuckle or two, READ THIS BOOK NOW. Then pick up the other 7 in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Surprisingly enough, my aunt Cathy started me reading this series, and I have to say that after reading all seven of her books (I'm waiting for eight to come out in paper back), there hasn't been one that hasn't made me bust a gut laughing. Stephanie is hilariously inept, honest, and so real that I wouldn't be surprised to run into her walking down the street. And Grandma Mazur is the funniest supporting character in the series. Her antics never fail to make me laugh. These books were not what I expected from a mystery series, but they are refreshingly different, laugh-out-loud funny, and I am proud to say that they comprise the majority of my tiny college bookshelf.Keep 'em coming, Janet!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich has presented us with irreverent, fiesty, often funny and always believable Stephanie Plum in her &quot;One for the Money&quot; novel.

Stephanie Plum is like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, with a Jersey attitude. The characters are so real, but humerous. The danger is thrilling as Stephanie weaves her way through the ghetto to get her man. How can you resist a book that features a cousin named Vinny, a mentor named Ranger, a neighborhood pizza parlor, diving into a dumpster to find the car keys, a butcher/bookmaker named Sal, a geriatric flasher, and a fictional Mike Tyson? Not to mention Mama, Grandma and the nice young man they invite for dinner who sells appliances. This book has attitude - mystery with humor.

The story's leading characters are Stephanie Plum, a New Jersey native and Joe Morelli, who stole Stephanie Plum's virginity when they were in high school. Stephanie Plum was laid off from her job, so she rapidly becomes poor and has to sell whatever she has. In order to make a living, she meets her cousin Vinnie, A Bail bondsman. He gives her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000. Her mission is to bring in Joe Morelli, who becomes a cop accused of murdering in cold blood and has jumped bail. Because of the huge amount of money and good opportunity of revenge for her lost virginity, she accepts this case even though she is afraid of gun and has no experience to do this job at all. After she starts this case, she encounters a lot of problems and difficulties. For example, she is pursued by a psycho nutcase, her borrowed car is bombed and her expensive new handbag is shot by her by accident.... One For The Money has three outstanding characters. First, it is easy to read. Janet Evanovich's writing is pretty smooth and clever. The dialogue is breezy, witty and bright as well as the plot is ingenious and fresh. Secondly, it is fascinating. It combines the aspects of mystery, humor and suspense. What is more, it has no slow or dull parts. Once I start reading it, I am interested the whole way through. Finally, the cast of all caharacters in well-rounded. The chemistry between Stephanie and Joe. Grandma Mazur is bust-a-gut funy, as is the portrayal of family life in the burg. Ranger is appropriately tough and mysterious. Ramirez is very creepy. I highly recommend this book to all mystery lovers not only because of its fascinating story but also because of its excellent description of cast of each character in the story. I believe no one will be disappointed from reading this book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a fun story - simple to read and fast paced. You will enjoy it until the very end. Great twists and turns with a hint of passion and lust. It is great clean fun."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Well, if you're Stephanie Plum it's time to take charge of your life. After her career as a lingerie buyer (for a supplier cheesier than Fredrick's of Hollywood), Stephanie finds herself without any more possessions to hawk off. Her mother suggests she go work for her cousin, Vinnie, at his bail bonds company. Of course, Stephanie doesn't want the filing job...she wants to be a Bounty Hunter.The cast includes lots of quirky characters that keep you entertained. Stephanie hooks up with a seasoned BH named Ranger to learn the ropes. He takes her under his wing but your left wanting him to take her other places... Stephanie also comes back into the life of Joe Morelli. He is a vice cop and they have a history that stared when she was six and he was eight. (Not to mention the fact that she lost her virginity to him)Between these two men of honor, she gets the assistance she needs to apprehend the bad guys. To get her daughter over more often, Stephanie's mom bribes her with desserts. The dialogues at these dinners are snappy and laugh out loud funny.Janet Evanovich has created a suspense-ridden romp that grabs you by the shirt and drags you in for a wild ride."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first in the Stephanie Plum series and is fantastic. You are introduced to Stephanie a Trenton girl who is divorced (didn't pick a very good husband) who has gone through about every job imaginable. Now she has decided to become a bounty hunter, as she has a cousin who she can blackmail in the bail bond business where it seems there is some pretty good money picking up people.Lori Petty has a great NJ girl accent to be Stephanie, though I listened to one of the later ones first and Stephanie will always be the voice of Debi Mazer to me.What ensues is a fantastic chase through parts of Trenton and the surrounding area, car bombs, introductions to Ranger (one major bounty hunter who appears in all the Plum books) toxic waste and then there is Grandma Mazer. Ok she is one spunky old Lady.So what is her first assignment? Well she is to nail a former vice cop who is on the run - but not that fast this one also happens to be the irresistible macho pig who Stephanie has a past with!This story is fast paced and super fun to listen to. If you like Mysteries/Thrillers and women heroes than this is the story for you.This is a definite winner!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a great book, great plot, great characters. I couldn't help laughing out loud. I love Stephanie Plum!Who of us hasn't wanted to run over a former beau with a car. An absolute must read, if you have a sense of humor (unlike some reviewers). No it is not great literature, but who needs that ALL the time.I am only on the fourth in her series, but I wish Ms. Evanovich could crank out one a month. Get this book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich has to be one the the best crime writers to date. I love her characters, plot, and especially, her humor! This book is wonderful from beginning to end!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I honestly did not follow the story line that carefully as i read this book. The reason for this is because I became so wrapped up in the character of Stephanie Plum. The book unfolded rather expectedly with Stephanie and Joe reuniting, but I really had a tough time making sense of the ending - especially the involvement of Jimmy Alpha and how hw went from apologetic boxing manager to drug king-pin. Anyway, the character of Stephanie was so life-like and entertaining (along with her family)that as long as she turned out o.k."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Honestly, I see tons of people saying how awesome this book is and I was so disappointed with it that I actually returned it for a refund. The main character is ridiculous. She's idiotic, consistently walking into situations that any moron can see will backfire and put her in danger. If you like watching people make asses of themselves, this is the book for you. In addition, the boxer-stalker character is NOT humorous in the slightest and the voice mail rape scene was enough to make me stop reading immediately.I was looking for a fun, light read and got an annoying piece of trash."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I bought this novel, which my mother had read about somewhere, for her to give to a cousin. She thought she'd check out the use of &quot;language&quot; and such, before sending it off to said cousin. As a result, she promptly returned the books: too much profanity and sex. So consider this when purchasing for older people."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I didn't like this book. I didn't hate it by any means--I thought it was good enough--but I did not like it. The characters were kind of fun, and it was an easy read. It was also a bit of a page-turner. On the other hand, the main character was utterly and unbelievably dense. I saw nothing romantic about Joe, a guy who molested Stephanie when she was six and took her virginity at eighteen (then never talked to her again and spread rumors about it). I, personally, would probably not make-out with a child molester/player/murderer (but I guess that's just me). Also, were a known rapist and sexual torturer calling me regularly to tell me he was going to rape me, I probably would call the police and not spend all my time alone. Stephanie Plum did the opposite, and somehow the rapist decided not to rape her on her daily early morning jog . . . alone. In short, the book had mostly implausible characters."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Meet Stephanie Plum, a female Barney Fife who due to circumstances beyond her control she becomes a bounty hunter. She bungles her way throughout the book trying to bring in a fugitive name Joe Morelli. Joe and her go way back to high school where he was her first time and was very crude about it. Years later she tried to run him over with a car to get revenge. Add in her straight forward father who makes short comments while hiding behind the sports section, her Mother who still thinks women should be married and pregnant and her crazy grandma (reminds me of Estelle Getty, Golden Girls) and Ranger who gets her out of predicaments she encounters bringing in fugitives. I do not like the character Benito Ramirez who is a professional boxer who thinks it is his right to terrorize women. He becomes obsess with Stephanie making her paranoid which causes more mishaps. I laughed out loud when Granny shot the chicken off the table with Stephanie's gun and was still smiling when I closed the book. This is a refreshing crime novel that is cleverly done with the right amount of wit, surprises and you will fall in love for Stephanie and root for her because she is clearly the underdog in the man world of bounty hunting."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read the book \\"One for the Money\\" by Janet Evanovich. It is about a thirty-year-old woman named Stephanie Plum, and she's got spunk! After she lost her job six months ago, she began to have to sell off the items in her apartment, until she had to turn to her last resort (Her family). Her cousin Vinnie is known for being untrue to his wife and was not her first choice when she walked into his office applying for a job. He ran a bounty hunting business. She needs the money, so she decides to go after the priciest guy. It turns out she knows the man she's supposed to chase after, he's the one that charmed her when she was only 16, Joe Morelli. They still have pretty strong chemistry. So while she's chasing after him with an un-loaded gun, he's evading her by slipping out from right under her nose, because he's trying to find his gun that made it seem like he wasn't shooting for defense and had murdered someone. He's a police officer. So Stephanie Plum is trying to help him so she can help herself get her money. This leads her to Stark street where she meets a man who has something to do with the Morelli Case, and wants nothing more than for Stephanie to sell herself to him. If only bounty hunting were easy! Nothing Stops Stephanie though. You can't help but wonder what will meet her at every corner.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had a witty narration told from the perspective of Stephanie and had witty characters. I picked this book, because I liked the character of Stephanie so much. It was exciting and had a surprising ending that is only uncovered by reading. Stephanie Plum teaches us that with a little more than a week you can go from broke to crazy bounty hunter. She never gives up and is beyond anything anyone could ever imagine a spandex-wearing, divorced thirty year-old to be. On top of that did I mention she's a pretty good bounty hunter? The only thing I didn't like very much was the amount of swearing that there was, but it is an adult book so that's to be expected. It was a great book and I would highly recommend it for those who want to read a really good mystery."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"[close] Stephanie Plum is so smart, so honest, and so funny that her narrative charm could drive a documentary on termites. But this tough gal from New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked this up on a whim after hearing great stuff about the series. I don't regret it.Great story with laugh out loud moments - her parents and dementia ridden grandmother give us some of the funniest scenes I have ever read.This isn't the most intense crime/mystery book you've ever read, but it will keep you guessing and you'll find yourself looking forward to Stephanie's latest escapade.I'll be buying the next book, definitely.

Although this first book isn't as polished or funny as the following books in the series, it is still worth a read. In this book Janet Evanovich is still developing characters and nuances that she will continue to weave through the later books.

She is quirky, clutzy and lovable. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich is a great author. This is not my favorite of her books, but it sets up the series so you need to read it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum's introduction to bounty-hunting isn't glamorous. She sells her furniture to pay her bills, her refrigerator holds nothing but mold an hamster food, and the only job she can find is with a relative's bond shop. However, she charges in with determination and a laugh in her throat, and carries the reader fr5om one mishap to another. Plum is a fun and sassy narrator, and her determination to make it to tomorrow provides excellent motivation for her actions. One for the Money is fantastically fun, and I'll definitely be looking for more Evanovich in the future."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the 1st book of the series (to date there are 15). Stephanie is our heroine and she is one of the best female leads I have read in a very very very long time. Poor Steph is divorced, she has been laid off from her job, her car has been repossessed and she is low on furniture because she had to sell it to pay her rent. At first glance, you may think Stephanie is a loser, but she's not - she's honest and pays her bills (as best as she can) even if that means she has nothing to sit on. Poor Stephanie even mooches meals and laundry from her parents.Stephanie goes to work for her cousin Vinnie, a bailbondsman and mayhem ensues. For some reason, she thinks she is capable of apprehending criminals when her last job was in ladies lingerie. This is just too funny. Her first big case happens to be a man from her high school past and he is a cop who has been framed for murder. He also happens to be the man who took her virginity and she does not remember him too fondly.After many mis-steps, she finally gets her man - sort of. This book is funny, laugh out loud funny and a very quick easy read. I couldn't wait to get to the next installment. Janet Evanovich has a real winner here. I have since read all 15 books and I have loved them all, so I won't critique each one individually. The arsenal of characters grows and you really begin to think you know these people.Give these books a try - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Must read!!

While I would give the story an average three stars, it is the humor that is added as the book follows Stephanie Plum from an unemployed lingerie buyer to a bounty hunter that adds another star.

There is even a movie being made about One for the Money and to be released in 2012."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A name I have probably heard more times than my own, Stephanie Plum. With the new release of the seventeenth book, Smokin' Seventeen, I thought, \\"I should get on this\\". Proud to say I did. I see why it is such a popular series. Plum doesn't have special powers, she isn't supernatural, has no idea how to use a sword or a gun, but she is a great heroine because she has balls of steel. She is funny as hell and does things without thinking them through first which is even more entertaining. Chick lit isn't my thing, but there is so much more to this and I am definitely glad I got on this wagon.One for the Money is about a woman named Stephanie Plum. She is just lost her lackluster job and is in danger of losing her place. Plum hears that a reward of $10000 will be given if out if a bounty hunter can find a man who is in trouble with the law. When she hears that it is an old high school fling of hers, Joe Morelli, (someone who used her and she paid back by breaking his leg with her car), she definitely thinks that it will be worth it. So she decides to become a bounty hunter pretty much overnight. But while investigating, she finds that a simple issue of finding and bringing in Morelli is a part of something far dangerous than she thought.I truly enjoyed the hell out of this. Unfortunately, when I downloaded this from the library, it didn't tell me that it was the abridged audiobook. This means instead of getting the entire book (8 hours' worth), I ended up with roughly 3 hours. So I missed a lot of content which is disappointing, but from the 3 hours that I got, I still loved it. This book was just fun and had me cracking up left and right.The plot was very good. I didn't know what I was getting into when I started this and that was great. Plum is a divorced young woman living in New Jersey (I will save the Jersey jokes for another time) and she is in a tough spot. She is taking on something bigger than herself and runs into a boxer who is creepy as hell. But I love how Evanovich doesn't make this as scary as it can be. She manages to makes this lighthearted (mostly). There are scenes that will freak you out, but Evanovich doesn't make this a horror even though she could have easily. Think of Odd Thomas, just without the supernatural creatures and with lots of laughs, then you have Stephanie Plum.The characters are a riot. I love Plum's family. They are your typical overreaching, Jersey family. I love how Plum's mom keeps telling her all about the people she should date and the jobs she should get. She never lets up. I read that her entire family is insane, but as I said, I got the abridged version, so I didn't get much from the rest of her family members. I am definitely going to get the book because they sound like lots of fun. I really liked Morelli. He was a dog sometimes, but he was likable. I loved the interactions between him and Plum. They were truly two halves of a whole. They deserve each other, they were evenly matched. The book was also read by actress Lori Petty who did a great job bringing the Jersey in the book. It added just another level for me.Overall, this book was fun. I am happy I finally got around to reading it. Couldn't believe just how awesome this book was. It is a mixture of mystery, crime, thriller, and comedy. Great action packed plot, lovable characters, laughs and just a breath of fresh air. This is the beginning of a great relationship. Can't wait to see more of you Ms. Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read this book many, many times. I have also bought the book to give away to friends in order to share such a fun read. I was really surprised that I enjoyed listening to the story unfold. I never thought I would but listening to books is rather pleasant."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money is good and I very much enjoyed reading it. I thought it deserving of 4 stars. Stephanie Plum is fresh off a divorce (her husband betrayed her) and she has lost her job as a buyer for a local department store. Wanting to keep busy and stay employed she joins a relative's firm where she becomes a bounty hunter. Only problem is she doesn't know anything about bounty huntering. One for The Money is fresh, silly, and at times hysterically funny. Getting to know Stephanie in this first book is a joy. The reader is also introduced to other main characters such as Stephanie's side kick, Lula, Grandma Mazur and \\"Ranger\\" the sexy, mysterious lead bounty hunter who becomes Stephanie's mentor. And then there's Morelli with whom Stephanie shares a unique past. It is in this book that we learn Stephanie's significant other is fattening food and that she has a little problem with her cars getting defaced and demolished. Not only is she hunting people down she finds herself being hunted. There is mystery and violence in this book as well as clever dialogue and humor. I really enjoyed One For the Money and I highly recommend it. I regret the rest of the books in this series are not of this caliber."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started reading this book/series on the recommendation of a friend and was immediately hooked. The characters were funny and entertaining, even if they weren't entirely believable at times. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is a regular girl who finds herself needing a job, and so she goes to work for her cousin as a bounty hunter. She's not anything like the bounty hunters you see on TV. She's completely inept but extraordinarily lucky. The things that happen to her are outrageous and hilarious. It's a good, lighthearted read when you're in the mood for a good chuckle. In fact, the first eight or so in the series are terrific. After that, they start to decline, but don't let that deter you from reading the first several books. Definitely read a sample of this one and you'll see what I mean about entertaining."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A book about a bounty hunter whose chasing after the man who took her virginity at eighteen who was accused of murder and is on the run.

Saw the movie after reading the book and as usual the book was better. I recommend this series to anyone looking for a laugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been hearing about this series for years. My boyfriend's parents have read it, my best friend's parents have read it, everyone I know has seemed to have read it. So I figured after seeing the movie trailer that it was high time for me to read it too.Picking it up this morning I figured it would take two days or so to finish it, because I just didn't think I'd get into it as much. But instead I was so into it I finished it in one day.Witty, sexy, and hilarious. Stephanie Plum is definitely a character that you wont forget.I love the guys in this book too. Every character sticks out in your mind, theyre all either funny or sexy or just plain strange.I give this book a 5 because I mean, what else does it deserve?And I end my New Years with this review, at 3 in the morning, and will now be retiring to bed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Excellent book and movie. Job well done. The only thing that doesn't seem to follow is Debbie Reynolds playing Stephanie's grandmother. There must be an Estel Getty type of grandmom out there somewhere to play this character. I'd see this movie again and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum novels and have bought all 17 so far and laughed at every one. I just have one question that no one seems to be able to answer. Why are the first 3 kindle books in the series non lendable? All of the other books in the series are lendable and I am just not understanding what the difference is with the first 3. I have someone that I would love to share this series with but can only start lending at number 4. Not sure how to change this."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Worth reading. Written in 1994 so the technology is dated some now. I think some of the one-star votes are off base. I think the point of the violence against women in the story was to show how far over her head Plum is. Fun to see her get herself out of the tough spots with no real experience. I like how she took the big bad world of Jersey and turned it into her little neighborhood. Running into old high school buddies at just the right time to move the story along. Plum seems to pick things up quickly so I'm looking forward to giving the series another shot."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie has to do what a girl has to do to keep from moving back home. If it means looking for FTAs (failure to appear) so be it. Being a bounty hunter isn't her original plan, but if it pays the bills. You get to meet a lot of interesting characters in this first book of the series. Stephanie is funny, likable and totally unqualified for the job. Her \\"adventures\\" are a hoot."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Perfect size, it has nice pages and everything is spaced great! A true classic, had me laughing and on the edge of my seat the whole time!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm definitely reading the rest of the series!Stephanie plum is so broke that she has to start selling her own furniture in order to pay her bills, which is why she ends up landing a job as a bounty hunter. Ranger, a very funny character is the one who will teach her some basics for catching criminals. His first prey is an ex fling called Joe Morelli. Morelli is a cop who is acused of murder. Stephanie tries to cacth him and that's where the chaos begins.I loved Morelli, Ranger and Stephanie, of course. Hated the grandmother though. Too annoying.It's not as great as for me to say is one of the best books I have ever read, but it did keep me enttertained enough to go and start book number two."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money is a rare read -- a great intro into a kicking crime/humor series with a realistic heroin and some great laughs and surprises. I really enjoyed the freshness of this book, the way that it took a maybe \\"old\\" idea and made it new.The thing I liked most about this novel was the humor. The author throws humor into the oddest situtaions, and the laughs are creative, and you definitely don't see them coming. The plot was creative as well, fast-paced and not horribly complicated, but just complicated enough to where it kept you guessing. The main characters was a spunky, realistic heroin who was tough but not too tough, and who I felt like I could relate to -- and her \\"love interest\\" (not too much of an interest in this book, but will probably grow to be one in the next book(s) Morelli was a great character with an almost familiar charm.I have only a few cons for this book. The first was the number of characters. A lot of character names were mentioned, and a lot of characters had small parts, which caused me to get lost in all of the names and often question who exactly the author was talking about, which resulted in some frustration. The other con was that, due to the fast-paced nature of the book, some of what happened seemed very convenient, and almost had to be written off.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading the next in the series. I would recommend this book for fans of crime novels, but non-fans may want to give it a try as well, as it has the ability to surprise. As far as content, there is language, some alcohol reference, some sexual reference, and reference to rape (as the book is crime-based).I give this book four of five stars for a good read, and the beginning of a different, humorous series.Alexandra Lanc~Author of The Foxfire Chronicles"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"\\"One For the Money\\" is light enjoyable reading.It will never be cause for social change,but if you are in the mood for a quick fun read, this would be a good choice.

It did arrive here, however, in excellent condition."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was the worst I've ever read. The main character is just a self-interested person who thinks nothing of comitting felonies. It is amazing that Morelli, the man she is after, falls for her. She would sell him out for a dime, yet he finds her irresitable. She judges all these criminals as getting what they deseve, but thinks nothing of comitting crimes herself. The fact that such a self-interested person is the heroine is a sad commentary on our times."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money by JE is a good book. Unfortunately my copy, given to my as a gift for my birthday last year from my brother, was destroyed after our basement flooded and it was found on the floor. The cover was torn off by the force of the water and it's now sitting outside drying on the bbq. I shall have to get another copy. I found this book to be a bit difficult to get into unlike many other mysteries I've read from Jessica Fletcher to Sue Grafton. My mom and brother thought I might like this book, but it turned out it's not quite as exciting as I thought it might be."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I got this book as a birthday present. I like reading spy novels. So, the crime novel came as something I was willing to try. Well, if you like easy read, this is a book for you. I was clearly disappointed. The main character, who normally reads only &quot;funnies&quot; form the daily paper, uses unexpectedly word such as inconspicuous, while at the same time using word curiouser?! Also, what annoyed me is that her best friend, the cop and friend married to her cousin, has &quot;eastern Slavic&quot; features, like there are &quot;western Slavic&quot; features, only we did not know about them? Anyone who likes loud mouth New Jersey girls with no style, or manners would truly enjoy this piece of trash. I cannot even imagine donating this book to anyone. It would be too embarrasing to even admit that I had it in my possesion at one time or another."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am reading the reviews full of praise for this book. Honestly, it was entertaining....until you get into the racism in this book. Note how many times the author refers to the latino or black characters as ghetto, poor, criminal, etc. Time after time, she takes the opportunity to paint a one sided picture with this novel. It is full of ebonic slang and blatant racism. I expected an entertaining mystery book. Never did I think I would be offended by a book. If the book was about issues of race, then the racist referrences would not mean anything. But in a regular book about a bounty hunter?????????"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm not a huge fan of chick lit, but I don't mind a dose once in a while. Unfortunately, this book put me off that genre for a couple of months.My cousin recomended it to me while we were at Borders. All I can say is that it's a good thing I started to read it and didn't buy it all at once. From the first page I had my doubts, and they just grew bigger and bigger as I continued to read. I got to about page fifty and then I couldn't take it anymore. The plot was just so stale!So there's this girl who lives in the suburbs (why not in the country? why the burbs?) and she's broke. She goes to her uncle and asks for a job. Then she wants MORE money (selfish b) and so she orders him to give her a highly dangerous case, which her spineless uncle gives to her immediately. Sure. So then she finds out that the guy she's hunting (hmm...Buffy?) is actually her old boyfriend and she has a major crush on him. Stephanie just sashays up to his door and rings the bell and says, \\"Hey dude, mind coming with me? I have to arrest you.\\" Like he's going to jump into her arms or something. The guy says no and then she leaves and...that's where I stopped.It might possibly have gotten better if I had perservered, but there are some books that you just can't take. THis was one of them. And now I hear that there's a series. oh no. How many other people are going to get snared in this trap?I don't think anyone should read it. And by the way, cousin, if you ever want to continue the shouting match about whether Pagan in Exile is better than this book, I'll be waiting."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My mother in-law has not gotten the books yet.

Her first assignment is to bring in Joe Morelli, her high school crush that besmirched her reputation on a bathroom wall.The hysterics ensue as a girl with no experience in bounty hunting tries to figure the job out on her own. The book is laugh-out-loud funny, with the right combination of mystery and girl power. I think the Stephanie Plum series is so endearing because we can all see a little Stephanie in ourselves.

I think the story line just flowed from beginning to end. I'm very anxious to read the next book in the series and I'm also going to take a chance on reading the \\"Full\\" Series as well.

Stephanie lost her job, had her car repossessed, has hocked or sold most of her belongings, has an empty refrigerator, and has been reduced to sampling the food she bought for her pet hamster. She obtains employment with her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, by threatening to tell Vinnie's wife about the duck (this is left to the reader's imagination). She is now a bounty hunter, and her first assignment is tracking down a man with whom she has a love/hate relationship.Stephanie is from a working class family in New Jersey, with an odd assortment of relatives and friends, some of whom pop in and out of the story. The novel has its moments as she is stalked by an insane prizefighter who likes to hurt women, has attempts on her life, and bumbles into some major crime. Things work out, more or less, in the end as she picks up some injuries along the way. The future looks bright for Stephanie and her hamster, and the series continues."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first books in this series hooks the reader right from the start, with a light reading, filled with funny situations and a superbly crafted main character. Stephanie Plum is a girl who does not pay attention to other people's advice and who likes to take matters into her own hands. For example, a few years ago, after Joe Morelli charmed her pants off of her and then did not bother to call her back, she took revenge by running him over with her car and breaking his leg.Stephanie was doing great in life, living the way she wanted and trying to stay as independent as possible from her parents, until the unexpected happened. She was laid off from her job, got behind in her payments and started being chased by debt collectors looking to repossess her goods, i.e. car. In dire straits for money Stephanie follows her mother advice and goes to see her relative Vinnie to try to get a job as a secretary in his bonding company.However, when she gets there the position is already filled, and she finds about an opportunity that pays much better but also involves a slightly higher risk: chasing after people who skipped bail. That is how she gets involved in pursuing the very man she hates, Joe Morelli, who is now a cop and has jumped bail after being accused of killing an unarmed man without justification.Evanovich delivers a fresh character that tells her story with no lack of witty comments and who is constantly revealing all kinds of interesting situations. Stephanie's remarks remind me of another of my favorite female characters, Anita Blake, the vampire executioner in the Laurell Hamilton series. The aspects strictly related to the mystery side are pretty good too, making this novel a fine read and leaving the reader with an urge to keep going forward with the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked up ONE FOR THE MONEY because I'd recently been hearing all types of things about the Stephanie Plum novels.

There's a lot here, and it mainly works just fine.

These books are best known for their first rate comic dialogue, but Evanovich is also a deft plotter, and keeps the action moving in this installment. Plum is definitely a plucky, likable heroine, and it's hard not to root for her as the story progresses. Overall, I very much enjoyed this novel, which is short enough to enjoy in an afternoon.Evanovich is pretty much one of the most successful fiction writers in existence, and this is the novel that started it all for her.

It was a really easy read, read it in two nights and it's mindless reading, which was definitely welcome after the insanity of the past week or so.

After reading her book titled How I Write I became curious about her fiction and gave this one a try. Reading this book was a great joy. Stephanie Plum is a lovable character who is down on her luck financially. She cons her uncle into letting her work in his bail bond office as a bounty hunter. Evanovich pulls no punches on Stephanie as she enters this tough world. The novel realistically presents the challenges faced by a woman in this brutal line of work. While things are not too easy for Stephanie, she takes it all in stride and displays a sense of humor that makes the story all the more enjoyable. There are romantic elements as well, since the person she is after for skipping out on his bail was someone that had seduced her when she was younger and then left for the military. If you enjoy action-adventure mysteries that are sprinkled with romantic tension, give this one a try. And if you are a guy, don't let the pastel colors on the cover turn you away. That being said, if Janet re-marketed her books with a little more hard-boiled packaging she may reach a whole new audience."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a down on her luck, unemployed lingerie buyer, who is forced to take a job as a bond enforcement agent with her cousin's bail bond agency.

I definitely look forward to reading the entire series. One aspect of the book that's interesting reading in 2008, the book was written in 1994, is that you can anticipate the growth in the story-lines as Stephanie (the main character) incorporates more technology and modern conventions in her crime solving.As for the book I really enjoyed the writing style and story-line. Although there were quite a few implausible plot-points they didn't detract from the entertainment value of this book at all. I was surprised at the number of times that I caught myself laughing out loud at the reactions that Stephanie has to the different situations that she's in from family matters to being poor to learning how to be a bounty hunter. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a fun, quick read with a good story attached to it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's first novel, &quot;One for the Money,&quot; came highly recommended, and that might have been the problem. I had heard nothing but praise and the repeated assertions of how funny the novel was. Yet when I read it, I found it thoroughly mundane. The story involves Stephanie Plum, an out-of-work New Jersey woman who watches as all of her possessions are claimed by her creditors. Desperate, she takes a job tracking down FTA's, people who failed to appear for court dates. The lure is a $10,000 fee for one particular man, a police officer charged with shooting an unarmed man.She finds the officer immediately, though she does not effect a capture. She also finds a top-notch boxer with a prediliction for sexual sadism and rape. Between these two men, her life quickly goes from calm but poor to frantic but poor.Evanovich does exhibit considerable flair for characterization, albeit not without resort to stereotypes and archetypes. But where the novel really disappointed me was in the ending, which not only hints of deus ex machina but screams it. In fairness, I should restate that this may well have been a case of a common phenomenon, previews that make it impossible for the novel to live up to the advance word. Even so, the ending seemed far too contrived, and I was not all that enchanted with the ride to that point."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started reading \\"One for the Money\\" in the hopes of finding a smart mystery series with a strong female lead. I really wanted to like this series, and I kept hoping something would happen to redeem it. But for starters, the designated love interest in this series, a vice cop named Morelli, coerced Stephanie Plum into a sexual act when she was 6. Yes, 6. He was 8 at the time, which I guess is supposed to make us all think it's no big deal. But child on child sexual abuse is incredibly common, and the nature of the act leads one to believe that Morelli is probably a predator. This is reinforced when he coerces her again at age 16. Then she tries to run him down in a car, which we're supposed to think is funny. All I got from that was she didn't know how to handle the situation and could benefit from talking to someone about it.Then there's the general sexism throughout the book. It's been discussed by other reviewers, but this is honestly the most blatantly sexist novel I've read in a very long time. The story focuses on violence against women, which isn't a deal breaker for me if the victimization is countered with strong female characters. But this book doesn't even attempt that. The relationships between men and women are NEVER equitable. Seriously. There isn't a single healthy friendship or intimate relationship between a man and a woman in the book. Even her father and mother don't seem to communicate at all, which is the only intact intimate relationship. It's incredibly disappointing that the author infused those paradigms.To complete the package, the plot is predictable and the writing style unimpressive. We're \\"told\\" EVERYTHING, rather than being \\"shown\\" character and plot development.I'm hoping that someone here can suggest a better series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The book is mediocre at best. Evanovich tries to be witty and hip, but comes out dull and awkward. The protagonist has no talent or credibility, but nevertheless manages to become a modern day street superhero in a matter of pages. Asking criminals to come with her to the police station? If that doesn't illustrate a poor, uncreative story line, maybe her ongoing brainless mistakes will.Evanovich keeps coming out with more books in this series, so my assumption is that someone out there must be reading this series. To those of you who find the first book appealing - enjoy the ride. I am ejecting at book one. One for the money, two for the dough? Spare me. One too many, two for the dull."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love some women detective novels. One of my favorites is the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton.This book has some sexual sadism that I can not take. I did not find the rest of the book entertaining."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My sister raved about this series so I picked up the first book as a 'tester'. Given the multitudes of rave reviews, I expected something much better. I had never read anything by this author beforehand, and it's highly unlikely that I'll read any more in this series. I'm not much into sexist violence, and I'm certainly NOT into stupid women who can't think their way out of a cardboard box. Stephanie Plum seemed to constantly blunder into situations that anyone with an ounce of brains would avoid or solve positively. It's just plain STUPID. I'll leave this series to those who enjoy it....but that doesn't include me. And I do read the occasional 'chic lit' book....Jodi Picoult, Elin Hilderbrand, Jennifer Weiner...but this book doesn't even come CLOSE.Not sure why this isn't coming up as an amazon verified purchase: I bought the kindle version (scratching head)..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is lite and fluffy. Enjoyable but no real substance. Good beach read. Characters are interesting but not real."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The biggest problem that I have with this book is that it is predictable. Even though the writing is good and keeps me somewhat interested, I was bored because I kept guessing what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"3.5I've had this book on my shelves for quite a long time, but as soon as my husband saw the preview for the movie adapdation of it with Katherine Heigel, I moved it up on my TBR list and I'm happy I did, What a character Stephanie Plum is, I can't wait to see how Katherine Heigel brings this character to life, and I think she is honestly perfect to play the role of Stephanie Plum, as I was reading a long she was exactally who I pictured playing the role. Not even because i've seen the previews with her in it, but simply because it seems like perfect role! I love Katherine Heigel as an actress and I think she will make Stephanie Plum come alive.The mystery part of this story was pretty predictable, which is probably the only reason why I didn't give this book a 4 star rating, at times I felt the storyline dragged on a bit, but on the other hand, I LOVED the characters and I think thats what really made me enjoy this story as much as I did. Stephanie Plum was down to earth, humourous, witty, and at times down-right hilarious. I also really loved the character of Cop Joe Morelli, for some reason I found him charming from the get-go and he definitely had that bad-boy essence that appealed to me, although i pegged it early on that he was falsely accussed of the crime.I know this is a Massive series and I believe she is on book #19 with a few companion novels out at this point, if I'm correct, I'm very behind on jumping on the Stephanie Plum train, but I'm really happy that I did because I found this to be a light, humourous read, with a bit of mystery, that left me wanting more and this was exactally what I was in the mood for. I'm hoping to get book 2 soon and try to slowly catch up on this series, there's just so many books, so little time."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Enjoyable read. Worth the time for a good beach read. Glad it was loaned to me. I wouldn't have purchased it since I am not one for mystery \\"chick flicks\\". I've read this one but likely won't read another - too silly. But if this is your cup of tea, I recommend it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is such a fun read. I laughed so hard I cried - literally. When I would try to explain to my husband what was so funny about the book - it just sounded dumb - but when I read the story - it just fit right in and the laughing would start all over.The book is silly and fun - but even better are the two very HOT male characters. Stephanie just has so many choices! I've read the first eleven books in the series - and while they are much the same - they never fail to entertain.The beginning if the series is the best - as it is new to the reader. Start with number one and work you're way through - you won't regret it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Oh my goodnes....Stephanie Plum, I love you. I usually read historical fiction and tried this book based on a Pinterest suggestion. I devoured it in 5 hours then checked my windows and doors twice before going to bed. This is laugh out loud funny. I enjoyed Stephanie's wacky grandmother and the tension between Stephanie and Morelli. I can't wait for book two. It's like a new guilty pleasure. So fun."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is one hilarious thriller--bet you don't hear those words too often. But, it's true-absolutely hilarious. Pee-in-your-pants hilarious. Snort-your-drink hilarious. People-move-their-seats-on-the-airplane-you're-laughin-so-loud hilarious. (Sorry, Vegas flight-I just didn't know I would be chuckling and guffawing all the way through.)Stephanie Plum in just that-plum out of luck, plum out of a job, plum out of romance and plum out of money. When she hears of a job opening at her cousin Vinnie's bail bonds operation, she goes for it. Only problem is....she's a cream puff and a real screw-up. A girl after my own heart.On the way to messing up her first case, she gets tangled in the life of Joe Morelli, her first love (for want of a more inappropriate word). Morelli and Plum have a love-hate relationship hearkening back to their childhood. Stands to reason this is the guy she would be assigned to bring in.On top of all this hilarity and romantic tension, there is also quite an engaging mystery and plenty of danger and intrigue.Plum, I have taken the bait and am well way on my to #2."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Well isn't this a wonderful, and funny story. Stephanie is having all kinds of financial issues; her car got repossessed, she had to sell her furniture and now needs a place to stay and a job. Enter, cousin Vinnie who owns a Bails Bondsman company. He hires her on a 10% commission basis and Stephanie's first assignment is to capture Joe Morelli, an ex-cop who is charged with murder. He also used to be a friend of Stephanie.The author created a wonderful story, using likeable characters and a great deal of comedy. It's hilarious! A well-written and captivating book that anyone would enjoy. Brilliant. Congratulations to the author."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After hearing all the hype from my more feminine counterparts, I had to give Stephanie Plum a test drive.Frankly the first installment left me a bit wanting. I didnt think it was that clever, and I wasnt surprised by anything in it. As it happened though I had already stcked 1 through 10 in this series on my shelf so I kept them around and used them as palate cleansers when I needed a break from some of my heavier series. And I have to say they keep getting better, and by the 3rd one, I was really enjoying them. So I am glad I read them all, and in order instead of piecemeal, but think of this as more of one to get through to get the good ones."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was so looking forward to these books as nice light summer read. The books got stellar reviews so I figured there must be something to all the hype. I got through One for the Money and admit I was drawn in at times, the book definitely does not drag and it does have its chuckle to yourself moments. I just didn't think it was that funny or that good to warrant such praise. The goofy humor that is in this book, like when Stephanie lets her senile grandma play with her gun at the dining room table and grandma shoots a hole in the chicken did not seem to jive with the brutal violence depicted in scenes. I even willed myself into the second book because I was sure at any moment the \\"magic\\" was going to sweep me off my feet and suck me in. It just never happened for me. Not a bad book but just so-so in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is in trouble, big trouble. Newly unemployed and with a stack of bills, what's a girl to do? Since her cousin Vincent runs a bond enforcement agency, Stephanie decides to do some filing for him. Oops - that position is already taken, so she figures being a bounty hunter can't be that hard, right?Dressed in an elegant suit and high heels, she gamely knocks on the door of her first FTA (Failure To Appear in court) and asks Joe Morelli very nicely if he would please accompany her to the courthouse. Not being an idiot, as well as being a cop who's been accused of shooting (and killing) an unarmed man, turning himself in is the last thing on his mind. He and Stephanie also have a rather colorful history, which makes things even more interesting.Seeing how Stephanie tries to get her man, despite the fact that she has no law enforcement training, gun, handcuffs or any other necessary paraphernalia, makes for some wonderfully funny moments. She \\"borrows\\" Joe's car, engages the aid of a very \\"hot\\" bounty hunter named Ranger, and falls in with an assortment of other entertaining characters.One caveat: After you finish One For The Money, you'll undoubtedly be delighted to learn there are many more books in the series. Please don't waste your money. Check them out of the library. They are nothing like One For The Money - they dissolve into junior high school bathroom humor, slapstick-idiotic routines. The same story pretty much over and over again. Stephanie doesn't grow, doesn't learn, and becomes less and less endearing. Book 4 or 5 was OK, but I'm on book 6 (library copies), and I've finally given up. We're evidently not going to see the caliber of the first book again. What a shame. It's as if they were written by a completely different author."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"2.5 starsThis was a fairly entertaining, if mediocre, novel, introducing the world to amateur sleuth/bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. While the \\"voice\\" of Stephanie is refreshingly earthy, sadly, taken as a whole, she's far less entertaining than I thought and certainly much more annoying than I could've guessed. Most of the good bits come from the actions of secondary characters, especially Grandma Mazur (although the \\"wacky old lady\\" schtick gets tiresome after awhile). For every minor chuckle-worthy moment with Stephanie, I had to slog through several other whiny, incompetent, frustrating, and just plain idiotic moments.And that's why I'm not such a fan of this book: It's so unrealistic. Yes, I know, it's a fiction novel about a fictional character. Thank you, I got that. But every story, no matter how how fantastical the storyline, has to have some ground rules. I have the ability to suspend my disbelief; believe me, I'm more gullible than most when it comes to books and movies I think. I want to believe the actions of the characters, I want to be surprised when the denouement comes at the climax, and I work hard to miss all the clues that might pop up along the way, bits of info that others seem to pick up on which shatter the illusion and spoil the surprise. However, Evanovich has pushed the boundaries of reality to their breaking point. If the events in this book occurred in the real world, Stephanie would've been beaten up, raped, and killed before a third of the story had passed by. Even allowing for the good luck (or the occasional deus ex machina) allotted to fictional characters in order to move the story along, Stephanie's fantastic luck in escaping from her hair-brained schemes would require the constant supervision provided by at least a dozen fairy godmothers.Which brings me to the heart of the matter. While I can admire anyone who leaps bravely into a new job without any training or experience, with only the confidence of \\"I'll learn as I go\\" to buoy them, I'm sorry, that kind of gung-ho behavior doesn't work in a job where a basic knowledge of how handcuffs work and a smidgen of self-defense skills is required, not to mention where a fear of handguns is a severe liability. Especially when that ignorance is brushed off with a blithe, \\"What could possibly go wrong?\\" kind of attitude. After all, Stephanie will be dealing with people, criminals, who have skipped out on bail for the simple purpose of not going to jail and who therefore won't be at all eager to simply come along when she bids them and docilely trot to the nearest police station to remedy their error. Instead, they will use whatever means necessary, and whatever weapon they can get their hands on, to avoid going to jail. So when Stephanie goes after one such person and stupidly stands there, on the front stoop of his house, as he takes away her purse, which, of course, contains her gun and spare ammo, thereby arming the man, and lets him shove her to the ground as he barricades himself into his house, it makes me want to gnash my teeth and pull out my hair in frustration. To top things off, because of her inability to defend herself, she's constantly crying to a fellow bounty hunter, a big, strong, manly-man, or to the man she's ostensibly trying to capture for aid and assistance. \\"Oh, please rescue me! I've gotten into this job to prove I can do it, but I have no skills and I know I should learn how to shoot a gun and defend myself, but it's so much easier leaning on your muscled chest while I let you clean up my mess.\\" Gag me with a spoon.The other problem I had with this book is the rather wordy narrative. I like reading about a character's habits and lifestyle, but up to a point. Wherever I went, I encountered lengthy descriptions of Stephanie's actions: \\"I took a shower, I got dressed, I put on my shoes, I put on some eyeliner, mascara and lipstick, I ate a bowl of cereal, I brushed my teeth, I checked my hair,...\\" I may have boiled down several actions into one sentence, but it's not too far off from the truth. I fully expected to see a sentence like, \\"I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet. When I was done, I wiped my ass and pulled up my pants.\\" I've encountered authors who have managed to describe their character's everyday actions in much less pedantic ways.Despite all this, I will read the second book...eventually, just to see if Evanovich's writing improves. However, even if it does, I highly doubt this series will become a 'must read'."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money was such a delightful book, that we had to purchase five more titles in this series.. we will then have to find the remaining Number books in this series.I recommend that you start with One For The Money and then proceed without haste to finish the series. I'm planning on doing this."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Stephanie Plum is out of work, out of money, and out of choices. Six months behind on her Miata payments, she begs a repo man to give her until the morning before he confiscates her car. It's that or be stuck at her parents' house all night. Given the reprieve, she scrounges enough cash, along with a few kitchen appliances, to buy a Nova that lives up to the meaning of its Spanish name. If that isn't humiliating enough, she is forced to beg a job from her cousin Vinnie as a bounty hunter. With no experience, she stumbles into her new profession.I've heard about these books for several years. Although there were sections that were a little thick to wade through, this was an enjoyable read. The characters were great and well drawn. I laughed out loud several times and gasped when a few things occurred that were unexpected.Miss Evanovich's writing style is enjoyable and easy to read, very similar to another author that I enjoy a great deal. I love the side comments that Stephanie gives. It helps the reader connect to the character. The setting and situations are very believable with secondary characters that are a riot. Gotta love grandma.Overall... This was a very good read.CarolASpradling.com author"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The early Stephanie Plums are just wonderful comic and rude thrillers.

I try not to include spoilers in my reviews. With that said, I recommend this book to anyone looking to be entertained. I needed to read something light and not too dark, and this book met that requirement.

Janet Evanovich is a delightful writer. I will definately read more of her books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book came to me by way of my wife, who desperately wanted a book of sheer fluff after reading a Thomas Pynchon novel with me. So, she picked this book and I read it - certain that I would just cruise through it and not gain anything from it. Boy, was I (somewhat) right. I thought it was a fun book, and I liked that the character of Stephanie Plum got smarter as the book went on.Stephanie Plum is in financial straits so she turns to bounty hunting in an effort to improve her finances. Along the way, we meet her family and become acquainted with a good-looking guy with which Stephanie has had past dealings. To say that a romance develops is not quite true, but enough of a romance occurs to warrant sequels (of which there are many). The story has Stephanie and this guy (Morelli) working together (of course) to solve a crime in which Morelli is implicated.Interestingly, there are some brutal moments in this novel - I suppose to convince the reader that the story should be taken seriously. These scenes were somewhat graphic in detail.Coincidences abound, and one such coincidence leads to a major break in the case, and also has Ms. Plum thinking on her toes. I liked the character because she grew more intelligent as the novel progressed. I'm guessing that the Stephanie Plum in sequel 85 is a lot smarter than the one in this book, but I thought her learning curve in this book was believable.Because the paperback book had Katherine Heigl on the cover, I kept imagining her as Stephanie Plum. This is unfortunate since I think the character of Stephanie Plum could use a better actress to describe her. While reading the book, I was certainly aware that Stephanie was very attractive, but I was also certain of her willingness to learn and grow with experience. Katherine Heigl, while very pretty, doesn't have the acting skills to convey the vulnerability and gradual growth of Stephanie Plum. So, I wish the book had either no picture, or at least a picture of an animated woman that conveyed the real Stephanie (I would have preferred no picture so I could imagine Ms. Plum on my own)."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a loveable bounty hunter and if I had picked up this book 10 years ago, I probably would have loved it. But today the book is dated (very clearly in the 90s) and juvenile. Some of the writing is annoying - Plum narrates each street she drives down in practically every chapter, even though she stays in the same neighborhood throughout most of the book. Similarly, she describes her complete outfit on a daily basis with the only variety being the color of the over-sized t-shirt she wears over her spandex bike shorts and the shade of blue eye shadow she picks. She reminds me very much of Maddie Springer in Gemma Halliday's High Heel series, though to be fair, Plum is far less bubble-headed. This was an entertaining read, but not enough to entice me to read 18 more books in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My sister has been a fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Novels for a long time. She finally convinced me to give the first one a try. I really enjoyed the book. I really felt a connection to Stephanie (the main character), as she seemed to talk and think as I would. I really enjoyed the dialogue and found it to be very modern. The story line was very interesting and kept you guessing and anxious to see what was coming next. I like how the author is very detail oriented, but not to the point of being boring and including insignificant details. She describes streets and directions in a way that is easy to understand. The attention to detail is phenomenal. I recommend this book to anyone who is up for a fast paced and enjoyable read.

Finally, years later and now a military wife I've been forced to slow down and have so much time on my hands its nerve wrecking. So while looking through the Kindle store on a whim I ran across that familiar title again. One for the Money. I looked to my husband for funds permission and with a nod from him it was on! From page one the book had me grinning from ear to ear. It reads like a Nancy Drew game for adults. Mystery, Adventure and even slight moments of smut. I now know why my friends loved it so much.

Her car is repossessed, she's hocked half of her possessions, and is just about one step away from eviction. She grits her teeth to apply to a disliked cousin's bail bond business as a file clerk only to learn that the job is already filled. That's when she learns that she can make good money as a bounty hunter bringing in criminals who have skipped bail. She blackmails her cousin Vinnie into letting her track down Joseph Morelli, a cop on the run from a murder rap. In way over her head, Stephanie tries to learn the ropes while dodging rapists, murderers, and bill collectors.While One for the Money certainly qualifies as detective fiction, it isn't really a mystery. Stephanie isn't trying to solve a murder, she's trying to find Morelli. And find him she does... repeatedly. Her problem is that he's about ten times tougher and more savvy and she has almost zero chance of bringing him in successfully. Stephanie is a likeable enough character, wise cracking, Jersey girl attitude, but vulnerable too. If you think of Marisa Tomei's character fromMy Cousin Vinnyyou'll have a pretty good idea what Stephanie is like. Morelli is a complete rogue and is also pretty charming. Other characters are well portrayed, whether it's Stephanie's well-meaning but smother mother or the completely psychotic rapist that has taken an unhealthy interest in Miss Plum.The story moves along at a good pace, although readers definitely have to be patient with Stephanie's total ignorance and incompetence for most of the book. This is the story of how she learned the ropes and it's pretty realistic that she would struggle badly in the beginning. There are a lot of wisecracks in this book, but they're much more cute than funny. I often smiled while reading but was virtually never moved to chuckle, let alone laugh. That's probably the biggest weakness of the book, though it's a relative one.One for the Money is the reading equivalent of a good snack. It's not a mentally stimulating mystery, it's not laugh-out-loud funny, and the action will not remind you of a great thriller. It's light, easy to digest, and a pleasant enough way to fill some time. As long as you understand what it is and are happy to take it on those terms, I would recommend it whether you've ever read a Stephanie Plum novel or not."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was introduced to Janet Evanovich through 12 Sharp when at work.

Through out the story she changes cars and these cars seem to symbolize her moods, and what she is going through. Evonovich is taking a older 30's woman and exposing her to things she would normally never have anything to do with and the result is very funny.

Makes you want to read the entire series.!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was turned on to this book by my doctor's receptionist; she had to tell me twice and I regret waiting that month before I read it. This was a fun, laugh-out-loud book. I loved it!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was a lot of good fun. The book was told as if you were following all of Stephanie Plums thoughts as she tracked down high school classmate Joe Morelli for skipping his court date for murder. Through a series of unfortunate events, Morelli and Plum work together to try to pin down what actually happened.It was refreshing to not read a story about how perfect and beautiful the main character was. While Plum was often called sexy, she also talked about how she had frizzy hair after being handcuffed to her shower curtain and how she had snot running down her face while she had a gun pointed in her face. It was really refreshing to not have a beautiful bodacious main character who constantly flaunted it.I think what brought this book alive was the development of the characters, from her overbearing mother who insisted that she find a man in her life, to her eccentric grandmother who thinks its okay to dress in spandex in her 80, and who can forget the sexy and daring Morelli who seems at first amused by her attempts at bounty hunting then becomes down right annoyed after she steals his car.Another refreshing point was that nothing came easy to Plum as she attempted to navigate a whole new world. Perhaps it was sheer dumb luck or beginners luck she seems to start to find her way while also learning a lesson or two about how bounty hunting worked. She had a perfect combination of good luck and really bad luck.Who I would recommend this to? Everyone, it's a lot of fun for people who enjoy a mystery without being imbedded in the cop lingo. I would also recommend this book to anyone down on their luck because Stephanie Plum has an awful lot of bad luck and can make anyone feel better about their life."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This first Stephanie Plum story opened my world to Janet Evanovich....and she can't write fast enough for me!! This book (and the following 20, I purchased) have great 'detective-like' story lines, hillarious prose which sometimes finds be doubled over in laughter, and is simply a 'thrill ride' of a read from start to finish. I have a hard time putting down any of her Plum stories. The 'number' series are by far the best. The 'holiday' Plum stories are more far-fetched (4-star), but still make me laugh. Definitely buy \\"One for the Money\\" because it is the START of a GREAT thing..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am definitely behind the times when it comes to reading this book but when I saw the movie I just couldn't hold out any longer. I enjoyed the movie and enjoyed this book even more.There is a lot of action happening what with boxers turning into stalkers and cars blowing up yet what really kept me reading was the characters. Stephanie is a Jersey girl through and through. And way over her head when she takes on a job as a bounty hunter yet she is not about to give up. A very plucky heroine whom it was a real pleasure watching as she learns and grows.Of course she starts out taking on a jumper whose skills far out match her own. And it doesn't help that they have a personal history. Joe Morelli, being investigated for murder, is one hot hunk of a man and deep down a good guy. Oh and there is a personal history between the two that causes some sparks between them.If you are anything like me and haven't had a chance to read this book then I recommend not waiting a minute more. The book is pure brain candy. There are some tense moments and some violent scenes but there is really a book that can be read by anyone of any age.I rate this book a 4.25.***I picked this book up at my local library."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"loved the book so much i went and got the whole series and waited and waited for the movie but was sorely disappointed by how the book was depicted in the movie made me sad"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a very entertaining and funny read. Janet Evanovich has a wonderfully witty writing style that gives Stephanie Plum a sassy but also honest voice. Divorcee and jobless Stephanie has been selling off her furniture and appliances to keep from having to move back in with her parents. She is stubborn to the core and a little nave, which is in part how she ends up as a bounty hunter chasing down her ex-fling Joe Morelli.The whole book is filled with colorful and engaging characters. Grandma Mazur in particular was an awesome character, she was so funny. Everything she said had me laughing. I loved that every character had their own voice. From the hookers, to the boxer Ramirez, to good cop gone \`bad' Morelli, they were all well developed and interesting. This is an adult book with some adult themes, including sex and murder, but I enjoyed that. I was glad that Janet didn't water down any of the issues she deals with.Stephanie has a lot of great stories to tell, particularly those that involve Joe Morelli, and she also falls into some rather hilarious situations. Anyone who's ever been down on their luck will completely relate with her. She starts out naive, but her character grew as the story went on. By the end of the book she's a much stronger character. I was also glad to see that as she progressed so did the feel of the book. Stephanie's situation may be funny but there is also seriousness and some scary parts that come from her working as a bounty hunter. She's dealing with dangerous people and falls into some dangerous situations.Over all I found this first book in the Stephanie Plum series a great read, however I did have a few pet peeves. Some of the technology in it is a little dated, which makes the story feel dated (It was written in the mid 90's), but that was easy to look over. What really bothered me was that I loved the interaction between Stephanie and Morelli, however I felt like there wasn't enough of it. I enjoyed reading about Stephanie apprehending various FTA's, but sometimes I wished that Janet had spent a little less time telling me about them and given me more time with Morelli. I was 70% thru the book before he and Steph started working together. At that point I was like \`this is what I've been reading for' but the book was nearly over. Morelli is a bad boy and a player, but underneath that he has a soft spot for Stephanie. I wish their partnership had had time to build and be grow stronger. Though I will say, where Janet ended the story left me wanting to read the next one, and I think this is a series I will continue with."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I watched the movie before I read the book. I don't think the movie did any justice for the book. The book is way funnier."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The version I read was quite old (library) but I assume it's the same as the current paperback. This is a great series - funny characters, likeable main character and two hot heroes. Though I will mention that Ranger, one of Stephanie Plum's love interests, changes a LOT after this book. In this book he is 5'10\\" and talks a blue streak of street talk. In the later books he is Mr. Mysterious, who says almost nothing except \\"Babe.\\" Oh, and he \\"mysteriously\\" grew two inches taller. I guess you can't be a true hero unless you're six feet tall!I consider all these books to be 5-star books until about number 14. From that point on, I couldn't finish them. I just didn't find them that funny. Don't know if the writing had changed or if I had ... quite a few years between the first one and the 14th. But don't let that stop you since you may not feel the same way. You don't have to read them in order but it is a good idea to start with this one. You've got hours of enjoyment ahead of you with these."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Per my mothers suggestion, I bought the 1st book of the series. She enjoyed the Stephanie Plum series and so far I've purchased the first 4 books. I like how the stories grow and add characters along the way. It's not brain surgery but it is an escape. Keep 'em coming cuz ill be to the 19 book by the end of the summer."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a book. This was hilariously funny. Stephanie Plum is from NJ and having some money problems. Sold her furniture, her car has gotten repo and next she will be needing a place to live if she doesn't come up with an idea fast. She goes to see her cousin Vinnie ( Bail bondsman ) looking for a job. The job had just been filled but the bounty hunter he used was having surgery. Stephanie, newly employed as bounty hunter. After all you get 10% and she would get 10k for bringing Joe Morelli in. Joe is a former cop and is running from Murder One. Stephaine and Joe do go back to growing up. This was a great book! Very funny, Ms. Evanovich really has a gift for writing a story in a very refreshing way! The &quot; who done it &quot; I couldn't tell until it happened. The pages just kept turning as the characters were very real, and enjoyable! I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum has been out of work for months. With her savings gone and her car repossessed, she's desperate enough to ask her cousin Vinnie for a job. But the filing job she went in for has been filled, so she decides to try her hand at bounty hunting. After all, how hard can it be?Turns out to be plenty hard. After all, most of the criminals won't come when asked politely. And she did target Joe Morelli, a cop on the run trying to prove he was framed. Still, that huge paycheck and a shared past keep her focused on Morelli. But when boxer Benito Ramirez starts dogging her trail, she begins to suspect she's in over her head. Can she survive long enough to bring Morelli in?I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet. Wish I hadn't waited so long. The writing style is engaging and the pace fast. I had a hard time putting the book down and couldn't stop thinking about it when I did. When the book ended, I started looking around for the second to see what would happen next to the main characters.It's easy to see why this series is so popular. The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light reading. I'm looking forward to catching up on the seven books I haven't read yet and hope to enjoy visits with these characters for many years to come."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum series and can not wait until the next one comes out. These books are a definate joy for anyone who has ever had a bad day go worse. When reading these books I try to be alone, not only to be undisturbed but also because I laugh so loud I disturb others. At a book signing I learned Janet is as funny in person as in her books, she comes by the humor naturally. Stephanie always finds herself in situtations due to her lack of a better career and her stuborn personality that will not allow her to listen to others advice. Stephanie is a very real character that is very easy to identify with even if you don't live life as close to the edge as she does. The stories have it all from danger, humor, sexuality, and moves so well that you carry it around hoping to find a few minutes to read just a little bit more. This whole book keeps you coming back for more with great characters that are humorous and outrageous, but could easily be someone you already know. One of my favorite characters is the grandmother that gets into just about as much trouble as Stephanie. Read this first one and I guarantee you will be back for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is simply the best first crime novel I have ever read. The characters, plotting, pacing, and writing all reflect years of experience by Evanovich as a romance writer. I have read three other books in the series, and this one exceeds the others in overall quality. That's most unusual in a series. Usually, they start slow, get better, and then slide downhill as the author overworks the formula. Even if you don't like female detection stories, you will like this one! If you are like me, you will read it in one quick sitting!Stephanie Plum is an original character in crime fiction, and an appealing one. You'll be rooting for her to get the bad guy (and the good guys, too) every step of the way!She has a toughness, yet vulnerability, that charm more than repel. She's pursuing the American Dream in her own unique way by doing whatever it takes to succeed, but trying to be a decent person while she does it.To understand how good the plot is imagine the writer's problem: You take an unemployed former discount lingerie buyer in a crime-ridden department store, and turn her into a successful bounty hunter in one book, without having everyone think the story is ridiculous. Naturally, Stephanie Plum isn't very good at doing something that is hard to do, and that she hasn't done before. Her learning is turned into wonderful comedic episodes. But gradually she gets better, and I was very excited for her.The story itself works at several levels. There is the surface one of Stephanie becoming a bounty hunter to escape total poverty (her car is repossessed early in the book, she has sold most of her furniture and her apartment is at risk). To get a job, she blackmails her cousin (threatening him with exposure to his wife for his very kinky sex habits) into giving her the task of bringing in Joe Morelli, a cop up on charges of killing an unarmed man. Even this conditional assignment is hers to lose, and she has to keep at it to get other assignments. No one in her life wants her to be a bounty hunter, but her.The second level is the development of a romance with Morelli. The two have a relationship from their youth. Morelli played choo-choo between her legs at age 6 and did more than that in high school before leaving for the Navy. When Stephanie next saw him, she ran over him with her car because he never called again, and left a note about his second deed in the rest room of a restaurant. Stephanie is able to find Morelli quite often, but cannot subdue him. Pretty soon, he's looking for her. The scenes and by-play will appeal to all who like romance with their crime.The third level of the story is about Stephanie learning the bounty hunting trade. She gets lots of help, and you'll like the other characters who help her. All of them repeat in important ways in future stories. Ranger (Stephanie's mentor) and Lula (Stephanie's future sidekick) make indelible impressions.The fourth level of the story is Stephanie's relationship with her family. They want her to be 'normal' and she does just enough of that to get free food at the family dinner table. This is a wonderful story of becoming independent in a traditional family.The fifth level of the story is a mystery of about who did what to whom, leading up to Morelli's killing of the 'unarmed' man. Morelli claims the man was armed, and that there was a witness. He is avoiding jail to find a way to show his innocence, and tries to persuade Stephanie to help him.The sixth level of the story is about a sexual sadist who decides he wants to have his way with Stephanie. This side of the story is dark, and takes a valuable look at the problems such people present to women everywhere.Evanovich brings all the strings together into a tidy package at the end. Her plot resolution is excellent. Yet she leaves lots of areas where you'd like to see and know more. Fortunately, you have five more novels to read right away.I also recommend that you continue with the series. Although the future books are not as balanced and outstanding as this one, they are fine stores of crime and romance in the comedic vein.On a personal note, there is a lesson here for us all about the untapped potential we have to do more than we think we can. Taking on a major goal is the starting point. Usually, we wait until we have no choice but to get better. However, we have the choice to decide to get better whenever we choose. We can have more, be more, and have better relationships with others by deciding to do so. When sociologists study those who have accomplished the most in their lives, what they usually find is that these people had written goals that they stayed focused on. You can do that, too! I hope you will find this book inspirational in encouraging you to fulfill your purpose in life..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Let's face it - the basic premise of this book is so whacked that you just gotta laugh before you even start reading it! Stephanie Plum, a down on her luck and out of work lingerie buyer cons her cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a job as a \\"recovery agent\\", a skip tracer, a bounty hunter. She's brash, vulgar, feminine, cute, sexy, tarty, sassy, funny and, on top it of it all, she's got balls made of brass. She actually believes she's qualified to chase down an old high school acquaintance, Joe Morelli, now a hardened career cop charged with murder and skipping bail.The dialogue is perfect - smack dab in the centre of a triangle cornered by New York police procedural, hammed up sit-com and cute romance! Yeah, yeah, yeah ... really hard to believe, I know! But Evanovich pulls it off, doles out a generous helping of laugh out loud writing and manages to keep the whole book light enough to polish off at a single sitting! Stephanie's grandmother is completely off the wall and positively hilarious.Now if only she could have figured out a way to resolve the mystery part of the plot without resorting to the painfully trite clich&eacute; of the gloating criminal holding the heroine at gunpoint explaining how nasty he intends to be in intricate, precise detail! And, puhleeeze ... our hero, Morelli, just HAPPENED to catch the whole conversation on tape which of course exonerates him completely from the murder charge.Full marks for the fluff - humour, romance, characterization, banter, dialogue! Failing grade on plot! OK, we'll call it 3-stars and let everybody decide for themselves whether they want to take on the second book in the series. I'm going to give \\"Two for the Dough\\" a read and see how it goes!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I finally decided to try Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series out because of the positive comments about these books on Amazon's discussion boards. I'm glad I did. ONE FOR THE MONEY was a terrifically engrossing, witty, and amusing tale. As soon as I finished it, I rushed out to get the others in the series, because I couldn't bear to part company with Stephanie and friends yet.Stephanie is a great heroine, a woman who's not afraid to make major changes in her life, like going from lingerie buyer to bounty hunter. Her attitude reminds me a great deal of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, with the exception that all the nasties after Stephanie are human, and unlike Anita, Stephanie's just starting in the business, so readers get to see her develop her skills from a completely blank slate. She has moxie - clipping Morelli with her car to revenge his adolescent seduction behind the &eacute;clair case, carrying concealed in a state where such a thing is illegal, venturing into the nastiest section of town on her own (although some, including me, might call this just plain stupid with an amazing amount of luck), commandeering Morelli's car...this girl is nonstop action!The remaining cast of characters is well-rounded. The chemistry between Stephanie and Morelli sizzles. Grandma Mazur is bust-a-gut funny, as is the portrayal of family life in the burg. Ranger is appropriately tough and mysterious. Ramirez is so creepy I had to look around to see if he was following me. Evanovich brings her characters and the city of Trenton to life in her straightforward, take-no-prisoners prose.My only complaint is that these books just go so fast! If you want a great weekend read, by all means, pick up ONE FOR THE MONEY. But I'm warning you now: you'll get hooked forever!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I happened across Janet Evanovich by chance at the library looking for audiobooks to listen to at work and stumbled across an abridged copy of Four to Score. It was fantastic, but I hated being cut short, so I began reading the books(hardcover) and was hooked. After reading the books I got the unabridged cassettes to listen to at work and laughed until I cried. Stephanie Plum is great and as a woman I want to find my own Joe Morelli!! :) These books are a must read even if you don't like mysteries these are worth picking up! For those who love mysteries all the better:)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"ONE FOR THE MONEY is the first in what is now a series of six(looking at seven and eight). Janet Evanovich (I keep mispellingevanovich as evanovich--Sorry) delivers a fast moving mystery drench in comical commentary. This author has a marvelous talent of poking fun at everyday life. I wish she had more books!NOTICE: If you start reading Evanovich, you will find that you need to finish the book away from others. You tend to chuckle. You will be drawn into the mystery of Stephanie Plum, former retailer, fumbling bounty hunter. Keep &quot;them&quot; away from your book until you finish. Trust me.I'm braced to read book six coming out June 20. In the meantime, my sisters are vying for who gets to read this book third. Mom loves the series too. Since I started the series a few month ago, I've given this novel as a gift to a sister in Florida, a friend at work, and my postal carrier. That is why I say, treat yourself to this author. Enjoyment to the Max."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was the first time I'd read a book by Evanovich, who is known more for being a romance writer who has now turned to mysteries. It shows. The romance is wonderful, and the book is hilariously funny, but the plotting of the mystery is good but not excellent. But somehow or other, that really doesn't matter very much.I liked the book more because it is laugh out loud funny; because most of the characters (except, of course, the villains) are very likeable; because it has a strong woman lead character (you really couldn't call her a detective!) that I could identify with; and because I couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to stop and do something else. But great literature it isn't -- this is not Elizabeth George, for example. But it's a wonderful rainy-day book, and will cheer you up.The plot involves an out-of-work and desperate young woman in Trenton, New Jersey, who goes to her cousin, a bail bondsmen, for work -- she's heard he needs someone to do some filing. She ends up trying her hand at fugitive recovery (that is, being a bounty hunter), because she is desperate. She needs to get her hands on the $10,000 she can earn by apprehending a fugitive vice cop who has been accused of murder and jumped bail. She really isn't very good at being a bounty hunter (she's afraid to fire a gun), and that's where the comedy comes in, but she has courage and determination. Needless to say, the fugitive cop is attractive and single, and there's a good chance he's not a murderer. But unless the truth can be discovered, he could end up going to prison. You can imagine the rest...Anyone who likes mysteries with humor and/or romance will love this book. I intend to continue reading the series to see what happens to this fledgling bounty hunter."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"\\"One for the Money\\" is harder-core than Janet's later stuff, and, frankly, it's not my favorite because of the level of violence, both to Lula and the poor, old, neglected dog. I can also see a bit of the race stereotype complaints people have, although I can assure them that lightens in later books. With all that said, the series is still my favorite because it's best described as \\"sexy and funny.\\" It's not highbrow stuff, and some people, including my mother, are put off by the language, so be aware..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I finally started reading this entire series last summer, and I wanted to kick myself for waiting for so long. Stephanie Plum is a hoot. All the sub-characters from Lulu to Grandma Mazur will keep you in stitches.Plot: Stephanie loses her job as a lingerie buyer and goes crawling to her cousin for a filing job, unfortunately the only job they have open is a bounty hunter. Well, how hard can it be, right? The promise of $10,000 pulls Stephanie to the job, and misstep after misstep occurs. Can she bring her man in?"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"These Stephanie Plum novels, the first one being One for the Money, are the best set of books I have ever read. I was advised by a friend of mine that I would like these books. They combine both the fun and mystery of crime solving and the twists and turns of a romantic plot. I can't get enough of them. I have read all the way through High Five, the fifth installment, in less than four weeks. They are just plain fantastic. If you want the thrill of crime and mystery, sidelined by a reoccuring romantic theme and topped with laugh out loud moments including a transvestite, an \\"enforcer\\", a mortitioner, and a midget - these are the books for you. Stephanie Plum is my hero."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Take if from a New Jersey native, Stephanie Plum is a tough, spunky, quirky heroine with hilarious observations about the \\"Garden\\" state--a state that doesn't always smell as fresh as a daisy. Bounty hunter by default. Good action, suspense, page-turning wit. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When Stephanie Plum finds herslef out of work, flat broke, and with a repo-man on her tail she knows that she needs to act quickly! She needs cash and fast, so she turns to her cousin who is a bail bondsman. She thinks that maybe she can do a little filing and answer a couple of phone calls until she can find a better job. But when she finds out just how much she can make being a bounty hunter she decides that this may be a good career opportunity after all. The risk is high but if she can mkae $10,000 off of just one job it will be well worth it! Unfortunately, much to Stephanie's chagrin the man that she is looking for is her long time adversary Joe Morelli who after one steamy night many years ago never called or spoke to her again. Joe is wanted and supposedly dangerous so Stephaine must take every precaution to get her man and collect her $10,000, however after a couple of encounters with Joe she finds that he may actually be innocent!I wasn't in love with this book. I have heard all of the hype about this series and wanted to give it a whirl but I must say I wansn't all that thrilled with 'ONE FOR THE MONEY'. Maybe I was turned off by Evanovich's descriptions of New Jersey (being from Jersey myself) or maybe it was just that the story line didnt grab me in the least. The saving grace for this book was the main character Stephaine Plum and her nemisis/love interest Joe Morelli who were both likable and interesting characters. Because I did like Stepahnie and Joe I will buy the second book in the series but if I am not won over by that one I will not purchase the third. I am hoping that this series gets better as it goes on."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich has just acquired another fan after reading One For The Money. This book was recommended to me by one of my reading buddies. &quot;Try Evanovich. You'll like her. I'd bet money on it.&quot; That's what she said to me. So I stopped by the local library and checked out Evanovich's first novel because I was told to read the books in the order they were written from first to last. I started reading the book late in the evening and couldn't put it down. The wit and humor Evanovich displayed in her two characters, Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli, was some of the best I've read to date. The plot was fabuluous, even though I almost had it figured out before getting to the end of the story. Still, I enjoyed every minute I devoted to this book and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery novel with a fresh approach. I'm headed to the library now to return this book and hope to pick up &quot;Two For The Dough&quot;. I have great expectations for another excellent read and I doubt Evanovich lets me down."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first book I read by Janet Evanovich was _Hot Six_, in which I fell in love with all of the characters, and vowed to read the entire series. The first book in that series, _One for the Money_, didn't disappoint.Stephanie Plum is someone that nearly any woman can easily relate to, thanks to Evanovich's singular ability to make her characters incredibly human. On nearly every page, there is something to make the reader chuckle in appreciation and self-recognition, and the belly laughs are liberally sprinkled in as well. The wit and humor aren't the only draws to this book, as they were with Dave Barry's _Big Trouble_; Evanovich has a good plot, and she develops it well, cultivating suspense and curiosity throughout the story.As Plum learns How to Be a Bounty Hunter while chasing after a cop charged with murder, she develops very believable relationships with her partner, Ranger, the cop she's chasing, Morelli, and sundry other people throughout the book. We follow her as she's chased by a sociopathic champion boxer, lives through really bad financial times, rummages for the keys to the car she's \\"comandeered\\" from Morelli after he throws them into a dumpster, deals with her overly-protective mother, and suffers through numerous embarrassing situations that rarely feel too contrived.A thoroughly enjoyable and quick read that'll keep you turning the pages. Evanovich writes the way I truly wish I could, and I look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"From reading others' reviews I can tell that the character of Stephanie Plum is appealing to some; unfortunately, she was more appaling to me. Stephanie never manages to grab my sympathy, and being forced to read descriptions of a rapist's work without ever getting good development of the plot makes this book a disappointment. Too bad, from everyone else's reviews, I thought I'd really enjoy this. Needless to say, there are much better books out there, and I won't be reading the rest of this series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Heroine: Average\\"Bawdy, raucous, and outrageously sexy\\" don't even begin to do justice to this thriller series which reads like an episode of \\"Moonlighting\\" meets \\"Married to the Mob\\". Heroine Stephanie Plum is from the Burg, a close-knit neighborhood in Trenton, New Jersey where the gals wear their skirts tighter and shorter than their spandex biker shorts, their make-up is louder than their booming car stereos, and their ultra-tall back-teased hair barely fits under the doorways at the mall.Formerly a discount lingerie buyer, Italian-Hungarian Stephanie falls on hard times and, in a fit of desperation, approaches her sleazy cousin Vinnie about a job as a bond recovery agent at his bail bonding business. Murder, mayhem, and mishaps abound as Stephanie tries to get her \\"collars\\" and discovers the job is far more difficult when you're the only unarmed person in Jersey. (Stephanie actually owns a piece but prefers to leave it in the cookie jar in her kitchen.)What worked for me:As much as I enjoy the zany plots and wacky secondary characters, I think what keeps me coming back to the series the most is Steph's tangled love life. (It must be nice to have not one but two delicious hunks chasing after you!) Janet Evanovich honed her word craft skills while writing romantic fiction, so she certainly knows how to spin out the sexual tension between the superbly-drawn characters of Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger. In fact, it takes several books of the series before there is any culmination of lust and love whatsoever. Talk about extended foreplay!Some folks might not find the mysteries convoluted enough, but not being a Perry Mason myself I like the fact that I catch on to the clues before Steph. Makes me feel quite the sharp cookie. :^)As far as size goes, Stephanie lays a few numbers on you weight-wise, but you get a sense that she's fudging them a bit. There are some characters who have a decidedly fat-phobic view on life but fortunately Lula is there to straighten them out.What didn't work for me:Serial writing is a great gimmick. It's all about leaving the reader hanging by a thread waiting desperately for the next installation in the series. I was lucky, having jumped on the band wagon late I was able to zip through all of the books back-to-back. Now that I am all caught up, though, I too shall have to endure the agony of waiting to find out what will happen in the next book.Overall:Excellent writing, interesting plots, wildly colorful recurring characters, and an infusion of humor make this series a great joy to read, with each book even better than the one before! Since the novels build on each other it's best to read them in order. Warning: there is coarse language used in these books, and they must be read while eating pizza and/or doughnuts.If you liked the \\"Stephanie Plum\\" mystery/thriller series, you might also like \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Fast Women\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Walking at Midnight\\" and \\"Looking for Laura\\".The who's who of the Stephanie Plum series:Joe Morelli: dedicated cop; known for having the best buns in the Burg. As the neighborhood wolf, he's had dozens of mothers saying rosaries for their daughters over the years, including Mrs. Plum when she learned that 8 year old Joe had lured 6 year old Stephanie into his father's garage to play \\"Choo-Choo\\".Ranger: Ultra-fit, dark, mysterious former military man, now mercenary bounty hunter with questionable side-businesses. So gorgeous that women walk into walls when he flashes a smile. Once had to release Stephanie from a pair of handcuffs which held her chained in the all-together to her own shower stall.Grandma Mazur: Stephanie's 70-odd year old grandmother, who doesn't look a day over 90. Likes to wear the same wild clothes as her granddaughter, especially to viewings at the local funeral parlors, which is the main social activity in the neighborhood. Recently learned the joys of sharp shooting when she shot a roasted chicken \\"in the gumpy\\".Lula: full-figured former hooker with a heart of gold and knuckles of brass. Loves to ride shotgun with Steph to pick up skips, but pouts when she is told not to actually shoot anyone.Mom and Dad Plum: Stephanie's parents. Dad is retired but drives a cab just to get away from Grandma Mazur and his wife. Mom is the ultimate hausfrau who lures food-loving Stephanie to the house with wonderful home-cooked meals then subjects her to hours of nagging, which gives Steph an unfortunate twitch in her left eye.Joyce Barnhardt: our heroine's nemesis who was once caught using Steph's now ex-hubby's backside to polish to the dining room table. Joyce \\"persuades\\" Vinnie in a similar manner to hire her on as a skip tracer, much to Steph's everlasting exasperation.Big Blue: An ancient powder blue Buick with windows like portholes. Steph hates this car because it's old, ugly, and turns on a buck-and-a-half. It sticks out like a sore thumb on stake-outs and is likewise useless for tailing people, but on the plus-side it's the only car to-date that Steph's managed not to blow up."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had no idea that this book contained so many graphic depictions of violence against women -- I was truly surprised. I had to quit about half the way through. I am a fan of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries by writer Sue Grafton. I was on the wrong track thinking this would be similar! I am just not entertained by descriptions of trussed-up women and brutal, bloody sexual violence. Ugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A lot of people love this series and after reading the synopsis I decided to give it a try. Turn out, it's just not my thing. While it was well-paced and some of the characters were good (loved the grandmother), most of them were stereotypes (the 'why can't you find a good man' mother, the 'I'm not getting involved/silent' father, the '\\"bad\\" cop with a heart of gold' and even the 'rugged, handsome, flippant co-worker'.I figured out who the 'real' bad guy was about half way through the story (the 'twist' isn't much of a twist)and the progression of Morelli and Stephanie's relationship was completely predictable. I thought the buildup of the Ramirez story line was interesting (a little over blown but creepy all the same) and then it was just thrown away in a last-minute black out. The end of this story just fizzled.I also didn't like how easy and convienent everything was for Stephanie. Her first catch as a bounty hunter just happened to walk (drunk) out the bar she was parked in front of and fall asleep in her car. When she had trouble with the second catch Ranger just agreed to drop everything and help her out. Her third catch was conviently located in her apartment building! (convient since she had no car at that point). Even more convienent? Her 'catch' agreed to LET HER DRIVE HIS CAR to the police station. I realize this is fiction but I want my characters to behave in a rational way.I can't say I was really entertained by this book, and I'm not intersted in reading any more in the series...from the blurbs I read in the back of my copy of this book they all sound pretty predictable and car-bomb heavy. Maybe other people really like this world, but for me, one was more than enough."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up this book. I always thought I was above reading crime novels, but this book has changed my reading habits. It's flat-out funny! In addition to being so entertaining, it's got lively characters and a good plot (bonus!). But don't stop here. I've read 3 more in Evanovich's Plum series and look forward to enjoying the rest. Even the sexy parts are fun without being sappy. I'm beginning to wonder how other writers can take themselves so seriously."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've read more books than I could ever count, and no book has made me laugh more and harder than this series by Evanovich. I actually fell off my bed laughing. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is someone everyone can relate to. She is quirky, clumsy, how-many-more-cars-can-I-go-though, man-(oops, men-) problems, just-lost-my-job-now-I've-got-to-get-help-from-my-family type of person. And talk about crazy family. Trust me, you'll love them. She also has a wonderful website...."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved it! This series was recommended to me by an online book buddy as fun with a twist. I must say I was not disappointed.Stephanie Plum, Bounty hunter extrodinaire has to live every single girl's nightmare; no job, no food, no furniture and soon no apartment. What is a gal to do? Enter cousin Vinnie, bail bondsmen. Stephanie figures this could be easy cash until she gets her life back in order. How wrong can she be!The ensuing story is filled with twists and turns and more than just a little humor. I look forward to the rest of this series and would highly recommend it to readers looking for something just a little bit different."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This series has given me reading fever!!! If you like a mystery with a strong female character who is smart, fun and someone you would want to have as a best friend you should meet Stephanie Plum. The first line of the book grabs you and doesn't let go. When I finished I was literaly running to the store to buy the next in the series. I laughed out loud while reading. This is also a quick read if you start on a Friday night you can easily have it done before you go to bed on Sunday. This is mature material and I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 18."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum loses her job as a lingerie buyer and falls into a job working for her cousin as a bounty hunter. Hilarity, confusion, and disaster ensue.Stephanie is not terribly good as a bounty hunter, but her determination and perseverance pay off time after time. She's driving a different car in every book, because each one gets blown up, caught on fire, or otherwise destroyed. Her friends and associates are a menagerie of oddities: Ranger, the supercompetent fellow bounty hunter who finds her both amusing and sexy; Morelli, the cop who's very fond of her but dreads hearing about what she's gotten herself into; the fireplug-shaped Lula, who is always ready for a fight except when she's really facing one; and Stephanie's grandmother, who attends viewings at funeral parlors as a hobby, packs a piece, and is always looking for action. That's not even counting the 6'8\\" transvestite from High Five.The books are drenched in the atmosphere of Trenton, New Jersey, and a polluted atmosphere it is, too: stoked with chemicals that dramatically hasten natural selection or at least adaptability, plus the cynicism and high crime rate that lead everyone Stephanie meets, just about, to be carrying concealed weaponry, even the ladies at the beauty parlor, who in one hilarious scene start comparing artillery.Then there's the wit and humor. Evanovich observes life in Trenton with a wry, knowing eye, and shares with us the quirks of living there, from the characters mentioned above to the essential tradition Stephanie's mother enforces of having her over for dinner every Sunday evening, jot on time.What can I say? These are delightful books!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this book so much. My sister gave it to me as a birthday present. I was laughing by the second page and hysterical by the end. I highly recommend all of Ms. Evanovich's books, both for her humor and for her writing style. Her characters are so true to life that you'll find yourself saying &quot;Hey! I know someone like that!&quot;. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is pure enjoyment! Stephanie Plum is my heroine!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read every one of the Stephanie Plum novels and found myself laughing out loud in doctors' offices, and at the beauty shop, and on my sofa. I hated to put the book down, and hated to have it end. A friend and I were reading the books together and would enjoy them all over again in our discussions. I hope Janet will write many, many more. I'm sending them as Christmas presents!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Perhaps the best and most exciting part of any book is getting to know the characters. Rather it be through dialouge, actions, or discriptions the reader begins to relate him/herself to each character. What can make getting to know a character better? Making that character Stephanie Plum! She is witty and clever, sassy and sophisticated. She is one of the most entertaining characters I have ever known! With the turn of every page you can't help but wonder what she will get hersef into next, but you can be sure it will come with a good laugh. Every sarcastic comment and goofy analogy will come to be appreciated as you get to know Stephanie and join her as she battles life as a single woman working in New Jersey as a bounty hunter. There is no other character quite like Stephanie! Be prepared to laugh out loud and make a new friend when you read One for the Money. No matter how logical you may be, I guarantee when you finish the book you will find yourself wondering what Stephanie is up to. Just when you think you can't wonder anymore, the next Stephanie Plum novel will arrive in the mail with Stephanie finding herself in another predicament that is sure to be just as entertaining as the last. Do yourself a favor and pick up a Stephanie Plum novel and get to know Stephanie for yoursef!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Okay, The first thing I want to say is, if you are contemplating the purchase of this book, save yourself time and frustration by plunking down the cold hard cash and buying all (seven so far) of this series in one shot. I consider myself fortunate that I didn't happen upon Evanovich's addicting stories of Stephanie and her colleagues until seven were written, because once started I just couldn't stop. I was hooked. When I finished the first book, I ordered the next two (used) from separate sellers on Amazon. They both showed up in a pretty timely manner. I finished both books also in a timely manner (who am I kidding - timely? It was fast, fast, fast), and rushed out to my local bookstore for books 4 and 5. Thinking I had plenty of time with these two I then ordered the 6th book (also used) from Amazon. I am now down to the last ten pages of book five and am using all of my strength to keep from finishing until book 6 shows up. Hurry please! I have to voice my respect for this author's ability to keep each book fresh, exciting, and funny. When one reads a series of books by the same author and barely takes time to pop a bag of microwave popcorn in between each, as I have done, one can become very aware of similarities and repetition. These books do have similarities, but instead of saying, oh come on now that happened in the last book or, been there done that, when certain scenes are revisited I find myself feeling nice and comfortable, like I was back in a familiar place that I liked a lot. The characters keep getting better and better with each book, with Grandma Mazur absolutely taking the prize. She is laugh out loud funny. I also have to admit that whenever Joe Morelli's name shows up on a page my heart skips a beat and I start thinking, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, what's going to happen next? What can I say other than the man is just delicious. What is really great is the relationship between Stephanie and Joe is never taken for granted, and just gets better and better, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! I don't remember reading a series of books I have enjoyed so much. I have book 7 (still in hard cover) on my Christmas list, but chances are I will never be able to make it that long. Even if I did it would be bad as I would surely resent all those people coming to my house Christmas Day who would get in the way of my reading. Hey, the mail just came and guess what? It's here, book 6, gotta go............"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend of mine recently recommended this book to me and I have to say that he has excellent taste in books. This book is so funny and the characters are engaging. A great read!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Starting the first book in a series is like being on a blind date. You start full of optimism, harboring a little trepidation, and hope that all the hype is true. In \\"One for the Money\\", Janet Evanovich delivers, and starts a courtship with readers that just might last a lifetime.Missing Persons 101"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"this is a very funny and witty mystery, with some slapstick which I have never read in a novel before!

This provides laughter as well as the who dunnit that I enjoy. It helps relax me after a long day at work."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first in a series about a girl who becomes a bounty hunter. She bungles everything but manages some success through it all. Her bungling and not-so-smart choices provide great comedy. I laughed out loud many times. This is not a romance novel. Sexual content: none for the main characters, but one of the \\"bad guys\\" is a rapist who uses violence and torture."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Witty and gritty crime story! I listened to the audio version in my car and almost had to pull off the road a few times because I was laughing so hard! This is my first book by JE and it did not disappoint. Stephanie Plum is an entertaining character - very real with a self deprecating sense of humor. Loved the Joe Morelli character and hope to see a little more romance between the two in future books! The audio tapes are narrated by C. H. Critt (a talented female voice actor) and run about 8.5 hours."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"is how I would describe Book One in the Stephanie Plum series titled ONE FOR THE MONEY. Stephanie is the unlikeliest bounty hunter you can imagine. Impulsive, Stephanie leaps first, then wonders how she'll deal with wherever it is she's found herself. Set in New Jersey, we see her interact with her sometimes overbearing family, laugh at her Grandmother's antics, and wonder about her feelings for her childhood nemesis/friend/and later, lover Joe Morelli -- who happens to now be armed (a cop) and a hunk.I am SO going to read the entire series! It's a fun ride!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend had recommended this title to me. At first I thought it would be just another police/mystery story so it took me a while to even check it out here at amazon and read some reader's reviews. I finally ordered the first book, One for the Money. I think I was on the 10th page or so that I realized that I would definitely need to have the next few titles waiting in the wings! What a wonderful read! Not only is it a book that doesn't require alot of concentration, but it actually made me laugh out loud! Any author that can make me laugh so hard that tears are brought to my eyes, is worth their weight in gold. Needless to say that I have purchased every title available to date!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is hysterical. Stephanie Plum looses her job but convinces her cousin to give her a job or she will blackmail him. She becomes an incompetant bounty hunter but does the job through the help of a few friends. I love this book and I am now on #4. They are all good."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Talk about entertainment! I literally blew through this one in a matter of hours. Stephanie Plum's wit and Janet Evanovich's engaging story telling combine for great brain candy!Our Protagonist, introduced for the first time in this novel, is an out of work discount laungerie buyer. So out of work in fact, she downs her last beer bottle for breakfast. Then she learns about the fine profession of bounty hunting from Vinnie - the bail bondsman. She also learns that if she can take down a wanted criminal (who also happens to be an ex-fling), she can earn a fast $10,000. Naturally, it doesn't come easy.What we get is a break neck paced, action packed story with some of the most tremendous wit in a novel to date, and oh yeah, its wrapped up in an excellent story line with true to life characters. Those of us who grew up in the Northeast will literally find their sides splitting with some of the humor.Great work. Can't wait to continue the series."},{"Title":"Railway Guns","review":"interpretation of the title was my mistake, this is an easy western novel, nothing to do with artillery as i had expected"},{"Title":"North Dakota Simply Beautiful","review":"This book has beautiful pictures of around the state of North Dakota with awesome country scenes. It did show one city picture of Minot which was nice however I think to have made the book complete He should of had a city picture of Grand Forks, Fargo or even Bismark the capital. I feel most of the pictures were of the western side of the state however the book was good and the pictures were impressive.Worth buying."},{"Title":"North Dakota Simply Beautiful","review":"This is a terrific book for the coffee table and for those wanting a superficial glimpse of a terrific state.Still, a few maps would help readers gain perspective into the various regions. First thoughts of outsiders regarding North Dakota? Cold and flat. Yet, the state does have a lot more variety and warmer summers than other states. Maps tied to the pictures would help. So, too, would brief descriptions of the counties interspersed between some of the fantastic photos.Despite the omissions alluded to above I recommend this book to all readers interested in North Dakota."},{"Title":"North Dakota Simply Beautiful","review":"I think that this book is a well above average \\"picturebook.\\" It's short on narrative, unlike \\"North Dakota ...Land of Changing Seasons,\\" for example.

This really goes into depth about the after effects of the choices made by Daria in the first book, where, after she marries Cole, she finds out that Nate, her first husband is alive.It discusses in great detail the identity confusion that Daria and Nate's daughter, Natalie, feels and how that effected her life. Natalie gets drunk and a car collides into her's and her best friend is killed. Then the book describes very effectively the pain that she feels over her friend's death and how she works toward healing by turning towards God. She then renews her relationship with her Daddy Nate and joins him in Timone.I highly recommend this book on God's love, grace, and forgiveness."},{"Title":"After the Rains (Beneath a Southern Sky Series #2)","review":"If ever a sequel could surpass its predecessor, this book has done it. After the Rains by Deborah Raney is the story of Natalie Camfield, daughter of Nathan Camfield and his wife, Daria. In the first book in this series, we meet Daria and Nathan when they are missionaries in Colombia, South America. Daria is forced to deal with Nathan's untimely death, only to discover a year and a half later, after she is married to another man, that Nathan is still alive. Award winning, Beneath a Southern Sky is that poignant, stirring story of the choices Daria must make between two husbands.After the Rains continues the story of their daughter Natalie and the tragedy that follows a moment of teenage rebellion. Can God forgive? And if He does forgive, will Natalie ever be free of the guilt and the harsh memories that dog her steps throughout her young adult years?Deborah Raney is a master of asking the tough questions and showing the inevitable consequences of sinful choices. This story evokes much emotion - from tears to romantic yearnings to satisfying joy. I found this book to be a compelling read, which I highly recommend to anyone who loves a truly good story. But keep a box of tissues handy. Oh, and if you haven't read Beneath a Southern Sky, be sure to read that first. Both books excel in the craft of good writing - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"After the Rains (Beneath a Southern Sky Series #2)","review":"This sequel to &quot;Beneath a Southern Sky&quot; is a wonderful story that while different from the first, is magicial in its own way.

Grab a box of tissues and spend your evening with Deb Raney. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"After the Rains (Beneath a Southern Sky Series #2)","review":"Deb Raney has a way of gripping you by the throat with emotions and literally transporting you into the lives of her characters.

There she finds work among the Indians rewarding and challenging. What is more, she finds what she had never expected to, forgiveness and love.***** This moving story will hold appeal to fans of all ages. The tough subject matter contains strong lessons for young people, yet is still interesting enough to hold the attention of older readers. Natalie gives us a heroine who is easy to relate to and empathize with her feelings. Though most people will hopefully never be in a similiar situation, everyone has to deal with learning to forgive the most unforgiveable person, one's self. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"After the Rains (Beneath a Southern Sky Series #2)","review":"Really great continuation of Beneath a Southern Sky.

I have purchased many books and failed to understand much. C# Express was a free IDE, so I downloaded it and purchased this book. This has been the first book to actually explain the basic of programming, the C# syntax (see I even know what syntax is... ), and designing forms. Each chapter begins with a description of a project, you then learn all the skills needed to complete the project and finally get to build the project with step by step instructions and source code listings. This book has also made me feel confident to take C# to the next level as I can finally jump into all those other books I purchased without feeling lost. C# Express for the Absolute Beginner is a well crafted book with a lot of insight for the beginner.

That feeling soon disappears. There are just too many errors that leave the \\"absolute beginner\\" totally not knowing where to go next. Once a person has started working the examples and found several instructional errors, confidence is lost and so when things don't work as they are supposed to, you don't know if it is your error (typing, careless reading etc.) or if it is the @#@### book.Additionally, in some of the more complex examples (like databases) there are several lines of detailed instruction that are missing - if it is to be addressed to the \\"absolute beginner\\"Although I have done quite a bit of programming a number of years ago, I thought I would best off starting as an absolute beginner. If this book were accurate and more carefully attuned to the \\"absolute beginner\\" it would be great BUT it is not!

You would think, and it makes sense to do so, that the author would start with the basics, such as defining terms that are not layman's terms, or using diagrams to show the reader where to look to find all of the things she is talking about (instead of images of screenshots with no arrows anywhere to guide your eyes). I am already frustrated with having to use this book and it is making me worry about my grade. How can the reader create a program on his/her own if he/she does not know HOW to use the tools.

Rodion Raskolnikov is a young, intelligent Russian student and as most of Russian young guys he is an atheist (his name derives from Russian word 'raskol' which means more or less rebel). He thinks religion is useless and horrible situation in Russia only cofirms him in his conviction. In accordance to his theory, which divided people into worse and better he decides to commit a crime. After the crime Rodion becames ill - he's delirious, he raves but the only thing he regrets is that the crime didn't show that he is one of the 'better' people. As the book progresses Rodion is getting more and more obsessed. Fortunately he meets Sonia, a very religious girl which became a prostitute in order to earn money for her family. She is a completely different person than Rodion, which starts to suspect that he's theory wasn't right. Although he pleads guilty he still thinks he did the right thing commiting a crime. Only when he finally saw that Sonia's love towards him is true he redeems. The book shows a lot of true and false moral values. It's also a great guide through Russia in 19th century. And Dostoyevski was the one that gave rise to theories that e.g. Nietsche used; he also was the first one who noticed the great role that dreams and obsession play in our life. And although if it's sometimes quite boring it's undoubtedly worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment (Classics Illustrated Notes)","review":"I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; expecting a harrowing tale of the punishment experienced by the author during his time in prison. What I found was a tortured man limited by his eloquence. He writes of his suffering for the entirety of the work, but that's all it is, writing. The plight of this man seems old and stale. But there was merit in the book. It revealed tortures, that although unthought of, nevertheless existed in those circumstances. It opens the eyes of the reader to the multitude of madness the human spirit can endure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment (Classics Illustrated Notes)","review":"The book revolves around one character, Roskalnikov, a student bored with his mundane life. To test his metal he turns to a life of questions. The questions are not of the universe or a god, but rather can he control his mind enough to commit murder and walk away mentally unscathed. The blood is shed somewhat easily. But, from the time he does the horrific deed until the last page is turned, Roskalnikov is deafened by the voices of his own mind. The character is kempt unslovenly and talks with no one. His friends are rejected along with his own family. All this is in the name of self-test, guilt, and guile.While the pages may turn slow at parts, as do the typical Russian novel, you will be enraptured by the thought process of Roskalnikov. His fears, visions, hopes and dreams become your own. If you can stand the sheer monotony of a volume of emotion, you will read a truly classic novel."},{"Title":"Three Ways of Asian Wisdom","review":"Three Ways of Asian Wisdom is a classic that should have never gone out of print. I read it over the period of about a month, not at bedtime like a novel, but over morning coffee while my mind was at its most alert because I wanted to fully enjoy the fascinating interplay of ideas.This book is a perfect introduction to these great religions without oversimplifying them. Ross writes with clarity about the historical, philosophical and cultural influences that shaped Hinduism, Buddism, and Zen. Her impressive depth of research into each of the three subjects gives her the detail and anecdotes which keep the book from becoming dry, and undoubtedly her personal experience has given her an insight which gives the work its immediacy.The fact that she discusses these three &quot;ways&quot; under the same cover allows the author to explain their influences upon one another. She also touches upon the relationship of Confucianism and Taoism to Zen. Many photographs of Hindu, Buddist and Zen art are discussed at length and constitute an integral part of her explanation of these Three Ways of Asian Wisdom.A beautiful, eloquent and stimulating book."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Over the years I have managed to read a fairly large number of historical works dedicated to surveying particular periods of history, but I have rarely found one that managed to combine learning with readability as well as this one. Although a historian, Elliott must of necessity tell a story, and that is how Spain went from being a relatively unimportant afterthought on the tip of Europe to being for a period of time perhaps the dominant power on the globe, only to fall into a state of decline and veritable collapse. It is an amazing, improbable story, yet Elliott manages it without ever losing the reader in historical minutiae.Elliott tells his story by focusing on the reigns of the great monarchs of the 15th and 16th centuries of Spain, and the considerably less great monarchs and their &quot;favorites&quot; (noblemen who actually ran Spain--as Elliott puts it at one point, the kings reigned, but the favorites ruled) of the 17th century. The highpoint of the story comes rather early, with the remarkable reign of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon, surely the greatest monarchial partnership Europe has known. Two gifted, talented, and powerful monarchs, they worked together brilliantly to create one of the great empires of Europe, managing such feats as driving the Moors out of Spain and creating a dynasty in the New World (as well as funding Columbus' discovery of it). Unfortunately, they, the Most Catholic Kings, also were responsible for the Inquisition. Elliott takes a balanced approach to the Inquisition (not my own inclination, since it seems to me to be an unmitigable horror), not minimizing its effects, but trying to understand it in context.From Isabella and Ferdinand, Elliott takes the reader through the reasons that Ferdinand was reluctantly forced to arrange for the monarchies of Castile and Aragon to the Habsburgs (it is fairly complex, but essentially there was no acceptable heir), and the eventual accedence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to the thrones of Spain. Although not quite as glorious a time as under Isabella and Ferdinand, Charles V's reign was also a highpoint in Spanish history. Although to a large degree an absentee monarch, his reign is characterized by his attempts to expand his empire--which embraced a substantial portion of Europe--and his wars against against heresy, i.e., protestantism, whether in its Lutheran, Calvinist, or English forms. Indeed, if religious zeal--even if profoundly misguided--were a criterion of religiousity, then Charles V might go down as the most religious monarch in European history. That protestantism survived is surely not to be blamed on Charles V (I'm a Baptist, by the way, so I'm hardly lamenting his failure). In the end, however, Charles V's wars put such a great strain on his various subjects as to lead to general financial chaos, and his expenditures led to multiple bankruptcies, not only in his own but in his son's reign.Phillip II is in many ways the polar opposite of his father. Although the monarch of the Dutch territories and Spain, he was not like his father the Holy Roman Emperor. He was also not a warrior king, although many wars were fought under his reign. While Charles V waged war closer to the field, Phillip II waged war at his desk and papers with a pen. The last of the great Spanish kings of the imperial period, Phillip II struggled desperately to carry on his father's goals amidst dwindling funds and financial resources.The final sections of the book chronicle the long, slow, depressing period of decline, the period depicted so vividly in DON QUIXOTE. Ironically, although the 17th century was a period of waning Spanish successes, it was nonetheless a far richer period artistically, not just through the work of such great writers as Cervantes and Lope de Vega, but a host of great painters like Velazquez and Zurburan.Elliott is a truly fine historian, but he is also an engaging one. I remained interested in the fate of Spain from the beginning to the agonizing end. I would strongly recommend this volume to anyone who wants a stronger background into the formation of modern Europe. It also makes an absolutely perfect introduction to the historical setting of Cervantes's DON QUIXOTE (my immediate purpose in reading it)."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Spain experienced a metamorphosis in the 16th century. It had been a divided country battling with an age-old enemy. Its separate parts worked more against each other than with each other; Castile concentrated on the fight to reconquer the land from the Muslims, while Aragon and Catalonia fixed their sights on a Mediterranean trading empire and control of southern Italy. Under Ferdinand and Isabella, well-known as the patrons of Columbus, the Moors were conquered, the Jews expelled, and all three main parts of Spain joined under one crown. Spain soon acquired a vast empire in the Americas and Asia. Through marriage, its fortunes were hitched to the Habsburg crown, thus despatching Spanish arms and treasure to the endless European wars in Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries. Spain rose to a certain proud zenith, both in war and in administration of its vast lands. The arts began to flourish. Portugal came under the Spanish crown for sixty years. The glory days did not last long as history goes. By 1640, Spain had crashed. It was bankrupt, taxed-to-the-limit, and losing everywhere. Its European empire fell away, even Portugal threw off Castilian rule. Government fell to mostly incapable favorites of the weak and indecisive kings. Bereft of a middle class, the only good income was to be had from the church or the court. In short, the imperial greatness, which had shot across the world like a brilliant comet, had winked out in financial collapse and administrative failure, though literature and painting continued to shine. Poor education and religious ultra-conservatism had denied Spain the leaders that might have saved it.Elliott's history of Imperial Spain paints a clear picture of the reasons for this abrupt rise and decline. He concentrates not on battles, foreign adventures or any sort of \\"glory\\", but on administration, finance, the strong differences between Castile and Aragon/Catalonia, the Inquisition, trade, and domestic policy. I admit that such a mix may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you are serious about learning the reasons for Spain's brief term at the top, you will certainly need to read this work, an amazingly complete study that stands with some of the best history books ever written. Though the title contains the years 1469-1716, the vast bulk of the book concerns only the sixteenth century.It seemed to me, as I read IMPERIAL SPAIN, that the book should be required reading in Washington, but of course our \\"leaders\\" are not interested in history. They reflect in their actions an uncanny resemblance to that Spain of its glory days, thinking that glory can never end, that the mighty shall not fall. Since we seem unable to avoid foreign wars, our education system is inadequate, we are facing a rising tide of religious obscurantism, and worst of all, we operate at a huge deficit, there are some disturbing parallels. Could we learn from the history of Imperial Spain ? No doubt. Will we ? No way."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"This book is accessible to a general reader although it assumes some basic familiarity with European history. Without being overly long, it does a great job of cutting to the heart of matters: what were the factors that made Spain a world power in the 16th century and why did this power ultimately fall apart? Elliott concisely helps the reader to understand Spanish politics, the Inquisition, tax policy, foreign affairs, as well as social and religious tensions."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"This book has been the definitive basic text for the study of sixteenth and seventeenth Spanish history for as long as I can remember.

Want to know why the Duke of Parma was wrong when he threw off the classic response to the question &quot;What about the Dutch pirates?&quot; (&quot;No es nada.&quot;) This book will explain it all to you.

By the book's middle, the country is the colossus of the world, already showing decline but still solid. How did this come about? John Elliott shows you how. The corrosive internal factors that precipitated the decline-- the inflation from the New World precious metals, the overreaching that stretched the state across an empire beyond its capacity to control-- all are studied here in the most remarkable and insightful detail."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Typical J.H. Elliott (The name itself is enough to summon associations of neo-Stoics dressed in Oxford academic gowns). Truly academia at its most noble, the pursuit of truth in the most unudulterated form. The logic is faultless and the analysis is penetrating. The author's success in revealing the very essense of that institution/concept/phenomenon/combination of phenomena so often lumped together under the collective title of the Spanish Empire is decisive. Although it is claimed in the introduction that this is a treatment of specialized topics rather than a factual overview, in truth the ideas behind this book have come to serve as the basis from which I personally, at least, view the social-economic-political climate in sixteenth and seventeenth century Spain.And yet, alas, it becomes all too clear that John H. Elliott is no man of literature. Even when discussing the various neuroses of surely one of the most compelling individuals in all of history (Philip II of Spain), he somehow manages to sound dry and un-compelling. He's like some horrible ascetic scholarly Platonist who refuses to dilute the purity of insight with unnecessary 'human interest'. Is this intentional? I certainly hope not. Of course, the analyses can often be entertaining enough in themselves, and of course, one would be hard-pressed to find a better or more informative book on the subject, but still..."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Synopsis of Early Modern Spain starting with Ferdinand and Isabella through Phillip II.

I read this book because while I consider myself a history buff, I had never studied about my Old World roots.This book gives a great descriptive almost lifelike overview of Spain from 1469-1716. I'll admit, the first 25-30 pages start out slow and seem boring but once it gets to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, it becomes really interesting and you won't want to put it down. It serves as a good introduction to Spanish history; you don't have to know a lot about Spain beforehand. My favorite portion of the book was that of the Spanish Inquisition. I am sure you have pre-conceived notions about what went on but this book clarifies what actually occurred and shatters a few myths about the Inquisition. While there is a slight Anglo-Saxon bias, I found it to only be subtle. I'd be hard pressed to find a better overview and introduction to Spanish history in this time period than this one.While reading, I found myself delving more into the specifics of locations , battles and people mentioned in the book. This opens up even more subjects to study. For example, there are whole books on King Philip II, but you get a good summary of what he did while in power in the book.If you are looking for a catalyst to get started learning about the history of Spain then this book is for you. Or if you are like me who wants to know his own history, it is definitely for you.As a side note, I found it fascinating to learn about the succession of the throne of Spain. I hadn't known that current King Juan Carlos I is a direct descendant of the first king of the Bourbon line, Philip V. I had no interests in Monarchs before reading this book, but now I want to learn more about European royalty.

The most impressive aspect is its lively recounting of the events, people, and places that shaped Spain in the imperial era combined with a well-considered analysis of the underlying social and economic forces influencing the behavior and decision making. Further, it clearly details the competing national factions, in-terms of their interests and relative power, that comprise the modern Spanish state. To be sure, this is not a book for those well steeped in the finer minutiae of Hapsburg Spain. But for those trying to get their feet wet; (as I was) I find it hard to believe that there is a better book to turn to."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"This book is very good about a number of aspects of internal politics and economics for the period. But it omits almost entirely one of the most important features of Spanish history at this time, namely its foreign wars and empire. The brief statement near the beginning of the book that it will not investigate the internal histories of Spanish colonies does not prepare one for the big black hole encompassing almost all of Spain's overseas adventures. We get very little about the struggles in the Low Countries, even though these imperial possessions provided important personages in the Spanish ruling house and played an important part in the origins of the terrible Thirty Years' War. There is very little also about the exploitation of New World gold and silver resources, although they funded the Spanish empire. As another reader complained, the book tells us nothing but bits and pieces of the Spanish royal house's complex and crucial interpenetration with the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg dynasty. Most annoying of all, we get NOTHING about the Aragonese and royal military involvements in Italy, which stripped the Spanish treasury and hastened the decline of Spanish dominance in Europe, not to mention devastating much of Italy. I read in another book of the fact that Charles V's Spanish army sacked Rome in 1527 and dealt a terrible blow to that city, but there isn't so much as a mention of that fact here. What was a Spanish army doing in Italy in the first place? Beats me. We hear time and again about the fact that Charles V was off in Italy, or the Netherlands, or central Europe, attending to wars about which we hear not a word; but the author is careful to provide us with detailed information about the wool trade in mainland Spain. Same story with Philip II's war against England. I bought this book to get an account of Spain's golden age of European power, in other words of \\"Imperial Spain 1469-1716\\", and didn't get it."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Ages past, when I was studying for my doctorate in history, my specialization was early modern Europe. I was writing on Spanish political ideas in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries --roughly the span of time encompassing the reigns of Enrique IV of Castile (1454-74) and Ferdinand and Isabella (1474-1504, -1516). Needless to say, I read EVERYTHING, everything I could get my hands on pertaining to that time and realm.Nothing came close to Elliott's survey in helping me to understand the period. I read everything Elliott published until I left the field many years later. All of it was brilliant and most of it brilliantly written as well as researched. Elliott is a lucid and forceful narrator and a master explainer of complicated things. Spanish history, especially the fifteenth century, is extraordinarily complicated, with many actors and subplots going on at any one moment. To complicate it more, Spanish archives are not the best organized in the world: documents that might help elucidate key episodes are missing, perhaps lost forever. Two of Elliott's best books, The Revolt of the Catalans and The Count-Duke of Olivares, highlight this problem: Elliott's ability to work around missing documents is exemplary.Imperial Spain is not easy to read. It's extraordinarily compact for so big a subject --covering almost two and a half centuries of history-- and much was still not known about many of the phenomena he discussed in the book. But he succeeded --brilliantly, I might add- in combining narrative (a forward line, with actors and events serving as historical signposts along the way) with analysis of structure (Elliott does Annales history as well as any of the great Annalistes, like Fernand Braudel, Lucien Febvre and March Bloch).It might have made the book more manageable if it had been broken down into smaller units but in my own study and research, I would have been lost without it. My solution to the complexity of the story it told? I read it over and over, taking more notes each time, until I reached the point where I couldn't read it any more because whenever I started a paragraph, my mind took off on a tangent of its own, tracing connections beyond the printed page."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Prof. Elliott's introduction to Imperial Spain is a great place to start for anyone interested in this often overlooked historical topic.

The book dedicate a great deal to the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand, which is regarded as the golden age of Castile with the discovery of America and the finishing of the \\"reconquista\\" but also marking the expulsion of jews and the beginning of the inquisition. Mr. Elliott explain the whole context of those years, politically, socially and economically, the real situation of the people of the time and the differences between the crowns of Castile, Aragon and Portugal. As the book advances and with the following Kings, the author makes clear the difficult situation of Spain, with an empire geographically separated, agravated by several revolts either at home or abroad, with the core of spain overburden with taxes, with a stagnated economy and more important, a mediocre ruling class. These are just part of the reasons that finally led to the dissolution of the empire at the beginning of the 1700. In summary, this book totally fulfilled my curiosity to understand this period of Spain, and like the last words of the book: \\"Castile has made Spain and Castile has destroyed it\\" (Ortega y Gasset).Note: I had the opportunity of being at the Escorial, I just regret to not having read this book before."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"This excellent book of Spanish history tells you every thing about Spain in that time.

He covers the economic aspects of Spain's problems, but not in much detail, and as an anthropologist I would have like to have more analysis of the 16th century Castilian dominant ethos -- that wealth and power proceed from honor, glory and military success, rather than the more prosaic Protestant virtues of the north.Extremely readable- I went through it in two evenings.

The maps and family trees provided were especially helpful!The book focuses less on foreign policy and more on domestic policy. I was disappointed with the page and a half dedicated to the Spanish Armada (in my opinion, Elliot seemed to downplay the importance of the event) and the few pages on Spain's involvement in the Thirty Years War.

Highly recommended!TB"},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"Elliot's narrative history falls short in a number of areas, not all of which owe to his authorship skills. The manuscript is replete with transposition errors. The evidence of editing disintegrates throughout the book until chapter nine carries the phrase, \\"this hilfrtftt ddf hi.\\"Elliot's work wants greater clarification of foreign and archaic terms. For instance, he uses the monetary of \\"ducat\\" without once providing a comparison to contemporary monetary devices but, on the other hand, pauses to define a fanega (1.6 bushels) in it singular usage. Additionally, the time span of the text grossly misrepresents the content. The book focuses on early fifteenth century events and never honestly appraises Spain's history after 1690.The two areas where the text lapses most profoundly occur in Elliot's idyllic esteem of Spain at the expense of other civilizations and his infatuation--blind, historic crush adulation--of Queen Isabella. In regards to the former, his text contents itself with treating every travesty meted out against other civilizations and populations as a mere precursor of a later economic disadvantage. The text seems to disdain everything not of and extolls everything of Isabella, like she never did anything wrong and she was the greatest thing to happen to Spain. The obvious favoritism taints the text and sickens the reader.In defense of the text, Elliot conveys a deep sense of the connectedness of operations and organizations that influence country development. His text bequeaths the reader a thorough understanding of relations amongst the states."},{"Title":"Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 (A Mentor book)","review":"After readingDogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors, I decided to keep rolling along and find out more about Imperial Spain. Mr. Elliot's work seemed to be the next logical choice for my Kindle.This book is very comprehensive on the subject matter, no doubt about it. I particularly enjoyed:* How smaller realms of Spain continued a certain autonomy such as Aragon and Catalonia.* The discoveries of the Americas and how a small group of Castilians dominated vast swaths of land through sheer will and determination.* The Apex of imperial spain with Charles V and the ascension of the house of Hapsburg.This book backs up the assertions made in the aforementioned \\"Dogs of God\\". That is, the disaster that was the expelling of the Jews, followed by the Moors. Though Mr. Elliot spends much less time regarding the Inquisition and its impact.The explanations for the decline of Imperial Spain towards the end of the 17th century are interesting. I think the author does an outstanding job of trying to explain this descent and really bring together the many contributing factors. He also highlights the various mistakes along the way, such as the lack of crop-based agriculture.But to be honest I had a tough time with this book. Some things that frustrated me:* Yet another history book that does not even try to flesh-out the events surrounding the primary topic. Who were the Hapsburgs? Not totally sure, I just know the particular ones that ruled Spain and that some were in Austria. Why were the Flemish rebelling? Again, not sure, but Spain obviously did not want them to. One or two pages of additional pertinent information, back-story if you will, can provide a much richer experience for the reader. It absolutely baffles me why more authors don't do this when writing history books. It almost seems that this book had a target audience of a college history course or something.* More than a few times I had to back up and figure out where some primary historical character entered into the story line. For instance, after 10 pages it dawned on me that I should probably figure out who the Conde Duque was. With so many characters coming in and out of the mix it is helpful to have more emphasis when a major historical figure comes on the scene.Some people will absolutely love this book, and to be honest it has a compelling storyline.

In short: some of the finest history ever produced by this planet. Another page, another big-time drama. (Why do contemporaries always have to live in the most boring of all times?)

The Legacy of Ibo Landing is an excellent source book for those with an interest in the African American culture of the Sea Islands. I highly recommend this book for academics and non-academics alike. I used it in an introductory course and the students expressed mixed feelings. Those who most enjoyed it sited the perspective of a Gullah person as the reason for their satisfaction (Marquetta Goodwine, the editor, does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the problem of cultural destruction Sea Islanders are presently facing due to development and tourism). Those who expressed dissatisfaction were somewhat intimidated by the use of Gullah language in many passages of the book. As someone who has invested several years in the study of Gullah I feel this book makes an excellent contribution and should be added to the collection of anyone interested in the African American past. It includes information for sociologists, medical anthropologists, linguists, and cooks; and the art from Jonathan Green is awesome! This book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Ibo Landing","review":"\\"The Legacy of Ibo Landing: Gullah Roots of African American Culture,\\" is an anthology edited by Marquetta Goodwine, dedicated to Gullah culture.

I expected Thoreau to write about discovering who he is in life and how society has found itself withering away from nature with all the advances in humanity.Instead though, I found a book that quite literally is a journal of what he pretty much did there in the woods. In all honesty, this book should have been called \\"What I did in the woods\\" because for the most part, that is what this book entails. He talks about his daily ventures around the lake and whatnot. This may sound exciting and all, but anyone who has picked up this book probably has gone out and at least attempted to enjoy nature. I don't need someone else to write about something that I try to do on a regular basis.There are some good moments in the book, like when he talks about meeting an individual who just works and works and for what? Moments like those was what I expected because it showed problems we Americans face every day. I did not expect however him talking about how deep Walden pond is or what the rabbits were doing around his cabin. Really Thoreau? What amazing revelation people find out of him talking of that stuff is beyond me.Don't get me wrong this is a good book but I believe really overrated. Some of these reviews are hilarious though talking about how \\"deep\\" the book is. I can just as easily write about going out for a walk anyday and be glad if someone called that \\"deep.\\" People writing those reviews makes me wonder when was the last time they went out for a nice walk in the woods."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Isn't it a little bit incongruous to desire to detach yourself from society, seeking self-reliance, and then write a book about it? Just an observation...While Thoreau is a curious individual - sort of a poor-man's G.K. Chesterton - he always seems to come up short. The Virtue of Civil Disobedience reads more like self-satire than a serious attempt at political philosophy. And while Walden is rich and fulfilling, it is ultimately just a vehicle for Thoreau to make baseless claims predicated upon his treasury of tidbits and odd knowledge.Had Thoreau been blessed with living in the modern world, he could have just written \\"Living by a Pond on Your Own For Dummies\\" and saved himself (and us) a lot of trouble.Instead of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" I recommend anything by Lysander Spooner (particularly \\"No Treason\\")Instead of \\"Walden\\" I recommend \\"Two Years Before the Mast.\\" It's both more relevant than Walden, and a heck of a lot Closer To Nature."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Walden and Civil Disobedience was bought as a gift and was exactly what he wanted. Has't put it down since he got it"},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"This collection has Henry David Thoreau's two most famous works: Walden and \\"Civil Disobedience.\\" Both are immortal literary works that should be read by all; anyone who does not have them would do well to get them here.Walden is one of the great classics of American letters. It has been somewhat unfortunately tainted by its reputation as the \\"treehugger's Bible,\\" but this misses the point. Thoreau obviously loved nature and was one of the nation's first environmentalists - indeed, modern day environmentalism can be traced directly to him -, but the core of the book is not a simple stating of nature's virtues. Thoreau lays down nothing less than a philosophy of life. Like \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" Walden preaches the virtues of individual liberty and the importance of Man over State. Thoreau raises some staggeringly deep existential questions: If a man does not depend on the State but still resides within its boundaries, need he pledge allegiance? Need he pay taxes? Thoreau tells us how to get the most out of life by living simply. Indeed, much like Rousseau, he seemed to basically believe that the true essence and spirit of man resides in the state of nature. He assures us that, if all lived as simply as he did at Walden, there would be very little theft, crime, violence, envy, or jealousy. He urges us all to live our own lives as we see fit, neither depending on or heeding others, and to avoid merely becoming another mindless drone in conformist society.\\"Resistance to Civil Government\\" - or \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" as it became known - is an essential part of American literature, culture, and history. Even more remarkably, it is undeniable proof that great literature can have a real effect on the world even long after it is written and ignored. The essay is world famous as the founding text of civil disobedience, i.e., non-violent protest, and its effect on such luminaries as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King was profound, thus sealing its immortality. This alone makes it essential for all.However, it is easy to forget that the essay is a masterpiece in itself. Essentially Thoreau's highly individual expression of his mentor Emerson's self-reliance doctrine applied to government, it has a wealth of depth and nuance despite its brevity. The words are few but the implications endless; it has enough food for proverbial thought to last a lifetime. The gist is very clear, but the implications have spoken very differently to many different people. The work's nature - and Thoreau's generally - is such that it and he are championed by everyone from neocons to libertarians to liberals, and the truly notable thing is that all are justified. This underscores the importance of reading the essay for ourselves.Its main query is \\"What does the individual owe the state?,\\" the answer being a resounding \\"Nothing.\\" Thoreau takes the maxim that the government that governs least governs best to its logical conclusion by wishing for one that governs not at all - a brave wish very few have seriously dared to make or even conceive. He makes a highly principled stand for individual rights and autonomy, arguing very persuasively that people should be able to go about their business without interference. This of course sounds very much like current libertarians, and their position has indeed hardly ever been better argued. Many related and implied issues - protests against taxation, conscription, etc. - also seem to support them. However, it is important to remember that the essay's crux and most famous section - Thoreau's account of a night spent in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because he did not want to support war or slavery - was and is immensely liberal. Few issues can be more central to current liberalism than an anti-war stance, and slavery was the era's great liberal cause. All this must be kept firmly in mind amid the many attempts to reduce Thoreau to a current party platform. He was at once too simple and too complex for this and would not have suffered himself to be thus reduced; nor does the essay justify it.Integral as all this is, the work's core point is arguably a new self-reliance argument above and beyond immediate practical considerations. Thoreau certainly had a practical, political streak, especially compared to relative idealists like Emerson, but he thought individuality more sacred than anything. He articulated this more fully elsewhere, but it is very present here. His work is thus in many ways the best kind of self-help material - and, unlike the mass of current self-help tripe littering bookshelves, is intellectually and even aesthetically pleasing. Thoreau was the most thoroughly local writer that can be imagined, but his willingness to look deep inside himself for the eternal truths present in all people has made him an inspiration to millions and millions of people from across the political spectrum and indeed the world. This essay is a major part of his legacy and thus one of the very few works that literally everyone should read. Few can be the same afterward, and it will change many lives; it is nothing less than one of the most important documents ever written, and its value simply cannot be exaggerated.This collection is an excellent primer for those new to Thoreau, and those who have not already done so should open their minds to him immediately - and once done, they will never be closed again."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Well Walden and Civil Dis. are both amazing essays and in that matter books. The fact that they have said so much and the genius that Thoreau remains to be is absolute. As E. B. White said if anyone attempted to recapture the way that Thoreau writes it would be impossible, the book would be torn and burned. His truth on simplicity is something that I myself and all should take into concept especially in these troubled times. I have read both works many times and continue to learn something new every single time. Absolute praise to Walden especially. I have personally learned that schools actually have it required to read \\"Where I lived and What I lived for.\\" However difficult the message is for anyone the fact that it is taught in schools puts it up on the scale for anyone. To put up an argument against this book is tough because it will be rebuked again and again unless you write an entire book trying to show these things wrong ( Moby-Dick ). Well anyway this is a must, I have read absolute tons of books and I have still found Walden still of my absolute favorites. So get this, it's amazing."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"I read most of Walden while backpacking the wilderness coast of Washington State alone. This was appropriate as the book is the author's account of two years spent largely by himself in a hand-made cottage on the edge of a pond. In it he details not only the minutiae of his solitary project, but opens into one of the heights of transcendental philosophy. I anticipated Thoreau's seminal work was powerful, but actually reading it was electrifying. No, I didn't agree with all of his positions. At times he turns tricks of hollow rhetoric though his arguments are nevertheless beautifully constructed. Over all, though, I came away changed and recharged to live a life more essentially meaningful; to simplify my day to achieve goals that last while experiencing as much as possible in every moment. My love of God and Creation were renewed. Classic."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Thoreau lived for two years and two months at Walden Pond. He said the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation. Henry Thoreau asked hard questions.He related that when the Masschusetts Bay Colony was founded, earthen houses were built. They were convenient and suitable and they had the advantage of putting everyone in a position of equality and not making the poorer inhabitants feel discouraged. It distressed Thoreau that a good deal of the money spent for shelter and dress was for show, uneconomical.He farmed organically because he was only a squatter. He found that by working for about six weeks he could meet all of the annual expenses of living. He claimed that memorable events transpired in the morning.Thoreau went to the woods because he wished to live deliberately. The sounds of the railroad penetrated the woods. Visitors were frequent during three seasons. In the wintertime basically he had only himself for company and some of the animals.In any season, the woods were surprisingly dark at night. Because he had no helpers or animals to assist him in cultivating the fields he felt that he ws more intimate with the beans in his beanfield. Songs have suggested that husbandry is a sacred art.The scenery of Walden was on a humble scale. The first ice was especially interesting. He reported seeing fox, jays, chickadees, and red squirrels in the the winter.In CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE he asserts that in a government that imprisons unjustly, the place of a just man is in prison. Thoreau underwent an overnight jail stay when he failed to pay a poll tax."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Walden is H. D. Thoreau's return to \`wildness', but with a rucksack.It is a protest against the existing civilized world, where men are \`serfs of the soil with no time to be anything but a machine.' They act as \`slave-drivers of themselves'. Why don't they live \`as simply as I then did' with plenty of leisure time for \`a written word, the choiciest of relics?'Walden is a retreat from status, appearance and jealousy. As Jonathan Levin states in his excellent introduction: \`Walden is written in defense of the value of the individual in the social / economic machinery.'But, Thoreau's return to \`wildness' is in no way a return to nature: \`Nature is hard to overcome, but she must be overcome.' \`The animal in us perhaps cannot be wholly expelled. We are yet not pure.'Thoreau's motto is: \`A command over our passions and over the external senses of the body is declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind's approximation to God. Chastity is the flowering of men.' (!)His dream of personal freedom and individual autarchy (\`drink water from the pond') is in today's environment totally impossible. More, Thoreau contradicts himself by stating:' if we know all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at that point.' This is not less than plain determinism.Civil DisobedienceThis short pamphlet translates perfectly the US dream of uninhibited freedom: \`that government is best which governs not at all'. But, Thoreau clearly understands that \`no government' is not a possibility, only a \`better government'.His civil disobedience (not paying taxes) is a protest against a government whose policies are illegal and immoral: \`to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico.'More, it oppresses its own population: \`There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived.'Henry David Thoreau's impossible \`wildness' dream with all its contradictions as well as his highly relevant \`Civil Disobedience' message remain a classic in US and Western literature.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"A previous reviewer asked what Thoreau might think of how society has developed commercially since he wrote this book.

I give it five stars in the same vein that Lawrence of Arabia is considered a classic: yes, it's undeniably a work of great effort and intelligence, but one viewing is enough.

In fact, what strikes me is that we as a Western society have not overcome many of the issues pointed out by Thoreau 150 years ago. Thoreau left Concord MA &quot;disdainful of America's growing commercialism and industrialism&quot;, the slavish materialism of that society then. One wonders what he'll say if he would see the extend today - in the post Coca-Cola society. But then Thoreau was a man who clearly stepped to his own drum. Becuase of slavery, he refused to support the state on moral grounds. How would his views have been tolerated today?I am not luddite, but my favourite quote from the book is this: &quot;We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing to communicate&quot;. Does this say something about the Internet, newsmedia and our contemporary information overload, or what?I liked the introduction and footnotes of Meyer. Just enough to provide context and explanation, but never intrusive. This book is as relevant today as it was during Thoreau's lifetime. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Anyone who prefers Emerson above Thoreau surely does so with a view to increasing his own popularity. Thoreau is too outspoken to be liked by everyone--indeed, to identify more with him is a kind of social suicide. But then, Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not here to please anybody, but rather to be authentically what he was.To find a modern western man who so thoroughly embodies the wisdom of antiquity is as rare as &quot;the tooth of a dragon, or the hair of a phoenix.&quot; Henry David Thoreau is such a man. More than a mere combination of past, present and future, he joins together the most mundane, prosaic and ordinary considerations of daily life with the loftiest and noble thoughts of mankind. Furthermore, he perceives the spiritual aspirations and practices of east and west as one coherent whole. He was well acquainted with the classics of both hemispheres--The Tao de Ching, The Bhagavad-gita, Vedic writings, The Iliad and more--and here, distilled for us common folk, is that wisdom as seen from the his viewpoint. Bertrand Russell has given what would seem the crown laurel to Thoreau calling him &quot;a pure romantic&quot;-in contrast to the weak romanticism of Victor Hugo, or the rather soft variety found in Emerson.During his lifetime, 700 or so of the 1,000 copies he had printed of &quot;Walden&quot; wound up in his parents' attic, ostensibly making him a failure as a writer. Since then he has become a literary god, and without doubt one of the most influential writers of the past 200 years. It was Thoreau's tract entitled Civil Disobedience, written because of his objection to paying tax to the American government--a so-called democracy involved in slave trade, westward expansion, displacement of indigenous population and imperialistic annexation of Mexico--that gave fuel to human rights movements in the 20th Century. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. based their efforts on this small but amazingly powerful essay, which only goes to show that Confucius--one of Thoreau's favorite sage authors--was right; the thought of an intelligent man sitting in his room can kill a king and destroy his country. And so it was that slavery was abolished in the United States, India attained home rule and racial integration in the U.S. progressed.Since the industrial revolution in the 18th Century, the central goal of western technological society has been economic growth. And to achieve an economic growth that is endless, corporations in the latter half of the 20th century have encouraged consumption that is mindless. But by the dawn of the 21st century, this central project has proven to be obsolete, for nature cannot sustain endless economic growth, and neither can the people in general. Nature has rebelled by refusing to absorb the transgressions against her dignity (pollution), and humanity has expressed insurgence through psychological and physical disease. Dr. Willis Harman has discussed the matter in detail in his book, &quot;Global Mind Change&quot; but, though more than a decade has passed since its publication, the important and timely points that it makes have yet to be assimilated by the public. Thoreau, however, was already tuned in to this problem way back in the 1840's. Astrologers attribute an overlap of a little more than 200 years between astrological ages, and this puts Thoreau in with the new Aquarians.His observations--on economy, simplicity, learning, human nature, participation mystique when close to nature and the close proximity of God--are unpresuming, candid and at times downright hilarious. I say Henry David Thoreau is a philosopher sage amongst the American transcendentalists, and a man who was not unconcerned about his less educated or enlightened fellows. He took tremendous pains to share himself with us through his writings, and there are many innovations of his that are already being practiced by posterity. Not the least of these is the growing awareness that ADULT EDUCATION for men and women can be a lifelong pursuit. I agree with Dr. Harman that this is on its way to becoming the new central project of western society, known as it is presently by the name, The Personal Growth Movement.In Walden the seeker will find lucid clues as to what the Aquarian Age is all about, its characteristics and even the means of cultivating the new consciousness. But this is not a book for people who like easy reading. Henry would demand of you that you read it with the same diligence and deliberation as it was written. It took him five years of refinement before he was satisfied with the manuscript. Walden will provide you and your descendants with many more years of pleasure and enlightenment than that."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"H.D. Thoreau is the first and most important figure in U.S. Radicalism. This collection provides the essential background for the latent radicalism inherent in American politics, especially as it was vocalized in the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements of the 1960's.Disobedience is the shorter of the texts, but probably more important. It is an attempt to justify moral anarchism and a call to act on individual judgements about justice.Walden can be interpreted as an important treatise against consumerism and the dangers of specialization, as well as an appreciation of the natural environment. Those interested in anti-globalization/anti-free trade movements would do well to read Walden to gain an understanding of where anti-consumerism came from and an examination of its ethical implications. However, it also pays to remember that Walden is a failed experiment and, in the end, Thoreau returns to Cambridge.Thoreau, as political philosophy, has certain problems. Moral anarchy and denial of the social contract is difficult to replace in civil society--Thoreau makes no more than the most vague references as to what could replace it, seeming to rely on the fact that his personal sense of justice is universal.Nevertheless, Thoreau's conscience has resonance and is as relevant today as ever. His rejection of consumerism as the basis for society and its stratification also teaches important lessons.Thoreau represents that first step in understanding the other part of American political thought--extremely different from that of the Constitution and Federalist Papers--but with profound connections to the work of Dr. Martin Luther King."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Scorning the mass slavery of modern industrial society, Thoreau conducted his most famous experiment in life: to live in solitude in a shack he builds himself on the edge of Walden Pond, on the land of Emerson, with whom he lived as a handyman and pupil. Thoreau, clearly, was no less radical than his mentor, Emerson, though he differs at least in the fact that he was not merely content with preaching, but actually strove to put his ideals into practice. The book is a profound statement of Transcendentalist individualism and self-reliance and a hymn to nature, contentment and joy. He recounts, at one point, the episode in 1845, during which he was imprisoned for one night for defying the local government and not paying his poll-tax. He mentions, in passing, how he allowed a runaway black slave to have safe passage through the region. His retreat into solitude was partly impelled by his disgust with the war with Mexico, and partly because he could not accept that he could live under a governemnt that was also a slave's government. Thoreau, a neo-Cynic, a modern stoic, emphasises a return to the basic, uncomplicated life, free from the cares and fetters of what he calls &quot;odd-fellow society&quot; and celebrates, above all, simplicity, magnanimity and trust. Glorying in the animal vitality of his body (though he was singularly unable to appreciate women) his ruminations encompass the most prosaic details of life in the woods, such as the migrations of birds, fishing, his own bean-farm, along with powerful insights into self-improvement, learning, generosity and other topics, interspersed with allusions to his favourite literature, the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer and the texts of ancient Hindu philosophy and religion. A refreshing and inspiring encounter with a fascinating individual in the history of letters."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"The Penguin Classics edition of Walden and Civil Disobedience is a well-edited volume which brings together these two great American masterworks into one inexpensive and convenient package. The introductory material and notes, though not excessive, provide enough guidance to favorably enhance the contemporary reader's experience of these classic texts. Though Thoreau's language may seem antiquated to today's reader, his message is still as vital now as it was 150 years ago.Walden is a manifesto of nonconformity and individualism, expressed in an inspirational combination of philosophy, poetry, and natural history. Beginning in 1845, Thoreau spent two years living in a small cabin in the woods near Walden Pond. Embarking on this sojourn of solitude was an attempt to escape the distractions, conventions, and frivolous fashions of urban society, to reconnect with the essentials of existence, and to get at the very root of life. By practicing a simpler way of living, engaging in a more direct relationship with nature, and replacing the hubbub of civilization with quiet contemplation, Thoreau hoped to experience life more fully and richly. The materialistic culture of modern, civilized society distracts us from finding our true direction in life. Solitude and introspection are the means by which to recover one's bearings. Thoreau urges readers to forget how society says you should live and to live by your own compass, by what you feel is right. Disregard public opinion and take command of your own fate.In Civil Disobedience, a short essay first published in 1849, Thoreau asserts that when a government acts in a way contrary to the conscience of one of its individual subjects, that individual has a duty to deny any allegiance to that government by ceasing to pay taxes and refusing to obey unjust laws. While Thoreau was focused on the issues of slavery and the Mexican-American War, much of the rhetoric in Civil Disobedience is broad enough that it can be used as an inspirational rallying cry for dissenters of every stripe, from anarchists to Tea Partiers. In Thoreau's view, all governments are inherently corrupt. Just because democracy is based on majority rule doesn't make it any less corrupt, because the approval of the majority is no guarantee of justice and right. Instead of waiting for their government to become just, citizens should behave justly, even if that means breaking the law.The Penguin Classics edition is an excellent presentation of these two great works. The introduction by Michael Meyer provides valuable historical and biographical context. Meyer examines Thoreau's thoughts on slavery before, during, and after the writing of these two pieces, and focuses on how Thoreau's conception of an appropriate reaction to this unjust institution changed over time. This edition also contains helpful endnotes which clarify some of the historical references that may be obscure to 21st century readers. If you've never read Thoreau before, the Penguin edition offers a great introduction to the man and his work."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"I bought this book after much searching for it in local bookshops. This volume, when it arrived, was beautiful to look at. Bound in a classic and impressive cover, it has 2 photos of Thoreau for fans of his works (such as me). But, it is his words which give one pause. Which make the idea of living in the woods, completely self-sufficiently, not as far-fetched as it may first seem. I enjoy this book each time i read it. It's a classic, full of great quotes for those who ruminate on the nature of man, and the beauty of living simply."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Thoreau died, aged 44, in 1862. Walden: or, Life in the Woods, based on his experiment in subsistence living between 1845 and 1847, was one of only two books published in his lifetime. Neither was a commercial success. His 'time' came later, and could plausibly be said to be still continuing. By the end of the nineteenth century a vast amount of his writing was in print, including much taken from the 39 notebooks of daily jottings that constituted his Journal. Each generation since has warmed to one or another facet of his writing - his philosophy, observation of nature, simple living, and refusal to pay taxes to a government that supported slavery and waged the Mexican-American War.For purists, it is all too easy to pick holes. Thoreau's philosophy was far from rigorous in an academic sense; many of his observations from nature were not scientifically robust; building his log cabin only one and a half miles from his parents' home and continuing to buy essentials in Concord (he was on his way to the shoe-menders when arrested for non-payment of taxes), he cannot credibly be said to have cut himself off from society; and for his refusal to pay taxes he spent only one night in the local lock-up before an aunt paid his debt. But to pick holes would be to risk missing several important points. First and foremost, he did succeed in sustaining himself at a basic level for fully two years. His diet was essentially, though not exclusively, vegetarian; he drank only water; kept no pets or other livestock; and seems never to have even thought of acquiring and maintaining a family. In so doing, he successfully demonstrated that living in such a way demands only a very small cash income, so that it is not necessary to work anything like \\"full-time\\", thus releasing much time for walking, reading, contemplation and writing. He derived great personal satisfaction from that lifestyle and took particular pleasure in his cabin, built by his own hands.The book is not an easy read and a measure of sympathy with the undertaking will be required to get most readers beyond the opening chapters. Even, then, all but the most enthusiastic would have to concede that the book is patchy. However, some of the best patches serve to make the whole worthwhile. Such a passage is a description of a hawk in flight found on page 210 of this edition (\\"On the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge...\\"). Incidentally, to get the absolute most out this passage, and the whole book, readers will need to know the length of a perch (as in rod, pole and perch, 40 to a furlong). It is sixteen and a half feet, or 5.08 metres."},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Thoreau is more than simply a writer who produced a great American classic. He exemplified the idea which perhaps as much as any other has come to be at the heart of the American creed. \\"If a man does not keep pace to his companion, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\\"Throreau when he went into the woods of Walden Pond on July 4, 1845 , a journey in solitude which would last just two years and two months, was the archetypal American individualist. He was the man 'doing his own thing' living in accordance with what only he could know was right for himself. This idea of 'radical individualism' has become part of the American common faith. Its abuses are legion and may be disastrous, but it also has brought about not simply 'better mousetraps' but a whole vast world of innovations and innovators, the like of which Mankind has never known before.Thoreau as he writes in his introduction went to the woods to explore not simply the natural world, the outdoors he so much loved. He went to the woods to truly go more deeply into and know himself. As he says in his introduction:\\" I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me.\\"Thoreau in that enigmatic, epigrammatic aphoristic style, he shared with his great mentor and fellow pioneering poet- philosopher, Emerson connects the world within with the world without , connects the Concord woods with the Cosmos . He creates a work in 'Walden' of singular beauty and of its own special economy and principles in thought.Thoreau was too an abolitionist, an opponent of the Mexican war, a civil disobedient who refused to pay the poll tax-, a pioneerwhose followers would include Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.But in his close looking at the world of nature and the world of himself he was first a great explorer of life and reality going out alone in his own way- however geographically close he may have been to home.His words and his wisdom waken us even today to the hope of new and better worlds i.e. he also embodied the spirit of a great American optimism.The great individual teaches us even in dark hours to find new worlds in ourselves outside our own darknesses. \\" There are new worlds yet to be born\\" he writes, \\" The sun is but a morning star\\""},{"Title":"Walden: or, Life in the woods [and] On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"I Love Thoreau, and while I haven't had a chance to read this yet, I am sure I will not be dissappointed.

Reading this book makes my eyes want to bleed it is so bad.It glosses over topics such as arrays, classes &amp; class interaction and only briefly mentions recursion. Add to that the fact it does NOT even cover multi-dimensional arrays or any type of dynamic data handling. How do I store data if I don't want to cap how much data can be entered?Not only is the information lacking it is poorly structured. It &quot;covers&quot; classes before it goes into selection ,repetition and arrays. This seems a little backwards to me.Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C# .NET","review":"This book is used as a textbook for computer science majors at a local communitry college. And interestingly, I found it to be the most comprehensive programming book I have ever read of either school textbook or mass-marketed (like SAMS).I have some programming background as a CS major, so alot of the constructs of the language already look familiar having studied Java and C++, etc. In fact C# is just that--a slightly modified Java for the Microsoft .Net platform. Now, I actually prefer C# to Java.I would recommend this book to anyone looking to learn the basics of C#. But, would not recommend it to anyone without prior experience of at least one professionally taught programming class. Of course an experienced programmer will want to breeze through much of the chapters which will serve only the purpose of making sure any slight quirks in syntax are understood--such as the way C# allows for printing of variables with curly braced symbols.One thing I really like about the way Joyce Farrell writes is that she explains all the syntax of the language she presents right away, instead of writing &quot;You don't need to worry about that now&quot; or &quot;You won't understand this part of the language yet anyway&quot; as so many annoyingly condescending computer learning books do.I plan on buying more of Joyce Farrell's books because I enjoy reading the clarity in which she presents the subjects.If your familiar with object oriented languages and want to learn the basics of C#, buy this book. Conveniently, the books also supplies a trial version of Visual Studio .Net which she requires as needed to compile C# for her book. If you can't get student software discounts, microsoft's compiler is expensive. However, I believe there may be free non-microsoft C# compilers that can be used with the book instead but am not sure."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C# .NET","review":"Bad...REALLY bad...This book claims to be for the beginning programmer, but unfortunately, it takes the....blah,blah,blah-\\"OK, got it? Good!\\"...blah,blah,blah...\\"OK, got it? Good!\\"...approach. In other words, this book VERY QUICKLY, in far too FEW pages, piles new concept on top of new concept WITHOUT giving enough examples. Exercises at the end of each chapter often follow a different format than examples given throughout the chapters. In chapter text, example code is given with some minor quick-over explanation (if you can call it that), and then in-chapter coding exercises are given often with little or no explanation as to how the code works...e.g. you get a breakdown on how the code works on one, but not the other example. You find you are TEACHING YOURSELF BY TRIAL AND ERROR, and referring back to the book only as a reference. Perhaps that would be a better title for the book: \\"Learning C# By Trial-And-Error\\".My gut tells me this book was really written in a hurry. I suspect Farrell was under a rough deadline or something. She obviously knows her subject very well, but unfortunately she assumes that by stating a fact once, with little or no reference or analogy, the reader will get it the first time. An ANALOGY might be: I KNOW how to bake a cake, and I assume that even though you've NEVER baked a cake in your life, if I tell you ONE TIME VERY QUICKLY all the details of how to bake that cake, that you'll be able to do it too! Sorry! New concepts don't cement that way.This book should be AT LEAST twice as thick, giving far more examples for each new concept and breaking each concept down into MUCH GREATER detail...that is *IF* Joyce Farrell is attempting to write for the beginner who is new to the concept of Object Oriented Programming as well as the specifics of the C# language."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C# .NET","review":"Require material for my .NET certification class but was good enough that I kept it afterwards unlike some less text books. Not as watered down as a typical Course Technology publication which is typically very surface knowledge oriented but then Visual Studio makes it easy to begin and C# is very much like Java but not as quirky even if more limited then Java. C# works fine with either SQL server or Oracle when set up properly which is how I was using it to make applications. Having some knowledge of C is useful if you want to code your own routines, sorting/searching/recursion, but this book does show enough that you can easily modify C code into C#."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C# .NET","review":"I am using this book for my online course, and while this book started out wonderfully, good explanations, definitions, etc. ,I am now on Chapter 8, and the more 'abstract' side of programming is very vaguely defined.I started off thinking this was a great book, and now I do not."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C# .NET","review":"I fully concur with the last reviewer. I think Joyce Farrell has done an excellent job with this book. The simple no-nonsense approach she takes in writing material that is geared for the beginning programmer. In the past, I had a hard time understanding Object Oriented Programming until I read this book. Now, I feel that I have a solid background in OOP. I also purchased this book to help my transitioning from Visual Basic to C# and I have to say, it has helped me tremendously. I would love to see her write a book on developing Windows and Web applications using C#.

But he does not want to jeopardize a family friendship to pursue it. But Annie has other ideas. After she gets Guy to a secluded cabin, the fireworks begin that are a trademark of a Foster book. I hated to see the interlude at the cabin end.Max's story involves a woman-hating dog and the woman (Maddie) who wins not only his heart, but that of the dog.

(2/99) in leading and secondary roles. In ANNIE GET YOUR GUY, Annie Sawyers no longer desires her friend Guy Donovan in a brotherly fashion but rather in a more sensual way. When Guy announces his engagement to another woman, Annie puts a plan into work to seduce Guy and prove that she's the woman for him. If he'd only cooperate! But up against Annie and her sister-in-law, Lace (a noted sex therapist), Guy doesn't stand a chance.In MESSING AROUND WITH MAX, the last of the Sawyers siblings get bitten by the love bug (older brother Daniel fell hard for Lace in LITTLE MISS INNOCENT?) when Maddie Montgomery runs into Max's bookstore. Literally. How could Maddie have known the glass door was shut! The store's owner, Annie Sawyers, always left it open. How could she have known Annie was away and her brother, Max, was tending the store with his dog, Cleo? Cleo, who likes no woman, takes a tentative shine to Maddie, thereby endearing her to Max. Trouble is, Maddie has no plans for marriage, despite the dog and the dog's cute owner. But when Max and Cleo team up, Maddie might as well kiss her heart goodbye, because this duo isn't about to stop until Maddie says, \\"Yes!\\"Ms. Foster combines her trademark wit and her ability to craft hot and steamy love scenes into two delightful stories guaranteed to get your sap running and put a spring in your step.If you haven't read LITTLE MISS INNOCENT?

He treats little Annie like a younger tomboyish brother. With the encouragement of her sister-in-law, Annie plans to seduce Guy. Either he will die of a heart attack from laughing at her, lose all respect for her, or match the beat of her heart. The only problem is that Guy plans to marry someone else.&quot;Messing Around With Max.&quot; Annie's brother Max meets one of her regulars Maddie Montgomery at the bookstore. Her show of affection towards his mean-spirited but harmless dog Cleo stuns him. He goes into near cardiac arrest when she chooses him to teach her everything she wants to know about sex. However, though Cleo accepts Maddie, Max wonders how to persuade Maddie that though he may be a reprobate, she is his destiny.Writing for Duets has to be one of the more frightening assignments for an author because readers obviously compare the two tales. Writing two novels for the same Duet has to be even scarier because the audience can contrast your own work and find one lacking substance which means there is damage to one's reputation. Based on her works in DUETS 47, Lori Foster shows she has the talent to handle double duty, as her two Sawyer tales are fun and amusing with likable lead characters. No messing around, Ms Foster gets her fans with a pair of fabulous romantic romps that provide delightful entertainment.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Annie Get Your Guy/ Messing Around with Max","review":"Lori Foster's books are filled with witty humor, fiesty heroines, incredibly sexy heroes, and sometimes-meddling, loving family. ANNIE GET YOUR GUY and MESSING AROUND WITH MAX, her Harlequin DUETS March release is no exception to that great formula. Her books catch your attention from the first sentence and you're hooked --- you can't stop reading until the end of the book! ANNIE GET YOUR GUY has a fiesty, yet innocent, heroine Annie Sawyers who is determined to make family friend Guy Donovan realize she's the one for him. Trouble is Guy has always kept her at arms length, treating her like a sister. Desperate, Annie enlists sis-in-law Lace's help, acquiring various books on sex, and sets out to seduce Guy. Events happen that help Annie get Guy right where she wants him, and she takes advantage of the situation to drive Guy straight into her arms. Guy never stands a chance against her! I found myself laughing all the way through, cheering her on, and as impatient as she was, at the same time. MESSING AROUND WITH MAX has Annie's Lothario brother Max Sawyers finally ready to settle down and get married. He's got one strange condition for the woman he chooses: She has to be approved by his neurotic, eccentric mutt Cleo! He thinks Maddie Montgomery is the perfect candidate, but Maddie is determined that marriage isnt in her near future. Maddie does want something from Max though: she wants him to educate her in the luring ways of sex! With both hero and heroine having seperate agendas, you just know there's going to be lots of comical -yet sexual tension happening. Then, I got to wondering if sneaky Cleo didnt have this mind all along...first he found his owner, then he finds his owner the perfect wife.

I liked Little Miss Innocent? the first book about the Sawyers family in which oldest brother Daniel got hooked by his little sister's friend Lace, a noted sex therapist. IMHO, this book surpassed that book. I know Duets are known for their humor, but these weren't just funny...they were sexy and sweet too.Poor Guy does not have a clue that his best friend's little sister has her sights set on him. With the help of the outspoken Lace, Annie decides to seduce Guy, but infuriates him by only telling him that she wants to seduce SOMEONE. Throughout the novel she excites, shocks, and almost scares him by practicing the things she reads about on him. I was actually laughing during some of the love scenes. You will love Guy's final realization and acceptance of his love for Annie.Max's story leaned more towards sexy than sweet, and I wound up liking it just as much if not more than Annie Get Your Guy. I didn't think Max was that strong a character in Little Miss Innocent? so I wasn't really excited by the prospect of his own story. But surprisingly, I was hooked by the storyline in which a confirmed bachelor decides to marry a woman who is convinced all she wants him for is an affair. All Max has to do is seduce her into marriage--after all, she's the first woman his dog hasn't hated on sight.If you haven't read these Duets yet, I recommend you pick them up as soon as you can.

Guy has been attracted to Annie just as long, but doesnt want to get involved with her because she is his best friends' sister. When Guy gets in a little accident Annie uses this as an opportunity to get him to stop fighting his attraction. In Messing Around With Max, Max has decided it was time to settle down and get married so he could provide a stable home for his dog Cleo, the only problem is that Cleo doesnt like the women he has been bringing home. Fate steps in when Maddie comes into his sisters' bookstore to look for a book. Max decides that Maddie is for him, but she wants an affair and he has to persuade her that he wants a commitment. I loved both of these stories and like the way Ms Foster, picked up Annie and Max not long after Little Miss Innocent takes place.

If you must read this, get it from the library don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Although this book received many good reviews, I found it to be lacking in the dashing, compelling qualities so many have claimed to enjoy upon reading \\"Through a Glass, Darkly.\\" Yes, it seems as though Koen exerted a great deal of effort in creating a historically accurate portrayal of England and France during the 1700s, however there are massive swaths of certain transitional scenes that become bogged down with the weight of Koen's didactic prose (not to mention the fact that it did not strike me as British in the least...I later researched the author's bio and discovered that she is American). I believe this was her debut novel, which may offer an explanation as to why her writing was so self-consciously laden with excessive descriptions. At times I even felt insulted by the author, because it seemed as though she didn't have faith that her readers would understand what was (very clearly) happening.Also, I had hoped for a story with more substance and less of the cliched phrasing that can be found in a cheap romance novel. I thought this book would be special because it has been advertised as a sweeping, whimsical family drama. It is certainly dramatic...but the characters are hackneyed...I've seen them all before, except they had different names and were much more developed. I completed nearly two thirds of the book and still felt as though the characters had remained static...There is no depth there to satisfy me, or compell me to become attached to any of them. Even Tony, who is the rather \\"dull\\" \\"dolt\\" of the family...who seems to be endearing because of his sensitive and hoplessly devoted characteristics...He became 2 dimensional because of the way his dialogue was written. Omitting pronouns does not an idiot make. His lack of intelligence was handled very poorly, in my opinion. I've never heard a person speak exclusively in fragments like that...no matter how unintelligent that person may be.There's a hat for every head and I'm happy that this novel has been enjoyed by others, but I've regretfully realized that this one's not for me. I would sooner recommend a book called \\"Cashelmara\\", by Susan Howatch. It is very similar in almost every respect. It also includes a relationship with a significant disparity in age...Marriages that face opposition, fortunes that are lost, skeletons in people's respective closets, people who are reluctant to come out of the closet...Etc. I read it when I was a teenager, so my perception of it may have been the result of my immaturity...but I still remember it being of a higher caliber. The rather poor quality of the writing is what really disappointed me here. Try that book out...I'm almost positive you'll find it just as, if not more satisfying."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I have to disagree with the majority of the other reviewers and say that I really don't think much of this book! I expected to enjoy it since my favourite genre is historical romance and I had heard 'Through a Glass Darkly' was similar to Gone With The Wind, but in my opinion it doesn't compare. The research and background were good but the characterisation emphatically was not. The characters were one-dimensional, especially the heroine. She was weak and childish and did not seem to mature as the book progressed. I felt the book could have been much better as it had an interesting theme of marriage between an older man to a much younger woman, and a fascinating setting. But the novel did not fulfil its potential. It also contained explicit sex scenes which were superfluous to the plot and seemed only to be there to make the book sell. As opinions have differed widely on it and the sequel, I would advise anyone thinking about reading it to get it out of the library before deciding whether to buy it!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really love this genre, but I could do without the sex scenes. Otherwise it was a great book and I so desperately wanted to get the sequel, but didn't want the torrid sex scenes (plus it wasn't reviewed that well). But a great read if that stuff doesn't bother you."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I did not like this book. Now, there is something to be said about a book that makes you feel passionately and I certainly felt passionate about my distaste of this book. I think the author has talent but this story was just terrible.The beginning got my attention and helped convince me to purchase this. I was actually excited at the page length because I adore a good long book as I can normally read a great book in a day or two because I get so wrapped up into the story. What a disappointment.This story will crash you into the deep despair of this poor girls life. Get ready to read the destruction of an innocent youth, watch her heart be shattered. The biggest annoyance was after pushing through the first half of this book, it leads up into this high story arch that has you, kind of, on the edge of your seat. Then, the book skips ahead a few months and leaves you picking up the aftermath of what happened during that time. You miss everything. You miss the main characters reaction and how she becomes what she does. Instead, you're left with a completely different version of her but you are left wondering what happened over that time. It was a huge disappointment and then the second half was just as terrible as the first but I felt myself caring less about the main characters because I felt like the author ripped away time of getting to know her and understand her."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"As far as romance fiction goes, 'Through a Glass Darkly' should get five stars out of five. The wealth of heart-warming cliches and mind-numbing descriptive minutiae (replete with navel-gazing, philosophical extractions from the Bible and various English poets of the period) will satisfy the pickiest reader in that genre.If, however, you're looking for well-written historical fiction, this novel shouldn't get more than two stars, one for being fairly accurate in its description of the period, and the other one for ambition (that and the effort it took to type the manuscript.)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It was slow to get into...

This one is worth the time.."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I literally have worn out two paper copies of this novel by Karlene Koen. It is perhaps my favorite period novel. It has everything required for the genre: the rakish yet honorable nobleman, the young, unprotected female come upon hard times, the political intrigue, etc. What I particularly like about this novel is the complexity and depth of the characters and the excellent dialogue. The setting is well-realized and the novel is faithful to its historical setting in its depiction of daily life and behaviours (as far as I know!)It has been many years since I read this novel, because I had lost the middle 100~ pages of my last paperback copy when they fell out during a re-read. I am very excited to read this old favorite again!

I couldn't wait to start the next one (Now Face to Face). I have to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through a Glass Darkly is the story of Barbara Alderley. At the opening of the novel, she is a mischevious 15 year old girl, living at the home of her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth. Young Barbara has a penchant towards eavesdropping and so we are introduced to a scene of family discord between her mother, the selfish and hedonistic Diana, Lady Alderley and her younger brother, the irresponsible and handsome Harry. Barbara's mother is disgraced due to her father, Viscount Alderley, having fled England as a suspected Jacobite (supporter of the Stuarts, the descendents of James II who was overthrown by the Glorious revolution and who are barred from inheriting the English throne due to the Act of Succession, which bans Catholics from the succession). Viscount Alderley left his wife with a mountain of debt. In order to avoid ruin, the greedy and selfish Diana has planned a glorious marriage for Barbara. Fortunately for Barbara, the planned marriage was with the Earl of Devane, a man whom Barbara has adored (and loved) since childhood. The first part of the novel deals with the tumultuous marriage negotiations and family drama. This part of the novel is delightfully gossipy, as Diana is a real peice of work and the author's descriptions of her relatives is amusing. Eventually Barbara and Devane marry. However, as Barbara begins to see Devane for who he really is, a skelaton in his closet seems to ruin her chances for happiness. The novel deals with the fall out from Barbara's discovery of her husband's secret.This is a 3.5 star read. At times, this book is a solid 4 stars, with a delightfully gossipy view of early 18th century England and France. At other times, Through a Glass Darkly drags, as Kathleen Koen has a tendency to be too wordy and drags the story out. Ms. Koen's style is to include long passages of internal dialogue reflecting the various character's thoughts. The novel is at its best during the marriage negotiations and when Barbara and her new husband are in France. The French nobels are a debauched bunch and it is entertaining to imagine the innocent Barabara in that environment! While Koen's writing style can be entertaining - bordering on the catty - it also can be repetitive, causing the story to drag, particularly in Part II of the novel.Readers who enjoy novels like Forever Amber or Gone with the Wind would like it. However, unlike those novels, Through a Glass Darkly is substantially lighter on the history. I also liked both of those novels better. That is not to say that Through a Glass Darkly isn't entertaining. Compared to those classics however, this one is a lightweight."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. I liked this book but it was sooooooo depressing. I felt very depressed after I put it down :). I wish there was at least one character in this book that wasn't unhappy, lol. Barbara and Roger's story was so heartbreaking. I'm not sure if I'm going to read the sequel or the prequel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"One of my pet peeves is when romance readers (of which I am) criticize a book by saying \\"this is not a romance!\\" As if the book is somehow less because of it.Well, TAGD is not a romance. It has a marriage at the center of its plot, but the theme, the meaning, the depth is not about finding HEA. Not at all.In a nutshell TAGD is about a 15 year old girl with a spine of steel who decides she wants to marry a 42 year old licentious earl and make him fall in love with her. The first 200 pages contain her struggles to make the marriage happen. In all honesty, I had to force myself through them. They are rather boring and the characters unlikeable and cardboard. I am SO glad I kept going though.Once Babs and Roger are married, the story becomes vibrant and painful and lovely. Many of the things I previously assumed about the characters are only superficial characteristics. I thought this was especially well done with Diana and Tony.Babs must face the truth of getting what she asked for. That Roger both is and is not the person she thought (on meeting him only a handful of times). In fact, the world is far more complicated than she could ever have imagined. She makes some monumental errors in judgment as does Roger and pretty much every other character. I ached for them. One of the characters (I can't remember who) says that personal suffering generates empathy for others. I disliked the characters at first, but as they suffered I grew to love them.TAGD is beautiful journey that ends with God giving Babs what she wants by ending things in a way that neither she nor Roger could ever mess it up again. (hard to spit it all out in a way that is coherent without giving away the details of the ending!!!) There are huge spiritual undertones throughout the book. They are handled with grace and great subtlety though, so I enjoyed them rather than feeling beat over the head.As much as the theme of the the book is seeing 'through a glass darkly,' it is also 'Ask and you shall receive.'This book touched me deeply."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Yes, Yes, Yes!! THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY is so good. I can't believe it took me nearly ten years to get to this book. I was absolutely enthralled with the book and put it up there with the likes of some of my other all-time favorite historical fiction such as THE PROUD BREED by Celeste DeBlasis and KATHERINE by Anya Seton.It takes place in London and Paris in the early 1700s. 15 year-old Barbara Ackerly is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and has been raised in proper society standards. Her mother is attempting to arrange a marriage between her and an old family friend, Roger Montgeoffrey, Lord Devane. Roger is 42-years-old and Barbara has had a crush on him since she was about 10. Barbara's mother, Diana, a beautiful but nasty woman who likes to sleep around and is attempting to arrange the marriage in order to help pay off her enormous debts. Roger is interested in Barbara because by marrying her he will get the deed to some property he wants to develop. (Barbara's mother is deeply in debt due to her estranged husband's drinking and gambling). Barbara is excited at the prospect of marrying Roger. She just knows she can make him love her. However, Barbara's aunt has other ideas. She wants the property for her son, Tony, who is the latest Duke of Tamworth and does everything in her power so that the Barbara/Roger wedding does not become a reality. The story goes on from there. To tell much more would rob the reader of the pleasure of discovering all its drama for themselves. The characters are so real that I feel I know them. This is more of a historical novel than a romance. Sex scenes are not detailed.I have to give this a 5***** rating. It goes on my keeper shelf and on my list of favorite books of all time.I did try to read the sequel, but could never really get into it and gave up fairly early. I may try again later."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Although this sort of period romance isn't my usual cup of tea, &quot;Through A Glass Darkly&quot; remains one of my favorite novels, one that I've reread many times. The characters are vividly drawn, the story is engrossing, the writing style is lush. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book is perfect. It had everything. Intrigue, drama, romance, beautiful people, a flawed heroine, everything. It is the only book I have read more than three times. This book set the benchmark for what a historical drama should be."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My friend recommended this book to me saying it was reminiscent of Gone With the Wind. Frankly, my dear, Through a Glass Darkly blows Gone With the Wind away. I absolutely adored this book and the sequel Now Face to Face. Karleen Koen is a master story-teller. She brought this century to life for me. I felt as though I really knew the characters personnally. When I finished the books, it felt as though I had lost close friends."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when it first came out and just finished rereading it. This book is so well written I felt like I knew these people and I felt like I was there. A very well researched historical novel that teaches as well as entertains. If you like Gone With the Wind type books, you will love this one. It's hard to put down once you get started!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It's true! I read Karleen Koen's novel, Through A Glass Darkly, several years ago and was spell-bound. I have always loved historical romance novels but this one broke the mold, with surprising plot twists and flawed heroines. My first novel, Willing Captive, was published in November 2000. I am proud of it...until I read Koen's novel again, then I feel compelled to work harder and write tighter. This is a fantastic novel. Buy it if you enjoy history and romance (Along the lines of Rosalind Laker novels)."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I just got done reading this amazing book. It touched my heart and soul. I have renewd my faith in god because of the reading of this book. I find the heart ach expressed to show the true reality of becoming a women. It is not like other romances were things turn out best for everyone. Mrs. Koen leaves you hanging on every word and beging for more!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had the honor of meeting the author, Karleen Koen just after the book was released. Turns out, my brother had been helping her sister haul the manuscript home in boxes as it was being written. My brother wrangled an invitation to the tea the author's sister was throwing in her honor right in my neighborhood of Deer Park, Texas. I thought I loved the wonderful book simply because I had met Ms. Koen and found her to be so warm and gracious. After reading these wonderful reviews, I realize I am not alone in my love for this book. Ms. Koen wrote a work of art that is unsurpassed, and I recommend it to anyone who just wants to completely lose themselves for a few days. Her knowledge of the history of that era is almost as if she lived it. And her understanding of the ups and downs of even true love is unbeatable. I loaned my autographed copy to someone and never got it back. Awesome book."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when I was hardly 12 years old. I found it in a second hand store on top of some dusty old boxes. The cover interested me because it was so new and seemingly untouched. I took it home and spent that entire summer reading it again and again, thoroughly emmersed in a world that changed my life. I learned to really read from this book. I learned what it meant to create and to become a writer myself because this book was a work of art I had never experienced before. It made me aware of the imagination and inspirations that surround us. Koen created this beatifully woven history and story and brought to life a time period that has long been past. It filled my life with a direction that is present today. I have since read countless short stories, novels, books and so on by great authors like Vonnegut and Faulkner. But none will ever mean as much to me as Koen. Thank you."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Kathleen Koen intricately weaves a story capturing both your heart and imagination. She is a master at surprises and breaks your heart dealing with the bare truth. I have never, in my 40+ years of reading, enjoyed a novel this much."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"You'll love this one. Personally, when I read fiction, I like a bit more escapism in my reading. Real life is depressing enough. The book is well-written and historically accurate but it reminded me a bit too much of The Thorn Birds. Heart-wrenching, shocking and although I couldn't put it down (kind of like seeing a bad car accident and not being able to look away), I was more than happy when it was finished. Not the happiest kind of book to read in these trying times."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm only about 3/4 of the way through this book, and I have enjoyed it so far. The only thing I'm taken aback by is some of the explicit/perverse sex scenes. I don't believe I'm a prudish person, but there are just some things I don't want to know the details of. Especially when I'm reading a historical novel. I wish, however, that I hadn't read the reviews before I finished it since it supposedly leaves you hanging on a lot of the characters. I may post again after I finish."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This brilliant, if weighty novel made its appearance sometime around 1986. Lush and engrossing, it is truly like no other novel.A hybrid of romance, historical fact, and mystery (though not in the usual sense) it is difficult to write a compelling review of this work without giving away some of its secrets. And secrets it does possess.Perhaps the reason for my reticence will be explained when I describe the circumstances which first brought me to this work. Rifling though a bin at one of the major book retailers in Manhattan (the bin containing books with no jacket), this intriguing title caught my eye. With not inside flap to offer any description and no review blurbs on the back, I was at a loss as to what I was about to encounter.Finding the style easy and flowing, and the story interesting enough, I leisurely padded my way through the first several chapters. But then something happened. Call it a \\"hook,\\" call it anything you will, but the can of worms Koen opened up with the development of the characters took hold and there was simply not putting this book down.Innocent, young and pretty Barbara Anderley has led a sheltered life. When she and her sister and brothers were abandoned by her courtesan mother, they were taken in by a doting grandmother. Life on their 18th century country estate was a somewhat isolated and protected one.We follow Barbara from age 15 up until she is 21, and if we thought her formative years were an education, what she learns about her husband, his peccadilloes, sex in general, and the world around her will make most heads spin. If you look up \\"dark secrets\\" in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of Barbara's husband, Roger. Suffice it to say the trials and tribulations of married life that Barbara goes through will leave you gasping for air.Through a Glass Darkly is filled with sex scenes, but the descriptions are anything but offensive and they are so well woven into the plot that you won't be able to imagine the book without them. What happens to Barbara, the protagonist in the novel, and how Koen keeps the tension up to the climax is sheer genius."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This work is beautifully crafted. The author put so very much work into this, I hate to give it a bad review.The writing is stunning, the characters lovable and memorable...but the last 1/3 of the book desperately needs to be cut. This would be an astounding work of art, but there is simply TOO MUCH for the reader to endure.the travails of Jane and her husband (I will not go into details in case people actually care and it's a spoiler) just need to be cut out. Most of the woes and tragedies that happen after that point need to be cut.This cannot be enjoyed for the beautiful work it is when there are so many weeds clogging it. I loved the first 2/3, could not stop reading, couldn't put it down - the author's research is meticulous and spot-on...the writing is flawless...but please, oh please, someone take pity on what could be a fine work, and EDIT IT!!!!I stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through. Even I, who cannot do that as I have a reading compulsion, even I, couldn't wade through as this dragged on and on. I stopped caring about the characters that I had really come to care about...when you do not give the readers any relief of the depressing tragedies, they lose their ability to identify and to care.When even minor characters have major tragedies that are described in numbing detail, the important things are lost.please edit this book...It is painful to give it a less than stellar review, as this could be such a fine and stunning work.My apologies to the author. I can see what an enormous amount of work went into this, and I can see, also, why it was so very difficult to cut any of it out. But a good editor is badly needed here...an author can get too close to their own work to see that some of their precious story needs to be sacrificed. There are many, many, many (MANY) scenes in here that can be hinted at rather than given in excruciating detail...if you emphasize every single thing, the reader feels utterly bombarded.The meticulous and hard work will show still, even if some chapters are cut away, some happenings mentioned in a single paragraph rather than a hundred pages.still. Fine work. It will be glorious one day, when someone edits it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This 700+ page tome is such an engrossing read, I was almost sad to finally finish it (thankfully there's a sequel). The book opens when Barbara is fifteen and her mother is plotting her marriage to Roger, a man old enough to be her father (he's in his 40s). Barbara's grandmother, a spirited woman who holds the family together, doesn't fully support the union though Barbara desperately wants it as she has been in love with Roger for years. Eventually, despite the scheming of Barbara's mother which causes the collapse of the impending marriage, the two are married.Immediately upon marrying they head to Paris for a few months and Barbara is thrust into her new role as a high society wife. She desperately wants Roger to love her as she loves him and she is disappointed when this is harder than she thought. She has misteps as she learns how to survive - and thrive - in society. But Roger remains just out of reach, alternating between a passionate, caring lover and a distant, absent husband.Money and the economy of the time (late 1700s) play a big part in the book and the characters' lives and how they're shaped. Roger - and therefore Barbara - are wealthy and live a life of luxury, but this comes at a cost. Gossip runs wild and influences actions. When Barbara learns something scandalous (I won't spoil it!) it causes her to flee her marriage. Though apart, Barbara continues to love Roger, even if she is hurt by his actions and angry at him. Later, when circumstances bring them together again she cannot help but feel for him and wonder what their future may be.Lies, deceit, love, passion, loyalty, and greed all play out in this excellent novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"A few years ago, I found a copy of \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" in hardcover at a used book store. I fell in love with its layered story and lovable characters, and read it again and again. I purchased the edition here after my copy eventually fell apart, and it's every bit as lovely as the hardcover edition.This is one of the finest examples of historical fiction I've ever read, outpacing popular authors like Philippa Gregory by a mile. Fans of Kathleen Winsor's \\"Forever Amber\\" or Ken Follett's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" will love it. The prequel and sequel to \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" are also highly recommended. If you love a lush storyline and flawed, human characters with a range of emotions, this is one worth reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Definitely read these books (Dark Angels, Now:Face to Face, and Through a Glass Darkly) if you love a book that will feed your soul. They're tragic and triumphant, heartwarming, adventurous, intriguing characters, chock full of political and historical detail, and amazing detailed descriptions.Koen's three books are honestly the most engaging, beautifully written books I've read in years. We all read books and see them through our own key hole of perception, and for me this was essentially a story of personal growth. Barbara is an inspiring, strong, resourceful woman; a heroine, really. A character like this is hard to find in a book, and when you find one so well written you not only feel a connection to the story, but are transported to her world.The relationships are written so cleverly. Koen manages to make you see a character's personality more in a look or gesture than with their dialogue. You see what's behind their words. You really do feel and sense everything that's not being said...it's almost difficult to put into words.It is also the story of a family and what the women do to survive, and all of the problems that arise within and outside family walls.The family home as well as the developing sights of London are always described down to the detail of the scents of the flowers in the breeze. You can almost hear the jingling of the harnesses on the horses, the bell in the tower, the swish of a gown...There was also ample political and historical information."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was an historical, emotional read. I loved it...every page.It brings the entire background of life in that period so that youcan see and feel it. I feel like I knew the characters. The researchwas amazing."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"through the glass darkly is one of the greatest romance novels of all time. Simply because of the way Koen makes the characters come alive. Each significant female character holds her own. Diana's heartlesness,Barbarba's love, Theresa's poverty and the grandmothers age, make each one human.Barabara's love for her husband is both compelling and realistic. Koen shows step by step their love for each other develop.This book is amazing, heartstopping, beautiful, poetic and deep. You can read it multiple times but still come away with something different.If you want to discover love the bitterness of life Read it. It's worth it"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book about a year after it was published, and I loved it. Recently, I decided to purchase it and read it again, and now I love it even more. Karleen Koen does a phenomenal job of taking the reader past sympathy for the characters, and actually making you feel empathetic as you read the book.Barbara is a timeless heroine, going from naive first love to the disillusioned acceptance of her married life, she starts the book as a child and emerges a young, strong, woman.This book possesses all of the things that make historical romance great: diverse characters, rich descriptions of opulent settings, politics, corruption, fashion and manners. But the underlying themes of unconditional love, and undying faith are the things that really make this a novel worth reading.Although this book appears voluminous and long, the story is so well written and plot driven that the 700+ pages seem not to be enough.Barbara and Roger made me cry, Diana made me laugh. Much like life, this book offers the bitter and the sweet. Excellent writing and enriching reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The strange, obscure sounding title of \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" refers to the lenses through which people see things, the expectations and emotions that color all our reactions and feelings relating to the people around us. The book is full of disappointing things happening to people because they saw \\"through a glass darkly\\" instead of seeing things for what they really are.The books' main character is fifteen year old Barbra Alderly, who is sold in marriage at the beginning of the book to forty six year old Roger Devane, who wants to develop the massive and well placed land given to her as a dowry. This isn't a problem for Barbra whose been in love with Roger ever since she can remember and thinks she can make him love her, but Roger has no thoughts at all for his young bride, and he has a skeleton in the closet that will threaten all of their happiness.Set against the lush backdrop of early eighteenth century England and France this book is a visual feast. Ms. Koen is so adept at describing scenery, food and fabrics it's hard to remember that you're even reading a book. Her way of allowing the characters thoughts to roam across the page as real thoughts do is most impressive, I'd never seen train of thought used more effectively in a novel. But still, the book has its faults.All the characters, from young, rash and beautiful Barbra to her domineering and grouchy loveable grandmother see, a little too typical at first. They seem to be cast from molds when we first meet them, and only gradually through the book do they become non-stereotypes. Roger is probably the best example of this. It's a pleasant surprise to see such a skilled evolution of character and to realize that the characters really don't fit the molds our culture oriented minds readily cast them in.This book is charming, beautiful written, and so sad its heart breaking. The illusions people cast for themselves over the course of the book will frustrate you, and make you want to yell at them to see the truth. It's what makes this novel so good, and so compelling. I'd recommend it to anyone. It's not only an example of great historical fiction; it's just a good book. My only problem with this book is that there is a couple of missing years that are eluded to but never explained in detail.For further reading track down the sequel,Now Face to Face: A Noveland the prequel which explores Barbara's grandmother's young lifeDark Angels: A Novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"...it is a terrific love story, really a bunch of love stories, all poignant. The relationship between Barbara and her grandmother is beautiful, the relationship between Barbara and her husband, DeVane, is tragic. Someone else called this the story of a dysfunctional family---that was an understatement! Set against the intrigues of the French court in the early 1700's and the South Sea Bubble venture, this is the story of a headstrong young woman who's determined to marry a man clearly not right for her, a man whose romantic and sexual past will come back to haunt the girl he marries. Koen pulls no punches. People die, children become ill, fortunes disappear, lives are ruined, love affairs turn out badly, but the wonderful Barbara will get through it all and emerge a stronger, better woman. Get out your handkerchiefs! The biggest problem I have with Karleen Koen's great big terrific historical novels is that she writes so few of them. She can give the more prolific Diana Gabaldon a good run for her money!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"On the surface, Karleen Koen's books may appear to be nothing more than historical romance fluff. You know, the typical muscle-clad hero meets independent but distressed damsel; the two parry and thrust (if you will excuse the phrase) and then, finally, succumb to the throes of passion. Natuarally, this all occurs in some exotic, historical loacle. Koen's books have the fluffy exterior but the interior is much,much meatier than any historical romance I have ever read.&quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; is set in 18th century England and France. The main character, or heroine, is a young girl in love with an older, fatherly type gentleman. As is the case with most young , headstrong girls, the heroine's passions rule her actions and cloud her judgement. After marrying the man of her dreams, she learns the shocking and devestating truth about his character. Because I hold this book in such I high esteem, and because I would like you to enjoy it as heartily as I did, I will not divulge any more of the plot. I will say that there are more turns and twists in this novel, and the sequel &quot;Now Face To Face,&quot; than the most harrowing and breathtaking of rollercoaster rides! As trite as it may sound, expect the unexpected in these books. The hero and heroine's are not nearly as pretty, the locales not nearly as exotic. Nevertheless, there is more substance to this book than any fluffy Harelequin.If you love history, and Koen loads her books with fascinating historical anecdotes and trivia, then you will love these books. However, if you are looking for the formulaic boy meets girl and lives happily ever after in fairyland, don't even consider these books. The characters are colorful, diabolical, interesting, and admirable...far from formulaic.Happy Reading. Let me know what you think"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Having debated long on it, I decided to rate this book purely by its story and not by the author's research (which is extensive and I salute her for it - but I could get that from history books.)I cannot recall ever coming away from a book with a worse feeling in the pit of my stomach and with so much rage at the author. Not because of the tragedies heaped on the characters. I did not expect a fluffy ending tied with a pink bow. What I expected was a modicum of respect for me as a reader.My main reason for hating it so much is this: All the set-ups were empty promises! The author had no idea how wrap things up. I felt she was terrified of confrontations. Because nothing gets resolved. All the fantastic threads of Part A become a tangled mess in Part B and the end was another big set-up that screamed of \\"Go buy the sequel!\\"I know it is hard to believe my critique after so many reviewers raved about this book. The thing is, I totally understand why - the book is wonderfully written but it should come with a big warning tag that says: MAJOR FRUSTRATION AHEAD!Here are the things that killed the book for me:1. The big problem with the main characters - never resolved (and the author went to great length to do that, like making the husband so sick he could not talk and explain. And of course in his letter he said, \\"This is not something to be discussed in a letter.\\" Arggg...)2. The long list of sub-characters with their endless thoughts - not important in the end. You can skip them - trust me! Especially that boring Jane character.3. The counter-hero the author developed throughout the book - gets nothing. Goes to waste. So why did the author tell us about him anyway?4. The heroine, Bab, changes abruptly from the person I rooted for and felt for to something unrecognizable and unbelievable. From a misguided teenagers who insists on marrying the wrong man, she becomes her grandmother's pawn, because having lost faith in her own judgment (and if you read the book you will understand why), she totally loses control over her life, her wants, her dreams for the future. I felt that Bab just lost it at some point. She gave up (at 20!) She didn't know what to do with herself and so handed the reins to her grandmother and did what the old woman said, which was basically to run away like a ditz. Another unbelievable twist since the grandma Alice had a wonderful life in which she was a queen in control. Bab began as a sweet, spirited girl, and ended as a too-stupid-to-live mess of a woman. Did I say a total ditz?5. The slap-in-my face jump from the second before the great climax of the story to years ahead was just rude. That really pissed me off.I kept reading, hoping for resolutions - and never got them. The author pours research into the book as if the pages are vessels for repetitive descriptive details (how many times do I need to read about all the powders and rouges on the vanity table? of the flowers? the clouds? the furniture? the trees? the holidays season?) I could get a magazine for that. When i buy a book i want a story with characters that DO THINGS and take charge of the pages.It felt as though two different people wrote the book: the good Dr. Jekyll wrote Part A and the crazed Mr. Hyde wrote Part B. The good build-up totally disintegrated in the end.This is not good literature. I don't care what people say. Look up Aristotle's POETICS and find out why. This book was worse than bad - it insulted my intelligence.Having read DARK ANGELS and raved about it with my review, I immediately bought the next 2 books in the series. Having read this book, I threw the 3rd - a brand new book - into my trash can without a second thought. I am not treating myself to more abuse from this author."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Overall review: Lavishly detailed but quick-paced early Georgian-era historical fiction in the tradition of Kathleen Winsor or Anya Seton, but including some of the same clumsy styling and lapses in writing craft as those authors. A disappointment to those who hope for a historical romance novel, but worth at least a read for those who do not.--------------------------------------------------------------------------GENRE: Although I recognize that literary genres are artificial marketing devices used by publishers, genres do play by their own rules, and clarifying genre will clear obstacles to your enjoyment of this book. A romance is at its core a book whose main plot thrust is the [ultimately monogamous, male-female] love relationship of one or more sets of lovers, which ends in a betrothal or the promise of long-term happiness. Without this crucial ingredient, there is no romance novel, even if there exist many of the incidental \\"trappings\\" common to many romances (e.g. a forced marriage; social obstacles to love; \\"the Other Woman\\"). Pride & Prejudice is a quintessential romance novel; Gone With the Wind and Through a Glass Darkly are not historical romances, but historical fiction. The best (popular, non-scholarly) exploration of this subject by a scholar is Pamela Regis' _A Natural History of the Romance Novel_.PLOT: The protagonist is a 15-year old noblewoman in Hanoverian/early Georgian England who uses land in her dowry to entice into marriage the 42-year old object of her infatuation. Her marriage takes a nosedive and she finds herself mired in several social, emotional, and political intrigues. We are given a front-seat view of life in both the English and French courts, emphasis on the French, with all their sexual and financial indulgence and moral lassitude.POSITIVES:1. Engaging, memorable characters. You will probably remember and be amused for some time to come by the imperial Duchess, scheming Diana, and nosy Abigail.2. Good use of historical detail. Although there is not great emphasis on actual historical events (wars; coups, etc.), there is liberal and interesting use of the culinary, mortuary, sartorial, sexual, marital and other customs of the age. One of the characters has a \\"secret\\" that was much commoner in the Georgian era than many today are aware; the fact that Koen uses this as a plot device is worthwhile, though her handling of it is not necessarily so (see below).3. Multi-generational emphasis of the \\"mini-series \\"sort that gives heft and drama to novels.4. Interesting inter-weaving of the major literary influences of the time, from the King James Bible to Shakespeare to Alexander Pope.5. A plot premise (see above) that is sound, and the ability to hold one's attention through many plot twists and turns, often through the use of emotional trauma (i.e. deaths).NEGATIVES (You guessed it was coming).1. Characterization of Protagonist. Barbara as spirited child is well-developed, but Koen does not effectively bridge the gap between the different stages of her development. The leaps from excited, nave bride to disillusioned lady about town to survivor of multiple traumas are disjointed and unconvincing. We never really get a handle on Barbara the woman, or her motivations behind her sometimes shocking reactions to her marital problems. And, most importantly, we never learn WHY she is still in love with Roger, after all he has put her through. If anything, we are given evidence of a deep connection with Charles Russel, Tony, and others whom the reader speculates would be better with Bab. In short, if you asked me to explain the character of Babara Alderly, I could only cite her early years with any confidence; everything post-Roger would be referred to as \\"a put-upon woman who asserts herself in ineffective ways and who doesn't know what she wants.\\"2. Characterization of Love Interest. Roger is an unfathomable character. We are told--not shown!-- he is charming and loving toward Barbara, but the majority of his actions indicate the opposite. He makes inscrutable decisions--such as how he lives after the falling-out with Bab--that Koen never explains. The telling instead of showing is a big detraction and indicative of the fact that this was Koen's first novel.3. Inept Time Shift. The single biggest flaw is the way in which the aftermath of Roger and Bab's falling-out is handled. The jump in time from the exact moment of Bab's discovery to a time 4 or 5 years later in which several new characters are lobbed at us is disorienting in the extreme. Plus, it deprives the reader of experiencing first-hand poor Bab's emotions, Roger's reactions to them, etc. Again, telling, not showing.4. The \\"Secret\\" is mishandled. Many people in this class echelon would have been familiar with the symptoms and mere general fact of it, yet Koen's are taken by surprise or totally oblivious. White and Diana, for e.g., would almost certainly have suspected and known of the possibility. Next, we are given to believe that another character's love is so great that the secret, while disturbing to this character, does not really actively bother or disgust or hurt or haunt him/her, and is even incidental to a later expectation of happiness. Finally, we never get what we really want--a satisfactory, detailed explanation and apology from the character whose secret is exposed.5.Style and Technique. The [heavy] use of interior monologue needed major work. Koen is fond of alternating, minus quotes or italics, rapid-fire mental musings with fragments of famous poetry or Bible passages. The result is stream of consciousness on steroids. Next up, Koen often employs the hackneyed phraseology and dialogue tags of some less skillful writers . Finally, she writes large chunks of exposition and historical detail that are not worked into the plot or dialogue; they just sit there.6. Loose Ends. There are too many to count. The entire character of Jane could have been excised, because we are certainly given no lasting impression of what her character has contributed to the other characters or plotline. One character has a 3-page scene describing his wish to rape another character; despite the heavy foreshadowing, no assault is forthcoming. Roger never explains himself or his behavior during or after the falling-out. Tony--who by the end of the novel has shaped up to be an interesting character--is snatched out from under us in a manner that screams \\"sequel.\\" The list goes on.*** 3 Stars to indicate it interested/entertained me, but the problems above would likely keep me from investing in a copy."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It's not often I don't finish a book, if the book starts off on the wrong foot, I usually stick with it until the end in the hopes it gets better, and also for the benefit of the doubt. Not with this book, it promptly went into my \\"started but not finished\\" file on my Kindle. I could not finish it, no matter how much I wanted to. From all of the reviews, I expected it to be good and couldn't wait to dive into it. I tried, really, I did try to like it, but after a while I found myself to be getting very annoyed, aggravated and exasperated. To start, the writing style is not the greatest, I became very annoyed with the numerous two word sentences....I did! I do! I will! Also, the characters babbled on endlessly, I found myself skimming and skipping a lot of parts. Detail is great in a book, it can draw a reader in to the character's world, but here, detail was used too much, too often and repetitively, it's like, Okay, I get it!! To say the least, I was very disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Seven years ago, when I was fourteen years old, I picked up this novel and absolutely fell in love with it. The style and detail of each character made the reader care not only about Barabara's fate but everyone as well. As an aspiring writer myself, I understand the importance of establishing a strong connection between the reader and the characters. This in effect allows there to be a level of suspense which carries the reader from beginning to end. The ability to create that sort of relationship is not an easy task. If you are unfamiliar with Koen's work, Through A Glass Darkly is the perfect introduction. She takes the time for you to understand the main characters and let's the drama unfold for itself. This is not merely a romance, but an interesting historical critique which revolves around the dynamics of a very dysfuntional family. Overall, I have always considered Karleen Koen to be an amazing author because she has taken the time and effort to polish her craft. The only disappointment is the little amount of information known about her, and the small number of novels published. To my knowledge,I have read all the books she has published thus far:Through A Glass Darkly &amp; Now Face to Face. If there are any other publications of her work I eagerly await to read them."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I bought this book hoping to obtain a portrait of the Georgian age, a compelling study of a family struggling to survive political intrigues and economic upheaval, and lastly, as a satisfactory romance. Well, this book did not work for me on any of these levels. The story is set around the failed Jacobite rebellion of 1715 (which forces the heroine's father into exile), the accession of the Hanoverians to the British throne, and lastly but not leastly, the almost concurrent economic crises in France (Law's bank) and the UK (the South Sea Bubble). The last event played a crucial role in the story, and was well-done. Unfortunately, the rest of the period was *not* so well-evoked.Part of the problem lay in the fact that so much of the story was set at the corrupt French court (the regency of the Duc d'Orleans for the young Louis XV), that more of French court intrigue - mostly sexual - was evoked than of British political, economic, and social life. However, the real problem probably lay in the heroine - who is a willful spoiled girl of 15 who has her bridegroom essentially bought for her by her doting grandmother. Barbara Alderley is not all that bad - she is a loving sister (to a wastrel eldest brother and younger siblings) and she is a fond granddaughter. She has suffered from negligent parents who married too young - a Jacobite father who has fled into exile, and a notoriously promiscuous mother (who like Barbara insisted on an early marriage that was a personal disaster). Unfortunately, neither of the marriages ring very true for the period. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, although there were doting parents, marriages were contracted strictly for financial and political reasons, as dynastic and familial alliances rather than love marriages. There were notable exceptions, but this part of the plot is not addressed very well. Barbara's grandmother and late grandfather are presented almost as copies of the 1st Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The real Duke and Duchess of Marlborough are curiously absent.Some of the political luminaries of the day appear (notably Sir Robert Walpole) but are presented almost solely in terms of their relationship to Barbara's mother or her husband, not as personages in their own right with their own careers to make and dynasties to found.Most of the story is about extra-marital sexual liaisions. When Barbara is betrayed by her husband and when she experiences another devastating loss, she does not seek consolation in educating herself or in . Rather, she becomes a duplicate of her mother, taking lovers recklessly - rather like the notorious court favorites of the Restoration period. Despite her infidelities (and despite her husband's infidelity), the couple supposedly remain in love until the very end. How and why is never very clear to me.I should warn romance readers that there is no happily-ever-after unless you count a trip to a Virginian plantation as a HEA. Perhaps this is why the book has been compared to Gone With The End. However, for that book, the age and society in which the book was set was brilliantly evoked, and the heroine (while unlikeable in many ways) had a strong sense of self and of family. I could not feel the same way about THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY or about Barbara Alderley. Her sole merit was that she nursed her husband to the very end and that she loved certain people dearly. Otherwise, she was just another promiscuous beauty - and the book the story of her love affairs, that of her husband, and that of her mother and brother."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"A thoroughly riveting historical drama, Through A Glass Darkly drew me in slowly, I must admit, but before I knew it, I was wholly engrossed! I positively devoured the story, even as I tried to slow myself down to savor its various rich and frothy delights. Its backdrop of early Georgian England is a deep canvas painted with a master hand, which deftly positions the reader right there in the crowded ornate rooms or the fragrant apple orchard, with the winds of the 18th century in your ears.The characters are so expertly presented you begin to feel as if you really love them, and I for one carried them in my thoughts well after I had finished reading. I don't need to go into the plot, since other reviewers have done so well. I only want to add my voice to the chorus of cheers for this truly remarkable, even, for me, *life changing* book!A Bit About The Order Of The Three ConnecTed NovelsI have read the complete saga with real passion, including Dark Angels and Now Face to Face. I must admit I read them \\"out of order\\", at least, out of order of publication. I read TAGD first, then Dark Angels, and Now Face to Face last. I am now reading TAGD again, and I think I will pick up Dark Angels again next. If anyone is curious abut the order in which the books are best read, I would say as long as you don't read Now Face to Face first, you'll be fine.A Bit About My Class With The AuthorA few months ago I casually inspected the \\"About the author\\" on the back flap and my jaw dropped to see that Karleen Koen lives here in Houston. Well, I immediately contacted her through her publisher, and she emailed me back less than a week later, giving me her phone number and offering to meet to talk about her research. I am an amateur historian, and I am truly curious as to how historical fiction authors learn enough about a era to write about it with confidence, let alone really send the reader back in time. And Karleen truly has a gift for time travel.She is also a funny, kind, down-to-earth, fascinating woman. To read her books again, knowing the woman who created these vivid characters and stories, makes for a much richer, more thought-provoking experience.I cannot say enough abut Karleen Koen or her books. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"\\"When I was a child I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face\\"Through a Glass Darkly is the second in a three book series set in Georgian England. Barbara is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and she and her younger siblings were raised by their grandparents instead of their parents Kit and Diana Alderley. Kit is an exiled Jacobite involved in the plots to put James III on the throne and Diana is a scheming slut desperate to wed Diana off to a wealthy man to save her from her creditors. Diana is negotiating with the much older but very wealthy Roger Montgeoffry, Earl Devane, and Barbara is thrilled as she'd always loved Roger from afar - although Diana's insatiable greed might bring those talks to a screeching halt.The path to true love and married bliss is never easy, especially when you have a family as complicated and double dealing as the Barbara's, and it is way too complex to try and explain - just sit back and enjoy the fun. Roger eventually takes his new wife and business to Paris and an innocent Barbara soon gets quite an education in the debauched lifestyle of the French court and its courtiers. Eventually someone from Roger's past returns that thoroughly upsets Barbara's marital applecart and sends her life spinning out of control, and only Grandmamma can set it to rights. Or can she?And that's all I'm going to tell you - I don't write book reports. This is the second time I've read the book and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. While I enjoyed all of the family's antics, I most especially adored Grandmamma and her cats, as well as Barbara's very smutty mother who steals every scene she's in. I loved watching Barbara mature from a young innocent (you will want to slap her a few times) to a mature woman who could take just about anything life threw her way - and life throws her a lot of heartache. It broke my heart watching Tony's unrequited love for Barbara, and as for Philippe? Grrrrrr.This is a book to be savored, like a box of fine chocolate or a rich red wine. Highly recommended, and one I will read again and again and again. The first book in the series isDark Angelsand the last isNow Face to Face. I recommend reading Dark Angels last after you have come to know and love the old Duchess, then go back and read Alice and Richard's story."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through a Glass Darkly is a long romance novel set in the early 1700's in London, Paris and the English countryside. The plot is captivating, the romance is sexy and the historical setting adds (some) realism.Young Barbara, granddaughter of a popular war-hero duke, loves Roger, a handsome and extravangant earl and financier. Barbara, her mother Diana, and her grandmother Alice are all strong colorful characters who spend time managing their many family and social relationships and getting dressed in gowns and jewels.The recommendation might be 5-stars for readers who go for plot with passion, but Through a Glass pales against Gone with the Wind, to which some reviewers have compared it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I never read romance novels, and would not consider this one a romance at all. There is a lot of talk of love and happiness but very little romance in the traditional romance novel term. It is very historical, painting a rich portrait of society on several different levels, the country which the heroine travels, and the limited resources a young woman, even one of a higher economic class, had in those times. You feel close to the main character and can even imagine that you are there, sometimes forgetting you are even reading a novel. It is very real and though it is set in another time, the heroine is very reachable, very knowable.

Even the first 100 pages were ordinary, and I almost put it down and did not pick it back up.For some reason, though, I kept on going, because I despretely wanted to see Babara married to Roger. I am so glad I did because I soon found myself flying through at least a hundred pages a day, until I finished the book this morning. What an amazing book!England, circa 1715. Fifteen-year old Barbara Alderley has lived a simple life at her grandmother's rich estate in Tamworth. She spends her time playing with her brothers and sisters and pulling pranks- until her mother, Diana- a beauty who will sleep with anyone for money- comes to visit. Since Barbara's father is a traitor to the king, Diana is petitioning for a divorce. She sees an ally in weathy Roger Montgeoffry, whom she decides to marry Barbara off to. Despite a large age difference, Barbara has been in love with Roger since childhood, and she is more than happy to marry him. She is sure that she can make him love her. And Roger is a good man- except that he has a few \\"particular\\" tastes, tastes that he cannot control, no matter how hard he tries. Barbara soon finds herself having to face scandal and heartbreak- will she prevail?I loved this book, and I loved both Barbara and Roger. The sideplots about the Duchess of Tamworth (Barbara's grandmother) and Jane were fascinating as well. This book was such a treat that I wish it could have been even longer! (P.S. I hated Charles. Didn't you?) At the beginning of the book I feared it would turn out like a lot of historical fiction, when everybody upon everybody seems to be obbsessed with the main chracter (Barbara, obviously) and you can only tell if someone is bad if they don't like her.(Plus- SPOILER! it was annoying at first how it seemed all her siblings died calling to her- she wasn't their whole world, in my opinion.

I must admit that this book was definitely a page turner for me, I could not put it down. I cried, cheered, fumed, and laughed(very little though). Do not read this book if you suffer from depression. The leading lady went through more in her 5 years (15-20years old in the book)then some of us and our own parents go through put together.I have mixed feelings about this book because it seemed like there was never any happiness. The leading man was 27 years older than her, I can get passed that because of the time period. He feel in love with her, how and when? From part one to part two, 3 years in between, there was no real detail as to what happened to her life, just little snippets that she would think about.The descriptions of places and events was just too much.

I was intrigued enough to buy it in hardcover, and it's been a mainstay in my library ever since. It's not a fantastic novel, but it is very compelling. Koen's details of early eighteenth-century England and France are astounding--nothing is prettied up. She seamlessly weaves historical figures with her characters, and her dialogue evokes the times without going overboard. The book was also a bit shocking for the time since it addressed a homosexual love affair involving one of the main characters, a major plot twist. In the current ridiculously politically correct climate, one has to wonder if that combined with the romance between a fifteen-year-old girl and a forty-three-year-old man would have been so hotly fought over by publishing companies today as it was in the mid-eighties. \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" does traverse an extremely fine line between historical romance and serious historical fiction, doing so with finesse and style.

This is one of the books that when you read it, you could just kick yourself in the shin for not reading it sooner! I LOVE drama and this book did not disappoint.Through a Glass Darkly is a novel about Barbara Alderley and is set in England and France in the early 18th century. Barbara and her siblings were raised by her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother, Diana, being too selfish and caught up in her own drama to worry about the children she bore and her father has just left the family, taking the money with him.When Barbara's mother informs her that plans are in motion for Barbara to wed Roger Montgeoffrey, she cannot contain herself, to her mother's surprise. Roger was an old friend of her grandfather's that she has been secretly in love with since she was younger. What Barbara does not know is that she is part of a deal her mother has concocted.The story goes on to follow Barbara as she moves to London and marries Roger. She quickly grows up when surrounded by the deception and cruelty of the English and French courts.I really enjoyed this novel. The characters were well-developed and easy to like, although they had their own faults (but that's what makes them real). Koen paints a very pretty picture through her words and you as the reader feel like you are right there with Barbara through all of her ups and downs. What was interesting to me was watching as Barbara tried to stay true to herself and her beliefs amidst the licentiousness of court. The love between Barbara and Roger was beautifully written, so much so, that you could feel it in your heart. One word of caution: have plenty of tissues ready when you are near the end (and if you do cry, then do in a separate room as your husband or he will more than likely make fun of you, like mine).Bottom line: I highly recommend this book to all historical fiction fans!Song: Torch by Alanis MorissetteFavorite lines:When you can no longer taste the divine nectar of life, when love no longer exists, then life is death.Never run away from the truth because you carry it on your shoulder and someday it will put its ugly face into yours and say, \\"Boo\\".Forgiveness: It is never done well in little bits and dabs. Do it all at once and never look back, or do not do it at all.Change is an easy thing to decide and a difficult thing to do. It is the day-to-day struggle of it that defeats people. Do not despair if old ways look good to you. Despair only if you fall into them too often."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"In 1988, when i read 'Glass' for the first time, I was fifteen years old, no older than Barbara, the heroine of Koen's masterpiece novel. Eleven years later, I have read this novel no fewer than ten times. I am amazed at the constant source of magic that is TAGD. Each read brings me deeper into the world of Barbara and her protective grandmother...each read brings me deeper into the realm of what it was to live and breathe in the eighteenth century. TAGD is a masterpiece and a forceful read. Easily one of the best novels ever written. My letter from Ms. Koen is framed and hanging on my wall :)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this novel a couple years ago and I remember it being great. Sorry I can't give specifics, but it definitely a must read trilogy."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend it. This book will break your heart and make you jump for joy. Must read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really love this book. I have read it more times than I can count. Beautifully written. Do not waste your time with the sequel or the prequel, though."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I bought the book for 99 cents at a variety store, taking a chance that it might be good (when good books are really long, I love it). I didn't read it for a while, but when I finally picked it up, I couldn't stop reading it. It completely drew me in, and the different twists it took suprised me, horrified me, saddened me, and made me totally fall in love with it. I sympathized with the antagonists (even the vicious, plotting Diana) and Barbara's Grandmama was so endearing. The heroine, Barbara, was real: silly and unlikeable at times, heartbreakingly honest and real at others. The subplots, such as Therese's own tumultuous life beneath Barbara, added so many dimensions to the story. Much better than the classic, fluffy romance novels. So much historical information, character development, and real emotion from me. I was sad when it ended, and can't wait to track down the sequel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly was an enchanting book. The best book I have read so far. The book was hard to put down, it made me feel that I was there in Barbara's world which made the book fun to read. I loved the book, it was unique and inspiring. The characters became your friend's or enemies that made you feel that you knew them or have met them before. It's a must read for those who want to read an excellent book. I can't wait to read more of her books."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is a wonderful book. I love it. I read it every year or so. I first bought the hardcover and now I have the paperback too. This is the kind of story that you become a part of. When I re-read it, it's like visiting old friends. For years after I first read TAGD I searched for a new Koen novel. I am thrilled to find out a new one exists."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book makes you remember what it's like to be so young &amp; in love. The characters were wonderful; you grew to love, or even hate them.Although Barbara is young, she portrays that rare quality that few have in that forgiveness goes with true love. I read constantly, but this is one of my all-time favorites! It should be made into a movie. Unfortunately, the sequel didn't have the impact I would have liked. However, I hope Ms. Cohen will try again. She is a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am known for only reading very high-end quality romances--and this is about my favorite. Ms. Kohen's descriptions are so vivid, you can practically see the characters and what they are wearing.

And I cannot deny that it is well written. The story follows a teenage girl whom I felt protective of and her mother whom I quickly felt sorry for. But the author put in more sex than was necessary. Simple allusions to it would have sufficed.The book reads slowly. It felt like it took along time to get to the first main event in the story. As to its historic nature, the author has pinned many details perfectly and she fills the story with facts and details that brings the story to life."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am not a literature expect by no means but I have taught middle school reading courses throughout my twelve years of teaching career! I don't know where to start. In my opinion, there were TOO many flat characters. I could help but wonder why the author included them.The chapters were TOO long and it seems to change settings too many times for the readers to accurately keep them straight in their mind. I don't understand why the author had chosen to have part I and II. Wouldn't it have been better to have developed this book into a trilogy? It appears as if part I and part I was written by TWO different authors. In the first part, the author separated out each characters inner thoughts by use of italics or starting new paragraphs. In the second part, the author made no attempt to separate each characters' inner thoughts. I had to constantly reread the paragraph to decipher the conversation and each thought the characters involved. Look at this example passage.Where is Roger? Where is Roger Devane? I will claw out his eyes. I will cut out his heart and eat it myself. Where is he, Barbara? Where? I do not know, Mother. Where are you, Roger? Come to Tamworth, please. I need you.It is too hard to decode. It should been clear that Diane, the mother was saying,\\" Where is Roger? Where is Roger Devane? I will claw out his eyes. I will cut out his heart and eat it myself. Where is he, Barbara? Where?\\"Barbara's respond should have been, \\"I do not know, Mother. Where are you, Roger? Come to Tamworth, please. I need you.\\"The sexual situations and language was a bit strong for my taste. In all fairness, I really don't have much of a comparison since I do NOT read books with content such as Fifty Shades of Grey.I have taught my students the plot map and the elements of fiction. For the most part, they know that after the climax of the story, there should be should kind of falling action and a resolution. This story did not! Barbra's grandmother, known as the Dutchess in the story, sent Barbra off to Virginia to inspect some land that had come into her possession. After conflict about Barbra leaving England to Virginia, the author has the Dutchess crying into the arms of her grandson. This was never resolved. I wanted to know what happened to Barbara!I would have to say that the author needs to go back and attend some writing courses! Readers must have a resolution!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but I can't say that they were met. Despite turns of plot that promised character development, I found that most characters, including the protagonist, remained fairly one-dimensional. Peculiarly, some scenes that Koen could have used to show character growth were left to occur in a time-lapse vacuum; in one case, instead of seeing Barbara sort through the challenge of a particular plot twist, the reader is swept directly to a scene several years later, none the wiser. The plot itself held no surprises for me; Koen's foreshadowing came across as clunky and heavy-handed. This book suffers from a serious case of Chekhov's gun. Despite my litany of complaints, it's a fine, inoffensive read, but I never was drawn in to Barbara's world, nor did I become invested in her story. There is much better historical fiction out there."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Well, I'm not going to tell you what happened and spoil the book - like some readers do. What's the use in reading it if you already know what happens? This is a great book. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when it first came out in hardcover over 20 years ago...I don't remember much of the details now but I do remember that I could NOT put it down and stayed up the entire night reading it.

One of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"OMG! This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is just as good as stephanie myers books in a different way.

The setting, details, and timeframe were intriguing to me and there were definitely some strange happenings in the book that kept it interesting to the end. The characters and relationships are well-developed. This author is certainly not afraid to kill off characters, that's for sure. I think this book is worthing reading, though I haven't bothered to order the sequel or prequel yet. Maybe when my to-read list gets a little shorter..."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"We read this book in my book club. I think that it was the first time that everyone loved the book. It is a page turner."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was the first book I have read by Karleen Koen. If you are a fan of Phillipa Gregory's writing like I am you will love hers as well! The characters are great and I was pulled into this book. I get bored easily so it was nice to have my attention kept. Takes place in the early 1700's in England and France. Great detail. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is carried to greatness by its main character, Barbara, a young, spirited noblewoman who quickly captures the interest and heart of the reader and manages to hold onto both for over seven hundred pages. Other characters -- Barbara's husband and the love of her life, her adoring, crotchety grandmother, the rest of her family, her servants, the servants of others, malicious nobles, her infatuated cousin, her husband's lover -- all are given a voice and perspective, making this tale full and multidimensional.The historical accuracy of this book is awe-inspiring in its detail, but often given in list-like form and thus not as complimentary an addition as it should have been. The story spans six years of Barbara's life, and is well-paced and interesting most of the time, laced with happiness, wit, tragedy, cruelty, and again, detailed historical background.All in all Through a Glass Darkly is a worthwhile read that manages to stretch 743 pages without getting too thin, or too thick."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had heard about this book some time ago, but only just got around to reading it recently. Most likely because I have an unsatiable hunger for GOOD historical fiction. \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" more than hits the mark for qualifying in this category. I found the beginning a bit slow, but it could have just taken me some time to get used to the large cast of characters. After that, the book just sails.At first, I found young Barbara's declared \\"love\\" for the much older Roger to be a bit much, too unbelievable by far. Of course, I realized it only adds to the degree of pain the heroine suffers when she discovers the hidden truth to Roger. Any experienced reader will be able to pick up the many clues to Roger's BIG SECRET which are peppered throughout the first half of the book, prior to it's revelation.A host of strong secondary characters play integral roles in moving this story forward. The Duchess, Barbara's grandmother is a fiesty old battle axe whose presence adds some humor to the tale. Barbara's mother, Diana , flawlessly plays the role of a woman who whores herself for her own selfish purposes . Diana's nemesis, her sister in law and Barbara's aunt Abigail is another humorous character; a busbody trying to advance the interests of her son Tony, the current Duke of Tamworth. At first Tony come off as a fat bumbling idiot, but by the end of the book he's a slim, dashing young man, who happens to be in love with his cousin Barbara. What a tangled web. I found myself rooting for Tony and Barbara to end up together. I was thrilled to learn of the sequel \\"Now Face To Face,\\" in the hopes they may end up together yet.This book is more historical fiction than a true romance. It covers, in great detail, economics, politics and social mores of early 1700's England.I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves big beefy works of historical fiction. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I first read this many years ago...and have read a a couple of times since. It's one of my favorite historical fiction novels &amp; is probably the book that got me into historical fiction. I think it's a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is a really fun read. It's not at all difficult to read, in fact it may even be on an adolescent level of literature or less. Like I said, it is fun and entertaining, appealing to the baser senses.This is one of those books where you begin to care about the characters (not unlike a soap opera) and think about them for a long time afterwards. Therefore you must follow them to see where the story goes. I thought that Diana Alderly was as fascinating a character as Ingrid Magnuessen from White Oleander, or even as much as Scarlett O Hara.One odd thing was that, the very first line ever uttered from Barabara was when she called her maidservant a slut for not letting her know when her mother had arrived in chapter one. For the rest of the book Barabara was someone else entirely; she was admirable, determined, caring, doting, and maternal to loved ones, so on. It was mildly bizarre that that was the first quote from her, but other than that, its a fine read.You buy the books you know that you will want to read again, and I would buy this."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I have read both this book and its sequel both twice thru, it's that great. The author's ability to blend historical fact into such an interesting plot line is amazing. Most books I read that try to involve historical politics tempt me to skip ahead due to boredom, but not this book! The characters' individuality makes for realistic interaction and conflict. I couldn't help but read this book in no more than five or six sittings. It really is quite a sizeable book, but if it's the type of reading that catches your attention, pick it up, set yourself down, and prepare for one of the most realistic, captivating, enjoyable treks into the fictitious past."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, but was left feeling depressed and unsatisfied. I like a book with characters that are more realistic and less perfect, but this book took it way to far; every character was corrupt. Even the young heroine gives up by the end. If you were as disappointed as I was, try reading The Bronze Horseman or Redeeming Love. Both historical novels are full of suffering and anguish, similar to this novel, but have better endings."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"With the publication this fall of Koen's Dark Angels, I looked forward to reading the book that started it all, Through A Glass Darkly. While this book is a fast, easy read, I didn't see what a lot of the other reviewers saw in this book.Not that it isn't entertaining. TAGD is a historical romance, but when comparing Koen to writers such as Phillipa Gregory and even Jean Plaidy, Koen's book seems transparent and fluffy. Her characters are somewhat unsympathetic and seem to lack basic common sense at times. Its hard to like anybody in this book as many of the characters seem to fall into stereotypes, i.e. the wronged woman, the doting matriarch, the wicked mother. Also, some of the plot twists are so obvious in coming, i.e. \\"one man's dark secret.\\"Yes, the book is a fun beach read type of work. But, don't be disappointed if you come to this book and realize that it just doesn't have the emotional connectivity to character like other books, such as The Constant Princess or The Other Boleyn Girl. Read it for the intrigues, like an episode of Dynasty, but don't expect to come away feeling for the main character."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I adored this book and was thrilled to find after finishing it that there is both a prequel and sequel which I have yet to read. As a historian and decorative arts specialist, I appreciated the attention to detail in the setting and costumes. I found the characters entertaining and believable and largely likeable. I was torn as the character was torn and in love as the main character loved. The ending was a bit hokey, but I will forgive it after such a lovely effort the rest of the book.I definitely recommend. I look forward to reading more by this author!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It is definitely a great read, but you might become angry with the author if you are expecting some grand love story. This book doesn't have a happy ending, but life doesn't always have a happy ending, does it? I would describe Through a Glass Darkly as a story about life. I was worried about some of the bad reviews before I read it, but now that I finished it, I understand why some people didn't really care for this book. The first two chapters were really terrible, lots of raunchy sex scenes, children die, the author skips 4 years ahead, and the readers don't get the ending they will want. Not to mention, Roger's big secret will make your jaw drop. Still, all this is what made this book so intriguing to me. Trust me, it's definitely worth it.Also, Mrs Koen does a wonderful job at expressing grief. You just want to cry along with the characters. Everytime Barbara said \\"I will not cry.\\" It just broke my heart. Most of the characters in this book are very well developed. Barbara's grandmother, is just delightful. You will wish she was your grandmother. She is strong and wise, and you just might come away with some words of wisdom for yourself!I am definitely buying the next book, Face to Face. I just have to know what Barbara is up to."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"i was at the thrift store compiling summer pleasure reading...i do not waste time with \\"romance novels,\\" mind you...but i liked the cover of this book and was drawn to it...i flipped to the middle and read a few paragraphs...i did that twice...and i decided to give it a chance...my expecatations were not high for this novel...but the author is a superb writer...she uses words that i had to look up (which i LOVE to do)...her character development is enthralling...and i was quickly swept up in the time period and woulnd into the lives of the characters...several hundred pages in,i did have to admit that it was a \\"trashy romance\\" novel, after all...but, i was hooked and loved everry minute of my wellinvested time...i look forward, with great zeal to the sequel \\"Now Face to Face\\""},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book took me longer than I thought it would. I didn't truly get into it until I'd read about 100 pages, and then I found that I cared about the characters and the situations said characters found themselves in when they steadfastly refused, time and again, to see what was in front of them. The story itself flows along nicely and I especially appreciated the nice historical detail. I confess I don't know a lot about this era and so if there are any glaring errors in the author's research, I cannot catch them. But from the point of view of someone who really doesn't know better, the descriptions of the time and the people were interesting. The minutiae of 18th century life was described particularly well, I thought.HOWEVER, this book was edited very badly. I found a grammatical/spelling/anything error about every three pages. I don't have the same edition that Amazon is selling, though, so I don't know if these errors have been fixed. I have the copy with a light blue border and a painting of two lovers on the front. If you happen to be someone who gets easily annoyed with typos, this book might give you a stroke.The characterizations in this book were, I thought, done fairly well. There were a few cardboard-type characters, but I was often pleasantly surprised when some character I thought I had pegged showed a new facet to their personality.**SPOILERS**I absolutely could not believe the number of deaths that this novel contains. The second part of the book was just tiresome because almost every loose end was tied up with a death. I felt cheated because nothing came to a conclusion, nothing really happened with a lot of the characters I was interested in. They just... died. And you know, I like a death at the end of a novel because it usually adds some emotion or poignancy or whatever. These deaths just seemed trite and unnecessary, like the author didn't want to come up with anything else. And as for Barbara... it was like every horrible thing that could possibly happen to her, happened. After a while she wasn't even a person to me anymore; she was a receptacle for miseries and nothing else. But then, to be fair, I shot myself in the foot because I couldn't help but read ahead a few times. That's probably part of the reason why the deaths seemed so annoying.**END**Overall, this book is good. I'd recommend it to a friend interested in historical fiction or in the period. I got a good bit of entertainment from reading Barbara's story. But it's not a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is the story of Barbara...a young girl right on the cusp of womanhood during the early 1700s. Barabara has all of her young life been head over heels for Roger Montgeoffry. When Barbara finds that a marriage is possibly being arranged between her and Roger, a man she thought only to get close to in her dreams...she is ecstatic and determined to do anything and everything in her power to see that the marriage takes place. Oh, but there is sooo much more to this book!! It covers years...it spans across both England and Paris and is peppered with an amazing array of characters...characters I both loved and wanted to strangle. Through a Glass Darkly had so many ups and downs..it was happy, and romantic, and exciting, and so so sad. Rarely do books make me cry, but this one not only had me in tears, it had me in a dazed fog for several hours after finishing...when a book moves me like that, even after Im done reading..I know it was a good one. I have only one real complaint with this book and that was that I wanted more from the ending...but overall, I loved this story so much I couldnt possibly rate it at lower than 5 stars. It swept me along and I happily devoured all 700 some pages...dont let the size of this book intimidate you...it is so entertaining you wont even notice its length. Infact, youll want more!...I highly recommend reading Through a Glass darkly.... A definite keeper."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This grand, sweeping drama follows a grand family in the 18th century. All the characters are vividly drawn. None some like a characture. It follows a young girl, virtually abandoned by her parents, living with her grandmother. The only unbelievable part is how \\"in love\\" Barbara is with the much older Roger who she has met a few times as a child.Barbara's mother, Diana is very well done, with just the right touch of believability done to her \\"heartless\\" mother role. The grandmother, the Duchess is my favorite. The servants are even a great, at times humorous touch.This was a great historical read. I think the romance in this book is mostly tragic. I would highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book was the first written by Houston TX housewife (and former editor of a local magazine). It's an impressive first outing.Innocent, young and pretty Barbara Anderley has led a sheltered life. When she and her sister and brothers were abandoned by her courtesan mother, they were taken in by a doting grandmother. Life on their 18th century country estate was a somewhat isolated and protected one.Barbara's father has recently fled to support a pretender to the British throne. Her mother, a flamboyant libertine, arranges a marriage between Barbara and Roger Montgeoffrey, Count of Devane. Barbara is thrilled, for she has known -- and loved -- the Count since childhood. Devane marries her for her dowry, admitting that he doesn't love her but she vows to win his love. (Names keep reminding me of DuMaurier's REBECCA -- Anderley for Manderley, Devane and Dewinter...look for more similarities.)As they move among the courts of France and England, Barbara becomes beautiful, worldly and sought-after as she falls more and more deeply in love with her husband. Then she discovers his terrible secret and her world falls apart.This is a fast-moving story with interesting, if predictable, characters. Readers of historical romance expect certain characters (beautiful heroines and handsome heroes, for example) and they want the story to develop certain ways. This one falls right along those lines. Don't look for lilting prose and surprising plot here but if you enjoy historical romances, you'll love THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Set in the opulent 18th Century, _Through a Glass Darkly_ is the story of an English noblewoman named Barbara Alderley. As the story begins she is fifteen, ready to be married, and coping with a father who has run from persecution as a Jacobite and thrown her family into financial ruin and a mother whose rather 'unsavory' reputation has brought her ridicule and disgrace in the royal court of King George. At the same time she is coming to realize that, as a woman, her own desires and dreams are largely unimportant and instead, her future is in the hands of her family and her future husband.Through countless plot twists and turns, Barbara eventually marries the man that she loves but is later forced to learn things about him that she could have never imagined and her life is changed forever.In many ways this book reads like a history lesson, but one that truly whisks the reader to the early 18th Century, a time when England's bubble economy is about to burst, the aristocracy still reigns supreme, and no one goes out without being properly powdered, rouged, and patched.Each detail (and there are many) truly makes this period of time come alive. However, though the setting is rich, it is the characters in this story that are absolutely unforgettable. Readers of historical fiction will be enthralled by this book, and there is enough suspense and romance to appeal to many other kinds of readers too. Highly recommended and a title I constantly display at my library."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is very well written, I cried almost throughout the whole book. I have read many historical romance novels and this one seem to have it all. Romance, betrayal, love and more!I could not put this book down. Story line and characters are very good the only thing that I did not particularly like is the side stories of dreams or flashbacks that don't really pertain to the story or if they did they went to deep and off subject."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The first two chapters were hard for me, but I stuck with it and WOW! This book was wonderful! I had a hard time putting it down. I loved the main character Barbara and the details in the book made you feel like you were there. TAGD is defiantly going on my favorites list."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Each character is craftily composed and unique in voice and detail. The story rings with classic telling and is reminiscent and ambitiously echoes the possible influences of the Bronte sisters and Austen. I found myself emerged in the story and attached to the various characters. Koen does a beautiful job of chronicling the life of Barbara while presenting the realities of marriage, money, title and hardships. Whereas in some historical fiction, the plot becomes secondary to the research, Koen uses history to drive the plot and coincidentally carry her main character towards a journey to the new world. In addition, the inclusion of the story (read by the characters) of Robinson Crusoe works to foreshadow the tale and adds thematic depth. It contributes a pleasant opposition to the idea of domesticity and the lure of a fresh start in a new land. It also represents the individual dreams and spirit of the youth in the household, including the desire to escape through adventure rather than sit idly praying in a chapel in the country. It is the old way or tradition, verses the new generation and idealized hope of promise.The first half of the story might seem a bit disjointed and although it gives a historical background to the scandalous sexual exploits of the elite at the time, it really is not terribly important to the core plot of the story. However, it does provide a basis for what was acceptable. Some readers might be discouraged by the length of the novel, but in defense, the meandering scenic descriptions are in step with the classic authors and possible influences mentioned above."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Richly Detailed, Slightly Melodramatic...and SpicyI'm rounding up from 3.5 starsI found 'Through a Glass Darkly' to be an engaging well paced story with likeable characters woven into a rich fabric of English traditions, mores, fashion and sexual intrigues.I would have liked Karleen Koen to focus on a few of my favorite characters a little more but over all I thought it was an enjoyable and easy read.The setting, England and France from 1715 until the early 1720s includes the conflicts between Whigs, Tories and Jacobites as well as the economic devastation of the South Sea Bubble. The history is not the focus of the story but rather a backdrop for the events in the life of the main character Barbara Alderly Devane.Barbara is a headstrong young girl who's father has disgraced her family by supporting the Jacobites and deserting her mother and his country. Finding a prosperous husband to marry her maybe difficult. Her overbearing mother who is constantly conniving and looking for the best opportunity has begun negotiating a deal for her daughter's future. She nearly secures the marriage contract with Lord Devane, Roger Montgeoffry, a man who has always been close with their family. But as with all things Barbara's mother seems to have pushed too hard.I enjoyed the relationship between the main characters Roger and Barbara, even though I didn't feel satisfied by the course their lives take. I thought Koen painted a realistic picture of the aftermath of the economic ruin of the South Sea Bubble and how it personally impacted people and their lives.There were many gardening, harvesting and seasonal traditions woven into the background of the story which I found interesting and I thought added to the story.The first one hundred pages or so are spent getting to know the cast of characters and the story begins in earnest after that. The ending is an ending obviously made for a sequel. The story in between was enjoyable, interesting and emotionally moving. I think readers who are fans of love stories and historical fictions will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I don't review things often, but I couldn't help it with this book. It is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are fantastic and I find the story emotionally compelling. The economic turmoil of the South Sea scandal is quite relevant to our own recent economic slump.In spite of the book's length, it was over too quickly! (Just realized there is a sequel!)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I ordered this book to replace a book that had been stolen. The story is historical fiction. The author has done a wonderful job of creating a story that will wrap one in the description of the setting so well that you can almost believe you are there. The story is interesting and the characters come alive in ones imagination. I would recommend this book to any one, and especially someone who is looking for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This afternoon I finished listening to an audio version of this book, narrated by Rosalyn Landor. The novel was tragic in its own way, but deeply enthralling. It revolves around the character of Barbara Alderley, a 15-year-old headstrong, beautiful noblewoman whose love for a man 27 years her senior pushes the plot line forward. From that infatuation a world of passion and sorrow comes forth - beginning with her mother's self-serving attempt to arrange their marriage, then pausing in lascivious life of the Paris courts, then careening into the national chaos of the South Sea Company's financial failure. Barbara weathers it all with the help of her clear-sighted grandmother, and though I felt like Barbara's character could have matured more I nevertheless enjoyed reading about her. I can see why this book has so many 5 star reviews on Amazon and will be checking Karleen Koen's other novels out from the library."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Seriously...if it wasn't for needing to care for my children, I would've read this book 24/7. It is THAT good.The begining starts out simple enough: Fifteen year old Barbara's scheming mother has arranged for her to marry a much older (and rich) man. From there, the plot contains all sorts of twists and turns...some that you typically wouldn't expect from a historical fiction novel. Which makes it all so much more interesting.I also liked how realistic this books seemed. Like real life, things don't always turn out how the characters would like them to. And people die, left and right, of all sorts of things. Not always pleasant, but a true indication of what life back then would've really been like.This is such a full, rich book. I highly recommend it for anyone, especially historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am at a loss (ok, nearly) as to how to write a review for this rich and marvelous novel. Here is what I know:I fell in love with all the characters and though 20 years have passed since I first read this book I am still as much in love with them as ever. Karleen Koen delivers characters so real and moving and gorgeous that it is difficult to believe they did not, in fact, truly exist.This is, mostly, the story of Barbara Alderley Devane and her life amidst the Hanoverian court in England in the early 1700's. I wasn't particularly interested in that time period before reading this novel and it is a real testament to the author that I could be so engrossed in the goings-on of the court. There is passion and love and heartbreak aplenty in Through a Glass Darkly. I still read a certain death scene and bawl like my heart is breaking. Wicked and cruel and cutting dialogue. Splendor and glamour and fleeting glory. I just loved every single minute of reading this masterpiece and if you enjoy your books with an edge of sophistication I think you'll devour it, too."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am not usually into perod dramas and I have tried to read many others only to last a few chapters....not this book. This book I literally couldn't put it down. I have neglected my family and ended up extremley sleep deprived as I spent any \\"sitting chance\\" reading this wonderful book. It has been a very long time a book has done this to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. (I have a large pile of half read books needing to be finished!)The story is wonderfully written centering on a generation of fiesty women, The Duchess of Tamworth, Diana and Barbara. It was so hard to develop an opinon of the characters as they changed throught the course of the book and this made the story all the more unpredicable and enjoyable. I do have to agree with other reviewers regarding \\"killing off of the characters\\" issue. It seemed that all the characters Lady Devane had a relationship with, ended up in the Tamworth Vault. Plus the missing years in the book, through me off a little, trying to decipher what exactly happened. In my opinion the Dark Secret wasn't so dark - it was pretty obvious in the begining- and I thought wasn't what the whole book was about.I just loved the detail of London and Paris, and to me it was fantastic, even it may not historically correct. I think sometimes readers forget that this is a fictional novel and a great one at that. My only recommedation is that you be prepared to spend your waking hours reading this book. Can't wait to read the sequal and the prequal."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book was nothing more than annoying. The author's writing style was not bad, which is the only thing that allowed me to be able to finish the book. The majority of the characters are unlikable, the heroine in particular. She was nothing more than a whiny little crybaby. I won't be able to force myself to read the sequel. This book's style came across as more of a romance than an historical fiction novel. There is no possible way this book could ever compare to Gone with the Wind."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love to read, but the author has over done it. It's too long and drawn out. There are too many things going on. The majority of the book, I skimmed over and just flipped pages. I was not impressed. I only read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened to Barbra and Roger. There is way to much going on and a lot of useless information given. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I feel that the author should have focused on the 2 main characters and their story, but the author just goes into so much non-sense in the book and just draws it out. How this book is a \\"New York Times Best Seller\\" is beyond me. It's not that great. Choose for yourself how you feel. I chose this book because it had good reviews from people, but I don't think those were honest reviews."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The way this story is written is odd. I never felt a flash of anxiety, happiness, excitement, etc. It was just flat. The plot is what kept me reading because a great potential always seemed to be hovering around the next corner. The fights, the sex, the turmoil, and the sorrow were beyond confusing me with the authors inability to maker me FEEL any of these things. The book is in two parts and I found the transition any thing but seamless and compelling. Let me get to the point...I won't even be giving this author a second chance, it was that big of a let down. Two stars for the over all vision and idea of the plot."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I was amazed that a book this long could hold my attention so firmly. I couldn't put it down; I don't read much historical fiction, but now I want to explore the genre."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"&quot;Through A Glass Darkly&quot; is the most, heart-wrenching, attention grabber, poignant, love story that I have yet read. The details of the late 1700's in England and France captured my attention and the way Koen writes the characters feelings, thoughts, and actions that literally passed through me and into my very core. It has the strength to make even me, a very tough, and hard pleasing person, cry and worry over the characters' dilemmas. Since I do not have much time on me, I must wrap things up. This is the best novel that I have read so far its twists and turns kept me turning pages from early morn to late at night wondering what would happen next until everything ended. I love this book so much I went out and bought it right after I finished (I had rented the book from the library when I first read it) it! I would totally recommend this book to any fan of: heartbreaking love affairs, old English/French history and of course a long, hearty 743 page novel to pass the time reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I just read this book and it has been almost impossible for me to put it down. If you read one book this summer make sure this is the one. I have not yet read the sequel but I can hardly wait to get it and read it. It has been a while since I have read a book with such attention to historical detail. The last author I read who did so was Diana Gabaldon and her Outlander series. This book will stay with you for a long time, and the characters will become a part of your life."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is a book that will never leave you. The story is another one of those historical novels that makes you forget what century you are currently living in, not to mention you will find your self forgetting about your daily duties till you have completed this book. I highly recomend this soon to be classic and then pass it on to someone else! PS...Get ready for a plot that gives you such a surprise it will take your breath away."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My favorite epic of all time is Gone With the Wind and I tend to compare all epics to that classic. This book is right on par! I couldn't put it down...reading way into the night and even sneaking peeks at work. It is simply that good. You HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! I was so upset when I finished it, because I wanted to still be involved with the character's lives...it was 5 years before I found her sequel and I truly yelped when I found it in the book store. Please read this book. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is a classic. this is one book in a million. It made me laugh and cry. This is better than Gone with the Wind. A must read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love books, but only a few more than I love this one. I just reread it for I believe the 6th time since it was first published. Although it no longer makes me cry as it did the first time, I am always misty. The only letter I have ever written to an author was to Karleen Koen begging for a sequal. Unfortunatly, the sequal is no near the triumph that this book is. If you haven't read it, you should. And if you know someone who hasn't read it, it makes a great gift. (everyone I've given it too has also loved it.)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Without giving away the plot, I'll say I enjoyed the way this book had a twist that, although I saw it coming, was surprising for your average historical fluff."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My suggestion would be that an editor get hold of this with a red pen. The pages could be reduced by almost half and not much would be lost.I picked this book because historical romantic fiction is one of my favorite genres. As history it is \\"good\\"; accurate in the economics, life, and prevalent morbidity in early 18th century Europe. The author includes the rise and fall of \\"new money\\" as well as the endurance of \\"old money\\" and title. The romance is more sexual and many times deviant with far too many affairs. The book gives the impression that if you were in London or France no one sleeps with their spouses. (This includes the handsome, risqu&eacute; husband of the heroine who also finally succumbs to revenge sex with others).I try desperately to finish every book that I start and this book pressed the limits of that personal commitment. Details of description were WAY out of hand and I found my self skimming quickly to try to get to the next morsel of a far too dragged out plot. (Did I really need to read a whole page of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\"? If I wanted to read Robinson Crusoe I would READ Robinson Crusoe!) I actually couldn't wait to finish the book so I could move on.The ending poises you for a sequel but believe me, I am content to leave everyone just where they are. I choose to believe somewhere in the historical romantic fictional world they lived historically, romantically, and fictionally happy.There were times the book was interesting and page turning, but those times were rare. If you read this, do not expect a riveting, appropriately paced plot. Expect to keep reading if only to say, \\"I climbed Mt. Everest and won!\\""},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book! In fact, had to purchase the prequel and sequel companion books. Found myself immersed in the characters and couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was coming next. Ending of sequel was weak, incomplete and left me dissatisfied - what happened to the lead characters? Perhaps another sequel is in the works? Worth your time to read - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Disappointing...you get wrapped up in the character, feel her pain, then try to muddle through gaps of time where you can't tell what's going on, and suddenly new people are in the picture. The ending of the book was the most frustrating. If you go through 6 years of misery, why do you suddenly leave the only person who has shown you support and love? I know a sequel has been written, but the reviews are far from glorious. I will not be purchasing it. I think I will leave our heroine in the ocean."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Not as well written as Philippa Gregory books, but very enjoyable. Would have preferred a book more about royal family."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I loved this book. It was enjoyable and interesting and I laughed and cried but mostly i just couldnt put it down."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I wish I could give this book 7 stars. It's complex, fascinating, compelling reading of a type that you can no longer find in historical novels today. Somehow I missed it when it came out, but I'm rather glad I did because it was such a pleasure to read a novel this good now.I have just finished reading the sequel which is just as good and comes to a very satisfying ending, but not without a great deal of angst.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"We just got back from a cruise down the Danube from Prague to Budapest where our traveling buddy was reading this book, Through the Glass Darkly. She kept slipping away in the evening to go read and I finally asked her what she was reading and immediately downloaded it.For the rest of the trip amidst all the beautiful scenery and rich history, all I wanted to do was slip away and read it as well!Kathleen's research, her story line, and the creative way she forms her sentences holds my attention as it has not been held by any other book since \\"Unbroken!\\" I have already downloaded the rest of her books and can't wait to \\"gobble them up\\" like I did this one. What a talent!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Once in a great while, you will come across a book that leaves you stunned by its creativity, lush background, and unforgetable characters. This is that book. All of the characters are given voices so that they are multi-dimensional and you completely understand their actions. Bravo to the author for writing such a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I got this on kindle as a freebie and what a surprise it was! This is a remarkable story with a substantive plot. It is fulfilling. Although some of the characters had a frivolous nature indicative of the time setting none of the characters/secondary characters were frivolous. Every single character had a purpose and added depth to the story. The characters were alive and complex! It's a story about history, romantic ideals, reality after disillusionment, intrigue, selfishness, selflessness, pitfalls of vanity and excess, and life's journey's ugliness and beauty. What an adventure! It will leave an impress long after you finish the beautiful story. Can't wait to read the sequel and prequel!!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love historical novels. This one is not badly written, but, the author does not seem to know what to do with the people in her novel and she keeps killing then. After 400 pages I learned not to get attached to anyone the beautiful Barbara loves, for surely he will die shortly. Can you believe the authoe killed the 5 beloved young brothers and sisters of the heroin in one page?, I was horrified, (the remaining older brother had to kill himself for lack of plague). It was no surprise that a cute 4 years old godson had no chance of surviving the flue and a mirracle that his brothers were still breathing at the end of the novel. I do not dare order the sequel for I am sure that if barbara will ever have children, they will not live very long. I dare Mz. Koen to try and actualy develope relationships in her novels that will last a few years."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"With about 100 pages to go, I just realized that I didn't give a darn about any of the characters or what happens to them. I just put the book down. I felt like it was mostly a waist of time. The characters are so UNLIKABLE!!! There is not one character in the book that had any redeeming qualities, they were all selfish and dull."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I like historical fiction and this held my interest however it had too many long biblical references for my taste. Should be marked \\"Christian Historical Fiction\\"."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. Having grown up reading Roberta Gellis historical novels, I guess I am spoiled. But this book seemed so determined to be sad and not allow the heroine to have any sort of happiness in her life. I read this book over the course of a week and when I was done, I threw it on the couch and wanted those hours back. If you want to read a story that ends with the happy movie ending, this is not the book for you. Bah!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Koen did her research, and that's to her credit. But the plot was sluggish, the characters flat and I simply could not force myself to care. It was only by sheer force of will that I finished it at all.

I, however, was searching for something with more meat to it..."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I have read it many times &amp; never tire of it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"&quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; is one of the best romantic historical fiction novels around. The basic storyline is about a feisty young girl's rocky marriage to a much older man. Barbara Aderly, 15 and grandaughter of very illustrious British family, is utterly besotted by the wealthy, powerful and handsome Roger Montgeoffrey, Earl of Devane. All her dreams seem to come true when Roger weds her, but if it's too good to be true, then it probably isn't. Barbara travels with her new husband to France (this occurs in the early 1700s), and she is exposed to Roger's society--rakes, harlots and vicious gossip mongers--except these people are the Princes, Dukes, and Duchesses of France. Barbara feels that she can make Roger love her, as she him, and so is oblivoius to anything unsavoury about her husband--including evidence that Philippe, the Prince de Soisson, seems to be more than a friend to Roger....Barbara is a very human heroine and it's very easy for the reader to relate to her. She is stubborn, and kind, sometimes doing scandalous acts and throwing wild temper tantrums, but always, she has a heart and cares for her loved ones.Roger, the flawed man and husband with all of his deceptions and betrayles to Barbara, still remains a uniquely beloved hero.The novel, in length, is epic worthy but because of the many twists, surprises and relevations in the characters and in the plot, it reads smoothly and easily. And other characters beside Barbara and Roger stand out and capture our hearts. There is Bab's clumsy cousin Tony, the Duke, who suffers painfully from unrequited love for Barabara, Therese who is Babs' maid and her difficult life as a servant--easy prey to aristocratic men, the Duc de Richelieu who is obsesses with having Barbara at all costs, and many more memorable people.This is bittersweet novel about love. Love, as we see, has the power to destroy, as Roger is destroyed. It can also bring out the worst in us like in Richelieu. Or love can mature and make one a stronger person, like Barbara. Through a Glass Darkly is thus, a classic novel. Timeless."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had seen this book on a list of recommended reading under the category, British historical fiction. The history is a backdrop; that is, the setting is the early 18th Century. But don't expect to learn much about the times.The author spends the first 200 pages on a marriage contract that ultimately fails. Why she takes 200 pages to get to the point is beyond me.I did get a good sense of the characters. So if you like character development and stories about family relationships, you might like it. What I read of the book resembled WIDEACRE by Philippa Gregory. But if you are looking for historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Based on the enthusiastic reviews, I was hoping for some substantive and entertaining historical fiction. This was \\"lite\\" and a little sleazy--more like standard romantic fiction with better costumes and marginally better writing."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I loved the descriptions of life in England. I did find a few errors. On page 275 the word \\"hid\\" should be \\"had\\". On page 332 there should not be a period after the word \\"him\\".

I am heartbroken that Roger died before he could reconcile physically with Barbara. Not a day goes by that I don't think of him and also Barbara.

I think I was in love with him too!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Loved this book! Very well written with period acuracy. It was very hard to put down and I would love to read more books by this author in the future."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to books. I picked this one up at a bookstore, intrigued by the historical fiction aspect of it and that it was about a reign (King George I) that wasn't often written about. I also picked it because I love a good personal mystery, and all the characters were hiding something.This book was very disappointing, because it's barely historical fiction. I think the author used the setting more for the manners and clothes, rather than fully exploring the rich possibilities the era gave. The most disappointing aspect was Roger's \\"big secret,\\" which is alluded to throughout the first half and is exposed in the second half. The secret is a terrible letdown, as most readers will guess it within the first few mentions. Moreover, the historical aspect regarding Roger's secret is totally ignored, and makes me wonder if the author did her research at all, or if she did research and just wanted us to put 20th century mores into 18th century characters."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"SPOILERS HEREIN.I ... was not sure what to think of this book. It's got well-developed characters and good style, but the plot is ... nonexistent. And the next time I see a book that has 3 things on the blurb, I might steer clear of it if it means after 700 pages I'll be left going \\"What the hell was the point of THAT!?\\" I realize the setting is aristocracy and all, but my God, it was so very \\"white people problems\\". None of these characters had any real problems, so they decide to make their own. And on top of that, not a single one of them takes a proactive stance morally speaking, or in terms of the strengths of their convictions. Everyone just kind of resigns themselves to their fate. And while life happens and I get that, I'm looking for a tad more than that in a story. I mean, the main character Barbara was the only one that showed any amount of pro-activity by pursuing Roger. That was it. And then when she finds out the guy is seriously in the closet, she doesn't bother trying for a divorce because she \\"loves\\" him and decides her best course of action is just to sleep around on the guy. Which is so out of the pages of the most psychotic Cosmopolitan magazine pages I could cry. (Nothing is better than when ladies are telling ladies this is the best we're capable of, right? Then you know we REALLY believe it.)And, I'm sorry, Roger's gay lover saying \\"She will never know our dark secret, here, let me stick my tongue down your throat on a balcony\\" seemed just the slightest bit contrived. After twenty some odd years of keeping it all a secret, you'd think they'd be better about it. And after the big reveal, that's the end of the book. Except there's 300 pages of characters reflecting on their brutal disappointments left to go. No one triumphs, no one wins, and no one learns. Everyone just kind of bitches about how it's not fair, (or kills themselves over the unfairness of it all) despite the fact that no one made any effort anywhere in the book to try and make things happen. People make mistakes in the book and end up trapped by them, not because they're against impossible odds or an unfeeling society, but because they don't bother. And everyone else around them says \\"don't bother\\" either. It was a strangely nihilistic tale, truth be told. A sort of weird, sordid story that suggests riches just make crappy people who make bad decisions. And possibly that childbirth and child-rearing is awful. Which, again: I get, that kind of stuff did kill the average woman, but the one women who wants kids is barren, and EVERYONE else hates them as miserable leeches that ruin the body, sag the boobs, and suck the soul from you. Until they die of smallpox en masse, and then it's tragic, utterly, utterly tragic.I have no idea what the hell to make of this mess. If the value of a book lies in how much time you spend trying to figure it the hell out: this one manages that pretty well. But in terms of satisfaction or resolution ... completely lacking in that department. Things go nowhere and people do nothing. Makes you wonder how the author managed that with a pretty turbulent backdrop for a setting. I'll give it some stars for characterization and description, but holy crap, Koen, give us a story next time!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"What a great book!!

But in this novel it definintly has it all. The heroine and hero is actually portrayed as actual flawed human beings also capable of great love. This story will sweep you back to a time of great decadence and scandel, and how this stories characters live in it is very accurate. Even some of the characters trully existed! Barbara Aderley is a charming women living in a very dysfunctunal family. And even in the face of utter betrayel still finds the strength to love. The feelings between her and her cousin is among my favorite parts of the book. Karleen Koen very eloquently wrote this book and stirred my emotions more than any other novel has and, believe me, and i've read many. The second part of this novel was also very well written but i felt it lacked much of the emotions the first one had. I feel there will be a third installment before the story of Barbara and her search for true happiness is found. This is the greatest of books and a definite classic. Ms. Koen, thanks for giving us this book. AND PLEASE WRITE MORE!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"By far one of the best novels I have read in years.

My mother reads romances, and we are always having mock arguments. When she pressed this heavy, extremely long book by Koen into my hands, I balked. I don't read historicals, I barked. But this isn't your average historical, she said.This was in 1990. Nearly a decade later, I finally picked up THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY (heretofore referred to as TGD) and read it in a week, consciously slowing down as the pages grew thinner and thinner.TGD is a gorgeous book, a tapestry; it evokes the early 18th century in brilliant detail. I loved the grandmother. What a wise woman! My only regret is not listening to my own sweet mother. I wish I'd read this book ten years ago.Unlike some hardcover historical novels, TGD is easy to read but beautifully written. I have ordered Koen's second book, Now Face to Face. I do wish she'd write a little faster! I wish I could read TEN of her novels. She's that good.Also: this book would make an excellent movie. It remiinded me of Gone With the Wind, English style, but with a likeable heroine--and much better developed supporting characters.May the wind be with you, Karleen Koen. You have two fans in Mississippi!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"One cannot express a feeling so intense and poignant, as I have felt after reading this book. It is a beautiful, haunting tale that leaves you searching your own soul for answers and questions. I tought about it for days after reading it and remain to do so every now and then with the same vivid emotions. It left me emotionally drained, having run through the whole gamut during the reading, but also with a new knowledge of human character and of the human psyche. This is an absolute must read for one who appreciates beautiful language and a masterwork."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I first read this book about ten years ago, when I was not much older than the heroine. Since then I read it about once a year, and the subtle characterisation, wry observations on human nature, and lavish historical settings never fail to delight me."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I picked up the trade paperback copy of this book at a local store (sorry, Amazon). It was thick and oversized which is just what I like. However, it was in the Fiction section. I was expecting something with more history and less you-know-what. As I read this, it seems MUCH more like a romance novel than a book of historical fiction. If romance novels are your cup of tea, go for it.As I read it the first time I was slightly disgusted with all the sex and with some of the characters being rather two-dimensional (notably Diana, the mother of the heroine, and Tony, her cousin). The Duchess (grandmother of the heroine) is always irritable and snappy, even when she's being loving, and the heroine, Barbara, spends most of the novel in emotional turmoil about her marriage. But it does have a good effect of transporting the reader to the era, so I reread it, and once I was able to mentally class it as &quot;romance&quot; and not &quot;fiction&quot; it was enjoyable as a sex-filled period romp. Though I could do without all the sex scenes.So, it's all right, but I wouldn't rave about it!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time!

There is always something new in it, something that hits me as relevant to my life, every time I read it. It is much more thought provoking than a romance, but it is romantic. It is more story- and character-driven than most historical fiction, but the author brings you into the world of the past and makes you feel you've experienced it for yourself. Buy it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I just read it again for possibly the 8th time. I have lost count.

Worth every minute of lost sleep!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"When I first set out to read this, I was expecting an historical fiction; a little dry perhaps, but information, blah, blah, blah. I found in its stead, a riveting book I just could not put down. A bit slow in the beginning, but necessary as it sets up for what is to come. This novel provided the history I craved, and the unexpected love story I thoroughly enjoyed by providing the details of the mores and values of the elite society in which the stories take place. It also delves into the lower ranks of society, what they were expected to do, their station in life, and what they had to suffer. The same holds true for women and what they had to endure insofar as their station in life. I was surprised by so many things. I do not wish to give away any of the plots or any of what I learned. I crave a sequel to this book because I want to know what happens to several of the characters whom I became so familiar with each evening as I set down to read. Please, Ms. Koen, keep writing!

So I expected to like TAGD also.But NO! This book absolutely NOT as good as Dark Angels, which I would describe as a 1/2 sort of historical novel, 1/2 sort of romance. And well done.This book is definitely not a historical novel. There is just the tiniest bit of backdrop of history, that's it. The rest is gushing, over-the-top, histrionic romance. Oh the CRYING! Never have a read a book with someone constantly crying about something. And the PASSION! Somebody was constantly \\"passionate\\" about someone else. And the MELODRAMA! Talk about drama-queens. And the superficial BEAUTY! There was such an emphasis on beauty and handsomeness, -- someone, over and over and over, was SO beautiful or SO handsome.GAG! -- That said, it did keep my curiously piqued to find out what happened next (though I wound up skimming over numerous paragraphs of repetitive, gushing blather). I stayed with it right up to quite awful ending."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Karleen Koen does a great job of presenting a historical fiction novel in early 18th century London and Paris from 1715-1721. The story evolves around the central character, 15 year old Barbara Aderly. She is raised by her grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother is pretty useless and selfish, worried more about how she can get more money, boyfriends, etc. Her mother Diana has decided that Barbara should wed the much older friend of the family, Earl Devane.The story is full of duels, deception and romance. It is over 750 pages, but does not drag on. I thoroughly enjoyed the great descriptors of the homes and clothing of the era. There are many characters that you grow to love. Although some reviewers have lamented the ending, there is a great sequel Now Face to Face, which finishes up the details. However, I would recommend reading the prequel, Dark Angels, first so that you get to know the Duchess and keep the history in chronological order."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was a great story, I could not put the book down. I unknowingly read the prequel before I read this but it only made the story more enjoyable I think."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I got this book as a free kindle book, and I so glad I did. This is a wonderful love story. It did not end the way I thought it would, but it's still great. I cried several times and didn't want to put it down.If you like period pieces about England, you will love this one!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Not since Gone With The Wind, The Count Of Monte Cristo, and The Far Pavilions have I read through a thick epic so quickly. The sheer, rich luxury of Koen's writing left me deeply involved in the characters and their lives, breathless with their intrigues, charmed by their goodness and appalled at their cruelty.Lush, sweeping, magnificent, grand, sad, tragic, poetic, risqu&eacute;, all of these words apply to 'Through A Glass Darkly'. Set in England and France in the 1700's, we move languidly through wealth, financial downfalls, boom markets and crashing markets, clandestine and overt love affairs, depravity in the elegant mansions, endearing love, tragedy in illness and death, true friends and schemers, loyalty and betrayal. The major character of the epic is Barbara Alderly, granddaughter to the powerful dowager Duchess Of Tamworth. Barbara's mother, the Vicountess Diana Alderly, is still stunningly beautiful even after birthing eleven children to her now estranged husband Kit, seven of whom still lived in Tamworth while Diana freely roamed London.Diana, a very un-motherly woman, has found herself in debt and is attempting to arrange a marriage for fifteen-year-old Barbara to the handsome, forty-two year old Earl of Devane, Roger Montgeoffrey. Both Duchess and Diana are shocked to discover that Barbara is delighted, she has loved Roger Montgeoffrey for years, since he served under her grandfather in the war.Barbara follows Diana to London, where Diana begins to play Roger against her widowed sister-in-law Lady Abigail Saylor for a valuable piece of property in London called Bentwoodes, Barbara's dowry. Diana knows Bentwoodes is the only reason the Earl of Devane will marry Barbara, but needs money more than the match.Intrigues and backstabbings abound until the distraught Barbara makes some mistakes and writes to her grandmother to help her right her wrongs. In doing so, the elderly Alice, Duchess of Tamworth, brings her power and influence to London, seeing to it that her beloved granddaughter receives what she so wishes for, Roger Montgeoffry. Abigail's son, the next Duke of Tamworth, stumbling and bumbling Tony, also falls in love with his pert cousin Barbara.The book is divided into two parts, Barbara's innocence and Barbara's awakening to the hardships and cruelties that life brings with maturity. The many players in this cast of exquisitely painted characters, Barbara, Roger, Diana, the Duchess and her tirewoman Annie, Prince Philippe, Caesar White, Francis Montrose, Tommy Carlyle, future Duke Tony Saylor, Barbara's older brother Harry, Lady Abigail Saylor, Barbara's childhood friend Jane, Barbara's great aunts, maids and servants and pets, each play an intricate role in the saga of Barbara and the Tamworth estates and family.'Through A Glass Darkly' is such a rich epic that it will appeal to a broad audience, it's not just another historical romance or a boring account of flagrant Paris in the 1700's. With fully fleshed characters and a descriptive prose that leaves you smelling the flowers, tasting the food, and feeling the rich fabrics on your skin, Koen's novel is not one that you will soon forget. Definitely worth a 'buy'. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am only a hundred or so pages into this wretched book, and I really don't know if I have the heart to go on...if I do, then I'll write a part 2 to this review. If I can be bothered.I bought this book thinking that it would be a wonderful, serious, well-written historical novel. Ha! Boy, was I suckered! This isn't a serious book - it's a romance novel, of the Harlequin/Mills and Boon variety (though not even a very good one), trying to masquerade as real literature. But at least romance books usually have the decency to stop at a few hundred pages long, whereas this book goes on for almost seven hundred LENGTHY pages. Ugh! I don't know why the author made it so long-winded. She really shouldn't have. It's painfully full of filler and unnecessary stuff. I myself can sum up the first hundred pages a lot more briefly and effectively:Evil wanton mother: \\"Daughter, I am cruel like a stereotypical Disney cartoon villainess, and I say, you must marry Roger.\\"Spineless, insipidly dull but virtuous daughter: \\"Oh goody! I love Roger! I can't wait.\\"They go to London. Although witless daughter knows that her family have fallen on hard times, she is surprised to find she is forced to live in the kind of dingy little abode you live in when you've fallen on hard times. Still, she doesn't complain, because she's a doormat who never says anything, except about how much she loves Roger, of course. Repeatedly.Handsome and impossibly perfect hero, Roger, enters. He says \\"I'll marry her because she looks just like her grandfather.\\"Silly heroine swoons.Relatives complain about the dowry.And that's pretty much it.I wasn't kidding about the grandpa thing. The hero actually says to the heroine,\\"God save me, Barbara, but you are the very image of your grandfather!\\" And the heroine takes it as the NICEST compliment she's ever received, and proof that Roger is a kind man who likes her. Argh! If some guy told me I looked like my grandpa, I DEFINITELY wouldn't take it as a compliment - I'd assume he was insulting me by telling me I looked like an elderly MAN! That, or I'd worry that he fancied my grandpa.The dialogue in this book is inane. But at least its gaffs are mildly amusing at times, albeit unintentionally. Not so the shallowness, and sometimes extreme nastiness, of the writer in the way she describes her characters. In true romance book style, EVERY character's physical appearance is described in great detail, and their looks assessed and rated, as if how physically beautiful they are - or aren't - is a guide to their worthiness as a person. The hero is of course impossibly good looking, not to mention rich and fashionable and beloved by ALL, and his good looks are mentioned CONSTANTLY, over and over and over again, page after page. It's like being hit with a beautiful sledgehammer. I wanted to yell at the author, \\"Okay, I get it, he's handsome, there's no need to keep going on about it. Can you not find something else to say about him? Something INTERESTING perhaps? Some character trait other than just him looking good?\\" The hero was so perfect, so utterly flawless in his physical appearance, that I just couldn't believe he was a real human being, so the story around him seemed unrealistic too. The heroine, also, was naturally a physically attractive character (grandpa comments aside), though thankfully her looks were rarely mentioned, unlike the hero's. But apart from those two, the only other attractive character is the mother, and only because it was necessary for her to be, since she was cast in the stereotypical part of the wanton villainess who enjoys seducing men. (Why is it that in so many of these clicheed stories, the heroine is virtuous and good, but the villainess is the kind of woman who'll sleep with a number of men - what a cliche, as if women who sleep around are always bad! So old fashioned!)The pious, virtuous grandmother of the heroine is not mentioned as pretty, but at least she's not much maligned. The author is reasonably kind, for once, but again falls into the trap of seeming to imply that a woman must be virtuous (not to mention God-fearing) to be a good person.The other characters in this book, outside of the four I just mentioned, are described as fat, or old, or ugly, or a combination of the three, and the author absolutely RIDICULES them for their physical imperfections, going on and on and on about it. And naturally, these not-so-pretty characters are always stupid and mean and greedy, because we all know that if you're not beautiful on the outside, you're not beautiful on the inside, right? The overweight maid Clemmie, especially, is ridiculed at every opportunity, her weight constantly made fun of, her looks derided, and the author has written her as a stupid, clumsy character, one that the prettier characters laugh at (seemingly with the author's approval). Many, many parts of the book also deride the elderly characters, talking about their wrinkles, and how silly the characters look and behave and think, and how they shouldn't be dressing in 'younger fashions', and how much fatter and uglier they've become with age.Argh! I was repulsed! It was so mean and shallow and beauty-obsessed, as if only pretty people are worth something.The only halfway interesting minor character was a gay man who's a friend of Roger's. But even he seems like a charicature, a stereotype, flamboyant and gossipy and b*tchy and openly promiscuous, with no real depth or substance or life outside of his role in the hero's life. I thought he seemed more like what people in the eighties who didn't actually know any gay people might think a gay man from San Francisco would be like, based on what they'd seen on tv comedy skits, rather than what a gay man a few centuries ago would actually have been like. I am almost tempted to keep reading the book to see if his character is going to be further developed. But I sense that things aren't going to improve for this character, and may just get worse. He's probably only there to spread some gossip or something.But anyway, back onto the subject of shallowness, I got sick of reading every character's appearance being picked apart, like a corpse by a vulture. It was like reading one of those cruel celebrity gossip magazines that are full of articles about which star has put on, or lost, a few pounds, and in which all the celebrities are constantly scrutinised for every little flaw in their appearances. If you like those kinds of magazines, or if you're the type of person who likes to criticise the way that people around you look (presumably because you look so perfect yourself) then you'll probably like this book. It'll probably help if you're also the kind of person who loves romance books and those really trashy, barely-believeable soap operas that are screened during the day on tv. However, if you're a lover of intelligent, witty, well-written or truly entertaining literature, and if you're not totally hung up on personal appearances, and bad cliches make you cringe, perhaps you might do better to bypass this book and look for a better one. Also, I don't think guys are going to like this book. But hey, I may be wrong. Guys can be really unpredictable. And that's the way I like them. I like that guys are interesting and mysterious and individual, with more to them than just IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT LOOKS!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm no expert on literature or anything, but I know what I like and don't like. This book falls into both categories! Lots of reviews have gone far into the plot, so I won't. But there are some spoilers in the third paragraph and beyond.I liked most of Part 1. I thought the love story between Barbara and Roger was unique, and most of the characters, with all their scheming, were interesting. The story was just fast-paced enough to keep my attention.But then I came to Part 2 and it all fell apart. The end of Part 1 was a cliffhanger (although not a big surprise) and I wanted to know exactly how everything unfolded, just as Part 1. Instead, in my impression, the story goes vague. I hated that the author just skipped four years. I didn't feel as if I knew Barbara or her choices anymore. Roger never had a chance to explain himself. And a lot of time was taken building Tony up for just a sad little piffle at the end.The ending was a huge disappointment with loose ends to tie up; just because a book needs a sequel to finish the story doesn't mean I want to read the sequel. As others have said, the character of Jane added nothing to the story. Finally, the author chose a strange way to show Tony's mental dullness, by having him speak in partial sentences. It was distracting and annoying. She could have described him as mumbling or just saying off-the-wall things.Overall, I did read the whole book, and it kept my attention to the end, which is why I gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Even though i've been an avid reader of romance novels for some time, I've usually found something lacking. But in this novel it definintly has it all. The heroine and hero is actually portrayed as actual flawed human beings also capable of great love. This story will sweep you back to a time of great decadence and scandel, and how this stories characters live in it is very accurate. Even some of the characters trully existed! Barbara Aderley is a charming women living in a very dysfunctunal family. And even in the face of utter betrayel still finds the strength to love. The feelings between her and her cousin is among my favorite parts of the book. Karleen Koen very eloquently wrote this book and stirred my emotions more than any other novel has and, believe me, and i've read many. The second part of this novel was also very well written but i felt it lacked much of the emotions the first one had. I feel there will be a third installment before the story of Barbara and her search for true happiness is found. This is the greatest of books and a definite classic. Ms. Koen, thanks for giving us this book. AND PLEASE WRITE MORE!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"There is something about summertime that just begs for a long, lazy read. Books for the beach have become the catch-phrase for this sort of thing, novels full of intrigue and passion, of lovers doing all of the wrong things, and plenty to make you sit up and go Oh! How could he do that!? If your tastes run towards the historical novel, author Karleen Koen has come up with a humdinger of a story, full of frustrated longings, greed, and plenty of tangles to keep anyone engrossed for a week or two.Queen Anne of England has died, and a new dynasty has come to rule in England. King George I is from the small German kingdom of Hannover, and has a very tenuous claim to the English throne. Already there is a brewing rebellion, and for one noble English family, strife is already pulling the family apart.Alice, the Duchess of Tamworth, is elderly, and has already buried her beloved husband and all of her children, save one. That particular child, the vicious, sexual Diana, is creating scandal by trying to divorce her husband, a known Jacobite rebel, and is more than willing to do anything to see it happen. One of those things is selling her daughter, the beautiful, vivacious Barbara off to the highest bidder. The same goes for her son, Harry. Clearly Diana is one of those parents who doesn't care too much for the wellbeing of her children.For Barbara, there is only one man that she cares for -- the wealthy, charming Roger, Lord Devane. She has had a hopeless love for him since childhood, and now at the age of fifteen, she's certain that he is the man for her, despite the fact that he's more than old enough to be her father. And Roger, for his part, has always been on good terms with the Tamworth family -- he was a close friend of Alice's husband, Richard, serving alongside him in the long wars with Louis XIV of France. And Barbara, with her enchanting voice, red-gold hair and vibrancy, has more than a little of her grandfather with her.But for every rosy romance, there's bound to be a few spots of trouble. And for Roger and Barbara, the list is long. There's her mother, Diana, whose greed nearly ruins everything, Aunt Abigail who wants Barbara to marry not at all, her hulking son Tony, the current Duke of Tamworth. But Barbara perserves and when she finally manages to get Roger as her husband, it seems that the future is going to unfold itself into a glamourous future.Most of the novel takes place in Paris, where Barbara and Roger settle for a time. This is the time of the Regency, where the child-king Louis XV is little more than a mouthpiece for his uncle, Philippe d'Orleans. Paris is a decadent, free-wheeling society where gambling, sex, duels and adultery are common. For an innocent like Barbara, madly in love with her husband, it's going to be an eye-opening adventure. She attracts several would be lovers, including the wicked Duc de Richelieu, and finds out that wanting isn't quite the same as having -- especially when an old friend of her husband's turns up, more than eager to renew the relationship...I don't want to reveal much more of the plot here, as it's quite a potboiler, full of betrayals and friendships. Koen's writing style tends to be rather florid, but she manages to keep it from getting too over the top. I was hooked by the descriptive writing, and how she managed to let the reader into this world of aristocratic indulgence. There's flashes of humour and insight, along with some pretty deep personal anguish and unhappiness. Too, she's not afraid to have tragedy strike a beloved character either.Best of all, it was her knowledge of the lifestyles and attitudes of the period that made this book such a pleasure to read. A major twist of the plot invloves the infamous South Sea bubble, and the theories of John Law, an economist that proposed letting credit and inflation solve the debt of a nation. All of this has a major effect on the story, and builds to quite a climax -- and a very unusual ending.While this isn't a short novel -- it takes more than 750 pages to tell the story, it is certainly worth the time. The narrative flows smoothly, the anachronisms are kept to a minimum if at all, and I got to genuinely care about what happens to everyone. Even Diana, the spite filled bag of venom that she is.This was originally published in 1986, and turned into an instant bestseller. There was a sequel to this as well, Now Face to Face which continues the story; the sequel has been long out of print, but is scheduled to be reprinted in January 2008. And for those who are intrigued by the story of the old Duchess, Alice, her story is told in [...]If you want an involved story that blends history, romance, and human nature, this is one great read. I was happily entertained for several days over this one, and would happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"After reading numerous reviews and seeing this book come up in so many lists of great historical fiction I picked it up as a Christmas present to myself. At the time I was reading Here Be Dragons by Sharon Kay Penman, which is easily one of the best books I have ever read. I was very excited to dive into this book, but I must say that it fell flat in every way for me and was a huge disappointment.I believe the most important elements of a book is the bond which is developed between the reader and the characters. I want to feel happy, sad, cringe when bad decisions are made, and cry when tragedy lurks. This book created none of this for me. I can honestly say that I didn't care for any of the characters in this book and actually found them a little irritating. I don't even know why some of them, Jane in particular, were even in the story. Most of the secondary characters added nothing and only lengthened an already dull plot. The love story the book is based on was not rich enough to fill close to 700 pages and lacked passion. I didn't like Barbara or Roger, found Diana to be irritating and the Duchess predictable.Another disappointment is the ending of this book which dragged on far too long only to discover that there is no true ending.There are more books in this series which I will not be picking up. Although this book is dripping with rich detail I can not bring myself to recommend this as a great historical fiction read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Yes, Yes, Yes! THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY is so good. I can't believe it took me nearly ten years to get to this book. I can honestly say I haven't been this enthralled with a book since I read THE PROUD BREED (by Celeste DeBlasis) approximately three years ago. All 750+ pages have been absolutely compelling reading.It takes place in London and Paris in the early 1700s. 15 year-old Barbara Ackerly is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and has been raised in proper society standards. Her mother is attempting to arrange a marriage between her and an old family friend, Roger Montgeoffrey, Lord Devane. Roger is 42-years-old and Barbara has had a crush on him since she was about 10. Barbara's mother, Diana, a beautiful but nasty woman who likes to sleep around and is attempting to arrange the marriage in order to help pay off her enormous debts. Roger is interested in Barbara because by marrying her he will get the deed to some property he wants to develop. (Barbara's mother is deeply in debt due to her estranged husband's drinking and gambling). Barbara is excited at the prospect of marrying Roger. She just knows she can make him love her. However, Barbara's aunt has other ideas. She wants the property for her son, Tony, who is the latest Duke of Tamworth and does everything in her power so that the Barbara/Roger wedding does not become a reality. The story goes on from there. To tell much more would rob the reader of the pleasure of discovering all its drama for themselves. The characters are so real that I feel I know them. This is more of a historical novel than a romance. Sex scenes are not detailed.I have to give this a 5***** rating. It goes on my keeper shelf and on my list of favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Karleen Koen's \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" is as rich and broad in scope as the period she writes about - the initial years of England's King George the First's reign. Her plot is exciting, romantic, historically accurate, and includes many real life personalities, i.e. Chistopher Wren (one of England's greatest architects). Her fictional characters display an extraordinary depth. What is most enjoyable about the men and women she peoples her book with is that they are not cardboard figures but are allowed to grow with time & the experience they acquire. The novel reminds me a bit of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in terms of its sweep of history and unforgettable characters....or it might also be reminiscent of an \\"upscale Forever Amber.\\"England, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was filled with political unrest & economic upheaval. King George I of Hanover had inherited the English throne, (1714), succeeding his cousin Queen Anne. English law stated that their King/Queen must be Protestant - and King George, even if he could not speak English, was definitely Protestant. However, many English Catholics, known as Jacobites, wanted to overthrow George and crown James Stuart, (James III), called \\"The Pretender,\\" as king. He was the son of England's King James II & directly in line to the throne through his royal English bloodline. Thus plots & whispers of revolution abounded.Interestingly, the terrible economic times of this period resemble those we are experiencing today. In 1711 the South Sea Company was formed. It was given exclusive rights to trade with the Spanish colonies in South America, transporting many slaves from Africa to South America. In 1720 shares in the company became massively overpriced. Then the share price collapsed - the South Sea Bubble burst - and many investors, from the highest nobles to the poorest commoners with a few guineas to invest, lost huge sums of money - their entire life savings. The losses and subsequent impact on the country's economy were catastrophic.Fifteen year-old Barbara Aderley is central to the plot. This is her coming of age story and so much more. Bab, as she is called, is beautiful, intelligent, precocious, strong-willed and ready to be married off. The custom in these days is to marry young and for money and/or title. Her grandfather, Richard, Duke of Tamworth, a famous general, is deceased and much beloved by his countrymen. Richard's widow, Alice, the Duchess of Tamworth, may be elderly but is every bit as sharp and lively as her granddaughter. She is a powerful dowager who rules her roost, but has an extremely soft spot in her heart for Barbara. And Diana, Barbara's vicious but gorgeous mother, bears child after child to her unscrupulous Jacobite husband and leaves them with the Duchess to raise. What can I say? Diana is a hoyden and a slut...to put it mildly. And she is willing to sell her daughter off to the highest bidder.Roger MontGeoffry, Lord Devane, served as an officer under Barbara's grandfather in the long wars with Louis XIV of France, and she has known him and adored him from early childhood. And why not? He is handsome, brilliant, kind & charming. Although there is more than a twenty-five year difference in their ages, when Lord Devane is proposed as a potential match for Barbara, she is thrilled. And he is extremely fond of her and needs her fortune to build a visionary architectural estate and museum in the center of London.Sweeping, passionate and scandalous, the story moves from London to Paris to Italy, taking with it the members of a great English family with all the intrigue and baggage they bring with them....and a haunting, hurtful secret and betrayal to boot.I usually do not read a book twice unless it is a beloved classic. However, I read \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" when it was first published & it became a favorite. I read it again about ten years ago and found that the novel only improved with age. Now that a sequel has come out, (\\"Now Face to Face\\" - also excellent), I read it for a third time so that there would be a flow of events & people when reading both books back-to-back. I cannot recommend \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" highly enough.PS - To see \\"through a glass\\" -- a mirror -- \\"darkly\\" is to have an obscure or imperfect vision of reality - perhaps by letting our emotions distort the true nature of people or events. The expression comes from the writings of the Apostle Paul, the King James version of the Bible, Corinthians 13.Jana Perskie"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I guess it is the wonderful writing that made &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; such a compelling page-turner. I loved all the descriptions of the British aristocracy (or should I say the 'idle rich'?) during the early 1700's. And I was intrigued and repulsed by the images of the French royalty (and their patrician friends and acquaintances) and the lurid and decadent details of their nightlife. Learning about the workings of Tamworth, the lovely estate that is central to the story was absolutely fascinating.When I read a book, I like to transport myself into the principal character (or the female who is closest to the lead). Even with the 'Harry Potter' series, I can visualize myself (quite easily) as a student at Hogwarts. I could not see myself as Barbara Aderley. I can't imagine falling madly in love with a man who was almost 30 years older than me WHEN I WAS TEN! Throughout the entire novel, we are constantly reminded what a good, kind, honorable, and decent man was Roger Montgeoffry. I'm sorry; I just couldn't see those qualities. To me, he was a selfish, thoughtless individual who lived a very immoral and depraved life. And I am not referring to his 'little secret'! He was a horrible husband who had no qualms about leaving his fifteen year old wife (for more self indulgences) immediately following a horrible tragedy. Throughout all of this Barbara remained in love with Roger--I can't understand it. Wouldn't these events have been an impetus to sever the relationship (for most normal people)? I also felt cheated because supposedly Roger had promised an explanation for his actions--and we never received it. I love fairytales--any book or movie where there is joy and most definitely 'happy ever after.' There is very little joy in this saga; very few people are kind and there is a lot of death (read with kleenex). I really wanted something good to happen to Barbara, Therese and to poor Tony (who started off being fat, stupid and insecure and then morphed into movie star good looks, confidence and intelligence) but nothing ever did.I recommend THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY to anyone who enjoys a well-written historical novel. If you enjoy a warm fuzzy book, then read Rosemund Pilcher (my preference!)."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The title comes from a Bible verse:When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.I Corinthians 13:11-13And from this verse flows the essence of the story of Barbara: a young woman with an open heart full of dreams and desires, longing to please, to love and be loved with a child's innocence, who comes to know a woman's life and to be known as a woman, amidst the heartache and bitterness of failed expectations, personal tragedies and the duplicity and debauchery of the English and French courts.England, 1715. Barbara is the sheltered granddaughter of the late Duke of Tamworth, one of England's most famous military heroes. With a traitorous father on the run and a scandalous, uninterested mother, Barbara and her siblings have been raised by their grandmother, the Duchess, an iron-willed woman who strikes fear in the hearts of those who oppose her, and will go to any lengths to aid those whom she loves.Barbara is content to spend her days happy and carefree on her grandmother's secluded country estate until her money-scheming mother arrives and plants the idea in her head that she could marry her childhood idol, the dashing, worldly, and much older Roger Montgeoffrey. Barbara latches onto that idea and moves to London, spinning grand dreams of her future and enlisting her grandmother's help to see those dreams to fruition. Though Barbara is young and unknowing in many ways, she is aware from the beginning that Roger marries her out of respect for her grandfather and for the dowry she brings him, but she is determined to make a place for herself in his life and in his heart.Roger, a rising investment star in the infamous South Sea Company, has plans for his life, and though Barbara is an unexpected and intriguing addition to that life, he's not planning on making any significant changes. As soon as they're married, he and Barbara are off to France, where Barbara makes her debut in society amidst a decadent and licentious French court. In this world of sex and scandal, Barbara is left to her own counsel and must choose how to conduct herself, all the while striving to hold her husband's attention, praying for him to return even a fraction of the love she feels for him. And just when it seems she's about to get everything she wants, tragedy strikes Barbara's family and Roger's hidden past sweeps into Paris. And as he succumbs to the temptations of his dark secrets, Barbara's life crumbles around her. Attempting to pick up the pieces, Barbara embarks on a journey of discovering who she is and who she wants to be.This book is one of those slow burners that takes its time to draw the reader into a sensuous world of compelling characters. It is a beautifully written coming of age story, love story and family saga rolled into one; a heart-wrenching portrayal of emotions, of the damage people can inflict upon each other; of human nature in every shade, where nothing is black and white. The outstanding cast of supporting characters adds dimension and layers to the story and the lushly depicted era of opulence, political unrest and financial instability of England and France weaves a rich historical texture throughout.I loved every minute of this book and I cried my way through the last hundred pages. Then, after I got hold of myself, I went right out to the library and picked up the sequel. This is one of those books that kept me up late and then woke me in the middle of the night - I could not stop thinking about it. Definite Keeper Shelf. Highly recommended to fans of emotionally charged, character-driven historical fiction."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"There were things that I really liked about this book and some that I wasn't too crazy about. I'll start with what I liked.The first part of this book was very good. It was interesting to see Barbara slowly work her way into Roger's heart and life, little by little. I also liked the suspense that was added by the author's little hints about this \\"great secret\\" about Roger. The part of the book set in France was also really good. I really liked learning about French society during that period, especially the \\"behind the scenes\\" look. My favorite part, though, were some of the secondary characters. Roger's two employees, White and his manservant (name?), were hilarious. I also really liked Therese and Richelieu. The author also didn't spare details about the less pretty side of life in this time such as rotten teeth and smallpox epidemics that nearly took out whole families at a time.One of my main complaints about this book is how just as you hit the climax and Barbara finally finds out Roger's \\"big secret,\\" the author skips to four or so years later. That's what I was waiting to read about and I felt cheated. The reader learns these things in flashbacks from Barbara. We even missed out on her affair with Richelieu. Also, her behavior after she finds out about Roger is a little cliche and frankly I just found Barbara plain annoying throughout most of the book. Another problem I had, which is a small one, is Barbara's age. I know that it was common for older men to marry younger women, but I couldn't get past the fact that he was older than her parents - by a lot! Also, I didn't care for such a young heroine, she was just a child. This might not bother other people, but I just get tired of reading about such young heroines.All in all, this was a good book, and I kept turning the pages to find out what would happen. There is a sequel which I also plan to read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"...Whoever shelved this book with romance novels was dead wrong. It is far, far more substantive than the usual watery romance fare. To begin with, Roger, the main male character, the heart of Barbara Alderley's desire, possesses all the qualities of a romance-novel hero, with one little flaw. Which, of course, I will not reveal, lest Amazon axes yet another one of my reviews. Suffice it to say, it is not his fear of heights or bad memories about a cold-hearted mother (standard romance novel \\"dark secrets\\") that will pain Barbara, his wife.In addition, the book is far, far darker than most romance novels are. There is death--quite a lot. People die, children die, smallpox comes and wipes out whole families. (Koen's descriptions of smallpox and its consequences are stomach-turning and heart-breaking at the same time.) By the end of the book, Barbara will suffer so much that the fortitude she shows is absolutely remarkable (somebody said she was winy; most modern heroines would have long been on Prosac, if they had to go through what she goes through in the book).Another reason why it is not a romance novel is that the characters are complex. As i said, Barbara was wonderful--and a difference between the Barbara of 15 at the beginning of the book, and Barbara of 21 at the end of the book is startling--and vivid. Both her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth (the entire family is painted, rather masterfully, from the Marlboroughs), and her mother, Diana, are wonderful. You love the former, you want to murder the latter. Roger is, of course, a true fallen angel--and he manages to enchant you absolutely, much like he enchanted his young wife. And of course, the most controversial (I think) character in the book--the absolutely evil, but captivating and tragic, Roger's friend, Philippe, Prince de Soissons.Finally, it is quite unlike a romance novel in that it provides the reader with an amazing amount of historical detail. Koen did an astounding amount of research, including on-site research in England and France. She manages to describe the contemporary English (and French) society with such masterful strokes, you really feel THERE. Their weddings, funerals, theater, everyday life, clothing, sex, death, food, the court, history--everything.All of that said, it is not a historical novel, either--the single historical event described in much detail is the terrible South Sea Bubble crisis of 1721, in which the lives of characters become entangled. Indeed, I think, this book quite stands out amidst women's novels--it is meticulously researched, fascinating, beautiful, poignant, sad, and very life-affirming. Perhaps the best book I've read in the past year."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is my favorite novel of all time. Simply put this novel is a masterpiece of writing.The setting, 18th-century London and France. The main character, Barbara Alderley, a young girl from a wealthy family is married off to a much older man by the name of Roger Montgeoffry.This is a magnificent tale in which the reader becomes swept up in the turmoil that ensues as the novel progresses. The characters in which there are many come to life due to the wonderful way in which the author Karleen Koen writes them. The novel is overaught with emotion,the description of places and settings in the novel are rich and glorius. You will come to know the characters on an intimate level. Loving some and loathing others. I loved the way in which the author wrote the book to show it's many layers so that you understand the smaller characters in the novel as well as the main ones.This is a gripping and tragic tale but also densely atmospheric. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"In the tradition of Kathleen Windsor's Forever Amber, Karleen Koen gives us the story of Barbara Montgeoffrey, a young woman who matures as she ages. The story begins when she is fifteen and marries Roger, a man much, much older than herself but whom she is determined to marry nonetheless. Barbara, like her counterpart in Forever Amber, is headstrong and willful, but I think Barbara is more likeable as a character.The cast of characters is fantastic: Barbara's grandmother, the aging Duchess of Tamworth; Barbara's mother, the spoiled and selfish woman who tries to get a divorce from her husband; Barbara's cousin Tony, a shy boy who grows into a very capable young adult and who remains in love with her even after all that she goes through; Barbara's husband Roger, a man who is not as bad as we think he is; Philippe, Roger's on and off again \\"friend;\\" Therese, Barbara's French lady's maid, who becomes an invauable companion; and Hyacinthe, a boy originally bought to serve as Barbara's slave, but who becomes like a son to her. There are also Harry and Charlotte, two pugs who are almost people themselves.The book is divided into two parts, beginning with Diana's decision to marry her daughter to Roger Montgeoffrey, a bachelor who is notorious but also incredibly wealthy and well-connected at both the English and French courts. Barbara, completely in love with him gets her wish and they marry, but not without the forebodings of the Duchess, the old woman who has cared for Barbara since she was a small child. They go to France, where Barbara is pursued by many men and Roger finds himself becoming jealous over them.The first part ends with a bang. It is then that Barbara learns about the true nature of the relationship between her husband and the Frenchman Philippe. It is at this point that Barbara loses her innocence and steps into adulthood. She and her husband separate for a period of four years, not to be reconciled until almost the last moment.The second part opens four years later. It opens with another bang: the popping of the South Sea Bubble, a crisis that had deleterious effects on not only England, but its colonies as well. By this point Barbara has become notorious fer her bavior: sleeping with several different young men, causing them to duel, and getting sent away from the Hanoverian court. There's a reconciliation with Roger, but it comes much later than the reader would have liked.This was a wonderful book; filled with insightful research and storytelling, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction and romances--but not the cheesy kind."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Having tired of the constant hit-or-miss factor of self-published works, I bought this book on a whim. I knew nothing about it - I just recognized the title as a famous one and thought I'd try it out.I had no idea what I was in for.I dreamed about this book, and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. It was beautifully written and had some of the best prose I've ever read. (I highlighted many passages in my Kindle to read again later on.)With the possible exception of Abigail, whose \\"I always know the right thing that everyone should do\\" attitude was a bit too self aware for my tastes, the characters truly came to life on the page. I became emotionally vested in all of them, which made what the author did to them (and, by extension, to me) all the more unfair.I'll agree with a previous reviewer in that I really, really, really wish the last third of the book didn't exist. (See spoilers below.) If it didn't, this would likely be my favorite book of all time.If I had to rate \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" based on *how* it made feel, I would only give it one star. But I gave it five stars because it did make me feel something and is extremely well written - two of my biggest criteria for a good read.The writer has a strong command of the English language and knows how to effectively weave emotion into a story. The words were like silk on the page, but they cut with the sharpness of a knife. It is unfortunate that they cut so deeply.[SPOILERS]I didn't like who the main character became in the last third of the book, and I say this as a judgment based on her moral standards, not mine. I just don't believe she would really make some of the decisions she did; her actions felt very out of character to me, no matter how upset she was.There was so much tragedy in this book that I wanted so badly, so desperately for a happy ending, but I could barely finish the last 20 pages because I was crying so hard - literally grieving. I found myself angry at the author for playing God in such a cruel way, for making these characters' lives so bitterly unfair.There is an ongoing theme in this story, which could be summarized as \\"Whatever your heart desires most, you will never have it, and anyone you care about will die.\\"Everyone's life was miserable in this book. Although some of it was their own doing, the result of some very human mistakes, most of it was beyond their control. And just when you think 'It can't possibly get any worse', it does. And then it gets worse again. And it never ends, never gets better. It's okay to have a down ending in a story, but not if the rest of it is as depressing as this one is.I've never been left with such a feeling of despair as I felt with this gut-wrenching book, which literally made me sick with its apparent message of 'Life is inherently unfair, and nothing you can do will ever make it right'.It took me several days to recover from this story. It truly is not for the faint of heart! :("},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really hated to see this book end.

So many lost years because both had been so terribly hurt.I absolutely love historical novels and its been quite some time since one has entranced me so."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love, love, love, love, love historical fiction.Through a Glass Darkly: A Noveland its sequelNow Face to Face: A Noveltake you on a grand tour through English and French high society in the 1700s. Koen's evocative writing style and incredible descriptions of time and place will transport you into a world of intrigue, paranoia, and love (and fortunes) lost and gained. The love story underpinning the first two books alternates between touching and heart-breaking and is as fine a cautionary tale about the double-edged nature of getting what one wants as any I have had the pleasure of reading.Dark Angels: A Noveltakes you deeper into the backstory of one of the most endearing and curmudgeonly characters in the two original novels. And fortunately for you, dear readers, the books are all readily available now (when I was first introduced to the series, through the prequel, I had to painstakingly track down used copies of the sequel - and pay an arm and a leg for it.

There's nothing to indicate to a new reader that it's the seventh book of a series, nor (more importantly) the third book of a trilogy within the series, so an unwary reader quickly find him- or herself confronted with characters making reference to past events that are never explained or expanded upon. As a thriller, it seems competent enough, but I found myself too mired in continuity to ever really get into it."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Special Agent Pendergast is so over the top, nearly a superhero; I just couldn't appreciate him as a protagonist. And the whole evil brother aspect is just too cliche. Speaking of cliche, the Tolkienesque ending, really? Why not just call it Mt. Doom? I admit these guys can write suspensefully, but the story leaves a lot to be desired. The whole house of horror aspect just left me not able to really accept the premise of this novel. I'm purposefully being vague about plot points to not spoil this book for those determined to read it.I also did not appreciate what I took to be Child's contributions to this book. paragraphs of inane details about computer systems. Literally pages of chase sequences turning left on street so and so, turning right on via something or other, down alley whatchamacallit. We get it; you have a city map of Florence. And the Italian names; why use the Italian half the time and the anglicized half the time? Why not be consistent? Was this book even edited for that sort of thing? Ex. They go to Florence (not Firenze) or Milan (not Milano) but are in piazza (not a square) or in talking to suor (and not a sister). The lack of consistency was distracting. And speaking of a lack of consistency, I understand that SA Pendergast is well educated but these two sentences next to each other he would not say: (and I paraphrase) His existence for living is I. My existence for living is him. \\"I\\" in the first sentence but \\"him\\" in the second (vice he)? little details like that throughout the book just kept reminding me that this book was pumped out in a hurry with minimal effort and minimal editing. But it was still kinda cool in an exciting archeological adventure sort of way, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of less."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is a wonderful series.

I've read terrible novels that were better than this. It was so unbelieveable throughout that I had to keep forcing myself to pick it back up and finish, and when I did, I wanted those hours back.WARNING SPOILER: A little ways in, I quickly deduced that the one person who could pull off the \\"gimick\\" was museum director Menzies, but then that didn't make sense, because he would have have to have multiple degrees from prestigeous universities in very specific backgrounds, plus spent his entire life getting to the point where he could become a museum director. So I knew it couldn't be him. Wrong. It was. Preston and Childs explained it away in less than a page - totally unbelieveable. And why would a group of people risk their own livlihood breaking someone out of a maximum security prison - it would have been easier, less risky, and less expensive to simply hire a good attorney. You have to totally suspend knowledge of how life really works to believe anything the authors were selling. I enjoy the subject of Egyptology, and normally like these authors, but cripes, this book must have been a deadline- created money generator for the publisher.

As I've said before, Pendergast, in my opinion, is one of the greatest literary heroes ever created, and I certainly was not disappointed in The Book of the Dead. In fact, Pendergast, having been through so much in the previous book, Dance of Death, becomes an even more complex character and actually shows his more vulnerable side. Secrets are finally revealed about his relationship with Diogenes, and we finally find out about the \\"Event\\", a memory that Pendergast has long suppressed, and something that absolutely chilled me to the bone. It remains the best book I have read all year. For fans of Preston and Child, this is a can't miss book, but for new readers, it's still a thrilling tale worth reading."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Child are so much more than the sum of their individual parts when they collaborate. This is so evident yet again in Book of the Dead. This novel finishes with a bang what is an informal trilogy revolving around Aloysius Pendergast and his brother Diogenes. This trilogy is populated with many of their previous characters and protagonists serving in supporting roles to the brothers, and is a very satisfying novel and a truly enjoyable read. How do I know this was a trilogy? One of the best things about this book is a brief two page note from the authors at the very end where they explain in which order to read their works and why.I have to give one warning though about what is otherwise a terrific book. I'm not a professional reviewer, as are the writers of the two reviews which have already appeared here, but I have to say I disagree with them that this can be truly appreciated as a stand alone novel. If you have not read any of the previous works then do yourself a tremendous favor and take the recommendation of both the authors and myself: go back and start with Relic and work your way forward from there. There is so much pleasurable reading you have missed and there is simply too much going on in this book which, without the knowledge of the previous stories, you will not fully appreciate. So, with that one warning, on to my verdict.I loved this book. It was everything I could hope for in a denouement and so much more. I, like so many others, have been waiting impatiently for a year for the answers and resolutions to the many apparently insoluble issues and problems created by the authors in their foregoing works. Finally, to my great relief, the book was released yesterday and with all apologies to Amazon, this was not a book I was willing to wait a day or longer for someone to deliver to me so I let myself off work early and went and bought a copy locally. I mentally steeled myself to be slightly disappointed because I simply could not see how the authors could convincingly solve the myriad of problems they had created previously. Yet, with a kernel of hope in my core, I started reading around 3 in the afternoon. I finished after midnight. Yes, as is typical of Preston and Child, this is one of those books that you will want to finish in one go and will find very hard to put down. I am happy to report that the authors, with grace, style, and panache, provided answers that are believable, convincing and reasonable and which resolve all the complex issues previously created. There was so much to like about this book! The Cain and Abel brothers (or Holmes and Moriarty if you prefer) have been locked in their dance of death for their entire lives. But what caused this to be? What is the unimaginably horrible crime that Diogenes is working feverishly to perpetrate? How can Aloysius escape from a maximum security federal penitentiary that has never suffered an escapee? And when will there finally be a point to Constance Green? All these loose ends are tied up for us finally in a deeply satisfying way.This novel delivers excitement, thrills, scares, mysteries, tension as fine as any you can read, and delivers them in sinfully addictive prose that drags you from one page to the next without remorse or relent. The best thing about the book is its relentless intelligence and the competence of the two siblilngs as they work to thwart and foil each other. The prison break was so intelligently crafted, the diabolical crime really was diabolical and also so personal it just dripped with hate, revenge, and misguided retribution. One final bit of praise. The authors finish the book with one of the most satisfying closing sentences I've ever read. It nailed the last niggling reservation I had and I unreservedly admire how they set me up for it, stringing out my reservation to the very last sentence of the very last page and then just crushing it. Do not skip forward to the last sentence. Restrain yourself, don't do it. You can't appreciate it fully unless you have been through the other novels and force yourself slowly through this one, but my hat is off to Preston and Child for crafting this enormously enjoyable conclusion that ties up all the loose ends and sets the stage for what may come yet in the future,"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The board members of the New York Museum of Natural History just don't seem to learn. After experiencing the terrors of THE RELIC and THE RELIQUARY, one would think they would be concerned about reopening the Tomb of Senef, particularly since two men have experienced unexplained neurological damage while working on the project. However, the board is determined to pursue the project to deflect attention from their attempts to cover up the return of their entire stolen diamond collection- returned as diamond grit, that is.Diogenes Pendergast has put into motion the perfectly orchestrated crime. This crime is an attempt to recreate the work of his ancestor, Comstock Pendergast, and will affect all who enter the Tomb. Nora Kelly, William Smithback, Viola Maskelene, Margo Green, and Constance Greene are all returning characters from previous Preston and Child books and they too are part of Diogenes' diabolic plan.Meanwhile, former Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is incarcerated at Herkmoor Penitentiary, as part of Diogenes' twisted plan (see DANCE OF DEATH for details). Herkmoor Penitentiary is considered impossible to escape but that is before Eli Glinn employs his agency's technical expertise. Pendergast, Vincent D'Agosta, and Captain Laura Hayward will have to work together yet again to stop Diogenes from wreaking destruction on their friends and the entire city of New York.Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child demonstrate once again why they are the masters of this genre. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is a cleverly crafted thriller with enough twists and turns to keep the reader turning the pages well into the night. While the returning characters provide a sense of familiarity, Preston and Child do not sacrifice the plot by any means. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD draws the reader in from the first sentence and doesn't let go until the very end. This is not a novel you will want to put down as Lincoln and Child continually keep you guessing as to how the characters will thwart Diogenes.THE BOOK OF THE DEAD can be read as a stand alone novel as the authors provide the necessary background to understand the basic plot. However, readers will miss the intricate details that make this series so successful if they do not read the earlier novels. At a minimum, this reviewer recommends reading DANCE OF DEATH prior to THE BOOK OF THE DEAD if only to provide the full complexity of Diogenes' deviousness. Part of what makes the Preston and Child novels so addictive is the authors' innate ability to weave together numerous plotlines from various books into a cohesive format. Readers familiar to the series will recognize details and characters from previous books and will be impressed at the sheer brilliance of Preston and Child at combining all of these elements into one book.

I am Italian, and the small details, for example the streets of Florence, or the cuss exclamation of a Carabiniere, or even the cell number of a bus driver (which uses a correct prefix for an Italian cell phone, no fake \\"555\\" number) all prove that they really went into research for the book.Also, the frequent sentences in Italian are correct and do make sense this time (unlike some of their previous books where the sentences were dictionary-translated and light-years from what a \\"real\\" Italian would say).The only quirk I found was with the audio book itself - while the guy who reads the book has a fantastic voice and a clear, perfect tone, it's also very clear he is not at ease with the Italian language.Some accents he uses while reading Italian words range from mildly amusing to utterly ludicrous, but then I guess it's something only a native Italian speaker would notice.All in all, a fantastic book, definitely well worth it!If you appreciate Preston and Child's novels, don't miss this one, with a single caveat: for maximum enjoyment you will need previous knowledge of facts and characters, so reading the other books (at the very least Brimstone and Dance of Death, ideally quite a few others) is *strongly* advised."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Book of the Dead is the third book in what Preston & Child call their \\"Pendergast Trilogy,\\" which began two years ago with Brimstone.Secrets are revealed, including \\"the Event\\" which transformed Pendergast's brother Diogenes into a sociopathic killer.Characters from previous novels, inlcuding The Ice Limit, Relic, Thunderhead, and Cabinet of Curiosities make notable appearances. Pendergast's mysterious ward, Constance (who has done very little in the earlier books,) takes a lead role with spectacular results.There's action, violence, a scheme to murder millions, some twists, and the best prison scene since Silence of the Lambs.If you've been waiting for this book, you won't be disappointed. If you're new to the series, you might miss out on a lot of the references to previous stories, and you'll enjoy this more if you read those earlier books first.I read it in one sitting, staying up all night, and I'm tired but happy.Congrats on another winner, Mr. Preston and Mr. Child."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I've read a fair number of books by Preston and/or Childs.

But even if I had some inkling into the chronology and backstory of all the characters, I doubt that I would have found anything about the characters, the setting, or the plot in the least bit credible. Things just keep happening that don't make sense--it's not that they are mysterious or spooky or build suspense and are explained later--they just don't make sense. Coincidences abound. Police and bystanders alike act in ways that defy logic. Characters do things that are bizarre and unrealistic.

The dastardly crime must be prevented at all costs despite Pendergast not knowing even the tiniest detail of Diogenes' actual intentions! The story gallops at breakneck speed from crisis to crisis as the life or death clash between Pendergast and his psychopathic megalomaniacal brother escalates to a thrilling climax but we are privileged to watch it being played out with masterful attention to character building, dialogue, detail, pacing and clever ratcheting or release of tension!As we have come to expect from their previous work, Preston and Child have once again packed their tale with a dazzling myriad of mini-plots that have afforded them a number of stages from which they could also deliver a series of wildly entertaining and informative lectures - the politics and history of Egyptian archeology; the religious beliefs and burial practices of the ancient Egyptians; the nature of security in a modern maximum security prison built for incorrigible offenders; the logistical details of mounting a world class exhibit in a modern museum; the potential for neurological damage caused by intense light and high volume sound bombardment; the trivia of diamond classification, colour, cut and value; and, arcane details of forensic evidence examination such as the study of knots or cloth; to name only a few examples.Readers who have observed Pendergast's growing resemblance to Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in the novels which preceded \\"The Book of the Dead\\" will shiver with a frisson of delight at the tumultuous Reichenbach Falls style climax which takes place on the very flanks of Mount Stromboli in Sicily. When Pendergast announced his intentions to retire to a period of solitude and contemplation at a Tibetan monastery, I quietly sent up a short prayer to the writing gods with the fervent hope that Lincoln and Child bring Pendergast back for a 21st century version of \\"The Final Problem\\"! Quiet retirement or beekeeping would not suit Pendergast any better than it did Holmes.And, by the way, be very, very sure that you read this novel right to the very last sentence ... and what a last sentence it is!Oh yeah ... did I say that I enjoyed the novel?Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Once upon a time there was a strange monster running around the basement of the New York Museum of Natural History and an eccentric FBI agent... And so went the tale of the first book in which special agent Prendergast made his appearance. There are now seven books in this series and, despite the authors' protests, it wouldn't surprise me to see number eight coming along at some time. They have always been better than merely readable and have occasionally shown flashes of brilliant. Unfortunately they don't make the transition to film very well.Preston and Child pull out all the stops in this latest volume, the third to pit Prendergast against his evil brother Diogenes. The setting has returned to the New York Museum of Natural History once again, where a desperate leadership is attempting to counteract the bad press coming from Diogenes spectacular jewel theft. This, as you may remember, left Prendergast imprisoned for evils he did not commit and one of the world's most valuable collections stripped of it's treasures. When the jewels are returned as powder the museum hatches the idea of reopening an ancient Egyptian tomb buried in its cellars, complete with a multimedia light show, as a way of distracting the public.In the mean time a group of Prendergast's friends plot to break him free from the Herkmoor Federal Correctional and Holding Facility. This clumsily named prison is a foreboding institute that is more than the equal if its Victorian equivalents - dark, menacing, and full of FBI agents who are bent on breaking Prendergast's will. No one has ever escaped, but no prison has ever encountered this new version of the Mission Impossible team before. Of course, locked away in prison, Prendergast himself doesn't play much of a part in the early going - something of a mixed blessing.Regulars to this series will recognize that Prendergast, with his overstated Southern gentleman style, austere looks, and brilliant mind, is a spitting image for Sherlock Holmes. Diogenes outdoes Moriarty as archfiend, and Mycroft as the brilliant older brother. The resemblances are uncanny, and no doubt intentional. Prendergast's personality has that same coldness to it as Holmes, and the same irritating habit of always being right. One can quite understand why Diogenes is dedicated to eradicating him.This time the situation is even more desperate as Diogenes devious plot unfolds quickly, and we discover a multitude of falsehoods and betrayals. Prendergast's brother is intent on getting even with everyone who has stood in his way, not just his brother. New York is again to be the site of a disaster. In the mean time you will find yourself delighted by Preston and Child's amazing facility with the details of a prison break, an unending supply of Egyptianalia, and the methods of a no-holds-barred museum exhibition. Book of the Dead is really the best of a long series. You probably should start with an earlier volume, probably Brimstone, but going all the way back to Relic wouldn't be a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"(NO MAJOR SPOILERS)One way or the other, I have to agree with some previous reviewers: this novel doesn't quite live up to the other fantastic Pendergast sagas, which have the best combination of action, suspense and mystery I've read to date, along with great characterization. I'd say this one focused more on characters than being \\"gripping\\" based on plot alone as might be expected.It's a well-written and carefully constructed book, a must-read for all Pendergast fans, but doesn't have the blazing rushes of adrenaline the previous ones had, all things considered. This may bore new-comers more than Dance of Death and should definitely not be read alone. Book of the Dead simmers more than boils, with certain parts to be slowly savored, mostly thanks to previous knowledge of the characters. I'm glad this novel is supported and fed by a larger plotline from the previous Pendergast books, because as a standalone, you'll miss the powerful characterizational kicks and might be disappointed to find few nail-biting twists, which are in fact slightly redundant when compared to what happens in, say, Reliquary or Brimstone.This 'conclusion' to the Pendergast trilogy wraps up details well, though a trifle bit transparently. The New York Museum problems are similar to previous ones mentioned in at least two other novels, and it's almost getting old. Or at least predictable. Same setting is fine, but it's almost exactly the same situation too, albeit with a different source of trouble. Also, a major flight at the end seems a bit forced, and a certain brave character's sudden competence and fury, though gratifying, came out of thin air and seemed almost too convenient.The diabolicalness of Diogenes is explained in this novel and while he's rather not as rounded out as I would've liked, he nevertheless is given a reason why he is how he is. I thought it was a relatively far-fetched explanation and didn't mesh with the plot quite as well as other explanations for past events in past Pendergast novels. I also thought his series of actions leading up to a 'master plan' as told in in Dance of Death made more sense than his ultimate goal here, which progresses to somewhat of a vague cliche.What Book of the Dead does best is continue to focus on the human side of Pendergast's world, which makes up for the lack of an independent plotline. The best part of this book for me was Pendergast and his facility experiences, the final stage of which indeed reminded me much of Hannibal Lector's, as mentioned previously. That and his behavior and interaction with certain people was absolutely priceless.I expected the final sentence of this book to come at one point or another; don't be surprised if your mind discovers it, even if just briefly, when you're still far from the end, as this is a kind of plot development sure to complicate the issues and keep at least one end loose for the future. No complaints, but it was coming.All in all, I honestly felt Book of the Dead lost steam and some of my attention at the end, which is why I regretfully give it a 4/5, which is not bad for it being the lowest opinion I've had for any Pendergast novel so far. This novel is definitely worthwhile just to see Pendergast deal with various awkward situations. I would have to disagree about the level of tension and adrenaline being high; rather, I found this laid-back and familiar due to its emphasis being on characters and motives and decisions, none of which originate from this book.At the end of the day, I will always be looking forward to more Aloysius..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of The Dead finishes up the storyline started in \\"Brimstone\\", and it does so in a powerful way. After the rather disappointing ending of \\"Dance of Death\\" (a cliffhanger doesn't work when it takes you a year to put out your next book), TBOTD actually brings things together rather nicely. It's not a perfect story though, so be prepared. While Pendergast has taken the starring role in the last few novels, the book is well over half finished before he becomes a major player. I was getting a little anxious and thinking Preston and Child were going to leave us with another cliffhanger here, but Pendergast does become a central part of the story and his battle with Diogenes takes on a powerful life of its own.That being said, you WILL need to have read the previous two books to fully understand what's going on. And it was nice to see Constance getting to do something besides sit in the library and read all the time. She's a character that deserves to be explored (and that's almost guaranteed for the next book). The major disappointment of this book is that it includes yet ANOTHER disasterous opening at the New York Museum (for those keeping score, that's three big openings in the Preston/Child series and three big disasters). Can those museum people not take a hint? And who are the idiots who actually buy tickets to these things thinking \\"Oh, the other times were just flukes\\"? People die when they open exhibits there! Don't go!While this story doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se, it definitely leaves you wanting to know what happens next (a few of the characters futures are in question). I love the characters Preston and Child have created. Each has an individual personality and depth. All in all, this is another incredible story by the team and it ends the trilogy with a bang. Grab this one and you'll be looking for their other novels, guaranteed!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Ok, so I was afraid...you know the kind of fear from wanting a book to be as good as you want it to be...but fearing you'll be disappointed? I have waited since the day I finished Dance of Death to find out how the heck Pendergast was going to break out of prison, what exactly Diogenes was now plotting since his previous plan had been ruined, and most important of all...what is the EVENT that happened between these two brothers that caused Diogenes to hate Aloysius so much that he spent twenty years of his life plotting the \\"perfect crime\\" against him???Well these, and many other plot lines, are all gratifyingly tied up in the Book of the Dead (and there's even a little twist at the end - even though I have to admit I guessed that one).The story starts out solidly setting up the plot about the museum needing an exhibit to save itself from the bad publicity resounding from the diamond heist in DoD. Because I don't wish to include spoilers- all I'll say is that it just becomes more and more engrossing, until frankly I was rocketing through the story at a million miles an hour. I had no reason in the world to be afraid of disappointment as the book was everything I had hoped it would be and much, much more! This book is definitely now my favorite of the Pendergast series (especially because of the background story of the EVENT, which further clues readers in on what makes Pendergast tick)...and all I can say is \\"Man, can these guys write!\\" and that now I can't wait until the next one!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I love this \\"series\\". I read the entire series in 2 mo. This is a great book that fits in the series well."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I have both read and listened to The Book of the Dead several times. By far this is my favorite of the Pendergast series!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"As the final book in the series of the Preston and Child triolgy of the Agent Pendergast saga this work has its good and bad moments. However on an overall scale the book is well worth reading and does have some good thrills in it.As we pick-up the story from a prior writing, Agent Pendergast has been sent away to prison and it seems all is lost for the good guys to capture the errant brother Diogenes who has caused all of the problems thusfar. The reader is led through a series of scenarios about the New York museum and a valuable old tomb that they have sealed away in their basement which a benefactor wishes them to reopen and put on display. As the plot goes on the tomb opening is really a ploy that leads to several more greater crimes. In the meantime Agent Pendergast with some help escapes from his prison and is soon hot on the trail of the pending disaster about to befall at the museum as they reopen the tomb.The story leads futher into the unmasking of Diogenes' plan and his alter ego as he tries to escape his brother only to be tracked down by a most unlikely person. This person is no other than Pendergast's ward Constance Greene who reveals at the very last sentance of the book her reason for wanting to kill the criminal brother. There are a few other revelations as well that are made during the last hundred pages or so which the reader will appreciate after having read the previous book in the series.In summary the book has its ups and downs and does drag at times, but there are some sections that really do keep the reader on the edge of his seat reading deeper and deeper into the book for the outcome. It's well worth your time to get a copy and read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of the Dead, by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Book ReviewThe third and final book in the trilogy of novels by award winning novelists Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, picks up where the previous book - Dance of Death - leaves off. FBI Special Agent Pendergast is in Hekmoor, a high security prison, framed for murders he did not commit. Those murders were carried out by Pendergast's diabolical brother Diogenes who has now gone into hiding. Having stolen priceless jewels from the New York Museum of Natural History, he returns the diamonds crushed to dust. In a bid to downplay this horrendous \\"attack\\" against the museum, its management accept a donation from a reclusive French count to reopen one of the museum's oldest, and now long forgotten, exhibits: The Tomb of Senef. But the tomb has a curse, and as the exhibit nears its grand opening, strange murders begin to occur within the museum walls.Special Agent Pendergast has an ally, Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD, and with help from a secret organization D'Agosta manages to enter Hekmoor's high security walls and assist Pendergast in a daring and well thought out escape. The meaning of this enterprising bid for freedom is obvious: Diogenes Pendergast must be stopped from carrying out his \`perfect crime', and the only man capable of preventing such a felony is FBI Agent Pendergast. It is a race against time for Pendergast to unmask his brother and prevent the slaughter of hundreds of innocent lives.The Book of the Dead offers much, and for the most part it delivers. Once again the characters are well defined and strong, although quite how Special Agent Pendergast is able survive a brutal attack six on one against brutish gangland thugs while in prison - and quite how he manages to escape from Hekmoor in the first place without so much as a single glitch - often leads one imagining how realistic such a character could be. The setting for the majority of the book, New York and its museum, is enjoyable as always, but the real storytelling comes in to play when Diogenes finds himself on the run, chased by not only Pendergast but an unlikely hunter. The pursuit heats up in the Italian city Florence and comes to its conclusion on the desolate, yet inhabited, island of Stromboli, near the island of Siccily.Everything that has gone before, not only in this book but certainly in the previous novel - Dance of Death - and to a lesser extent in Brimstone, the first in this unofficial trilogy, should lead to this one moment, the final 30 pages of climactic action when the two brothers meet in a duel of the death. It falls flat on its face. The end chapters are so unfulfilling, so unrewarding, so utterly devoid of closure that for a while it made me wonder why I had read so much for so long. If the meaning was to leave the plot open for the possible return of the fallen character, then even that was done poorly.The Book of the Dead is a good read and it does have its great moments as one has come to expect from this talented author duo, but don't be disappointed if the rollercoaster ride stutters to a level slow stop instead of leaving you screaming down that one last cavernous drop."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Same title as the Cornwell book, but entirely different story. I picked this up as a paper back at the airport before a trip and had never read these authors before. This was part of a series but I understood most of it without having the background. Set in a museum and dealing with Egyptian artifacts and murder. Good story. I would advise reading earlier books by these two before picking up this book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I came across it by accident when looking for Lee Child. It was a quick read but enjoyed it alot!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This could have been a good mystery if not for the multitude of unnecessary characters in the story, all introduced in each short chapter.Historically, it leaves something to be desired, but most unfortunately rarely delves into the science & particulars of egyptology and the reason for the title of this book. It mentions a few times, but briefly the meaning of the ancient texts. It was an easy read but could have been much more interesting with some historical facts that could have fitted nicely into this story."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child bring what is unofficially called \\"The Diogenes Trilogy\\" to a gripping conclusion with \\"Book of the Dead\\". The story arc that began with \\"Brimstone\\" and continued with \\"Dance of Death\\" wraps up with a number of questions answered, and important changes in the lives of some of the major characters.\\"Book of the Dead\\" brings the usual players- D'Agosta, Hayward, Smithback, Kelly, Green and of course, the Pendergast brothers- back to the New York Museum of Natural History for another round of the deadly cat-and-mouse struggle between Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his criminal genius brother Diogenes. Readers will find echoes of \\"Relic\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" in the premise of another big museum exhibit gone wrong, but the novel is in no way a stale re-hash of previous plots. Preston and Child put their characters in precarious and confounding situations, and Diogenes spins a complex web of evil. There are even a few surprises thrown in.One of the most fascinating details is the revelation of the event that sent Diogenes over the edge and into a lifeleong hatred of brother Aloysius. The story arc draws to a satisfying conclusion, but the authors leave just a little room for doubt, plus a \\"Wow!\\" moment on the final page.One of the most enjoyable aspects of Preston and Child's work is their ability to put old characters in new and interesting settings. Pendergast, D'Agosta, Hayward and Smithback were first introduced to the reader in \\"Relic\\". Nora Dunn originally appeared in \\"Thunderhead\\" before later crossing paths with Pendergast in \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\". Eli Glinn was introduced in \\"Ice Limit\\", while Viola Maskelene came along in \\"Brimstone\\".If \\"Book of the Dead\\" has a weakness, it lies in the fact that Pendergast is sometimes too good at everything. He's not physically imposing, but he can take out prison toughs in the blink of an eye. He's brilliant, well-read and a master of spiritual disciplines. At times one wants to ask, \\"What can't this guy do?\\" This is a flaw common to many heroes in the genre, and detracts only minimally from the enjoyment of the story.A note to the reader- Do not read this novel as a stand-alone piece. At minimum, read \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" before diving into \\"Book of the Dead\\". If you are a fan of the adventure-thriller genre, start with \\"Relic\\" and read all the Pendergast novels in order. A few plot threads from \\"Still Life With Crows\\" and \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" carry over into the Diogenes Trilogy, so take your time and enjoy all the works of these fantastic authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is the 2nd Pendergast novel I have read and I would rate it slightly below \\"Brimstone\\" but in the same ballpark and well worth reading. These books have an aura of the supernatural but the stories are in the end grounded in reality. The hero Pendergast has an evil brother as smart as he is, an everyday NYPD detective as a sidekick and several continuing female characters. I like the female no nonsense NYPD detective captain the best. This story flags a bit at times and has some filler. It could have used an editor with a green eyeshade to shape it up. But this series is different. I would buy it if only because it's not set in Florida or Southern California but it worthwhile aside from that. Buy it for the unique, well crafted characters and interesting plot. One comment - Pendergast's \\"ward\\" is creepy. She is NOT someone who would at least pretend to be interested while you explained the infield fly rule. I wish she would wander off into the moors lost in deep thoughts and fall off a cliff."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"As the final book of what the authors term \\"The Diogenes Trilogy\\" I was all set for a final battle to the death between Pendergast and his very evil brother Diogenes. I was pleasantly surprised to see the book move in a very different direction. Perhaps too much time was spent in extricating Pendergast from his unjust confinement, but the detailed process was executed with fascinating and belivable precision. As with the other Pendergast books, the strange protagonist manages to carry out his plans with such amazing ability that it is a bit mystifying that Diogenes could have accomplished so much of the mayhem that he has pulled off in the past. It was painful to watch Diogenes in action as he duped the the innocent Constance, but the reversal which happens is both believable and highly satisfying. The character of Constance is one which bears even further development, which I suspect is what will happen in Wheel of Darkness. I certainly hope so."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"While the book was fairly entertaining it barely touches on the Book of the Dead. Was the title merely a marketing ploy to appeal the those who liked the B movie The Mummy?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is a deeply plotted story that is true to the teaser blurb on the back cover, which gives away some of the things that I would have thought would be kept as surprises. The book starts out with an interesting premise--a natural science museum receives a parcel containing bag of dust. But though this device is explained later, it is really never developed to satisfaction as the plot turns to the museum re-opening a long-closed exhibit of an Egyptian pharaoh. There is the psycho-thriller aspect of the villainous and rather unhinged Diogenes Pendergast; the spy genre aspect of his brother, Aloysius, a brilliant FBI agent now rotting in prison; the romantic sidebar of the reporter and his wife who works in the museum.The book also introduces Aloysius's ward, Constance Greene, a character who is mentioned only briefly in the beginning, but really plays no significant role in the plot or character development until near the end of the book, where she comes out of nowhere. Her character is only sketched, not really providing enough acquaintance with her to understand her or her later actions in any depth. Another character, Margo Green is briefly introduced but not dealt with much thereafter, just distracting from the story rather than adding dimension. The similarity of the two characters' last names doesn't do the reader any service, either.But that's OK, this is a good beach read.Although the story provides a compelling story line, and creates tension with increasingly frenetic action throughout, it fails to develop its two-dimensional characters. In this way it reminds me ever so slightly of Tom Clancy, who also drops his flat characters onto mazes of fascinating plots, and escalates the action steadily to climax.The authors (two partners wrote this book) have done some homework on their Egyptian mythology and ancient history, but have a tendency to use naive or just lazy assumptions. For example, a reporter calls a lab to extract some information:\\"...This is Bill Smithback of the Times....can I ask you a few questions?\\"\\"You said you're a reporter?\\"\\"That's right.\\"\\"I suppose so.\\"I cannot imagine any high-profile testing lab that would allow its employees to talk to the press about confidential tests.There are also factual errors, such as one scene, albeit inconsequential, where a museum employee was analyzing clay pottery using carbon dating techniques. The problem is that carbon dating works on organic material, and clay is mineral material. The authors ask us later to believe that properly formulated sound and light applied over a very short period of time (minutes) can cause targeted brain damage to produce specific, predictable behavior. Another scene refers to a \\"low-voltage, high amperage shock,\\" but any electrician will tell you this is an oxymoron; voltage is directly proportional to amperage. An FBI agent gives direction to a prison warden with great authority, but the prisons are not under FBI jurisdiction.The book is filled with phrases that might have been trendy in a 1940's detective novel but just sound trite here, or just bad cliches:\\"The case against him was good. Maybe *too* good.\\"\\"...his head, which was shaved bald as a billiard ball...\\"\\"...the man [had] a bullet head that contained about as much gray matter as a spaniel.\\"\\"'How did you come by this information?' Pendergast asked in a voice so cold D'Agosta felt his blood freeze.\\"\\"The two men held each other's gaze for less than a minute, but to D'Agosta it seemed to last forever.\\"\\"His heart was beating so hard in his chest he thought it might explode at any moment.\\"\\"It doesn't matter what happens in that room. Do you understand me Vinnie? Because whatever happens in there, happens to both of us. We're in this together.\\"The even crib a phrase from Churchill: \\"...enigmas wrapped in mysteries.\\"And my favorite exchange between two supporting characters, a man and woman facing each other again a time after an ugly breakup:\\"You lied to me. Played me for a fool. I was willing to offer you everything. Everything. And you--\\"\\"And I am so very sorry. God, if only I could turn back the clock, do things differently. I tried my best....\\"If you keep your sense of humor you will enjoy this greatly while listening to the waves lap onto the beach.And the biggest disappointment of the book was the fall-flat revelation of a backstory told by Aloysius, the only witness, where Diogenes experienced something as a child that changed him forever, and the telling of it built and built, came to a head as we understood how horrible it must have been, and the authors escalate the tensions as Aloysius tells it, we anticipate learning of the horrible Event, so horrible that it made Diogenes attempt to take his own life rather than continue the experience, and we await Aloysius to tell all.

The Book of the Dead was a page turner from the opening. As an editor I insist on justice being rendered to every word, but the tempo of this novel had me flying through page after page. I also must disagree that this can be a standalone novel. For the most enjoyment, all the Pendergast books need to be read in order. This from a logical analytical mind point of view. So start with Relic and read them all. Watch SA Pendergast grow. You won't be disappointed.Previous reviews have elaborated about the content, so I won't. Suffice it to say, Aloysius Pendergast isn't your normal hero. Although this has been billed as the last of a trilogy -- because of the denouement between protagonist and antagonist -- there is still much more to tell.

This so-called trilogy of novels involving FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast ends (or does it?) with this fast moving book. The loose ends that were left hanging in Brimstone and Dance of Death are purposefully tied up. Without giving away the plot, our protagonist, Agent Pendergast, has his final showdown with his evil brother, Diogenes, in a volcanic island near Sicily. Aloysius, however, is not the one who does his tormented brother in. It's a surpirse plot twist that reverberates right through to the very end of the book and leaves things open for still another Pendergast-based novel. Run, don't walk, to your library or book store and get a copy of this book for your summer reading. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another enjoyable romp with the cast of characters from \\"The Cabinet of Curiosity\\" Preston and Childs are paralleling the career of the worlds' greatest detective and shuffling names a bit. Sherlocks' brother Mycroft belonged to the Diogenes Club and his great adversary was thrown over the Falls. All of this gets worked into the Pendergast Saga in fun forms. Fans of Conan Doyle will be delighted, but those who can't see through the veil will be a bit confused. It is still a great read and promises future amusment as well. Once again the joy is in the details, the poetry, the wine, the locations, and the ambience of a glorious pair of literary lights at the top of their form."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Just finished the book today and am still digesting everything that went on, as a lot gets answered while new questions are raised. I agree with the other reviewers that while this book can be read itself, it becomes much more enjoyable if you've read at least Brimstone and Dance of Death, if not all of P/C's books. I gave it four stars as opposed to five because it was not as good as the aforementioned novels, but it was a great read nonetheless. If you are a P/C fan you know you will have trouble putting this one down.Without spoiling anything, this time around the Event is revealed and sheds light on Aloysius and shows some of his flaws as an adolescent. There's D'Agosta and the prison break, and its always good to see Eli Glinn and EES in action, if only briefly. The same goes for Smithback who gets less time here than in previous novels, as the focus is on Diogenes as well as Constance. We also are treated to a brief appearance of Special Agent Coffey. And of course there is the Tomb and the Museum and its ever rising body count.I must say the book ended entirely different from what I expected which is a credit to the authors for not doing the obvious. P/C have done it once again, and this one meets the high standard set by their previous work. I am already anticipating the next one. Highly recommended. Buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I think this was the one that came a little damaged, though well packaged. Its fine, all things considered.

This was my first read in the series but it made enough sense with the hints and backstory. By far the best part was the escape from a maximum prison facility. The ending and the fate of the villain was disappointing for a number of reasons (no spoilers). There are a lot of sub tales taking place and most of them revolve around the NY museum but that's okay, especially if you like Egyptian History and all its mysteries. Pendergast is a compelling character and probably the main one in the series but he seems to have equal screen time compared to some of the other main characters.

Overall a wonderful read , and I finished it in one day !!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Hey, here's a shocker for everyone complaining about this book: It is NOT a stand-alone novel! You see, what happens when you read only the third book in a trilogy is that you might not understand everything that is going on. That is why it is wise to start trilogies from the beginning.Preston and Child can't be expected to fully develop characters they've been showcasing in novels for the past 10 years or so every time they begin a novel. Seasoned fans know when Pendergast has made his appearance in a book, and new readers shouldn't start here anyway.If The Book of the Dead was recommended to you by a friend, go buy The Cabinet of Curiosities instead and begin there. Relic and Reliquary are decent enough reads, but the truly amazing stuff begins in Cabinet."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Childs deliver another good story.

Preston/Child have created one of the oddest and most entertaining heroes in the mystery genre. Looking forward to many more stories."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of the Dead is the third book in Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child's \\"Diogenes\\" trilogy, the seventh book featuring the fantastic Special Agent Pendergast, and the eleventh book overall that these two writers have worked together on and it picks up shortly after Dance of Death (the previous book).Special Agent Pendergast sits in prison for crimes he didn't commit, D'Agosta suspended from the police force and facing a disciplinarian hearing for his role in the previous book, Constance teetering on the verge of a breakdown, Margo still in the hospital; all victims of Pendergast psychotic brother's Machiavellian plans for global revenge.Therein lies the first problem with this book, it is not a complete story; to have any idea as to what's going on you have to have read the previous two books (Brimstone, and Dance of Death). This wasn't a problem for me but newcomers beware; this is NOT the place to start in this series.The second problem is that, being a fan of their work, I expected so much more from this book. Cabinet of Curiosities and Still Life with Crows are the two best in the entire series and, I admit it, I was spoiled by them. They are the two that the others must compare to and Book of the Dead just doesn't hold up. The surprises weren't surprising, the plots didn't seem all that impressive, and the ending was too obvious for my taste (I knew what the last two words of the book would be less than 100 pages in).The final problem is that, as a character, Diogenes just isn't very interesting. His motivations, his history, his scheme for revenge, his trophy trunk, his childhood trauma etc... None of it really seems to work to make him a worth adversary for Pendergast or an interesting villain in general. In fact Diogenes penchant for failure basically renders Pendergast a superfluous character for 90% of the book.In spite of all of those negative comments there are some really good moments in this book and, if you read the other two, it is worth the read. It is an action packed story that keeps you turning the pages, the scenes with Pendergast in the prison are fantastic (I don't want to spoil anything but the final prison scenes are genius), Laura Hayward steals quite a bit of the show as the tough as nails homicide captain trying to find the truth, and seeing Special Agent Coffey finally get his comeuppance was worth the entire book.Finally, the last 100 pages (with the exception of the last chapter) were a fantastic globe hopping, cat and mouse game that made up for a lot of the failings. I wish that last 100 pages could have been the basis of the entire book because everything you expect from the P & C books are there in force; suspense, surprises, twist, turns, you name it... But there just wasn't enough."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This book starts off slow till about the middle and then steamrolls to the end. Fans that read the prior books will not be disappointed. Newcomers to the series should read at least the prior book (Game of Death) to get a full appreciation of this work.Eli Glinn from The Ice Limit, plays a prominent part in the book as well as Constance (Pendergast's ward). We finally learn what caused Diogennes to become the evil opposite of Pendergast. Once again the NY Museum of Natural History is the focal point of the story, with its assortment of employee murders, which makes one wonder why anyone would be brave enough to work there?The book does have an interesting twist at the end which suggests that the authors will be planning more Pendergast tales."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The first book was incredible and the second book of the series was equally mesmerizing but this book bored me to tears. The main character was incarcerated it seemed for half the book. Way too much time was spent on the details of Egyptology. The book had some good parts but even the ending fizzled out and was not worth drudging through all of the tedious details that in my opinion only served as filler to add pages to the book. Save yourself the time and aggravation and stop after the first two books..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I have read all of their books. I strongly recommend that you read the earlier books in the Pendergast trilogy.Having said that I am more than ready for something different. I feel like we have fallen into a rut where we have another big opening at the museum, another bunch of dead city celebs, and another master crime. It seems we have done this a couple of times now.The blood feud between the brothers comes to a conclusion. (Great can we get back to monsters like THE RELIC?) I don't regret reading this book. It is well written, and many questions are answered."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The funny thing about this book is actually the plethora of great reviews it got/is getting on this site. This book is not at all bad, but then again it's not at all good either. The problem with the book is that is basically the definition of average in a novel. It's hard to rant and rave about this book and Preston/Child if you've read other mystery/thriller/suspense books by other authors that were so much better. All in all, this book is too average to get higher than a three rating and I'd imagine it would be good for an aiport layover or a long drive, not to keep you absolutely enthralled."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Brilliant, scary page turner. Let your imagination go wild reading this excellent thriller. Preston & Child have created another entertaining novel. I'm sorry we'll have to wait for another Agent Prendergast novel."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"THE BOOK OF THE DEAD brings the trilogy of Aloysius Pendergast and his demonic brother, Diogenes, to a startling conclusion. As in the previous novels, Child and Preston serve up a humdinger of a plot, fraught with gory murders, supernatural undertones and breakneck action and suspense. The characters continue to be richly drawn, with some surprise twists and a frightening sequence in the museum's new Egyptian display. You'd be more involved if you've read the two novels leading up to this one, but you can still enjoy the book nonetheless.One of the strongest features of a Preston/Child book is its cinematic quality. You can just see this book on the big screen. The horrible secret of the two brothers' youth is finally revealed and it gives some kind of motivation for both brothers' life choices. More is given too on the enigmatic Constance Greene. Nora Kelly, Bill Smithback, Vincent D'agosta, Margo Green, Hugo Menzies---they're all back and I only hope we get more Pendergast stories in the future. A great read folks!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Child have done it again. They have created a suspence novel TOGETHER that keeps the reader on his toes. There are about four stories going on at once, but they all conclude at the end of the novel. My question though, has to do with the last two words of the novel. What will they do now?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Jyst what you expect from a Preston & Child book. Packed with action and surprises at every turn.

I read the back cover and thought, \\"hmm, seems interesting.\\" When I got home and began reading it, I was hooked from Chapter 1. This was the first book by Preston and Child that I have ever read. It launched me on my path of addiction to the Pendergast series. I backtracked and read the previous novels starring Agent Pendergast and then went on to read all the others. Preston and Child are a truly great combination. I highly recommend their books, especially the ones featuring Agent Pendergast."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Pendergast series is one of the most entertaining I've read in years. Preston and Child make a good team. There story thread follows through without confusion."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"As usual you can't put the book down and you're always surprised.The charactersare great and the suspense is incredible. I can't imagine what it must belike living with either author or how two people could have such talentedand unusual ideas."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Whenever I sit down and get started on a Preston and Child novel, I have some basic expectations: the characters will speak at a level most people don't hear on a daily basis; there will be some element of the supernatural or spiritual; and there will be intrigue that, even if implausible, draws you into the world Preston and Child so carefully craft. Book of the Dead is no exception.While some aspects of the story are difficult to believe - including the science behind the main event - there's enough detail present in the writing (and, indeed, the writing is exceptional) to allow the reader to suspend their disbelief and just go with it. Not having read the previous two Diogenes novels (Relic and Reliquary, I believe) may have left me with a bit of a disadvantage as there were references to previous events. P & C state that their novels can be read as stand-alones, and that may be the case, but I'd still recommend knowing the backstory before diving into Book of the Dead.While not a front-of-the-line psychological thriller, I did find the description of the \\"Event\\" that leads to our main conflict to be incredibly chilling and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend reading this while alone in a house in the mountains that you don't really know."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I feel like all my reviews for the Pendergast series are starting to sound the same, I'm gushing as if in love about how fantastic the books are but its still true, this story is phenomenal and it makes you want to read another and another, this could easily have thirty volumes and I would still want to read them all, as usual this book reads smooth as silk while the action cuts like a knife.The Book of The Dead is the standard great stuff that one would expect from the insightful and intelligent duo, their stories breathe a life of their own and to me they feel different than other novels. Our world is filled with books, one can find them everywhere but whenever I read a Pendergast novel I feel as if I was holding something of heft and value, there is knowledge in these pages; ancient cultures, science, architecture, folklore and mysticism, curses, artifacts and it all sounds real enough to touch and some of it is but I especially adore all the breathtaking characters both good and bad and some in-between, in my opinion they are invaluable to the books. I guess they speak to me, true love haha... Pendergast lives in my mind beyond the pages of the book, that's how great he is.The third in the Diogenes Pendergast trilogy and seventh in the Aloysius Pendergast series ( I highly recommend starting with Relic, Pendergast#1) story continues on the wild hunt to catch and expose the elusive Diogenes who is conveniently presumed to be dead by everyone but the small circle of our heroes. The Queen of Narnia, The Heart of Eternity, The Indigo Ghost, Ultima Thule, The Fourth of July, The Zanzibar Green and of course Lucifer's Heart, all precious diamonds that were stole in the last installment are destroyed by Diogenes and arrive pulverized into a rainbow colored snow to the museum as a final act of madness and show of power. The previous book was simply fantastic and it exposed Diogenes' identity but only to the reader, the entire museum still has no idea that not only is Diogenes alive but his secret identity is walking right under their noses. To make matters worse, Aloysius Pendergast is in a top security prison and everyone that has always been jealous of him is gunning for the guy to go down, he deals with that brilliantly, boy that was fun! Even though Aloysius is locked up he is the only one who can match up against his evil and twisted genius of a brother, their journey takes them half way through the globe and back.My personal favorite part of the tale was the prison sequence, well pretty much all of it, I don't want to spoil anything but what happens to Pendergast in the prison is nuts. I read all the parts while holding my breath, some I had to re-read because they were simply too good to only read once. Ingenious and stunning, no deus-ex machina way out of this puppy! Lots of stuff happens, there is also the museum exhibit with a tomb that appears to be cursed, madness and mayhem breaks out as usual, lovers of museum thrillers will have a ball with the Tomb of Senef and those who love Pendergast will gobble up everything he does and says. I was finally impressed with Constance, I never really gave her much thought before but through this book she became another strong contender for future stories and my dear Vincent D'Agosta, he was wonderful as was Laura Hayward. For some reason Laura Linney ( the actress) kept popping into my head when Hayward's scenes came up, she was something, the woman can hold her own.This was such a tremendous journey with the two brothers that I'm not sad to see it over because I'm really looking forward to the next chapter, the next book sounds quite potent and meaty and I might need a bit of a break to let my brain prepare for another greatness of Preston and Child. I don't read them back to back on purpose as much as I really want to, after all it's not good to eat dessert three times a day, same with books, I save the good stuff to be savored when I'm really in the mood for greatness.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Became interested in Ancient Egypt as I was researching info. for my 6th grade sp. needs student.

It brought all those \\"difficult\\" names into my reality as if they were current. The intrique of the story and the facts so amazing that it was a challenge not to put the book down when I needed to do so. It also seems that even if I hadn't become interested in Ancient Egypt, this would still have been a book difficult to put down. It does take place in NY during the present."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I've just finished the BOTD 5 minutes ago so it's quite fresh in my mind.A very good typical book from Preston and Child. Spoilers ahead.Why are they good? They are good because they are very good at providing a chilling and scary backdrop. Their stories are scary, period. It kept me up til 5am last night until my eyelids could no longer keep up against gravity. It's just like a good horror movie, only in book form. The museum is a great setting for them, so they keep going back to it as you can't ask for anything better. I used to close up buildings for a living at night, if Preston Child had been around then, I don't know if I'd have kept my job.Alright, so why doesn't it get a 5 star rating? Problem are the Pendergast brothers, especially Diogenes. I think the trilogy is a mistake because you always know who or what the adversary is: Diogenes. Whereas in the stand alone books, you don't know what the adversary is, and the book keeps you guessing and biting your fingernails. It's a mistake to write from Diogenes' POV because, like the cliche, familiarity breeds contempt. You are no longer scared of him once you see how he works and thinks.I do have a problem with Diogenes setting the whole Tomb of Senef thing up. That kind of work requires special knowledge, and I don't see how or where he can acquire it, what with having to seduce you know who and all that. And how's he gonna get all that stuff installed with everyone there. More omnipotent stuff.Same thing with Aloysius, since an unkillable, omnipotent, omnipresent character is what I call lazy writing - you can make him do anything, no need to think. Don't know how to finish the chapter? No problemo, Special Agent Pendegast shows up in the locked room, kills the bad guy, saves the girl, end of problem. But I forgive Preston and Child since I'm still favorably disposed towards SA Pendegast at this point.Now that I know Smithback is cool, I rather like him as it creates a subplot.A pregnancy? Oh no, can't we stop beating this to death and go to a stand alone book?Overall, still quite a good book for 80% of it. However, this book is not a 5 star for me, but 4 or 4.5 stars.PS, I'm migrating this review from my old account to my new one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Terrific book!

Other characters like Smithback and Nora Kelly are also very engaging. The Egyptian background is fascinating.As for Agent Pendergast himself, I'm still not sure why I haven't warmed to this guy.

They hooked me with Relic back in the 90's, and I've been an avid reader of all their works ever since. Year after year, they continue to produce compelling stories that are crafted so well that each new book is almost impossible to put down. The dishes remain dirty in the sink. The dog gets ignored. The mail piles up in the mailbox until the last page is finally read.Book of the Dead is no exception. Every chapter builds on the suspense and tension of the previous one until things are flying along and you're desperate to read the next page. There are surprising revelations, great twists and a couple of real surprises along the way.Preston & Child are two of the best storytellers writing today. Do not miss out on the ride they offer every time you open one of their books.John R.

Perhaps it is because this was the first book I read out of the series. Nevertheless, after the initial shock of numerous characters and scenes, I fought the urge to continue reading and I'm so glad that I did. This book is a master piece!

While it can be read as a stand alone novel, you should really read \\"Dance of Death\\" first. Its a great summer read with intricate escapes, international flight, games of \\"cat and mouse\\" and a look into Diogenes' lair, as well as Pendergast's psyche.

I expected it to go out with more of a bang. Still, these authors entertain by educating readers, and they certainly do that here. I wish the characters were a bit richer and the plot a bit less rambling, but, you know, there are a lot of worse books out there (I know that's an awful endorsement of any book and I don't mean it as harshly as it sounds). I enjoyed this one, for the most part, while I was reading it; I guess it just isn't as memorable as I'd have like it to be.

I will explain what I didn't like. The \\"Event\\" reminded me too much of Malin Hatch from RIPTIDE and his brother's death. And the psychotic light-show as Diogenes' big finale didn't wow me at all. Viola Maskalene lost her attraction, being more flat and boring a character in this book. And all the time spent in the prison bored me to tears - come on, we all KNOW Pendergast's breaking out. This novel lacked the atmosphere of the others. I love the NY museum setting, and I love Egyptology, but it felt contrived here. The backgrounds were hollow and other characters entries seemed gratuitous, while Diogenes & Constance stole center stage in this installment. I don't even remember Constance Green being featured very prominently in Cabinet of Curiosities. And Diogenes wasn't as scary anymore. As usual, the pages turn quickly and the excitement builds. Of the three Pendergast novels, I really liked BRIMSTONE best, and DANCE OF DEATH a close second, BOOK OF DEATH third. This one just lacked atmosphere for me and also I was disappointed in the revealing truth of what happened to the brothers.

As such, you would expect to have to have read the previous two works in order to have any idea of what is going on. No doubt much more could be gleaned from the novel if you are an avid follower, but it can also be said that Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child succeed in providing a book that does not completely leave first-time readers in the dark. From the get go, they weave in story elements and background enough to give you some idea of what it is that has gone before. As a stand-alone piece, THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is still a heck of a thrilling ride.The New York Museum of Natural History is the backdrop for the tale, and in page one things already begin to go incredibly wrong. A delivery arrives via bike messenger. Tattered and leaking a mysterious powder, the Museum is shut down in a post-9/11 potential bio-terror panic scenario. The powder in question, however, is not nearly so dangerous, yet it is extremely troublesome. Previously, the Museum's diamond collection had been stolen, and the dust delivered in the box is the remains of that priceless exhibit. Now the question is who would steal something so valuable only to destroy it? And how can the Museum deflect the media scrutiny to come?The answer to the second question is simple: locate and reopen the Tomb of Senef exhibit. Originally opened 70 years previously, the exhibit was mysteriously shut after a series of grisly murders began to plague the Museum. Giving the old Egyptian presentation a state-of-the-art overhaul seems to be a wonderful idea until the murders begin again. As if this weren't bad enough, FBI Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his maniacal brother, Diogenes, are involved in a chess match that yields some startling results in the book's final pages.THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is crafted much like a rope. Not just one simple thread, the novel takes the stories of several characters and winds them tightly around each other to form one strong and compelling story. With so many characters floating around, it would become a tangled mess in the hands of less capable authors. Preston and Child have a clear idea of their direction for the individual arcs and their place in the storyline as a whole, and thus are able to snag readers as soon as the cover is cracked. They propel the story forward with great skill and without ever leaving readers with a shred of disinterest or boredom. This is not merely quality writing, this is quality storytelling.--- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Never picked up a previous one and won't pick up a later edition. I'm half way through and have no idea what's going on! Why the hero is incarcerated, why a special agent can think he can tell a warden to keep an attorney from his inmate (who isn't actually sentenced yet), or put him in danger in a prison yard, and think he can do it again -- all on the word of an agent he's never met before. There's two women who are dead or injured and I'm clueless as to why. One Prof. entering the museum at 3 in the morning -- when 2 men were attacked there the night before and one died! Its really, really stupid !!! Like a really bad B movie. Hey, I love thrillers - believe me, this is terrible!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Serial killer FBI special agent Aloysius Pendergast is serving time in solitary confinement in upstate New York's Herkmoor Federal Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison that no one has ever escaped from. At the same time that the disgraced Fed assumes his adversarial brother Diogenes set him up, the New York Museum of Natural History is trapped in scandal, embarrassment and fabrication. The museum has been exposed by the media concealing that dust is what has become of the priceless diamond collection stolen by them during a less than ethical era and recently purloined by Diogenes.To distract the public, the museum hires archaeologist Nora Kelly and British Museum Egyptologist Dr. Adrian Wicherly to reconstruct the Tomb of Senef from artifacts in their basement. The plan is to dazzle wealthy patrons and the press especially her spouse a New York Times reporter, who broke the diamond story. Adrian realizes that the tomb's hieroglyphics include a curse of insanity on whoever besmirches it, which happens as workers and visitors become crazed murderers. FBI agent Vinnie D'Agosta frees his peer Aloysius from prison while Diogenes stands trial for murder.Though THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is exciting and can stand alone, newcomers should first read the previous Special Agent Pendergast thrillers (see DANCE OF DEATH and BRIMSTONE) because this tale ties up the dangling participles from the previous novels. The story line is action-packed with supernatural overtones and homage to Holmes and Moriarty gripping readers from start to finish as Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child deliver a terrific thriller that never takes a breather. No one combines a cerebral (think Holmes) mystery with non-stop adventure (this team wrote RELIC) than this pair as they prove this once again."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"It only takes a few pages of reading this book before you realize that this is not a stand-alone book. In fact, it is the seventh book of a series that recounts the heroics of Aloysius Pendergast and even more disturbingly, it is the culminating volume in a trilogy that recounts the battle between him and his brother Diogenes. I wish there was any kind of indication on the book's cover of this fact as that alone would have deterred me from picking it up and reading it. Unfortunately, though, that was not something the editors did. Maybe sales are so bad that they decided to not even offer a hint about it to catch a few hundred unweary souls? If so, this definitely backfired in my case!The book falls in to the thriller genre. It takes place in modern day New York City with the Museum of Natural History as its focus and background. In the first chapter we learn the conclusion of what took place in the last book (huh? Oh, something to do with a collection of diamonds that was stolen). Then, in rapid fire, we meet one of the curators who just got married to a reporter (apparently they were involved in the previous books), a woman who is convalescing from an attack, another woman who lives in an old house, and an FBI special Agent (that being the first Pendergast) who is now a resident of the biggest, baddest, maximum security prison in existence - this as a result of some murder he did NOT commit in a previous book.This technique of presenting material in rapid fire mode, in very short chapters, was popularized by Tom Clancy and carried through by Dan Brown in their thrillers and they make it work. In this book it does not work as the transitions are way too jerky. Of course, the fact that they rely on the reader having knowledge of all the plot lines that were developed in two to six previous books does not help matters. It is only by the time that I reached the middle of the book, that some of the threads started making sense and got connected to each other.The plot line is just as convoluted and non-sensical. Since the museum is in trouble, it decides to pull off a publicity stunt and reopen an exhibit that's been walled off for 70 years. This being the Tomb of Senef - an Egyptian tomb that is rumored to be cursed. Coincidentally, all the main characters manage to get involved as do some characters that we meet in the middle of the book that happen to be the love interests of the FBI dude. How convenient. Of course, the tomb still appears to be cursed and there are several scenes of people dying in really horrible ways as the storyline progresses.As it turns out, the whole story is of the battle of the Pendergast brothers. As we read the book, it is clear that one is evil and is attempting some sort of massive morbid crime. However, the other is in jail. So, how to solve the dilemma? Why, let's get him to break out of the jail that has never had an escape. That's it! Now, how do we arrange this? Well, we first bring back some super-secret outfit that has all kinds of fancy methods of doing things that are not always legal. Then, we make agent Pendergast into some kind of genius who understands things at a glance - even when never experiencing them before - let's see, we also make agent Pendergast into some sort of martial arts expert in an art that allows him to remotely kill people when he is being pounded by six others, and then, let's also make him a complete renaissance man by having him pick up drum rhythms and play them back and CONTROL them with no practice needed.Do you find it interesting that every female protagonist in this book is beautiful, young, and completely accomplished? There is a mysterious woman who lives her life cloistered and shut off from the world. Towards the end of the book, she needs to leave the house that she's lived in for decades and is immediately able to assume all kinds of disguises that fool everyone, travel in the modern world of trains and airplanes with no negative effects except for spending too much money (how did she get a passport?) and manages to elude the villain who has been planning on his campaign of terror for 15 years or more and is intimately familiar with many locations - yet she manages to ambush him in several of them; knows more than he does about others; and she manages to win the final battle between them. Totally unrealistic!There is a police captain - of course, a beautiful young woman; a museum curator - a beautiful young woman; etc. One of the things that really bugged me is that each of these characters was a shallow clich&eacute;. There is no development of personalities or of character here. These are line-drawn cartoons and nothing more.Another departure from reality is that neither of the brothers ever have a problem with money or the government agents that are all around them. The bad brother has unlimited funds, houses all over Europe and the United States and a horde of passports, papers, and disguises that allow him to appear as someone else while having completely different thoughts inside. He is also a genius who can accomplish all kinds of feats better than the world renowned experts that are all around him - but then he slips and is destroyed by quoting a line from an Italian poem.The good brother also has no money worries; is also a genius that knows everything; and is also unbothered by such things as breaking out of jail, killing people, and jetting around the world at whim. How can it be that all the bureaucracies that we all have to deal with daily, do not impact of affect these folks?In summary, this book is only of interest to those who want to find out how the story continues from the previous books. I will not go back and read any of the others in the series as the whole premise of these books and the plotlines are so unreal and improbable as to be off-putting. Stay away."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I got the 12-CD edition from my library, and found the reading by Scott Brick so awful I quit before the end of the first disk. From what I heard of it, the story is good and deserves better treatment than it get."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I've just finished the BOTD 5 minutes ago so it's quite fresh in my mind.A very good typical book from Preston and Child. Spoilers ahead.Why are they good? They are good because they are very good at providing a chilling and scary backdrop. Their stories are scary, period. It kept me up til 5am last night until my eyelids could no longer keep up against gravity. It's just like a good horror movie, only in book form. The museum is a great setting for them, so they keep going back to it as you can't ask for anything better. I used to close up buildings for a living at night, if Preston Child had been around then, I don't know if I'd have kept my job.Alright, so why doesn't it get a 5 star rating? Problem are the Pendergast brothers, especially Diogenes. I think the trilogy is a mistake because you always know who or what the adversary is: Diogenes. Whereas in the stand alone books, you don't know what the adversary is, and the book keeps you guessing and biting your fingernails. It's a mistake to write from Diogenes' POV because, like the cliche, familiarity breeds contempt. You are no longer scared of him once you see how he works and thinks.I do have a problem with Diogenes setting the whole Tomb of Senef thing up. That kind of work requires special knowledge, and I don't see how or where he can acquire it, what with having to seduce you know who and all that. And how's he gonna get all that stuff installed with everyone there. More omnipotent stuff and lazy writing.Same thing with Aloysius, since an unkillable, omnipotent, omnipresent character is lazy writing - you can make him do anything, no need to think. Don't know how to finish the chapter? No problemo, Special Agent Pendegast shows up in the locked room, kills the bad guy, saves the girl, end of problem. But I forgive Preston and Child since I'm still favorably disposed towards SA Pendegast at this point.Now that I know Smithback is cool, I rather like him as it creates a subplot.A pregnancy? Oh no, can't we stop beating this to death and go to a stand alone book?Overall, still quite a good book for 80% of it. However, their books are no longer 5 stars for me, but 4 or 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is the sixth novel in Preston and Child's ongoing series of books about Special Agent Pendergast and the third in an informal trilogy focusing on his brother Diogenes. All the old characters are here--Nora Kelley, Smithback, D'Agosta, Constance Greene, etc., but the spotlight is really on the two brothers. You may think your family has problems, but they're nothing compared to the family relationships and rivalries of the Pendergast family. In this novel, Special Agent Aloysius Prendergast and his younger brother finally reach endgame in their long, convoluted struggle.As usual the, much of the action takes place in the Museum of Natural History, which--also as usual-- is mounting another spectacular but ill-fated exhibit. In order to counteract bad publicity over the theft (and unexpected return) of its diamond collection, the new museum director decides to reopen a long-forgotten exhibit buried in the Museum's subbasement. The refurbishment of this exhibit, an authentic Egyptian tomb, is the background against which much of the action plays out. Needless to say, the lavish opening is a disaster. Meanwhile, Special Agent Pendergast is in jail, having been framed for murder by his brother Diogenes in \\"The Dance of Death.\\" His escape from a maximum security prison forms another major thread in the narrative.Against this background, Preston and Child paint their usual story of thrills, chills, and over-the-top mayhem. These guys really know how to write a good yarn Those who have read their other books will probably notice a certain amount of formula (they seem to have a thing for underground settings and mass stampedes), but the authors manage to reinvigorate it each time around. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is written with intelligence, wit, and enough plot twists to kink any rope. On top of all this, we get to see more of peculiarities of Pendergast's family and what makes the agent tick, including \\"The Event\\" that started Diogenes on his path. This is one of those books that, once you've started, is difficult to put down. Loose ends get tied up, but the authors leave more than enough in play for future go-rounds.A word of caution: Don't read the ending until you get there. Normally, by the time I'm midway through the book, I find that hard to resist. But, on the advice of another reviewer, this time I didn't peek. The wait was worth it. The last sentence is a humdinger."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I must admit that it was a bit slow to start after the exciting finish of the last book, but it became just as nerve-wracking once the story started moving. Not to mention that this one had yet another cliffhanger of an ending! I thought that it would all be over after this one, but though this is a trilogy within the series, it seems that the next book will pick up right where this one abruptly leaves off. I really ended up liking Diogenes' character... I do wonder where this series will go!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I'm not sure what's happening to this franchise, but I want it to stop. First of all, the story depends on a couple of blatantly absurd plot twists and character developments that required me to suspend my disbelief beyond the breaking point, and I just couldn't. Second, and I noticed this in the prequel to Book of the Dead, the books are starting to get bogged down under the weight of their own useless details. Someone's done a lot of research, that is clear, but in some spots this reads like an eighth-grade social studies report -- not one single useless detail on any subject is omitted, whether it's a street map, an exclusive brand name (often so little-known that it conveys nothing to most readers; a simple description of the item would have been both more useful and less pretentious), or the specs of a machine. Also annoying are the \\"conversations\\" about obscure objects or artists that sound as if they were lifted directly from a Wikipedia or encyclopedia entry. Last, I was completely blown away by the Mac notebook ads in here (what else would you call a lengthy paragraph that serves no purpose whatsoever except to recite the virtues of a Mac notebook as opposed to a PC?). Are we at the point where companies can buy ad space in books now?"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"There are positive and negative aspects of this book.Overall this is an interesting book that will entertain you. Most of the characters are well developed with the exception of Agent Pendergast and his protegee. If you have read the two previous book of the trilogy (Brimstone and Dance of Death) maybe that would not be true.However here is the biggest problem of the book. There is no indication that this is a part of a trilogy. I bought this book at the airport before a flight and only after reading the whole book there was an afternote by the authors saying that the book stands alone but it would be better if you read the other two books first. There should be an indication on the front cover about that.The book \\"throws\\" you in the middle of a situation which is enjoyable- I am certain, though, that it would be for more enjoyable if I had read the other two books first. I will not read them now as I know the ending of the story and know the development of the two main characters (Pendergast brothers) and why Diogenes acts the why he does (I will not elaborate as not to spoil the book for the future reader)."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the end of this trilogy and hope the authors continue to write about this cast of characters. I feel like I know them all. I've read and enjoyed other works by Preston and Child, both writing together and individually, and am amazed how much they seem to think as one. Agent Pendergast could become the modern Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I've read every Pendergast book, and Still Life with Crows is by far my favorite. So I tend to measure each book by Still Life. This book, while a lot better than the previous Dance of Death, still doesn't eclipse Still Life. However, it's good for what it is: a fairly predictable and formulaic Pendergast novel. But what's wrong with that? The formula is fun, Pendergast is an intriguing and neat character, and the expanding role of Constance Green is well worth a return trip to whatever Pendergast novel comes next."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another top-notch page-turner from Preston and Child. You'll want to have read at least Dance of Death before reading this one, and you should really have read Cabinet of Curiosities and Brimstone as well. If you've read and enjoyed any of the novels featuring Pendergast, this is a must read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"In Book of the Dead, you have everything you'd expect from these two brilliant authors, a solid, fluid story, great writing and some wonderful twists and turns that will keep you riveted.You'll be tempted to rush through the book and get to the end but if you do, you miss the beautiful play of words, their bold attempt to paint the horror and suspense in the more terrifying scenes.The only complaint I have concerns the board members of the New York Museum of Natural History. You'd think they learn from experience. They are a bunch of imbecilic, dull-witted morons who are drunk with social and political ambitions, at the cost of other people's lives. It almost seems unbelievable that they would make the same mistakes again and again.This is, in my opinion, the best installment of the Pendergast Novels. I'm unsure if it can be treated as a stand-alone but I must say that it is, compared to the earlier books, peerless. The storyline is complex, much like a chess game between two masters who are almost equally matched in their gifts. There is a surprise ending and one I didn't see coming.I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Child or is it Child and Preston? Have done it again. A very satisfying read. Answers a lot of questions and I'm happy to say, still leaves questions. This series is by no means dead. Cant wait for their next books! Oh, and do read other things besides just the Pendergast books, they are awesome writers together or apart."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Reading the first few pages of The Boook of the Dead was like slipping on a pair of comfortable old shoes. It was as if no time at all had passed since last year's Dance of Death, to which this is the third in a trilogy that began with Brimstone. Despite what Harriet Klausner says, this book is not to be read as a stand-alone, a fact to which Preston and Child allude about as strongly as their publisher would allow (so as not to negatively impact sales) in their closing comments.By the end of the book the authors have, as expected, tied up all the loose ends (well, they did leave one or two dangling, pun intended) with Pendergast, Vinnie and Laura, Smithback and Nora, Margo, Menzies, and of course, Diogenes. Like all their books, the pacing is fast, the writing crisp and easy, and as usual the book is difficult to put down. I read it in two days while on vacation at the beach.I laughed out loud with pleasure at the end of chapter 3 when the identity of the suspected biohazard delivered to the museum in chapter 1 was revealed. There is a lot to enjoy here. But as this was the final book in the Pendergast-Diogenes trilogy, some of the suspense was lost as the final outcome was more or less pre-ordained. Thus only 4 stars not 5. Nevertheless, Diogenes still managed to come up with his share of perfidious and insanely clever evil deeds.A must read for all Preston-Child fans, but not the one to start with."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"So the Pendergast vs Diogenes saga comes to a close, as all good things must. And with that said and done, I have to say that either my expectations were way too high or the last two books just weren't as good as I'd hoped them to be!The cast of Book of Dead is large, almost everyone who was in Dance of Death. Sometimes the direction of the story gets lost in jumping around from character to character. And the pace isn't as breakneck as Dance of Death or even Brimstone. The book has a lot of potential and some great scenes but at times it was just plodding along, not really going anywhere, telling some interesting side-stories, but not really doing anything. It felt a lot like material we'd tread before: a museum show that you know is going to go horribly wrong! The Egyptian stuff is interesting but... nothing felt really fresh until the last 50 pages or so (and I'm not going to tell you what it is because I hate spoilers and I know when you get to it you'll know what I'm talking about)!The Pendergast novels have always been about a crime that seems like it could be supernatural but... That's what they are: great mysteries with great characters and great ideas. But the last two just haven't been that... mysterious.I love these writers. I will keep reading their books. Even with an okay book, they still are ten times better than some of the crappy writers out there. But they just haven't been up to their game. Brimstone, Relic, Cabinet of Curiosities... these were amazing Pendergast books! Dance of Death and Book of the Dead were just good. As I said before maybe my expectations were too high but when you are going to pit one of the best detective characters in recent literature against his \\"Mycroft-gone-bad\\" brother, I kind of expect... beyond amazing."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another weekend trashed thanks to the addictive storytelling of the Preston/Childs team. Like all of the Pendergast novels, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is pretty much impossible to put down, showing again that an assignment at the New York Museum of Natural History may be the most dangerous job this side of Baghdad.\\"Dead\\" neatly wraps up the trilogy preceded by \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of the Dead\\", tying up the loose ends and flying through cliffhanger after (literal) cliffhanger. The redoubtable Special Agent Pendergast spends the first few hundred pages cooling his heels in an upstate New York maximum-security federal prison, but that by no means diminishes the mystique of Preston/Child's bizarrely original superhero. And Pendergast's deliciously preposterous escape from prison is an entertainment masterpiece, making Tom Cruise's \\"impossible missions\\" look like addition tables.The story: the museum's priceless collection of diamonds, stolen by Pendergast's evil brother in the previous installment, is recovered - sort of. As a deflection, the museum decides to reopen to the public an Egyptian tomb bricked over since the 30s. In preparations for the gala celebrating the tomb's opening, people start disappearing or turning up dead, reviving old stories of mummy's curses and decades-old cover-ups. Meanwhile, the devious brother Diogenes is causing mischief while the familiar cast of Nora Kelly, Bill Smithback, and NYPD's Lt. Vincent D'Agosta, and Capt. Laura Hayward are on the case, rolling along to not one but two white-knuckled climaxes. One word of warning: \\"The Book of the Dead\\" will probably not read well as a standalone. Best to tackle \\"Brimston\\" and \\"Dance\\" first.If like me you're a Preston Child fan, you know that this is pure adrenaline, not literature - James Bond, Laura Croft, and Indiana Jones rolled up into an extravaganza of action, thrills, suspense, and fantasy. Those expecting an education in Egyptology or the mysteries of the real \\"Book of the Dead\\" may be disappointed, but for pure fun, this is the ultimate summer read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I love the Pendergast books, and I have read them all. I still say the best was either Relic or Reliquary, then Dance of Death. This book and Brimestone probably come next and then Cabinet of Curiosities and finally still life with crows, which isnt bad at all. This was a great book, and it does a lot to explain Pendergast's past, but I dont really like the climax (Which I cant say here because it is somewhat surprising.) It does end on a strange cliffhanger however and it was very enjoyable, featuring many of the same elements as Relic and Dance of Death. I deffinatly recomend reading this, but read the series in sequential order (Relic, Relquary, Cabinet, Still life, Brimestone, Dance, and then this) They are all good."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Like all of the Preston/Child novels, The Book of the Dead moves at a lightening pace. Carried along by the plotting and the planning, the believable and not so believable events, a reader is left wondering will good (in the form of Aloysius Pendergast) overcome evil (in the form of his brother Diogenes)?There are a number of twists and turns along the way. And a number of loose ends (from earlier novels) are tied together as well. While this novel can be read and enjoyed as a standalone, I think that for dedicated Pendergast fans (of whom I am one), it is best read after 'Brimstone' and 'The Dance of Death'.FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast has joined my select group of fictional heroes.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Enjoyed this but wasn't all that impressed with the story line. Oftentimes, I felt myself nodding off in sections. All said and done though, it was an enjoyable read.

I did enjoy Brimstone, I felt it was alot of story backed into a good novel, with an ending that opened up the Dionesis charactor. Then Dance of Death continued the fued between the the Predergast brothers, this was a good novel. But Dance of Death lacked a few element. For one it took too long to get to the prison sequence, we were half way through the novel before anything happens, second the conclusion was summed up too quickly. I did enjoy it more that most novels, but I was not the biggest fan of this outing. I miss the novels like Riptide and Ice Limit."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"It's an extension from Relic, so you should read that book 1st. Some slow portions and several characters were not well developed, but still a good read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The New York Museum of Natural History is awashed in controversy: it's reknowned collection of diamonds was stolen...and has just turned up, smashed to bits. To save face, the Museum accepts a grant to open an old, forgotten exhibit--The Tomb of Senef. It will be the biggest night of the year, and will put the Museum back on the right track.Or, at least, that is the intent. But Diogenes Pendergast, a brilliant and frighteningly crafty criminal mastermind, has a secret agenda of his own. And the only man who can stop him, his FBI Special Agent brother Aloysious, is locked away in a federal prison for crimes Diogenes committed. As time slowly runs out, Special Agent Pendergast and company must soon face the fact that they will not be able stop Diogenes's perfect crime...Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are both, in many ways, like their famed hero, Special Agent Pendergast: they are careful, crafty, subtle, charming, and entirely unpredictable. They have proved this throughout all of their novels (the Pendergast tales and the stand-alones), and \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is no exception--may, in fact, be the perfect culmination of their talents. Considering this may in fact be Pendergast's last tale (true, there is somewhat of a cliffhanger ending, but it's just like these guys to leave us hanging), it's rather appropriate that \\"Book\\" may be one of their best yet. Special Agent Pendergast is certainly the most interesting hero in modern literature (arguably the most interesting since Sherlock Holmes), and his younger brother Diogenes (who first appeared in \\"Dead's\\" immediate predecessors, \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\") is quite possibly the most chilling villain I have yet encountered.For longtime Preston/Child fans such as myself, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is a pure delight, bringing together characters from most of their previous novels (\\"Mount Dragon\\" and \\"Riptide\\" are the two exceptions, I believe), and introducting new interesting ones. New fans might want to read \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" first; it's not entirely necessary, but it certainly helps (heck, just read all of their novels; all of 'em are top-notch thrillers). Whether you've been reading these guys since they first came out, or have just recently found out how great they are, you can't deny the fact that their novels feature first-rate suspense in a well-written, fully thought out manner; these are intelligent thrillers, novels that have a pulse all their own. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is simply another great novel by two of today's best writers."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This book opens with a bow to current events: a suspiciously leaky package shows up the museum . . . sending employees into hazmat hysteria. (SPOILER) The museum's diamond collection (stolen in the previous book-- DANCE OF DEATH) has been returned but certainly . . . in no condition to be in an exhibit. And it only gets better and better after that.Its just non-stop thrills. The Museum has been in the publicity pits lately. (You really have to DANCE OF DEATH first to understand why Aloysius is in maximum security prison and Diogenes isn't, why the museum is in trouble, why D'Agosta--a police detective is close to losing his job, and there's that mysterious Constance Green . . . )Anyway, there's several subplots going on. But the main one happens in the museum itself. There's a huge donation but it has attached a condition to the use of the money. They have to re-open an Egyptian tomb exhibit that was bricked up in the thirties. (I'm a little disappointed that they didn't really say why THE TOMB OF SENEF was closed. There were tantalizing hints but it wasn't pursued. Maybe that's another book.)Then there's the Gordian rescue/escape operation of Aloysius Pendergast. (I actually found this to be the best part of the book so I didn't mind that he didn't get out of Herkmoor Penetentiary till page 260 or thereabouts.)An ingenious, intricate and unbelievable prisonbreak . . . with shades of Silence of the Lambs. Courtesy of Eli Glinn, Master Engineer and who appears in ICE LIMIT (another Preston/Child book which I also recommend Highly!!!!).Then there's Diogenes who appears in the book in several guises. But which?? There's also his most peculiar & diabolical courtship of Constance Green wherein we are introduced to the members of the Pendergrast family . . . through the ages!(It would be great if Preston and Child write more books about the Pendergast ancestors who seem to be mad geniuses of one stripe or another.)There's more of Diogenes in this book. Which is good because he holds the same fascination for me as other literary villains like Hannibal Lecter . . . for example. And we also find out what is probably the root cause of Diogenes' psychosis.The race to stop Diogenes plan (on national TV no less) from bearing mad fruit is exciting and at some points, even morbidly funny! Note the nitroglycerin scene.The ending was a bit odd. And it happens all over Italy which is a lot to cram in 100 pages or so. I would have like a final denouement between Aloysius and Diogenes. But that doesn't happen.Just a few minor quibbles. I give this a 4.5!And looking forward to more of Pendergast!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of the Dead is the third in a trilogy of books. I wish I had read the preceding two books in the series, in order to understand what was going on in this one. For example, there were references to a diamond heist at the start of The Book of the Dead, and Aloysius Pendergast is in jail for murders he did not commit.The book opens with the arrival at the Museum of Natural History in New York a mysterious package, filled with some kind of dust. It turns out that this dust is in fact the stolen diamonds, ground down into powder. Added on top of the mystery is a mysterious benefactor to the museum, who offers money to the museum if they open the Tomb of Senef, the tomb of a grand vizier that was closed and put into storage in the 1930s. The night of the opening is coordinated by Nora Kelly, assisted by an Egyptologist specially brought in for the event.The ancient Egyptians believed so strongly in curses that a simple message above the door to one of the tombs was a deterrent to potential robbers. Modern-day Americans, of course, don't believe in those old curses; but awfully strange things begin to occur. There are two ghastly, brutal murders, and two other characters seem posessed by demons.The story follows Pendergast's escape from jail, as well as the story of his brother, who stole the jewels from the museum in the first place. The brothers are diametrically opposite; Aloysius is the ex-FBI agent trying to prove that he didn't commit the murders, and his brother is working hard to prove that Aloysius is evil and guilty of some wrong. We of course know right from the very beginning who is the \\"good guy,\\" but the way the story plays itself is interesting to the extreme.The only flaw I can think of in this book is the character of Smithback, the journalist. Always on the lookout for a good story, he seems to figure out the clues to the mystery just a little too fast. But otherwise, this was a gripping book, one that I spent only two days reading because I thought it was so good."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"\\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" is probably the only clich&eacute; the authors missed.This book is a ponderous mash of clich&eacute;s you've seen dozens of time in \`B' sci-fi flicks and cheesy slasher movies.The characters are colorless props, unbelievable and lacking in sympathetic qualities. Some of the plot elements are laughable. The pace is slow. I sometimes found myself rooting for Mycroft, er I mean Diogenes, to kill 'em all.I had read and enjoyed Tyrannosaur Canyon; Cabinet of Curiosities was OK. I had also read the first 2 books of this trilogy. So, I wanted to finish this book, awful as it is. Eventually I got through it by creating a theater in my mind with Joel, Tom Servo and Crow Robot from \`MST3K' sitting down front, making fun of the inanity that reeled across the screen. Push the button, Frank."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The book in no way let the reader know that it was the third book in a trilogy. Even though it seemed it was written for people to just pick up and get into, it was difficult to find any relatable qualities to the characters. I was very upset with this book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"As a big fan of Preston/Child, I was looking forward to reading this book. I wish I had not. After savoring so many previous efforts, \\"Book of the Dead\\" is like reading a bad novel by an acolyte author. It is everything previous Preston/Child novels are not - predictable, formulaic and uninspired. Sure, there are occasional flashes of technical and storytelling brilliance, but they are few and far between. I suspect this gifted writing duo was pressured into writing faster than they prefer, were too busy doing other things, or have grown weary of their characters. Let's hope future books return to the suspense, subtlety and craftsmanship for which Preston/Child are rightly praised."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I am not one to write book reviews, typically, although I do a lot of reading. However, I felt strongly enough after reading this book that I figured I'd give it a shot.To give you an idea of my experience with Preston/Child: I have gone back and read every book released by these authors, after I was hooked on the first one I read (The Ice Limit). One of the things that attracted me to this duo in the first place was their attention to detail, and the ability to craft an excellent, intelligent story that would stick with you after you closed the last page. In addition to The Ice Limit, exemplar works in this style were their first book (Relic),Thunderhead, andThe Cabinet of Curiosities.Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I started reading Preston/Child _before_ they started this trilogy. In my opinion, Brimstone went _way_ downhill vis-a-vis their previous books. Don't get me wrong, I liked Brimstone, but it read much more like a Rollins thriller than the typical Preston/Child storytelling.Fast forward to Book of the Dead, which is a _great_ return to their roots. It's obvious Preston/Child love archeology and ancient history, and their mastery at weaving these elements into the story makes this a much better and more satisfying story than in the previous two books in this trilogy.That said, I do have some complaints (spoiler warning). I was disappointed in the last 1/3 of the story - Diogenes' \\"evil genius\\" plan was way below expectations, and the ensuing globe-trotting chase didn't have the detail or intimate knowledge of the geography involved that I would have expected.As other reviewers have mentioned, the pace _is_ slower than the previous two books - but this is a good thing! This is what sets Preston and Child apart from the shoot-em-up drivel that haunts many top seller lists these days. If you're an intelligent reader, and enjoy well-written and detailed suspense novels, I would suggest starting with their earlier works before reading this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another great book by two fine authors.What more can I say.I have every book these authors have written.They are all well worth reading.Mystery and adventure in a high tech and/or old world manor.You can't put the books down.Sincerly,Jack Barnes"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Once again, Preston and Child deliver the goods.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I have to admit, this was better than the last one, and probably as good as the first one. This book was better written and easy to understand. The only criticism I have is the romance, especially between Margo Green and Smithback seems forced. I understand that it is not a romance novel, but why throw it in there if it is not going to be smooth and believable. Anyway, I do love the fact that everything is explained (although I am not sure I still understance WHAT Constance Green is....really), but the rest is. I now know why Diogenes hates Aloysius (although it is silly) and I am glad that D'Agosta and Lieutenant Hayward worked it out. Now that I am writing this review, there were a FEW things that I didn't like....I really didn't understand why Diogenes picked on the poor curator for the magazine, and why no one suspected who he really was. However, I thought it clever the whole \\"reopening\\" of the exhibit to commit the ultimate crime. There were some good parts (Constance goes Rambo) and some not so great parts (Constance preggers), but I am not sure if I would read another in the sequel. I would rather the images of Constance telling her fate; Diogenes' appearing to shall we say \\"meet his fate\\"; a budding romance between Pendergast and Constance (although he mentions some foolishness about a monetary to get his thoughts together); and the rekindling of romance between Hayward and D'Agosta linger in my mind with old Eli Glinn and Pendergasts' sidekick backing them all up. Hopefully this is it, but with the cliff hanger, who knows. Uh...I thought I said one criticism, I guess it may have been more than one, but I enjoyed the novel. LOL"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Book of the Dead comes on the heels of Dance of Death. There is some resolution here for readers who have been following the Diogenes/Aloysius relationship, but the \\"Event\\" from childhood and Diogenes' \\"perfect crime\\" are both contrived, simplistic, and even childish compared to the usual Preston/Child high-tech scariness. Drop foot? You can do better than that! I was really disappointed in this aspect of Book of the Dead, but there are other thrilling sequences that almost make up for it.I am curious if other readers find the marriage of Nora Kelly to William Smithback to be an odd coupling? There is no chemistry here--Smithback is portrayed as an egotistical, self-serving, insensitive journalist--not sure what Nora sees in him, nor he in her, for that matter. Either Nora needs to move on or Smithback's character needs a lot of development and growth. Romantic relationships generally aren't addressed very well in Preston/Child novels. Regardless of some weaknesses, Book of the Dead is recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The final chapter to the \\"war\\" between brothers, a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax.

Preston and Child tied up the family epic perfectly. Somehow though I do not think we have heard the last of Diogenes. The storyline was artfully told and maintained the reader's interest by being believable. Great pains were taken to make sure that \\"everything fit\\" and that the little things were as accurate as possible. The prison escape rivals the \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" or the \\"Great Escape\\" in cunning. Although I like and have visited many times The Museum of Natural History, I think that Preston and Child have just about exhausted that location for a storyline. Agent Pendergast is terrific but Lieutenant D'Agosta is my personal favorite and I hope he is developed more in future stories. Riptide and Thunderhead have shown that these two writers can expand there genre to new and exciting locations.

Some might say that would have to be poetry, others might say it has to be a classic tale that is a pure expression of fine grammar and intellectual genius... what those books are? I dont know... and I probably never will, either.My point, is to state, that without stepping on the toes of those people out there with their nose in the air for works of less than historic truth, or cultural facts, i can say this book (along with the previous duo in the trilogy) was one of the most entertaining reads of my life. There was a lot more mystery to the characters than i would have hoped for (things like constance greene and some of the other people in the storyline) but considering Constance is somewhat of a main character, and the Cabinet Of Curiosities is supposedly the cure to the unknown about her, there really has been some exposure to her past and whatnot.But aside from the lack of background that i would have liked to learn more of, the books were great. Lots of twists in the plot, somewhat gorey and goulish, but also had some sex appeal in it. All-in-all, it was very entertaining, had lots of culture (whether it be fact, or fiction) and it kept you wanting more... i spent all my free time working on finishing these books, and I must say, all in all, it was worth it. Somehow, i feel the door was blown open for another sequel to the story, yet i heard so much to contradict that theory before buying... i heard this was closure... no more anything... kinda sad, seeing as how you can get attached to the characters... but still, the fact that there could be another sequel, kind of upset me... i dont like waiting, im not a patient person, and that kind of upset me a bit. But thats probably the only negative thing I can really say about the series, and even that.. is just a personal perception. Have fun reading, just make sure you buy the other 2 books...

It's not worth the paperback price."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"After stumbling over a weak and silly plot in Brimstone, the authors recovered nicely in Dance of Death, and now has brought the trilogy home to an-almost flawless conclusion in Book of the Dead. From the moment Pendergast busted out of Herkmoor prison, this fantastic and horrifying tale held me enthralled. The book features wild action, the \\"gotta-love-him\\" journalist Smithback, interesting tidbits involving Egyptology, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and plenty of fun technical information (dynamite, anyone?). I could not put this book down and read it over two days (\\"sorry, honey, the dishes aren't done and nothing's cooking on the stove\\"). Note: this novel is not \\"stand-alone\\"; start with Cabinet of Curiosities, Brimstone, and Dance of Death. Book of the Dead is definitely my favorite in the Pendergast series.Nevertheless, the book sagged in some points. (1) The opening gala museum story is a retread, and after what happened in previous books, you'd think no New Yorker with a lick of sense would ever attend one again. (2) Despite the tension between Diogenes and Pendergast building over three books, Pendergast was inexplicably relegated to bystander in the final face-off. (3) The reason given for Diogenes hating his brother seemed too soft to cause a lifetime of homicidal psychosis. Granted the Event itself scarred young D in more ways than one, but his brother's role in it seemed relatively benign. (4) A sheltered, nervous woman suddenly morphs into a commando in the final chapters, capable of tracking a diabolical villain halfway around the world in two days. Even allowing for \\"hell hath no fury...\\" it was too big of a stretch to believe that she could expertly ambush him on a city street or start blowing bullets into his bay windows. (5) The closing sentence was pitifully soap-opera-ish. Please tell me this isn't the direction the authors are going to head the series in. Just the thought of this extraordinary, super-cool FBI agent reduced to a homebody with a baby sucking on his shoelaces makes me want to reach for the Advil. How disappointing that P&C; managed the novel's multiple gut-wrenching ordeals with the finesse of a slick juggling act only to drop the ball on the reader's toe in the final page.Despite the weaknesses, I'm addicted and when the next Pendergast novel comes out, I'll be first in line. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Read the other books first. That is sound advice repeated through these reviews. This story is interesting and brings a lot of old friends from previous books together for a jolly romp through the dark recesses of a supposedly cursed tomb. Are there any that aren't? You will enjoy it much more if you are familiar with the characters. I have grown fond of them and enjoyed, for the most part, seeing them in action again.One of the joys of Lincoln and Child's earlier books is that you always came away with knowledge of some arcane subject. They are educational and more readable as a result. This one was not so edifying, but rounded out the series nicely.There were some plot holes. The 'Event' a life changing childhood experience of cosmic proportions, is pretty lame when you finally find out the circumstances. This 'Event' is pivotal in the development of the two main protagonists, one an almost saintly cross between Sherlock Holmes and 007. And his evil brother, brilliant monster, part Hannibal Lecter, part Moriarty. As children they discover a box that someone thoughtfully stored in the cellar, 'fully loaded' as it were. Not wishing to spoil anything, suffice to say that it is a stretch to think that anyone would want to keep their mad old uncle Comstock's, gaudily painted, suicide machine in the cellar. But parents who name their children Diogenes and Aloysius are probably questionable anyway.As with previous works, the Museum of natural history in NYC is the backdrop for most of the story.The Museum and a grand gathering of glittering celebrities has been worked to death in this series. There must be a fresher vehicle for the action than retreading the dusty halls of this fine old institution.Hopefully the series will continue, these books are always welcome diversions and the few suspensions of disbelief are worth it for the overall adventure. Read the earlier works, then enjoy the Book of the Dead."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Although the pacing was a little slow in some parts, especially those dealing wtih Pendergast getting out of prison, all told I liked how the authors put this book together.Book of the Dead has all the usual elements in this series, fast action, interesting story and setting, and mostly likable characters. But what I liked most was that, for once, the ending was not too crazy or involving, as literary types sometimes say, deus ex machina. There were some things that were far-fetched, like Constance being able to track down Diogenes as well as she did, that were not adequately explained, but Ive come to expect that.Overall, I was satisfied with the story and enjoyed my time reading it. I was about ready to toss in the towel on this series after several ridiculous plot-twists in earlier books, but this one has brought me back to the fold. I look forward to reading more novels involving Agent Pendergast, one of the more intriguing characters in fiction."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Child finish what they started two books ago in \\"Brimstone\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" with \\"The Book of the Dead\\". As in the previous novels, protagionist Aloysius Pendergast is faced with his greatest challenge which is found in the form of his younger brother Diongenes. Diongenes is bent upon revenge against his brother for perceived ills and abuse that were heaped upon him during his childhood. These \\"abuses\\" are finally brought to the surface in \\"the Book of the Dead\\".All of the familiar characters from the earlier books (Nora Kelly, William Smithback, Margo Green, and of course, Lt. Vincent D'Agosta) are all present and play important roles in this novel. The setting is once again the (beleaguered) Museum of Natural History in New York. (site of many P & C novels, by the way)A long forgotten Egyptian exhibit is reopened thanks to the generous donation of little-known benefactor. Nora Kelly is put in charge of the reopening of the exhibit which is designed to restore some of the luster lost by the Museum because of the numerous tragedies that had occured there in earlier P & C books. Diogenes, of course, is behind all of this and tries to use the exhibit and its publicity as the means to \\"repay\\" his brother so that all of the world can see. Pendergast must first find some way to escape from a Federal Penetentiary before he can stop his brother. The last half of the book highlights this battle between brothers.P & C do their usual great job establishing the plot and quickly moving it forward. Their books always hit the ground running from page 1. While it takes a little longer to gain momentum than some earlier Pendergast novels, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" is a satisfying read that will appeal to all P & C fans. And, as is the case with many of the Pendergast novels, the last few pages leave a number of unanswered questions and quite a few open doors for new stories.I do agree with some of the earlier reviewers who stated that readers interested in this trilogy should definitely read them in order. There are just enough character development items and important plot details that one would not pick up on if he or she didn't read the books in progression.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I really enjoy the way these guys write.

Would have liked it to stay on a few of the plot-lines longer. The parts about the jail-break and ending held together very well. I'm hopeful the Pendergast brother battle is now laid to rest so they can now do some more Aloysious books that focus on supernatural crime, detective work, etc. All in all, a great read (but not as good as \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" or \\"Still Life With Crows\\")."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Ever since I finished \\"Dance of Death,\\" I have been waiting for this book to come out so I could find out Agent Pendergast's fate and hopefully learn the answers to so many of the questions that book brought up. With \\"Book of the Dead,\\" Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child do not fail to answer all of these questions, but also to provide one of the best fiction books I've read.I was introduced to Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child with \\"Relic,\\" which is the first book in their informal \\"museum murders\\" series and the introduction to Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast, who \\"Book of the Dead\\" focuses on. If you're considering buying this book, you should at the very least have read the prequel, \\"Dance of Death.\\" Without it, you will really be lacking most of the background knowledge necessary to enjoy this book. These two books are more of a single story split into two, and I don't see how anyone can read this as a standalone. If you really want to get to know the many characters featured here, below is the following order you should read their books in:\\"Relic\\"\\"Reliquary\\"\\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\"\\"Still Life with Crows\\"\\"Thunderhead\\"\\"Brimstone\\"\\"Dance of Death\\"I will have to say that \\"Book\\" was not as exciting as \\"Dance,\\" despite being the climax to the Pendergast Trilogy. Part of the reason for that I think is because Diogenes Pendergast is given a lot more exposure and is shown of as more of a flawed character than he was in \\"Dance,\\" which takes a lot of the mystery out of it. Preston and Child do divulge the incident that caused Diogenes to hate his brother so much, which I found fairly interesting but think they could have come up with a better excuse. Margo Green has only a few pages devoted to her, and the relationship between D'Agosta and Heyward takes a backseat. The book strays somewhat from previous novels, which focused on describing a different character each chapter. This would become very frustrating as one chapter would end and the reader would have to wait 50 pages to pickup with that character again. This book just flows more easily and keeps your interest regardless of who the chapter is about. The main focus of the book is on the Pendergasts, Constance, and Nora Kelly. Agent Pendergast's prison break was ingenious and just put me more in awe of his character.In summary, Preston and Child have done an excellent job creating a thrilling suspense tale, as well as tying up so many loose ends from previous novels and answering many questions the readers have. I think could have had a slightly better climax, but overall I'm satisfied with it and just hope they keep collaborating and producing more stories around these people."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of the Dead was a good book, it was slow up until about the middle.. then it became a page turner. I hadn't read the previous two books in the trilogy, and after reading this one, which most people say is the best, i dont think i'll waste my time on them. All in all this was a good book, but not a great one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Masterful - I don't know what more to say. This is the third book of a trilogy involving agent Pendergast and I think the 7th book in total - in which he has been a main character. Excepting, Still Life With Crows (which I didnt like), I have read and re-read each and every one of these. Preston and Douglas have honed their storytelling skills and are able to provide some incredible reads. This is clearly one of them."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"If you want to maximize your enjoyment of this book, read Brimstone and Dance of Death first, and maybe even Relic and the Cabinet of Curiosities, to get used to the cast of characters in The Book of the Dead. By the time I read this one, I was already emotionally invested in the cast of recurring characters (Pendergast, of course, D'Agosta, Nora+Bill, Margo Green, Constance Greene, and Laura Hayward), so it was a nailbiter for me from start to finish.However, that's not the only reason this is an excellent thriller. In the previous books, there were often subplots that weren't very interesting or weren't important to the main plot. It was distracting sometimes and slowed the book down. Not so with The Book of the Dead. It is deftly plotted and detailed, but not boring. Pretty much every chapter ties in with the main plot (discovering Diogene's plan and stopping it) and moves it along quickly. I also liked that the master plan was actually very believable (just think Pokemon) and awesomely ironic. Also, seeing a whole other side to Agent Pendergast.The important thing is, The Book of the Dead is tremendously exciting and just plain fun. Just when you think it's over, you find out the authors have more surprises up their sleeves. Which is a good thing, because I didn't want the book to end. This is my favorite Preston/Child novel so far (of which I've read 6), for the reasons above. It's not a monster book or nature vs. man book; the characters rely on their wits and are driven by honor, friendship, and vengeance, feelings very human and relatable. This is a thriller that doesn't let up on the action, but also takes time to let us get to know, and get close to, its characters."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston/Child books are somewhat evil: you buy them and... you're done reading the whole thing the night after the purchase. Their Pendergast stories are quite a page-turners. One thing that started to bother me though is that with every new book they keep repeating the same stuff over and over again. Not to mention that the whole Viola plot is just downright ridiculous. Personally, I still think that The cabinet of curiosities was the best Pendergast book, but I will definitely go and grab the Wheel of Darkness as soon as I can. Addiction is a hard thing to fight:)"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The previous two installments of the Pendergast-Bros Trilogy had been found wanting - in both originality and density. The basic story did not seem to hold much substance and, thus, repeated dilutions and page-fluffing elongated a one-book story into a Trilogy.However, this is indeed the best of the three. If not for anything but for the culmination of the story and the tidying of loose ends.Of course this is not saying much: the can surely write; they can surely keep building the tension of a thriller without ever loosing their rhythm - but, let's face it: how many times are they going to redo THE RELIC? The Museum is so overused, every time they mention it we know someone is bound to get killed in some long-forgotten subbasement...Let's hope they decide to do the long awaited sequel to THE ICE LIMIT they left unfinished.PS:***SPOILER***Odds are we are not done with Diogenes...Not very imaginative (temporary) demise either: Arthur Conan Doyle had used it with Professor Moriarty and they are called \\"hidden cliffhangers\\" since."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I think this is the best of the books running from 'Crows' on. This book didn't drag in any chapters, and the old Pendergast reappeared where he was missing somewhat in Brimstone and Dance of Death. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Book of the Dead is a perfect ending to a great triolgy of books, the started with Brimstone and Dance of Death. I highly recommend reading those before starting this one, each book basically continues from where the previous one left off in a cliffhanger fashion. The Book of the Dead continues with Pendergast battling his evil brother Diogenes, and it continues to be compelling. Dance of Death was probably more exciting than this book, but I found this book to just be more interesting. It reveals alot about the characters, and you learn more about a certain girl who is shrouded in mystery. She plays a pivotal role in this book, and it ends in a bang. You honestly can't go wrong with these books, they once again show why they are the masters of mystery."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I have been a huge fan of the dynamic duo of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Every novel written by this duo is way above the average beach/summer read and even better than most of the techno-thrillers in terms of believability. But ever since the Pendargast trilogy began to unfurl, I have grown restless because despite being a die-hard fan of Special Agent Aloysius Pendargast, I longed for return to the \\"Relic\\" era, when Pendargast was one of the major force behind the novel, not the only novel, as has been in the last three works. Most importantly, I thought that maybe this work would round-off this \\"family affair\\", but the last sentence of the novel obliterated that hope. Neverthless, this book is essential for all Preston-Child fans, esp. those who have read the \\"Dance of Death\\". Enjoy it, maybe with that small misgiving."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I like the way Doug and Lincoln completed the series. They added all the good elements I like in their novels including a creepy museum atmosphere and a mystery of who or what was driving people crazy. Was it a curse? A chemical? A disease? My only complaint was that there was no icky bug, but the story was good enough that it wasn't needed. I think they did an outstanding job of tying up loose ends and bringing the story to an exciting conclusion. And, some things I suspected turned out like I thought but there were a few surprises too.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Childs wrap up the \\"Pendergast trilogy\\" with an addictive novel that shows all their strengths: complex plotting; interesting people and backgrounds; and, a rare gift, the ability to layer in fascinating detail without slowing the pace of the story.As a science and history writer, I know something about the effort that good research demands, and the work diplayed here makes my head hurt just thinking about it. From the look of exotic locales to the details of making your own explosives, there is something for every reader to learn here while enjoying the well-paced, absorbing story.There are always quibbles. I would have preferred that Agent Pendergast's brother/adversary, Diogenes, meet an unambigious death rather than a \\"fell-over-the-cliff\\" demise that reminds me of Sherlock Holmes' plunge over the falls. And when the museum was setting up for its big gala, I kept waiting for some character to object, reminding everyone how terrible things went the last time they threw a big gala (in the novel Relic).These are minor objections, though. When I started this novel, I was literally unable to put it down until it was done. Preston and Childs have indeed done it again."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"If you're a Preston & Child fan, you will be hooked from page one. If it's your first P & C, hummm I don't know...."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The excitement continues in the last installment of the Pendergast Trilogy . However, don't think this is the final installment,,,,the authors leave the reader with a blockbuster of an ending that will keep you counting the days until the next release . This novel has it all : plot twists, attempted jail breaks, and seemingly hopeless cliffhangers . Personally, I literally couldn't put this novel down until I was more than three quarters of the way through . The action and excitement are non-stop ."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This has been a fine series of books! Hopefully, as the end indicates there will be another! This writing team is VERY entertaining!

I'd read Preston's Tyrannosaur Canyon and loved it so i thought i'd give this a try since i love Egyptian themes as well but I can't say I was all that impressed. First off the title is misleading, because i can't remember even one point in the book where the mention \\"The book of the dead\\" its nonexistent in this book, but still revolves around the opening of a pharaohs tomb. The book was suspenceful and there were a lot of parts i really enjoyed, but i felt the explanation for motives and events that were really hyped up throughout the book had sort of weak explanations, and the ending wasn't too thrilling. It's not an awful book, but I can't say i came away in awe."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is the last installment of the trilogy following Brimstone and Dance of Death. The books are about FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast battling his evil brother Diogenes. I was a big fan of the agent Pendergast character, particularly in the earlier Cabinet of Curiosities, but this trilogy didn't excite me as much. The last book wraps up the story in a satisfying manner, but there was really no mystery or intrigue. However, it was not boring either. For example, agent Pendergast's escape from prison was most entertaining, but the outcome was never in doubt.There was also no supernatural element to the story, as there was in many of Preston/Child's earlier novels. There is no historical intrigue, no new characters introduced, and no plot twists. We are merely observers watching a linear story unfold, the outcome of which is known from the beginning. I was hoping that this would be the end of the Pendergast stories, but the book ending hints that there are more to come.To be fair, this book is fun to read and I blew through it in a couple of days, but Preston/Child have done much better in the past. I hope that their next collaboration involves all new characters and settings. After all, how many more people can die in the New York Museum of Natural Histrory before they shut it down?!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I bought this book on the way home from our memorial Day weekend and finished it in two days!

I was duped on this one - and by many of the reviews written here and on another big book site! I should NOT have listened!This book is nothing but B-movie schlock on paper. Poor plot, poor characterizations, extremely unrealistic settings. It reminded me of something on Cinemax at 4am. Do yourself a favor: Watch that instead."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The cover is deceiving. Looks to be about the ancient Bood of the Dead which the Egyptians of 900-600 BC used for their religious rituals. The English version came out in 1895 of the Papyrus of Ani found in the tomb of pharaoh Ramses, whose ceiling was decorated with astronomical scenes. It is the collection of prayers, spells and rituals for the after life th Egyptians of antiquity believed in, worshiping the God Osiris.Along the vein of Shakespear's tragedies, the antagonist is aptly named Diogenes after the philosopher who influenced Will with his cynical attitude toward life, not death. Being demonic in this story and a criminal of first class, he challenges his FBI agent brother Aloysius to a duel of wits. If you read 'Relic' and 'Dance of Death' then you know all the background of these two and the trouble they have endured. Diogenes had stolen some diamonds from the New York Museum of Natural History and returns them grown into dust, for ashes of the dead.This Egyptology story is based in the underground tomb of Senef which had been a popular exhibit at the museum until the 1930s when it was suddenly closed amid rumors of unnatural occurrences. Now it is about to be reopened, and we find Aloysius as a prisoner in the dungeons of a maximum prison. Sounds more like England, Scotland, or wherever they have dungeons, not New York in America. We are aware of the lower reaches in some of the churches there, but a museum sounds suspicious. Oh well. It is an interesting read, especially for the fans of the authors Preston and Child (I like his first name Lincoln). But I am an unbeliever in life after death. It was not as compelling as Elizabeth Peter's novels about the tombs along the Nile and the Puramids of Egypt. Now, that's more my style."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The alternate title of this book should have been \\"HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS\\".An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The other reviewers will tell you about the book. I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read. What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism. I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published. I guess most people will sell their souls for money. Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments). The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men. The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters. This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.So this is just a warning. If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The characters come out of late-night television dramas. The plot requires suspension of reality to the point where paranoid quasi-paranormal drama is normal. Um... the progress of the book is well-paced, it's super easy to read, and it's moderately distracting from whatever dental surgery you may be undergoing at the time. However, it's designed for people who move slowly because they have tiny brains. The plot is obvious and easily guessable. The characters require incredulity to accept. Every three paragraphs, when you begin to think you're reading a comic book, they spout off some Internet research about a technology or Egypt. I have read books this bad before but they weren't best sellers. I would only recommend this to people with a fear of polysyllabic language."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Do not read this book unless you plan on being immobile for a while.

This is one of the better books, since you can read any in the series at any point to get \\"hooked\\". This one deals with the New York Natural History Library and the fact that there is so much stuff in it that entire exhibits can be there and be lost. That alone is so much food for the imiagination to run wild with! It is well worth the read, but write your name in the book so hopefully you will get it back - you will want to reread!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"apparently it is very easy. Don't bother, this book should be marketed to young readers. It started off better than it ended, which is worst than startng off slow and building. Totaly unbelievable, unimaginitive and well, which means its pretty boring and predictable. Its a 1 1/2 stars at best. A mysterious benefactor, a magician style arch nemesis all seem over the top. I guess I should have read the first two novels in the trilogy because I don't think this novel stands by itself very well. My bad."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I didnt' realize this was part of a series when I read it, and it is great to know that was not necessary. The book is written in such a way that prior character knowledge or lack there of does not detract from the story. Book of the Dead is intense and I had a hard time putting it down. I couldn't resign myself to wait to find out what happened next. Diogenes is just so evil and cunning and \\"wow\\". Pendergast has his hands full...but you never stop and think...he's not going to make it - you just aren't quite sure how he's going to get there. The details are well covered, and the idea that there are sealed exhibits and tunnels, and shelves with jars of all kinds of things hiding in museums makes me want to go on a scavenger hunt. Completely captivating, amazing, intense read!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Pendergast is in jail, framed by his brother. His friends, led by Vincent D'Agosta, plot to help him escape. The New York Museum of Natural History receives a mysterious package - that turns out to be diamond dust - their rare diamonds, stolen by Pendergasts brother Diogenes inDance of Death, have been reduced to nothing but powder by a vengeful Diogenes. An ancient tomb, bricked up in the catacombs of the museum, is re-opened, but strange occurrences are once again haunting the museum. And we finally learn about what caused the terrible rift between the brothers when they were young - why Diogenes is so angry. And finally the brothers have a showdown, after Diogenes seduces Constance - Pendergast's ward - and leaves her emotionally unstable.There is so much going on in this book that I don't even know where to start. So, rather than spoil it, I'll just tell you that I liked this book a great deal - I liked the fact that we're finally getting some perspective on what happened between Pendergast and Diogenes, and I enjoyed the clever device Diogenes created to cause mass hysteria/insanity in the museum. Those who are a fan of Preston and Child and/or of the Pendergast tales will not want to miss this."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This book was an amazing ending to a trilogy that I loved!

As with their other novels, I didn't feel like I was reading a book, but rather that I was there seeing it all happen in front of me. The writing is fantastic, and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The book begins by grabbing your attention and continues to hold it throughout the majority of the text. The ending drags a bit but it is worth it! Great summer read!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Diogenes Pendergast has slipped through the grasp of law enforcement again and again all the while making it look as if his brother, FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is really responsible for the wave of crime. With Aloysius locked away in a federal penetentiary, Diogenes is available to execute his master plan - the ultimate crime targeting as many victims as possible. Disguised as a museum employee, Diogenes has access to the setting of an Egyptian tomb that is being refurbished for a grand public opening. Nora Kelly, the curator for the exhibit, is working feverishly to get the tomb ready for the opening, but an ancient curse attached to the tomb seems to resurface, making it difficult, if not impossible, to stay on track. Meanwhile, D'Agosta, along with Eli Ginn, Proctor, and Constance Green, are working just as hard to find a way to spring Aloysius from his prison and clear his name.Fans of Preston and Child will enjoy this thrilling conclusion to the trilogy. It is by far the fastest paced and exciting of the three. At this point in the series, the reader is used to the convenient appearance of characters from past books so it is easier to move past that shortcoming and just get into the plot of the book. It is always fun to see how the brilliant Pendergast brothers will use their genius minds and impressive world knowledge in an effort to outdo each other and stay ahead of everyone around them. For all of the series faults, this exciting and page turning conclusion saves the day."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"If you're looking for a fun adventure story, THE BOOK OF THE DEAD certainly delivers the goods. This is basically a Indiana Jones movie in a novel format -- lots of big action scenes, a dramatic prison break, even a bit of Egyptology thrown in for good measure. None of this is remotely realistic, but it's a lot of fun and I kept turning the pages.This is not Lincoln/Child's best book by a long shot, but it's a good novel overall. This novel is rather slow-paced at the beginning, but it picks up nicely after the first hundred pages or so. This novel also has pretty much zero character development --every major character in this novel has been introduced in a prior book by Lincoln/Child.I've read most of Preston/Child's books, and my major problem is that the writers are beginning to repeat themselves. For example, much of this novel is set in the Museum of Natural History. Many of the scenes in this book remind me of their first novel RELIC, which takes place in the same locale (and with many of the same characters). For the next Pendergast book, I would strongly suggest leaving the museum behind.For those who don't know, this is the third book in a trilogy --the first two books being BRIMSTONE and DANCE OF DEATH. I would strongly recommend reading those two books first, since they provide a lot of the background for this novel. Indeed, you might be better off reading novels like THE RELIC or THE CABINET OF CURIOUSITIES first, because they are considered by many fans to be Preston/Child's best novels."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston and Child in \\"The Book of the Dead\\" conclude their classic trilogy of the confrontation between Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his pathologically evil younger brother Diogenes. The novel commences very shortly after it's prequel, \\"The Dance of Death\\" concludes and therein lies the problem. Without having at least read \\"Dance of Death\\" you'd be lost just picking up \\"The Book of the Dead\\". Having myself read the prequel when it was first released, enough time elapsed to create a bit of fuzziness about the plot.Closely paralleling the Star Wars trilogy as to the relative dispositions of the forces of good and evil, we find our heroes back on their heels as in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". Agent Pendergast is incarcerated in an impregnable federal penitentiary implicated in a slew of crimes committed by his brother Diogenes, who had framed him. Pendergast's sidekick. NYPD Lt. Vincent D'Agosta had been disgraced as a result of his involvement with him and faces a departmental disciplinary hearing. He was forced to sever romantic ties with Cpt. Laura Hayward.The plot begins with a delivery of a suspicious package to, where else, The Museum of Natural History. Powder leaking from the package spawned fears of bioterrorism. Careful lab analysis concluded that the powder was a large amount of industrial diamond grit. Examination of this grit by the museum's mineralogy experts revealed that the grit was actually the pulverized remains of the museums priceless diamond collection which had been purloined by Diogenes.This revelation set into motion, by the directors of the museum, a huge project designed to distract the public from destruction of the precious stones. Former P & C heroine and museum curator Nora Kelly was assigned the job of re-opening the lavish Egyptian tomb of Senef, which had been bricked up in the bowels of the museum in the 1930's. The tomb which had been shrouded by rumors of a curse surrounding it was to be again opened amid a gala pageant funded by a ten million Euro bequest by a mysterious French count whose ancestors originally uncovered it. This all fell under a nefarious plan orchestrated by Diogenes to wreck havoc using the exhibit as his base of operations.In the meantime Lt. D'Agosta working with wheelchair bound genius Eli Glinn of Effective Engineering Solutions were plotting a scheme to spring Pendergast from prison. Pendergast made aware of events surrounding the museum and Diogenes' plan was anxious to break out to thwart his brother.The wily Diogenes however was taking no chances and was trying to seduce Constance Green, the young but ageless ward of Pendergast, who lived in his Riverside mansion, using her as a wedge against his brother.The plot thickens as the brothers attempt to fufill their goals. A major revelation in this book is the insight we get into the genesis of the conflict between the two brothers. A boyhood prank perpetrated by a nine year Agent Pendergast on his seven year old brother resulted in his partial blindness and twisted his psyche forever creating an insurmountable rift. Also revealed by P & C are some aspects of the story behind the mysterious Constance Green.Since the authors have indicated that \\"The Book of the Dead\\" concludes their trilogy, we can hopefully look forward to some fresh new plot fabrications. In the concluding scene of the book, seeds were planted for a possible direction their next eagerly anticipated novel will take."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"The Book of the Dead closes out the informal trilogy centering on the gifted Pendergast brothers (and deadly rivals) Aloysius and Diogenes. Brimstone (2004) and Dance of Death (2005) were virtual set-up books to the culminating heart-stopping events in this new offering. I highly recommend that readers attain a working familiarity with those other titles (as well as the rest of the Pendergast ouvre) before tearing into The Book of the Dead. There are just too many things going on which connect to prior books for new readers to otherwise get full, comprehensive enjoyment.All the familiar faces are back, and have varying degrees of impact on the proceedings. Margo Green, for example, only has a cameo appearance, much to my regret. William Smithback Jr, the reporter with the \\"nose\\" for news, and Eli Glinn (from The Ice Limit and Dance of Death) also take somewhat of a backstage role. Instead, Nora Kelly, Vincent D'Agosta and and Homicide Captain Laura Hayward come to the fore. Constance Greene also has an integral part to play. But, of course, the main star of the show is maverick FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast, with his psychopathic younger genius of a brother Diogenes getting the second star billing. As an additional teaser for the readers, one of the long-time supporting characters turns out to be a sleeper villain.The sprawling, prestigious New York Museum of Natural History has survived the bloodcurling events of The Relic and The Reliquary, but the latest mishap involving grounded up diamonds just might be the last straw. The museum powers that be, in an attempt to forestall negative publicity, decide to re-open The Tomb of Senef, which has been sealed off decades ago and long forgotten in the dank recesses of the museum. But, of course - because this is a Preston & Child production - there is a supernatural curse on the Tomb of Senef. Nora Kelly, selected to head up the exhibit, must deal with not only the Tomb's murky past and reputation, but also with the repercussions of one murdered hired hand and two more employees who've entered the Tomb and come out murderously insane. Meanwhile, Captain Hayward attempts to make sense of all the unsettling museum shenanigans. Little by little, she is coming to believe D'Agosta's assertion that Diogenes Pendergast is the main culprit behind it all, and that, furthermore, Aloysius Pendergast is innocent of his charged crime. Speaking of whom, Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is still busy cooling his heels in the maximum security Herkmoor federal prison, but not for long, as Eli Glinn and Vince D'Acosta begin to set the stage for the agent's hoosegow breakout. Meanwhile, behind the curtain, pulling the strings and paving the way for his \\"perfect crime,\\" lurks the brilliant, amoral mastermind Diogenes.This is a damned good read, one which I polished off in one hot summer day. I had no idea museums were so interesting. Special Agent Pendergast is one of my favorite literary characters (he's kinda like what would've happened if Sherlock Holmes and Fox Mulder had a baby), and I always relish revisiting his macabre universe. I was wondering if Preston & Child could pull this one off, and, mercifully, they do, and with great style. This is a riproaring, edge-of-your-seat thriller which lives up to the quality of Preston & Child's best efforts. Several dangling plotlines left over from the previous novel(s) are gratifyingly resolved. In The Book of the Dead, we become privy to how Eli Glinn effects Agent Pendergast's escape from daunting Herkmoor, the fate of Margo Green and Constance Greene (no relation), the resolution of D'Agosta and Capt. Laura Hayward's estranged relationship... We also finally discover the terrible secret which is the source of the brothers' bitter enmity, and how it impacts Diogenes's vengeful master plan.So what're you doing still reading this? Go check the book out already."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"For those of you who have been waiting on pins and needles for Preston & Child to wrap up the Pendergast Trilogy, this book certainly couldn't have come soon enough. The trilogy began (unofficially that is) with 'Brimstone' which was one of their best books since 'The Cabinet of Curiosities', which remains my 2nd favorite novel by this amazingly talented duo. But believe it or not, they actually went one better with 'Dance of Death'. I am having a difficult time deciding which one stands above the rest (with the exception of 'Relic' which I still believe to be their masterpiece -- so far anyway).To set the stage to some degree, events in 'The Book of the Dead' began with 'Brimstone' leading us to see the emergence of Special Agent Pedergast's younger, more disturbed brother, Diongenes. His twisted mind, and how he became so demented specifically against his brother is alluded to, and finally totally explained in this novel which wraps up the trilogy, and yet sets the stage for further Pendergast tales. As 'Dance of Death' ends, Agent Pendergast is incarcerated for a series of crimes which were actually committed by Diongenes, and carefully crafted to point guilt towards his brother, with whom he has a hatred for that borders on madness. As the story picks up right after 'DoD', the largest collection of diamonds on earth have been stolen, and suddenly appear back at the Museum -- only as ground up worthless grit. Why on earth would Diongenes do something so unexplainable? As we discover soon afterwards, the firm headed by Eli Glinn, according to his most thorough predictions, Diongenes has set the stage for what he considers to be the 'Perfect Crime', but it hasn't happened -- YET. And when it does, it will make everything he has done up to this point almost pointless by comparison. So what could be worse than murder and the seemingly perfect framing of his brother? That, of course is just PART of what awaits you within this nearly flawless tale of greed, revenge and sheer thrills.Constance Green, who has been quite an enigma since she was introduced in 'The Cabinet of Curiosities' has quite a roll in the final pages. We see more of exactly why Diogenes has a hatred that seems to be bottomless, and more importantly, why specifically his anger is directed towards his brother. The opening of the near-forgotten Tomb of Senef is the stage set for the final act of Diogenes' plan for which he has spent over a decade preparing for. After some poor press at the Museum (this establishment is as unlucky as any building or person in modern fiction...) it has come to the attention of the Director that what they desperately need is something to offset everything that screams for the Museum to be shut down...hence the opening of an Egyptian tomb that hasn't seen the light of day since the 30's, and from what everyone slowly learns, it was closed for good reason. Does the so-called 'Curse' continue to this day, or has someone carefully manipulated events in such a way that all it can do is create more interest in the Tomb's opening? What about the stories of people quite suddenly going mad, are they true? And what about Agent Pendergast being stuck in a maximum security prison? How can he possibly orchestrate the capture of his brother from such isolation directed by a rogue FBI agent with an agenda all his own? All I can say is this: you get the answers to ALL these questions and just when you think the book is over...a secondary chase begins which takes us to Europe, with the most unlikely of the characters that have been introduced in the Pendergast novels. Oh, by the way, the very last line simply ensures more novels that will pick up where this one left off -- even though the storyline is pretty much tied up at the end, we haven't seen the last of Agent Pendergast, of that I am certain. Unlike many readers, it took me a while to get to really like Pendergast...but I have almost reluctantly come to be a huge fan. He definitely isn't your typical protagonist, but he certainly is one of the most original. Yet another Grand Slam from the best duo working in fictional thrillers today. ALL of their solo novels are great, but just like Lennon & McCartney's song writing talent, they just seem to work better together. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Judging by the ancillary material published with this book, co-authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are prolific and successful purveyors of popular pot boilers.While reading through this book, I found myself shuttling between regarding this P&C; opus as the most awful tripe (or codswallop, as some Canadians might say) and ruefully enjoying it as a guilty pleasure.Let us be clear about one thing: this is a book of no literary merit whatever. The P&C; formula clearly consists of improbable plotting, characters lifted from a better writer, undigested chunks of research material scattered throughout like raisins in a cookie, silly psychobabble notions, pointless quotations of poetry (proudly and even more pointlessly identified in an appendix) and occasional passages of laughably overwritten, absurdly high-flown material.As a ghastly example of the last, consider this:\\"Because it's time we spoke, you and I. It's the least courtesy you could pay me, after all.\\"Constance took another step, her fingers tailing along the polished wood. Then she paused. \\"Courtesy?\\"....\\"Constance,\\" he said in a quiet voice. \\"Du calme. Du calme.\\"\\"Courtesy!\\" she cried once again. \\"How dare you speak of courtesy! You murder my guardian's friends, disgrace him, tear him from this house!\\" She stopped abruptly and struggled. A soft groan rose in her throat: a moan of frustration, mingled with another, more complex emotion.The man continued to speak in a smooth undertone. \\"Please understand, Constance, I'm not here to hurt you. I'm restraining you simply to prevent harm to myself.\\"She struggled again. \\"Hateful man!\\" [Pages 86-87 of the paperback edition]I suggest that such dialogue is truly suitable in only two places: about halfway through the novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" or in a Monty Python sketch. I laughed and groaned simultaneously, when I stumbled upon it.And then there is that ever-memorable motif that pops up again and again: \\"Draaaaag-thump. Draaaaag-thump.\\"As for the lifted characters, can anybody possibly doubt that the lethally battling Pendergast brothers are other than Ersatz Holmes and Pseudo Moriarty, updated hardly a whit, and deposited improbably in the 21st Century?There is doubtlessly a thesis to be mined by some industrious doctoral candidate-drone from P&C;'s lunatic plotting. Constrained by word-length requirements, I'll touch on no more than a jailbreak scenario that is considerably less convincing that the escapes orchestrated from Colonel Klink's stalag by Hogan's Heroes, a diabolical master plan, devised and carried out by the Moriarty-clone, that must have been lifted straight out of the Joker's Gotham City playbook, and a conclusion that all too obviously harks back to a very famous literary precedent, one that will be almost too painfully obvious to virtually anyone who reads it.Speaking of that conclusion, it comes as a painfully over-extended anti-climax. The book ends properly and perfectly obviously with the conclusion of Chapter 66 on page 496. The book then abruptly changes direction and staggers on for another sixteen chapters--101 pages!--to a second and much lesser finale. If P&C; had only a speck less of hack in their collective make-up and an additional speck of art, they might have realized that their second ending, needed or not, would have been better served had it been presented as a one-page kicker.Finally, there is the matter of tone and style. Throughout the book I experienced odd feelings of familiarity that I could not quite place--particularly with the often repeated introductions of characters with their identifying tags: \\"Agent Pendergast,\\" or \\"Captain of Homicide Laura Hayward\\" or Dr. Adrian Wicherly.\\" It finally occurred to me that such things were characteristic of the old network radio crime dramas. \\"The Book of the Dead,\\" I realized, owes as much to \\"The Green Hornet\\" and \\"The Shadow\\" as to \\"The Final Problem.\\"This lumpy confection really ought to get two disdainful stars, but I am forced to admit that it has just enough guilty pleasure in it to raise it up to the proud status of a full-fledged mediocrity, so ... three stars."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This book was billed as the capper to the Pendergast series, when all of the plot threads left by \\"Dance of Death\\" would be neatly sewed up. Much to my delight, the authors were apparently seduced into keeping things going. Not to give the plot away, but I doubt that we've seen the last of Diogenes, and the last sentence in the book just screams \\"continuation.\\"Not that I mind. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next installment. After being sorely disappointed in \\"Brimstone,\\" but enthralled with \\"Dance of Death,\\" I can say with certainty that this book is the best of the three. I have criticized Preston and Childs for being poor \\"finishers\\" in several previous novels, but that is decidedly not the case in this one.Highly recommended, but read the other two noted books first, along with \\"Cabinet of Curiousities.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Good thing this is a written review, eh?I got the book this morning, and I just finished it. It is AWESOME! All the books in the Pendergast Cycle, by that I mean all since the original book entitled \\"The Relic\\", have been brilliant. (\\"Reliquary\\" was the low point, but it was still superior to most other books in the genre and related genres.) This was a spectacular culmination of all the previous works.I don't want to give anything away, and so I must cut this review shorter than I'd like. Suffice it to say, no one will be disappointed. If they are, then they're square. No, really. The book is wildly entertaining, intriguing, and amazing. It's really, really, really incredible.Just plain wow."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"New to the Preston/Child series of novels, I started with Brimstone, then Dance of Death and then the finale, Book of the Dead. The \\"Diogenes\\" trilogy.Extremely well written, and eloquently poised, the imagery and characterizations blend to create the perfect thriller. Preston and Child contribute the perfect combination of talent, to be indistinguishable as more than one author.Agent Pendergast and the collaborating cast of characters are so real, so carefully created, that they bring to life the story, and draw you into the reality of the novels. The obviously well documented, and researched background information gives a vivid backdrop to the plot and your imagination builds the elaborate scenes for every location.I will be buying more of the authors' past books and will be eagerly anticipating more of the Pendergast saga as it unfolds.HIGHLY recommended reading, you won't be disappointed. A thinking man's thriller."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Preston/Child are such marvelous writers, it's important to do them justice. You want to make sure you get the full effect of Diogenes' (dare I say it) diabolical plot.Here's how it should go. Get \\"Brimstone\\", \\"Dance of Death\\", and \\"Book of the Dead\\". Put them by your reading chair, but do not open them.Clear your calendar--call in sick, take vacation days, whatever you need to do. Check for sufficient provisions for several days--whatever your reading food of choice is. Make peace with your family, insure they have enough food and clean laundry to tide them over, (does not work with young children) and explain that you will be incommunicado for a while. If necessary, go shopping. Have a talk with your pets (does not work with cats) and make arrangements to have them fed and watered.Now, with a clear conscience, open \\"Brimstone\\". Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"First off, I think that reading the previous two books in the cycle should be mandatory before you read this entry. I also think you should read 'The Cabinet of Curiousities' prior to reading this.This most recent Pendergrast thriller ties up a lot of loose ends (but not permanently), and has all of the series' most important characters going through their motions as they routinely do. And that's why this book falls short of the heights of its predecessors. Everything is routine.The villainous Diogenes is not as potent or powerful this time, and seems to be 'going through the motions' of what an arch-villain should do. D'Agosto and Hayward do their cop/romance schtick as usual. The reporters are both here, but neither has much to do. Margo Green is a character, but her part seems like it was added in afterwards when the authors realized she was still a loose end.I plowed through this book and found it to be a compelling and compulsive read, but somehow I'm disappointed. I've come to expect greatness from the authors, and this time all they delivered was a solid book. The problem with the book is that there were no surprises, and in a thriller I want to be thrilled.I feel like a Yankee fan who complains because A-Rod only hit 40 homers and drives in 120 runs."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another fast paced and exciting thriller from the dynamic writing duo. Be sure you've read \\"Dance of Death\\" first to get the full impact.Only one complaint -- Special Agent Pendegast spent too much time \\"off stage.\\" Next time, Messeurs, more Pendergast, please!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I've been following the books of Preston/Child since THE RELIC. My favorites are the ones featuring Agent Pendergast...they have created such a wonderful \\"family\\" for him - all of the Pendergast clan seems to have been very interesting individuals. There is more insight in to Diogenes, Constance and Viola...if you're a fan of the stories thus far, this will be a delicious read! Long live Special Agent Pendergast! May his saga continue..."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"If I could give this book higher than a 5=Star rating, it would have one. What a remarkably suspenseful, intriguing conclusion to a great series of books. Pendergast is fascinating, as are all of the characters. It has been most enjoyable seeing their characters develop and interact - makes it more interesting. The authors ability to create and not be held back by explainable reality is what makes the books so interesting. It gives you the opportunity to imagine and wonder. A completely engrossing book that I hated see end. Can't wait for another Pendergast book!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Once again Agent Pendergast is faced with impossible odds. Accused of the crimes committed by his brother, he is locked away in one of the highest security prisons while his brother plots to get away with the perfect crime. Preston and Child have once again configured a fast moving murder mystery with their wonderful compilation of interesting facts and characters."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Book of the Dead ends the \\"Pendergast Trilogy\\" and I have to say that this was the best book of the three. Finally there is some closure to the Pendergast vs his brother battle, and we find out what caused Diogenes to hate his brother. Unlike the last book, Dance of Death, this one really holds it's own and ties up so many loose ends from the previous novels that it is a MUST read for ever Preston/Child fan out there.I think that the most enjoyable part of this book is that it featured other main characters rather than just Pendergast. Many return from previous novels and all in all it makes for a very enjoyable read.If I have one complaint, I would have to say that the last line of the book was not only expected, but really a disappointment. If they had ended the book two paragraphs earlier I would have been very happy but this is not a major issue.One side note, if you have not read Brimstone and Dance of Death, you need to before reading this one or you might be a bit confused. Other than that this is a first rate page turner that builds up the suspense as it reaches a fascinating climax.All in all this is one of the best Preston/Child works out there. I cannot wait to see what comes next from these two dynamic writers!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"For those who haven't read an Agent Pendergast novel before, this book will be very confusing - go back and read the earlier books first. For anyone who's been following Pendergast's story, this is one of the best in the series. Our hero gets a little more human, just as he did in \\"Dance of Death\\" and \\"Brimstone\\". The battle with Diogenes continues, and every time things seem resolved, there's another shock around the corner. I finished it in one day, and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"If you are perusing these opinions you already know what incredible writers these two men are - what you don't know is that this is a wonderful read. The Pendergast brothers keep your interest and Agent Pendergast and his high-tec antics keeps the imagination open. That's what you should do - don't say, \\"That wouldn't happen\\" or \\"impossible\\" - just go with the flow and enjoy this masterful piece of verbal art. The ending is open -- and I feel that Diogenes will reappear -- to claim his child -- and that there is more to happen to Constance - we still don't know her entire story but it will surface with the birth of a child. Please read ALL the books by these gentlemen. They are sensational authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"These authors are two of my favorites.I enjoyed this book very much,but, can we get away from the museum for a while. I am aware that one of the authors worked there and it is a facinating place, just the right setting for these stories. However, it seems as if there is always a new exhibit with a gala opening that turns into chaos.I would like to see some more stand alone books from these guys. I like the idea of using characters fron previous books in stories that are not set in the museum. Agent Prendergast and brother Diogenes are like evil twin Sherlock Holmes. It would be nice to read about their family history. We have seen glimpses here and there, but not enough for me.I will continue to buy every book published by these authors and cannot wait for the next on."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"As David Spade would say, I like this book better the first time I read it, when it was called \\"Relic.\\" Preston and Child can turn out potboilers, guilty pleasures that aren't literary masterpieces but make with the page-turning fun, but they also aren't without their flaws. Too often, they drop arcana into a situation that doesn't call for it (anybody can Google up a ton of trivia on any subject, and besides, you shouldn't try to impress your reader by your mastery of obscure facts). Agent Pendergast is again perfect in every way. Need a safe cracked? He knows the metallurgy necessary to pick the weak point in the lock. Not to give away a plot point, but in this book he McGuyvers up one particularly necessary element in a manner that's just too convenient.And convenience is the downfall of this book, and of most P&C; books. What could be a situation fraught with drama is instead defused by Pendergast's godlike abilities, including the ludicrous \\"memory crossing\\" technique that is P&C;'s way of conveniently explaining away anything they don't know how to write into their books.Chop off a few chapters, give Pendergast at least one or two flaws, and drop the attempts to dazzle the reader with trivia, and this would be a five-star summer read. As it is, it's just laughable and tedious."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This book was much anticipated - with the disappointment of Dance of Death, I wanted to see if Preston/Child got their acts together, and boy did they - I read this book in one session - was hooked from page 1.This takes us back to the Museum of Natural History, where we began in Relic, and the opening of another exhibit, this time a ancient Egyptian tomb that has been literally bricked up for over 50 years in the museum - We see our old friends from earlier works, including non Pendergast books, and they all mesh together beautifully.Agent Pendergast is in a high security prison, framed by his equally genius brother Diogenes. Diogenes, has been a busy boy - he stole the Museum's diamond collection, ground them to dust and sent the dust to the museum. He is able to enter Pendergast's boarded up home and woo the much protected ward Constance toward 'the dark side'. That path is sensual and exciting, and there are many revelations about Constance that make the story more rounded -The ending made me have a quick intake of breath - it took me unawares! So many of the stories in the series seem to be tied up and here is a curve ball!For those new to this series, I recommend at least reading Cabinet of Curiosities which can give you some background.The author's notes at the end of the book gave the reader a great overview of the characters' entrances into the series. It was much appreciated.This is the best in the series and if you are remotely a fan of Pendergast, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Awful and dragged out. If done in half the pages it may have been a decent book."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Oh, what a tangled web they weave. Again, this Preston-Child novel, The Book of the Dead, contains so many characters and subplots it's almost too daunting to absorb and seems to bog down the read at times (though I'm still a huge fan of these authors). I stayed with the book to the very end but found myself skipping entire passages to get back to the action. Not on par with their earlier works, to be sure."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Incredible \\"end\\" to the Pendergast / Diogenes books. This is not a stand-alone Pendergast book. While you could pick it up and read it, you'd be missing out on one hell of a backstory with everything (there are 2 before this one). I highly recommend the whole series (Brimstone, Dance of Death, Book of the Dead)."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"this was my first book of the series, actually of both authors, and i am completely hooked! the action was hard core and i loved the main character pendergast. he is just the best good guy! you know kinda bad...i am definetly a serious fan and i cant wait to read everything by these authors."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This was the second book I'd read by Preston & Child, but the first with the character of Agent Pendergast. It wasn't until I finished the book that I even knew there was a trilogy and that this was the last book in it. If I'd known that, I probably would have preferred to start with at least one of the other two books in the series.I would most definitely classify this novel a page turner. It kept the action going and kept me me anxiously anticipating what was coming next. However, the authors moved various plotlines and characters ahead at the same time by skipping from one to the other. While I understand this tactic, it can be tremendously frustrating, when you're at a tense point in one storyline, to come to a screeching halt in that storyline and move to another one which may be at a very different point.Most novels of this ilk require a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, and this one is no exception. If anything, it requires a much larger dose than the average thriller. There were portions of the story that would have been laughable had they not been in such capable hands as these authors. The story was good enough and the characters strong enough that I was able to move past the fact that there was a lot of unbelievably wacky stuff going on.While I enjoy suspense, I am not a person who enjoys reading horror, ghost stories, etc. As a result, I probably would have never bought this book had I picked it up in a bookstore because it sounded like it was going in that direction. Instead, I saw it on a \\"loaner shelf\\" at the place where I volunteer and, after reading a few pages, was relatively convinced that it wasn't going to be that kind of book, so I took it home. It is certainly suspenseful and there are elements of ghost story/horror writing in it, but it was not overdone. In fact, I will happily be returning the book to the loaner shelf next week with my recommendation to coworkers to pick it up and go for a ride! :)"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Having not read the previous books, and only found out that other books should be read prior to this one, I think I missed out on a great oppirtunity for a good read. There were many parts that I thought needed more description, or background, but I am sure it was known to all who have read the books prior...knowing characters, etc.I found the main character came in and everything 'fell into place' when I was still trying to figure out ... how did that happen so quickly?Not a bad book, but not a standalone novel."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Although I liked it and found the science behind the eventually \\"Big Event\\" cool, I wish I had read the 1st 2 of the trilogy first, but I got it from the library and it was not clear from the cover this was the 3rd. It managed to stand alone well enough but the Constance long-childhood thing was very unclear and hinted at annoying. If a focus was going to put on it, then it should have been flatout stated. Despite that, it was a rewarding, quick and exciting read. For a suspense novel, there were very few holes...I can't think of any except a weird statement made about Nora by her husband that seemed like something bad editing failed to catch a change in characterization. Still, a fun story great for a rainy day or beach."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is book 3 in the 'Pendergast trilogy,' and you should read Brimstone and Dance of Death first. Taken as an aggregate it's a very engrossing, entertaining read (taken seperately they tend to leave you hanging - at least the first two books did, so you might as well get all three at once!).The whole series is full of interesting characters and bizarre situations, and while some plot points are utterly predictable, there are still enough twists and turns that keep you guessing. The action is well written and pulls you in wonderfully, and the narrator (I listened on tape) did an amazing job."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"This is an enjoyable novel and an ideal poolside book. However, I probably won't read any more Preston/Child novels; here's why:(1) As other reviewers have already noted, this is actually part of a series. The book cover doesn't say anything about this. Obviously the publisher doesn't want to lose impulse buyers who might be put off by phrases like \\"The final book in the Yadayada Trilogy!\\" To their credit, Preston and Child do their best to make this work as a standalone novel, but you'll still end up feeling like you walked into a theater in the middle of a movie.(2) Two of the principal characters, Agent Pendergast and Diogenes, are a bit, ahem, baroque. They talk like characters in a melodrama and are endowed with almost supernatural intelligence and physical stamina. They both seem out of place around the other characters, who are all very realistically portrayed. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of Diogenes's pretentious monologues.(3) The story contains some highly implausible plot elements (most notably a sound and light show that makes people go insane), and Preston and Child don't really go out of their way to make these convincing. If you enjoy Clive Cussler (who routinely expects readers to swallow some pretty absurd things) you probably won't mind this. If your tastes run more to Michael Crichton, you might find yourself questioning some of the book's plot holes and bizarre premises."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Another action filled adventure with the strange but compelling Agent Pendergast at the center of it all. The authors keep your attention rivited as the characters weave in and out of the main story line. The descriptive narrative keeps you looking over the shoulder of each person while you hold your breath at the suspense when the evil Diogenes is at his worst and you are waiting for the brilliant Aloysius to save Constance. Loved having D'Agosta back in the middle of it all!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"First Preston/Child book I've read. What a find. Now I am reading the books in reverse as I didn't know there were others written before. That hasn't seemed to change things for me maybe even helped keep track of who is who. These writers are just great and even reading out of order hasn't changed my mind. I want them all!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"While this chapter of the trilogy almost had the feel of Relic in the beginning, the fast-paced suspense created by Lincoln and Child got to me once again. The well-known characters are true to form and Diogenes becomes even more reprehensible, if that's possible! The last two words of this book will leave you speechless. Another winner for Lincoln and Child... now on to the Wheel of Darkness."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Unfortunately like so many of the reviewers on this page, I read Preston and Child's newest offering to the Agent Pendergast sequence of thrillers, \\"The Book of the Dead\\" before reading \\"Dance of Death.\\"I vaguely recall the plot of \\"Brimstone\\" where the intrepid FBI agent meets the lovely archaeologist Voila and then seems about to meet his maker when a pack of wild dogs surround him in the Tuscan hills towards the end of the novel. Imagine my chagrin when in the first few chapters of \\"The Book of the Dead\\" I realize that the clever Aloysius has been incarcerated in the state penitentiary for the murder of his brother, the dastardly Diogenes, and I had not a clue of how he got there. Not having a copy of \\"Dance of Death,\\" I ploughed on---happily so---with just a little trepidation regarding what seemed like a repeat plotline---some terror going on in New York's Museum of Natural History with an impending gala that surely spelled doom ala the first Pendergast novel \\"The Relic.\\" In this case, despite the repetitions, author team Preston and Child know how to churn out a great page-turner---I finished a very satisfactory read in a few non-stop and enjoyable sittings.Now for those of you who are unfamiliar with this team's efforts, this is popular writing for the general masses, winging their way through airports and train stations, wanting a compelling read to soak up tiresome commuting time. Not exactly great literature. However, it is entertaining storytelling with tight albeit sometimes improbable plot lines that have beguiling scientific or historic solutions that can't always be foreseen by the reader. The trick of utilizing a group of characters that reoccur in subsequent books allows the authors to develop the characters over time without stalling the action or the momentum of the bigger story. The short chapters drive the story forward in a manner that pushes the reader to stay up until the wee hours just to find out what happens next. The denouement satisfies as well as tantalizes---there is always that bit of a cliffhanger that ensures successful cash register sales for the next installment. (I, for one, am thrilled that \\"Wheel of Darkness\\" is due out at summer's end.)Bottom line? I am not about to spoil the plot of \\"Book of the Dead.\\" If you have followed the rather exciting overactive lives of FBI agent Pendergast, his ward, Constance Greene, his diabolical brother, Diogenes, New York Times reporter, Bill Smithback, his wife, southwestern archaeologist, Nora Kelly, police lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta, police captain Laura Hayward, museum curator Margo Green and the rest of the Museum of Natural History crew, you already know what to expect. \\"The Book of the Dead\\" does not disappoint.

The ultimate crime executed by Diogenes wasn't as diabolical as I expected and the chase at the end could have been fleshed out a lot more, with better explanations of how the pursuer tracked the pursee. Overall, though, Lincoln and Child produced another entertaining page turner."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"I have read the following novels by Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child or both: DEATH MATCH, RELIC, MONUT DRAGON, RELIQUARY, RIPTIDE, THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, STILL LIFE WITH CROWS and THE BOOK OF THE DEAD. They are excellent writers. They are masters of the English language and have the rare ability to draw the reader into the storyline. On more than one occasion, I became so involved in the novel, I lost track of time - missed an important meeting and supper. One cannot pay a higher compliment to an author.For the second time (see my review of THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES), I read THE BOOK OF THE DEAD out of sequence. Throughout my reading, I waited for an explanation of how Pendergast got in prison. It was not until the end, that I realized that THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is the third novel in a series. Thus, my warning to the reader, read BRIMSTONE and DANCE OF DEATH first! Publishers really need to include warning labels."},{"Title":"The Book of the Dead (Pendergast)","review":"Great last book in the \\"Trilogy\\". Settles some questions raises others.

I spend a lot of my life in airports, and these are perfect books for the endless waiting around or during flights. This being the final part of a trilogy I was even happier to see it drop through my letterbox.The story, as usual, weaves the different recurring characters, and some new ones, into rich and believable situations and I enjoyed the description of the Museum and its warren-like interior. I felt at times however, especially in the later stages of the book, that the sheer volume of unanswered questions, interwoven characters and story threads to be \\"closed off\\" in this final part of the trilogy, meant that the story lost a little of the fluidity I am used to.But I will say that I enjoyed the book, I finished it in one flight, and despite these minor points it remains a good read. Interestingly the back cover mentions that the authors \\"are working on their next Pendergast book\\" - I hope they intend to make it a stand-alone story."},{"Title":"Hostas and Other Shade-Loving Plants","review":"Limited information about Hostas in this poorly named book. It is better described as a beginners guide to shade gardening, with some reference to Hostas.The book contains: 83 pages on general shade gardening, garden design, seasonal garden observations, soil preparation, and plant propagation. 15 pages on Hostas (17 species and 37 cultivars), each receiving one small paragraph of information. 30 pages about 119 other shade plants, again each receiving one small paragraph of information. 1 page listing plant suppliers and 1 page listing societies.Book has a 4 page index. Both cover pages contain a paper fold to act as a page place holder (when you put the book down, you can find where you left off - a nice touch).Photography is great. Images are clear, colorful, and show interesting plants. Most pictures contain a comment line that properly identifies the plant to species or variety.The book is not a great reference manual on Hostas. It merely introduces the beginning gardener to shade plants and describes the more common Hostas. Information is solid and helpful, but there is not a lot of depth.If you're looking for a lightweight introduction to shade gardening - then this is a very good choice.It's a thin book that is priced around $[price].

The attacks on September 11th were probably too important to generalize about from either a left wing point of view (big bad America is getting the punishment it deserves) or a right wing one (those evil freaks are just jealous of our money, fast food, and Disney Land). With this in mind, I highly recommend reading \\"9-11\\" but be aware of its limitations. After all, this is a slim volume of email correspondence that took place between the author and foreign journalists before a lot of substantial information about September 11th (such as the identity of the terrorists) had become public knowledge.The most compelling part of \\"9-11\\" is how effectively it dispels the notion that the terrorists are blindly lashing out at globalization. Chomsky points out that Osama Bin Laden is hardly aware of globalization and has more concrete goals that include ridding Saudi Arabia of American troops and creating a \\"truly Islamic\\" government in that country. Chomsky also points out what is now probably common knowledge, namely that Bin Laden and his followers were trained and supported by the CIA to fight the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. America's \\"new\\" war on terror, according to Chomsky is hardly new at all. Since the end of World War II American political lexicon has frequently labeled America's adversaries as terrorists whether they resisted American backed dictatorships (South Vietnam, Central America), or rebelled against American control (Panama, Grenada, Iraq). Finally, Chomsky reminds us that the beneficiaries of terrorism are the most violent and corrupt people on either side of the equation whether it is Bin Laden and his followers or radical conservatives and the Defense Industry.Chomsky certainly has an agenda and one should keep this in mind when reading his book. His language tends to be terse, impatient and at times even arrogant which probably does not do much to strengthen his case. Never-the-less, we are all obliged to research and understand what was behind the attacks of September 11th, and more than ever we should be objective about the information we encounter. Before you doubt the veracity of this book, check the information against other sources such as Mamoun Fandi's \\"Saudi Arabia and the Politics of Descent\\". Contrast Chomsky's point of view with Karen Amstrong's insights about Islamic fundamentalism (\\"The Battle for God\\") or Samuel Huntington's argument that the world is fragmenting along age old civilization boundaries (\\"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\\". Don't just take the American president and the press at their word. Research for yourself and come to your own conclusions."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book was a big eye-opener for me in terms of the US and its foreign policies. However, it has to be read with an open mind because alot of the fault is blamed on the bullying of the US. Read it ...it's well worth it. THe media would never discuss issues he brings up. Like the Sudan and the implications that the sanctions placed on Iraq have on the world view of us. Although a bit out of date since it went to press in mid-October, the general idea still comes thru. America needs to change its ways if we want this so called \\"war on terrorism\\" to cease. And Bush's \\"Axis of Evil\\" comments just don't cut it. These types of sayings just aggravate the problem further and push the US into further isolation. Like another reviewer said, yes, we are at the top, in terms of being a superpower, but at the expense of stepping on a lot of little folks (smaller nations)."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Perhaps to stop \\"terrorism\\" altogether we need to understand the psychological and cultural relationships that are luring and binding thousands, possibly millions, of mostly ordinary people into the terrorist organization's martyr-making web. If we pursue this seriously we may find that the global economic, political and cultural agenda of our own society - whose government promises to preemptively forestall any potential military opposition - has a catalyzing role in moves to retreat from our worldview (e.g., the Taliban) or to create a global counterweight (Al-Qaida). As with the selective use of the definition of terror that Chomsky has so clearly described in Pirates and Emperors our government has simply decided that this would not be a legitimate subject for inquiry. The current bustle and \\"R&D\\" devoted to understanding 9-11, in particular,and terrorism, in general, is therefore likely to be politically potent progaganda (for spurring us to war), but intellectually and ethically vacuous. Chomsky reminds us that there is a genuine alternative to being mindlessly duped."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"The world became a significantly more dangerous place on September 11th, 2001, and, as Chomsky points out in this packed little book, not just for Americans. In these times what is probably more crucial than that is developing, personally, publically, and politically, an understanding of the nature of our own views and the consequences of our actions.Chomsky saws through the rhetoric of terrorism, showing us what terrorism looks like when the guns are pointed the other way, and he provides no shortage of examples of this phenomena, Nicuragua and East Timor to name only two of the most devestating. Using the official definition of a terrorist act, the one held by the US Government and the World Court, and then looking at the US's own policies, Chomsky argues (surprise!) that the United States is one of the leading exporters of terrorism in the world.Even if you do not personally agree with this view, the ideas in this book are so important and really must be considered if we ever hope to break out of the cycle of violence that has run the world for the entirety of the 20th Century and has only been demonstrated more strongly with Bush's actions in the 21st. We need to be asking ourselves what this \\"war\\" that we are fighting really hopes to accomplish, what is going to happen when it is done, and what kind of a wolrd we want to live in, not just as Americans but as human beings. Nobody will say that the actions of 9-11 were justified, but we can not hope to prevent them from happenning again without a critical engagement of the ideas and actions which led to their happenning in the first place. The ideas presented in this book are a step to that sort of an engagement, and I would strongly urge EVERYONE to read this book and approach it openly. It is only in such a manner can we begin to truly make the world a safer place, not for bullying and imperialistic Eurocentric regimes, but for all."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky addresses the questions that very few others seem daring enough to deal with in the subject of 9-11 and terrorism. This is a piece that attacks unilateralism on every page and for every issue. Is there more than one way at looking at the events of 9-11? Is there more than one way of dealing with the aftermath? The answer is a resounding yes, and it doesn't mean that Chomsky hates Americans or likes terrorists; on the contrary, he wants - as much as or more than anyone - peace and justice. Justice, however, comes in many shapes and needs to be used on all guilty parties.The lack of a 5th star is due mainly to the format and vagueness on certain issues. The interview format makes for an easy, informal read, but it does not facilitate the depth and detail that you would find in a full-scale book."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I am a big fan of Chomsky and I have read many of his books. I just thought that this book was a hurried publication. And therefore, it lacked depth and/or analysis that I've become accustomed to in his books. Although for someone who truly believed that the US engage in wars only to help the poor of the world and to bring peace and justice and freedom , this book is a waker-upper. It will serve as a good introductory book for the American who is not satisfied by the answer they got from the mainstream media(Dan Rather,Friedman,Charlie Rose) that 9/11 happened because those people are jealous of what we have.So if you've never read Chomsky before. This book is an excellent starter. If you own at least 2 or 3 books of Chomsky on the middle east, this book isn't necessary."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I've liked the issues that Chomsky raises for a while now and feel this book does not falter with this intellects mind you can always empathise with chomsky and really feel the passion behind whatever issue he raises even if they are at times faux (which by the way every human is) so this desrves 5 as it's an insite into chomsky through a well conducted interview. I feel that with 9-11 been such a sensitive issue for many Americans and people across the world that there was no offense directed at the public only at the leaders of such organisations and terroist groups which is one of many things that chomskys 9-11 conducts well. And the book is not to patriotic as i feel patriotism is where the American leaders have been going wrong for a long time now so congratulations to Chomsky on handling a sensitive subject well and on digging up whats dark in the world in a lucid way."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"For the most part Chomsky is closer to the truth than his detractors.Years ago I was a student at MIT and had a laboratory close to Chomsky's office in the old research MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics. At that time, and for many years later I thought Chomsky was a rabid liberal- socialist that was out somewhere in left field on many issues.Of course I had formed that opinion without reading his books! But I knew that he had written dozens of books, was made an Institute Professor (which is a big deal at MIT) had written hundreds of papers and had at least 20 honorary doctorates from universities all around the world. When I sat down and read his books page by page I was converted. He simply presents the facts in a cool and detached manner. The facts speak quite eloquently for themselves and they are damming of US foreign policy.On 9-11 and after like many others if I had been the President I would have ordered a military strike. It was and is a natural response as if your wife was raped or a child killed by a criminal. We wanted revenge for the 3,000 killed. Even Rudolph Giuliani told Bush he wanted to personally pull the trigger when Bin Laden was captured. It was a time of high emotion. Bush followed human instincts and his advisors, and indeed at lot of pressure from the American public and the congress to do something.Chomsky of course has taken a more rational approach and has tried to formulate a quick analysis of what happened and where we have gone wrong. This is a short book but otherwise excellent. It is a question and answer format. I cannot agree with everything in the book but it gives a fair portrayal of many aspects of the problem. In many respects the US has become a rogue nation, pumped up with layer of propaganda and patriot rhetoric that has permitted the government for over 45 years and often with congressional and public support to invade Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Haiti, Kosovo, Iraq, to send troops to Lebanon, to bomb Yemen, Libya, and the Sudan. No wonder the US has enemies. If we are upset about the 3,000 killed on 9-11 what do the Vietnamese think of the 3 million killed in the Vietnam conflict?It is time for a complete re-think of the US foreign policy and the role of the UN and other institutions such that groups and countries will act within a set of internationally accepted laws. Then variations from those laws will be addressed by all nations acting together, not just the US following its own self interests for better or for worse. That is the value of this thin book on 9-11.My humble opinion."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky throws down the facts in this book like vegtable soup. And it's very easy to digest too. In 9-11 the reader gets a delicacy of unique perspective, often ignorned by mainstream medias and authors. Chomsky's answers all the who, what, when, where, how, and most importantly why of the tragedy! He gives compelling reasons which are backed up by substantial factual details on the reasons of why 9/11 happened without justifying the sheer horror of it. We in America, when we turn on the news are often bombarded with unquestioning, flag-waving media outlets, ex. FoxNews Channel, CNN, etc. And Chomsky's analysis of 9/11 is a welcome change to that gross media-machines, who always hold that America #1 view!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Before I review this book I'd like to say a word about some of the other reviews. Many people seem to confuse Doctor Chomsky's indictment of the government with his love of our country. It is ironic that so many \\"Americans\\" can confuse our right to criticize our government with being anti-american. There is nothing MORE American than reflecting upon our own policies and actions and speaking out when we disagree with any of them. It is disgusting to me that \\"americans\\" view anything that disagrees with or criticizes U.S. government policies as \\"anti-American\\". Jingoism is alive and well even though most \\"Americans\\" would have to look up its meaning.As always Dr. Chomsky cuts right to the heart of the matter. While acknowledging the horror and tradegy of human death (Americans and non-Americans)caused by terrorism, he points out correctly that the U.S. is the world leader in terrorism and is therefore hypocritical in its rant against the \\"evil\\" terrorists around the world.Is it possible that so many Americans have neither read nor understood Orwell's 1984? I think it likely!Once again, thank you Dr. Chomsky. Like yourself I love America but despise the un-American men representing her."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"If many of the reviewers here are Americans, this may be cause to reinstate faith in the American Public. Empires and power structures will come and go, and the US is no exception as history has proved consistently. However, People like Chomsky will probably be remembered long after George Bush. As some reviewers have commented what the US is doing has been done all along in History and dirty politics are definitely not exclusive to the US today. What is noteworthy is that those in power ofcourse get all the coverage today. But nature has a way of correcting these abberrations in its own patient way. Let us not forget a prime example of a man condemned as a common criminal without lawyer or cousel and executed 2 thousand years ago. History and time have provided the appropriate coverage in due course. Rome and Jerusalem of that time are ofcourse long gone and the people responsible sentenced to eternal infamy.Chomsky is doing what history will do in due course anyways. Those who have exclusive access to the podium today may be wise to heed the lessons of history."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"As has been stated in numerous reviews prior to this one, this slim volume by Chomsky is a collection of edited interviews in the immediate aftermath of 9-11. Perhaps the most salient quality of this short book is the fact that it attempts to critically analyze and elucidate some of the underlying factors that seem to trace a trajectory toward the terrorist attacks on NYC and D.C. I'm sorry, but any rationally thinking human being should be able to understand that these attacks were not simply a matter of \\"terrorists who hate freedom and what America stands for\\"; it's much more complex than that. Unfortunately, at this time in our history, it has virtually become VERBOTEN to ask the question 'Why?' vis-a-vis 9-11. Despite some of the rather hackneyed and noxious accusations made by previous reviewers (e.g., that Chomsky \\"hates America,\\" is \\"an apologist for the terrorists,\\" is \\"cashing in on 9-11,\\" etc.), this book is a good starting point for a critical analysis of that horrible day."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I would have liked this book to be a little more in depth, like some of Chomsky's other talks conducted after September 11th. But I can also understand the need for him to get this book out right away, in order to help educate Americans about the true nature of our foreign policy in Afghanistan.Chomsky reviews the root causes for the September 11th attacks in this set of interviews, while provoking a thoughful analysis of how American policies may better prevent future terrorism. This approach is not meant to \\"blame America\\" or show that Chomsky \\"hates America\\" in the least, for anyone that's interested in the truth. The real point of this book is to help Americans understand the facts behind the \\"War on Terror\\" and how U.S. foreign policy hurts innocent people in Afghanistan. Why in this book, does Chomsky focus almost exclusively on U.S. atrocities, and not other countries atrocities one might ask? The answer is simple. As Americans, we have a direct responsiblity primarily for our own actions and how our tax dollars are used, not for anyone elses. I was happy with how concise this book was, but I would also recommend reading it along with many other critical perspectives by other members of the \\"left\\" (for lack of a better word) in order to understand other points not specifically adressed here.Overall, this is a great book for anyone looking to understand the \\"War on Terror\\". Anyone labeling it \\"Anti-American\\" is just living in the clouds. Chomsky is just being honest, (like usual) and he should not be subjected to name calling or criticism for telling the truth. If you have not already picked this book up, get it right away. It's a quick read, and worth the money."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"If you want the other version of the truth read this book, it is not a slap in the face, it is Hard Truth. One thing that many of us do not realize is the way a foriegn country will react to our actions. This Book reveals that very accurate thought reasoning in open detail. From reading this it may be a trite reason for all of us to accept that certain nations will respond to our policies, meaning we should be careful for ourselves from what others will do to us if we intrude. Sure, there is absolutely no excuse for 911, what needs to be looked at is how to prevent it from happening again, one way is to be aware of what these primitive minded terrorists and religious fanatics will do if we make a certain intrusive policy. You don't step on a snake with bare feet, it will bite you, and if you have protective shoes, it will find a way to get you. The snake does not know any better, and neither do many of these people who would like to ruin us. We need to wake up to that reality, not everyone is as intelligent as we are. That is what I got from this book. I do think that is an accurate real life summary of anything or anyone who slaps people around, the other will do something. It's horrible that thousands had to die for this primitive way of thinking, but that is real life we have to obviously be more wary of. This book brings this to light in a very Bold position, of what the primitives could and can do to us, not what we would normally think they or anyone would do. We have to accept that primitives are in great numbers, and they do not have our way of thinking or reasoning. This book says , be careful.A book that offers a tremendous peace solution and even predicted the terrorist attack is SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox, I believe this author has a potential remedy."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Noam Chomsky has spent a lifetime sharply criticizing U.S. Foreign policy. And he's still going strong. In the first few weeks after 9-11, he was interviewed a lot about the event. This small book consists of transcripts of these interviews and was rushed into print while the smoke was still settling over that big hole in the ground where the World Trade Center used to be.There's nothing essentially new in these musings. Chomsky believes that American imperialist interests are responsible for most of the ills of the world. He feels that 9-11 was the result of a volcano of unrest that was just waiting to erupt. There's a bit of \\"I told you so\\" in his analysis, and an attempt to weave it all together - Nicaragua, Vietnam, and the history of the world. Some of it is understandable and I find myself nodding in agreement as he discusses the wars and turmoil that has always existed. According to him, the only difference in what has been going on forever is that, for the first time, the victims are different. And because the victims are American, he feels he can blame the victims. Well, not really the \\"victims\\"; it's the American government he targets.He also warns against bombing Afghanistan. He sees it as just playing into the perpetrators' hands because this will even give more fuel to the fire, make them hate us more and leave us open to more and more attacks. His warnings and pronouncements seem gloomy indeed. But are we supposed to do nothing?I live in downtown New York. I saw firsthand the horror of 9-11. I smelled the burning fires for weeks. And I've finally stopped looking for those tall twin towers, which used to be part of the landscape I saw every day. I remember the photos of the victims posted on billboards and lampposts and the faces of despair on us all. All those victims did was go to work one Tuesday morning. They were just living their lives, not part of an international conspiracy - office workers and waiters, shopkeepers and fire fighters. A lot of people died that day. It was awful.It is my understanding that every action has a reaction, a rippling effect that causes further reactions. War and conquest has been going on even before the discovery of fire. We're awfully nave if we think that's going to change. And yet, I applaud the idealist in Professor Chomsky. He wants to change the world for the better. That's what keeps him going. And the book \\"9-11\\" is the latest of his efforts.Do read it. It's small and easy to follow. It's a frightening perspective for the future. And yet, there's an underlying message of hope. Recommended."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Even though the book consist of a set of interviews the author gave in the aftermath of the horrible attacks on New York and Washington, it is highly interessting and readable. Everyone who wants to get behind the usual rhetorical war against terroism should read this book.Noam Chomsky makes a good case against the moral reasoning which is behind the so-called \\"war against terrorism\\". By referring to a lot of examples, where the U.S. has broken world laws, acting as a terrorist state, he shows clearly why the USA cannot win the war on moral ground, even though it pretends to.The morality which is behind the attacks on Afghanistan and the war on Iraq, which is soon to come, is shaken heavily by Chomsky's arguments.The book does not intend to say that the attacks on America were justified by its own actions around the world. It merely says that if you want to understand why we were attacked last summer, we have to see why we are so hated."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This is book is collection of Interviews by Noam Chomsky given before and after the attacks on the WTC.I found this book a little too brief and would recommend to first time readers of this author to read some of his other work and then come to this particular book.This book is nonetheless an Interesting view to take on the events that are discussed in it."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This slim Chomsky book has a lot of important information in it --- unless you've read Chomsky before. If you know anything about US foreign policy, this is a recap. If you've never read Chomsky before, this is an okay place to start. (A better place to start is Chronicles of Dissent.)What does it have to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks? Well, Chomsky gives you a lot of context. He shows you that these events didn't take place in a historical vacuum. But once you've read that, it's up to you to learn more, by reading dozens of other books."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book may be small, but it contains a lot of information. Information we all know to be true and factual but which we somehow have been told to ignore by the enormous U.S. media/propaganda machine. What Chomsky is saying in a number of different interviews with radio stations in different countries and through correspondence, is that the U.S. is the single worst terrorist state in the world today. The only state to be found guilty of it by the World Court. He is able to back this up with irrefutable facts, i.e. Nicaragua, Indochina, Angola, and Kosovo among others.A very disturbing example of this is the U.S. bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. A little footnote of U.S. terror, quickly forgotten here but well remembered in the Middle East and Africa. The subsequent deaths this caused by lack of medication is well into 6 figures.There is also documentation that the CIA was offered a large file on bin Laden's operatives by Algeria but were rebuffed.The fact that the U.S. also sponsored bin Laden and his ilk in the Afghan war with the Soviets starting in 1979 is also known, but quickly forgotten. At that time bin Laden was considered a friend of the U.S. and a \\"Freedom Fighter\\".For anyone who wants a factual background as to why this attack occurred on Sept. 11 this book fills the bill.Chomsky, as always breaks through the rhetoric, propaganda, and spin.I will read this book several times."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book reek's. Right off the bat when the author is asked, did the attacks of 9-11 change the geopolitical scene? he just cant help his anti-american views, he spouts off how the U.S. annihilated million's of people, conquered half of mexico, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines killing hundreds of thousands of filipinos.

Although Chomsky leaves no question that the actions of bin Laden and his \\"associates\\" (his way of referring to the Al Qaeda organization) are \\"horrifying atrocities\\", he is also quick to point out that the United States itself has a long history of state-sponsored \\"terrorist\\" acts, citing in particular our past involvement in Sudan, Nicaragua and Bosnia. He downplays our need to invade Afghanistan, contending that our primary objective in response to Sept. 11 should have been to hunt down the individual terrorists rather than drop bombs on a country already devastated by decades of war and oppression, sending its people into further destitution. This course of action, according to Chomsky, has only served to prove to other nations that we are indeed the world's \\"leading terrorist state\\".The most prominent flaw in his argument, in my humble opinion, is that the alternative Chomsky suggests, seeking justice by means of a global manhunt supervised by the UN and followed by a trial before the World Court, is a concept which sounds good in theory but in all likelihood would work out poorly in practice. ... we've successfully managed to flush out the Taliban ... so perhaps his point is on its way to being proven. In any case, Chomsky sets the floodgates loose on a much wider range of issues beyond [the] need to obliterate bin Laden and his Al Qaeda cronies off the face of the planet. ... it would be in our best interest to examine our own nation's conduct in the global arena."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"The man is always spot-on.

A fine purchase for the first-time Noam reader."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"The book is brief (96 pages), but it's substantive content is even less than that. Anyone who's read Chomsky's articles knows what is going to be said here. The United States government and the terrorists are morally equilvalent, regular Americans are too ignorant to understand the Middle East, somehow Bush is to blame, it's Israel, stupid, and so on. Nothing particularly new here. There's the typical left-leaning commentary about how we should cut our support for Israel (an &quot;apartheid state&quot;) and drop sanctions against Iraq. There's also the moral equivalance argument where Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush are just as bad as bin Laden/Hussein. I'm not particularly offended by of Chomsky's claims. He's just wrong.Unless you are a Chomsky lover, like the majority of the students in my graduate history courses, stay away from this book. Chomsky's reputation as America's foremost dissident and intellectual has gone to his head. Instead, how about buying one of the substantive books about the Middle East crisis? Check out Bernard Lewis, Chaim Herzog, Amin Maalouf, Simon Reeve's &quot;New Jackals&quot;, or anything by Ahmed Rashid.

He has a knack for cutting to the quick, summing up extremely complex international political situations succinctly and comprehensibly. And he certainly doesn't beat around the bush!But five years down the line, though most of his predictions have sadly proved true, this book is clearly outdated. Owing to its structure, moreover - a series of interviews with journalists asking more or less the same questions - it's rather repetitive.Now I'd like to know his thoughts on the situation in Iraq - and Somalia...."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"The book is premature, inasmuch as the action against those who perpetrated the September 11, 2001 atrocities is still ongoing. It is far too soon to sort out causation and effect. This fact would properly daunt an objective historian. No matter how much one may disagree or agree with the author's frequently novel viewpoints, and those he elicits, the fact remains that the episode is too fresh to allow a reasoned analysis.One may fairly conclude, and will conclude from an objective reading of this opus, that Chomsky, as was the case with many of his other works, has jumped the gun in an effort to promote his own subjective opinions to the prejudice of more reasoned efforts at a later time.This may suffice as effective propaganda to some, but it is no way to record history. Given the fact that the struggle is ongoing, it is a mere, nakedly political attempt to influence the course of events rather than report upon or analyze them. I do not recommend the book for that reason. I believe that its purchase is a waste of better-used resources."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"A very worthy point of view for those searching for an understanding of the global position of the U.S. today."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Much of what I read here I was already aware of, that being the American public, by and large, has no idea what our government has been doing abroad in our name for the last 30 years or so. Chomsky's commentary can be summed up as this, I think: while the American people didn't 'have this coming', our country's hands certainly aren't clean.Chomsky details the shady alliances our government has made in the past, most notably with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, who now of course are our mortal enemies. We helped both of these individuals with training and technology, something that doesn't get much emphasis on television.I think one of the more salient points Chomsky makes is that we (the US) believe we have the freedom to act any way we wish, and that the rules (of the so-called 'international community') don't really apply to us, even though we say we support them. International law, Chomsky says, should apply to all states -- as well it should.Conservative talk radio likes to dismiss people like Chomsky as left wing ideologues who &quot;hate America&quot;. Read this book and judge for yourself. I don't agree with everything Chomsky says, but his arguments are certainly well thought out. His responses are, in my mind, better than what we've gotten as the official reasons for the attacks from our government, viz., that these people are just &quot;evil&quot;, or that they &quot;hate our freedom&quot;. At least Chomsky doesn't insult your intelligence."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I guess you could split political ideologies into two equal but very different aspects. Those that believe in the Human Spirit, and those that believe in Human Nature. From those who would argue Human Spirit, they would have us believe that there shouldn't be winners or losers, that are against Free-market Capitalism, that everything must be redistributed and equalized or else you will have Terror. From those who argue Human Nature, they would say that it is the nature of Humans to want to aquire and build personal wealth so that they may give that wealth to their children so that they may have a better life. Thus, you begin the great political split between the Democrats and the Republicans in the United States. P>Noam is a brilliant man, or he wouldnt' be teaching at MIT. However, his book clearly outlines his overall agenda based on the Human Spirit. His unwillingness to recognize that the whole world doesn't play by the same set of rules makes me reduce this rating on his book to just two stars."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"If the revelation of the extent of the killing fields in Cambodia (more on this later), or the mass graves concealed in Serbia didn't dissuade Noam Chomsky from continuing his bizarre career of spinning conspiracy theories and whitewashing murderous ideologies, it is definitely too much to hope for that the deaths of 3,000 people in a well-orchestrated murderous attack might provoke some thought in his mind, while sitting in his decidedly non-plebeian mansion. No such luck.If anything, this book illustrates just how deeply old Noam has withdrawn from the world. There is little in it that one could not find in his prior works, and I got tired of reading his discussions with fawning interviewers who throw him softballs. Of course, he writes of Afghanistan as someone who has never seen it (I'd lay money on that) and certainly as someone indifferent to the damage wrought by the Taliban on that country. The Chomskyite Left doesn't really care about human suffering in the vast majority of instances when it does not flow from Western action - he may occasionally cite the failure to intervene in Rwanda as proof of Western or American malevolence, but (diehard followers pay attention) does anyone think that he would have supported an intervention there?Once again Chomsky trots out his tired characterization of America as a terrorist state. But he doesn't really look at events in question besides viewing them casually as items on a list. Context is important. Why? See what one author has to say about this, when examining the crimes of Communist rebels in South Vietnam:&quot;I don't accept the view that we can just condemn the NLF terror, period, because it was so horrible. I think we really have to ask questions of comparative costs, ugly as that may sound. And if we are going to take a moral position on this-and I think we should-we have to ask both what the consequences were of using terror and not using terror.&quot;The author? A younger, less guarded Noam Chomsky. Apparently terror is OK if inflicted in the name of &quot;the people&quot;. But going in and rooting out a terrorist-sponsored regime in Afghanistan is inexcusable.He's done this sort of thing before. One chapter of his career that is deeply embarrassing to his acolytes occurred when he savagely attacked emerging reports of genocide in Cambodia. When refugees published accounts of Khmer Rouge atrocities, he attacked those accounts, while praising pro-Khmer Rouge works by Western Marxists (a Google search on Khmer Rouge and Chomsky will reveal more information). Some Westerners admitted later that they were wrong about the Khmer Rouge; Chomsky never has, though his praise of them was written guardedly, as if in anticipation of future denials.Readers looking to learn about the world will find this book tiresome and disappointing. But if you care more about the Cult of Noam than the actual world his writings distort, don't let me stop you from buying this book and helping him pay the mortgage on his mansion. Go ahead, once you have it, you can read it forwards and backwards and sideways and even upside-down. It will be very enlightening . . . because you want it to be!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I am deeply heartened to see that Noam Chomsky's small paperback, \\"9-11\\", is selling exceptionally well, despite the usual critical reviews from his detractors. Although it was written soon after the events of that date, before all of the relevant facts had emerged, Chomsky's sure and articulate grasp of the situation makes for enlightening reading.Chomsky writes at length about the plight of the innocent, war-torn Afghanis, and about the people of many other countries, like Nicaragua and Haiti, who have been victimized by US policies. Reading his account should give pause to Americans who may be swept up in patriotic flag-waving and the ill-considered, narrow rhetoric of Bush and his advisors like Rumsfeld.Chomsky takes a world view and strives for an informed, balanced outlook. He writes of the extreme importance of not being intimidated or swayed by hysterical ranting or lies; to stay as closely as possible to the path of truth and honesty, and to acknowledge the human consequences of our acting, or failing to act.This book is must-reading for all concerned Americans. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"While reading this, I got the feeling that the publisher decided to rush it into production right after 9-11. The book is a series of transcripts taken with Chomsky about the events of 9-11. The questions themselves are generally disconnected, and Chomsky often answers by referring to some of the other books he wrote (which was of no help to me, since I hadn't read any of them). There is nothing in the way of a comprehensive analysis of the events. No good argument about why it happened or what we can do.Having said that, the book does present a few interesting ideas. Chomsky refutes the popular idea that the attacks were due to globalization, and offers supporting evidence in a few places. So if you're interested in that, you can get the book. And for the rest of us, if we haven't read anything of Comsky prior to this, we needn't bother."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky concedes that the events on 9/11 were horrendous but drives home the point that the United States has committed even worse attrocities throughout the world. To demonstrate his thesis that the U.S. is the most vile terrorist state in the world (superceding even the Taliban), Chomsky focuses on the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan that destroyed half of the country's medicine production and silently killed thousands while halting the trend of moderation in the country and plunging back into fanatical warring which has now culminated in genocide. In addition, Chomsky hones in on our decimation of Nicaragua in the 80's near the peak of communist hysteria when the leftist Sandinista's were rapidly accruing public support. As Chomsky repeatively emphasizes, the United States is the only country to ever be condemned for international terrorist by the world court (1986).Not only does Chomsky expose the hypocracy that lies beneith the interminable \\"war on terror,\\" he also mentions that it was the U.S. (among other capitalist nations) who organized, trained, financed, and armed the most extreme Islamic fundamentalists to slaughter the Russians who were lured into the \\"Afghan Trap.\\" The \\"blowback\\" from our actions have been felt all over the world--after expelling the Soviets this new fundamentalist organization directed its attention towards oppresive regimes more influenced by capitalism than Islam. This same group relates the U.S. occupation of Saudi Arabia (country of Mecca) to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and their primary goal has been to drive the oil coveting interest protectors from the holy land. Hence the reason Bin Laden's networks brought jihad to the country that created them.The only problem I have with this book is that is was released way too soon after the attacks. Instead of predicting America's reaction, Chomsky should have waited to criticize it.. (for example, he suggested that a dazed and confused america would be open to questioning and freedoms would actually increase--this of course, before the announcement of the \\"patriot act\\")I highly recommend this book..."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book is one of the worst pieces of moral relativism I have ever read in my life. It's a political tract on the supposed evils America has imposed on the world, which meanwhile ignores the immense good the U.S. has generated and the U.S. aid (food, health care, drugs, agricultural assistance, etc.) from which people around the globe benefit daily.Just as the book avoids discussing the victims of 9/11, it avoids the facts surrounding both the worst terrorist attack in world history and its perpetrators. Chomsky is uninterested in Bin Laden or the Islamic extremism that created him and his cohorts. According to this book, everything bad is America's fault.There are lots of errors, too. According to Chomsky, America's attack on a Sudanese \\"drug plant\\" --- which in reality produced biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction --- was calculated destruction of much-needed drug supplies for Sudan's beleaguered population. Yet, Chomsky ignores the Sudanese government's perpetuation of terror, genocide and enslavement against its south Sudanese black, animist and Muslim populations. If you are a humanist, please readSilent Terror,Escape from Slavery,Let My People Go, andDream Freedomfor the details.But to Chomsky, U.S. policy must be considered in a vacuum --- where it is always, and can only be --- bad.Chomsky also repeats earlier falsehoods concerning U.S. support for Israel. Chomsky advises us to stop supporting a nation whose largely hostile neighbors have sought her destruction for56 years.As for Iraq, while the war had not started when this book was written, Chomsky condemned U.S. sanctions, and ignored Saddam Hussein's ruthless mass murder ofIraq's Kurdishand other populations, or his orders that henchmen perpetratemass rape. Subsequently, Chomsky did not care about thefreedom relishedby Iraq's masses after Hussein's defeat. Rather, his perspective lacks all balance.Presented as questions which the author purports to answer, this book requires readers to have a firm enough grasp of history to see through Chomsky's --- what can I say? --- creative historical reconstructions.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I enjoyed these interviews of Noam Chomsky immensely. I found that they were sane, balanced, and well-researched. A lot of the people who gave this book poor reviews probably did not even read this book- Chomsky in no way condemns the attacks or makes them seem okay. Granted, he didn't go into how horrible the attacks were or stories of those who died, but that is not the purpose of the book. The purpose of the book was to go into the reasons for the attacks, our role, and how we can/could have prevented the attacks. He also compares our international terrorism to the attacks on 9-11. But by doing this he is not saying that bin Laden's attacks are acceptable; he is saying that bin Laden's and our terrorism are both unacceptable. Anyway, I find it hard to believe that one can ignore or argue out of Chomsky's main reasoning against the war- that more people dying and more violence and more starvation in the middle east will just mobilize more desperate people to bin Laden's cause. Just read the book yourself, and no matter what your political beliefs are, keep an open mind."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky points out that the attack of September 11 was unique in that for the first time since 1812 U.S. territory was attacked. He says that Pearl Harbor really dosen't count because Hawaii was not mainland U.S. and was a colony. The U.S. has slaughtered millions and millions of people from its inception as it exterminated the Indians, conquered half of Mexico, conquered the Philipines and Hawaii, intervened to support the slaughter of millions of poor people around the world. Europeans have also slaugtered millions of poor people around the world on even greater scale and up until 1945 spent a great deal of time slaughtering each other.Chomsky asks: Why do they hate us? Well it's a complex question. He dismisses the self-serving bunkum about how they hate us because we are such a wonderful democracy or whatever. Instead he turns to the Wall Street Journal which several days after the massacres surveyed wealthy Arabs with close links to the West. They found that there was alot of resentment even amongst the upper classes at U.S. and Western propping up of feudal dictatorships which stiffle civil society and prevent development and which help send the oil wealth to the region away from their people and to the West.They also, like the poor in the Arab world, are bitter about U.S. killing of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis while strengthening Saddam Hussein and his apparatus as well as continuing to provide Israel with advanced helicopters to massacre Palestinian civillians. The U.S. true committment to democracy in the Arab world was shown starkly in October when it was revealed that our kindly Secretary of State Mr. Powell had been pressuring the dictatorship in Qatar to &quot;rein in&quot; Al Jazeera, the only independent television station in the Arab world.He also provides some very good stuff on the Sudan bombing in August 1998. Clinton's bombing of the Al-Shifa medical factory has according to wide estimates from impeccable sources killed tens of thousands of people who had made use of the factory which produced fifty percent of Sudan's medicine ,ninety percent of its most crucial medicines and all of its veternarian supplies. He also cites news reports that the Sudan had arrested two people in connection with the bombing of the African embassies in August 2000 which precipitated the bombing of Al-Shifa and had offered an immense database on Bin Laden and his top goons but because the U.S. state department so violently hated the Sudanese government they refused the offer and Sudan released the suspects after the bombing of Al Shifa.He has an interesting response to a question from one of the interviewers in this book about the celebrating in Palestine or wherever else after September 11. He notes what the jubilation in the U.S. media after the U.S. backed Suharto seized power in Indonesia in 1965 and proceeded to slaughter at least a half a million &quot;communists&quot; i.e. landless peasants. Or when Nicaraguan voters finally voted out the Sandanistas after the U.S. proxy army had been deliberately destroying their civillian infrastrucure and killing thousands of civillians to the applause of the media. The U.S. of course escalated its terrorist war against Nicaragua, as similarly in El Salvador and Guatemala, in 1986 after Nicaragua obeying international law went to the World Court which ordered the U.S. to stop its slaugter and pay substantial reparations to Nicaraqua. Of course, Nicaragua is ruined probably forever. Its elections were recently subjected to gross interference on the part of the U.S. embassy which was campaiging for the ruling right wing party and against the now pro-capitalist and utterly decadent Sandanistas as having links with terrorist organizations.Well, of course as he says the U.S. immediately ordered Pakistan to cut off truck shipments and food aid to Pakistan after Sept 11 over the intense objections over international relief agencies. The bombing campaign almost completely ended food assistance in Afghanistan. The U.S. air drops which according to news reports were suggested by PR advisors are very paltry among other problems compared to the seven million people who need assistance. Thousands almost certainly have already died, in addition to the possible thousands of civillian casualties....."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This is excellent material from Chomsky.

In leu of a well-thought out exegesis, we find a jumbled collection of email interviews and remarks. For an issue as serious as this, one would think Chomsky could make an effort at scholarship. But Chomsky, so used to preaching to a loyal choir, has no had to make any scholastic effort for a long time. Moreover, this book is shallow in its understandings of the complex dynamics of the Middle East. Chomsky, having little experience or knowledge in this area, is notably useless as a Middle East commentator or in explaining what motivates jihadi terror. His area of expertise--uncritical blame and Leftist demonization of the US--is likewise not very enlightening. This book is proof that Chomsky can publish almost anything, even some emails, and his loyal fanbase will always buy it.

Academics have rigged the system by voting themselves lifelong jobs. What a fraud and sham. Do you have lifelong job?Tenured jobs are for life until they drop dead. Basically, welfare for burnt-out intellectuals.

I can't agree that with Chomsky that we shouldn't have played a role in Afghanistan during the 80's. It was a good way to indirectly hurt the Soviet Union. But our previous administrations foreign policies failed to protect us with what happened on 9-11. If something remotely similiar happens again, then the Bush administration has failed. The book is good to read if you are open-minded and not-biased against or for the US, Israel, or who ever. Chomsky makes the US look bad so if you the American thats refuses to accept our wrongdoing don't read it. If you are anti-Bush and whatever, reading it might fuel your bias. If you are more moderate then its a great book to give you some things to think about but don't take everything to seriously but seriously don't outright deny any possiblities."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Thousands of people died in the September 11th attacks yet not many in America seem to care WHY. Well I care and Chomsky cares and you should too so that it won't have to happen again.Other reviewers have more eloquently stated why this is a most important book. Short and to the point because there is nothing complicated and long winded about why those horrible attacks took place. It is all out there in broad daylight for anyone who wants to wake up and look. I love it here in America, but make no mistake that everyday people all over the world die for American interests. You don't [tick] someone off enough to want to kill themselves by being the \\"brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world\\", you do it by being the exact opposite. Years of death, starvation and oppressive economic embargos led to those attacks.How do you cash in on 9/11 by selling a book for [money]??? You don't. Others have though with their [expensive] coffee table photo albums (now that's disgusting) and their [even more expensive] terrorist emergency kits. There will always be a market for big color pictures of death and destruction. Too bad there never seems to be much of one for preventing it. Popular media won't talk to him so Chomsky has to publish his thoughts in print in a little pamphlet that every American should read."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Noam Chomsky may be a world class linguist, but that doesn't make him any more qualified to address the aftermath of 9-11 than, say, the world's leading dog trainer or the world's best plumber. That's not to say that his ideas and thoughts aren't valid or interesting, it's to say they are, in actually, no more informed than anyone else's and just as subject to personal predilections and prejudices as anyone else's, just like the plumbers or dog trainers would be.Chomsky's predilections and prejudices are decidedly anti-American. He believes that the US is a leading terrorist state. His view of 9-11 events is thoroughly and pervasively colored and influenced by that world view.It's not that he doesn't raise good questions-he does. It's that his conclusions are based not so much on objective fact or thoughtful consideration of the situation as they are the inevitable logical extension of his radical political orientation and beliefs.Chomsky asks: Did America's policies and behavior create the coditions that gave rise to 9-11? Chomsky's answer: America is solely responsible. In what way? Chomsky's response: In every way! America is evil, evil evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In part, no doubt America's policies and behavior did help create the events of 9-11. Hoiwever, I don't buy into the \\"America-love it or leave it!\\" mentality, but neither do I buy into the \\"America is evil incarnate\\" mentality. Unfortunately, it seems that all 9-11 material to date originates solely from one of the above enumerated points of view. What's really needed is a thorough, thoughtful, objective, historically and politically researched and-most of all--balanced analysis.This isn't even close on any of those counts."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Noam Chomsky refers to many events that are generally not found in commonplace media that most Americans are hooked to. Hardly any history text book refers (or will ever refer) to such happenings. This book is interesting if you want to know a bit about many of the recent state sponsored criminal acts around the world. You are not likely to know such stuff through TV.However, Chomsky, being a linguist, finds it very hard to stay with easly readable language. This book is a compilation of his interviews. Even then, the sentences are so long and so confusing at times that it becomes difficult to figure out what he wants to say. His language is not easy for everyone."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I found this work to be a compelling read. It gives comprehensive information about all countries and parties involved. It makes a clear argument that the events of September 11 were a crime against humanity and should be judged accordingly in a court of law. That in fact operation \`enduring freedom' may be increasing the risk of terrorism on United States soil rather than reducing it.He also gives detailed information on American foreign policy that is largely lacking from the media. It is my belief that if the American public where more alert to the atrocities committed by there own government, they would be shocked and dismayed. It is crucial that we make ourselves very aware of all the facts. That way we can each make an informed opinion about the current course of action. In this regard I found this book invaluable."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Americans have a right to be mad-as-hell, but no right to bomb-the-hell out of anyone else. Nor do our politicians have the right to declare open-ended war against any country of their choosing. It's hard to keep perspective following an atrocity like the twin towers, but keep perspective we must if we are not to repeat the same slaughter of innocents as the perpetrators of the attack. Applying standards of procedural justice is crucial to a fair and effective reckoning. The atrocity should be treated as a crime against humanity, not as an opportunity to launch aggression against entries on an administration hit-list. As an international crime, the machinery of world justice should be brought to bear on the perpetrators wherever they may be hiding. They should be tried and punished in a world court of law, not in the dog cages of Guantanamo. What's good enough for victims in Kosovo should be good enough for victims in New York. The alternative, to wage war against suspect coutries without clear standards or honest diplomatic effort, will only prolong the suffering, create more enemies, and militarize our society. Is the unhobbled supremacy of Corporate America worth that price.Chomsky makes the case in clear and consistent terms, refusing at the same time to undergo an historical lobotomy as prescribed by the president. Nor is the irony of an architect of global terrorism declaring war on itself lost on the author. Probably no word in our lifetime is now so exploited as that tortured term. Despite media filtration, there is an alternative, as Chomsky shows, to the present destructive course and its fog of misdirected jingoism. Though a quickie and somewhat disjointed booklet, 9-11 presents the kind of perspective unavailable in the mainstream, and for that reason should be read. The urgency becomes even greater as Bush and Company plot more conquests, more adventures, and more weapons of destruction, leading to who knows where. Though the president and his bullies would force a choosing of sides, there remains a more civilized path. The global community must insist upon it."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"In other words, this is not the stuff of NBC News. I begin with a quote from the book:&quot;Nothing can justify the crimes such as those of September 11th, but we can think of the United States as an 'innocent victim' only if we adopt the convenient path of ignoring the record of it's actions and those of it's allies, which are, after all, hardly a secret(p 35).&quot;This short book is a transcript of email conversations with Chomsky. Many who are not familiar with Chomsky's work may be too quick to call him callous due to his style. He is not one to overzealously repeat obligatory statements so as to appease and pacify possible critics who would question his patriotism. Instead, Chomsky wishes to illustrate the &quot;B-side&quot; of the current crisis which is often bankrupt in most media.Crucial premises among his talks include the idea that the U.S. did not take the legal route towards our response to 9-11 becuase it would lead to questions about the recent history of U.S terrorism (he gives a sampling) as defined by U.S. Codes and organizations such as the World Court. He discusses the comparability of 9-11 with other U.S. created disasters such as the Al-Shifa plant in Sudan (with it's resulting death count reaching into the tens of thousands). Interestingly, he discusses U.S. intelligence failures that may have led to the prevention of 9-11, such as Clinton's refusal (due, according to the CIA, to his &quot;irrational hatred&quot; of the country) to accept Sudan's critical information regarding many members of the Al-Qaida network.Chomsky also questions the current Realpolitik phenomenon of American anti-Islamic Fundamentalism while we currently support Islamic Fundamentalist regimes, such as in Saudi Arabia, which are just as despotic, especially to U.S. &quot;noble ends.&quot;It seems that there is more of a pause among Americans in response to the bombings of 9-11. This is in sharp contrast to the American reaction to the Gulf War incident over a decade ago. Books such as &quot;9-11&quot; by Chomsky perhaps gives us a bit of insight as to why there is more of a &quot;pause.&quot;"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This is another one of those Chomsky books that comes from a number of interviews done with Chomsky. It only has interviews conducted in September and early October so there's not much in it in regards to the \\"war on terrorism.\\" It has a lot of the usual information that Chomsky gives out about America's role in different areas of the world and how that could easily be seen as \\"blowback\\" in what happened on 9-11.He discusses a lot of the legal ways we could go after terrorists, but as we all know, that hasn't been done. He points out all the things Nicaragua tried in attempts to alleviate American terrorism on their soil (Nicaragua went to the World Court, which ruled in their favor, ordering the US to desist and pay substantial reparations, but of course the US dismissed the court judgement and responded with an immediate escalation of the attack. Nicaragua then went to the Security Council, which considered a resolution calling on states to observe international law. The US alone vetoed it. Then they went to the General Assembly, where they got a similar resolution passed with the US and Israel opposed two years in a row).He brings up one issue that I hadn't heard about and that's how humanitarian aid was being affected very early on. In quoting the NY Times he stated,\\"Washington has also demanded (from Pakistan) a cutoff of fuel supplies...and the elimination of truck convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to Afghanistan's civilian population.\\" He brings up numerous reports from NGOs that called the \\"humanitarian airdrops\\" things like \\"a propaganda ploy rather than a way to get aid to Afghans who really need help\\" and that air strikes \\"had halted the only means of getting large volumes of food to Afghans--overland truck convoys\\" of the WFP.One other interesting point he brings up is America's attempts to censor the Arab-speaking world's only uncensored news source--Al-Jazeera.It's not a book full of new information (although some of it may well be for some--it is full of stuff that isn't often discussed in our mainstream press, but stuff that you'll have probably read if you've read much of Chomsky), but basically presents the case for a peaceful way to fight terrorism and what America's done to receive this \\"blowback.\\""},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I really wonder if the Library Journal reviewer bothered to read the whole book, or just stopped when he found that Chomsky was departing from the post-9/11 unquestioning acceptance of the 'US vs. the evildoers' party line.&quot;Chomsky condemns the attacks specifically and then suggests that the deaths are entirely the responsibility of capitalist globalization&quot; - That is a complete misrepresentation; Chomsky repeats several times that Bin Laden and his ilk don't care about globalization. What has created anti-American sentiment around the world, in Chomsky's view, is a US foreign policy dictated by the interests of energy companies, and which supports brutal, anti-human rights dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries because it guarantees access to cheap oil. This book was written before the recent US takeover of Iraq, but Chomsky's arguments are quite prescient..."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"If you haven't read Chomsky before, this is a decent introduction to one of the most controversial public commentators of our time. You'll want to read more of his work when you're finished with this.The book is a collection of interviews with Mr. Chomsky conducted between September 11 and October 15. It will be a long time, if ever, before we are able to make sense out these attacks given the images the media floats before us. We instinctively look for answers that are both safe and comforting. However, too many people died on 9-11 and since for us to accept the easy answers. We must have the courage to look fearlessly at ourselves and the rest of the world.Despite, or because of the focus on 9-11, Chomsky delves into the past fifty years of world history, particularly regarding U.S foreign policy. As always, he allows the facts to speak for themselves. In this sense he is much like I.F. Stone. When the Kennedy administration was testing nuclear devices and claiming that a test ban was unenforceable because such tests were not detectable, Stone simply read the newspaper. The government argued that we would have no way of knowing whether the Soviet Union violated a test ban. Stone pointed out that in the same newspaper (I believe it was the New York Times) which carried the Kennedy administration's position on page one, the back pages carried short and unheralded reports from as far away as Australia that geologists reported their seismographs had clearly recorded the test. Chomsky works out of the same tradition. While other commentators attempt to put a spin of one sort or another on a story, Chomsky relentlessly places the facts before his readers and asks: what do these facts tell you?He also insists on applying the standards the U.S applies to other nations to the U.S. If another nation claimed that the deaths of tens of thousands of children are an acceptable byproduct of its foreign policy, we would, of course, deplore it. Madeline Albright defended U.S. policy toward Iraq in those words. When our friends in Indonesia, Angola and Central America use tactics we label terrorist when used by bin Laden, our presidents call them \\"freedom fighters\\".Chomsky does not blame the U.S. for the 9-11 attacks. Terrorists are responsible for their own acts. He does, however, demonstrate that the U.S. conducts itself in a manner that helps create a world in which terrorism is not only acceptable but flourishes.His insistence on focusing on the facts and applying standards universally maddens his critics. Nothing is left for them to do but call him names.This small book is a big boost for democracy."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky is disturbing to many people becasue he asks the difficult questions. When most of the U.S. media is focused on retaliation, bombs, attacking Afganistan,then looking for the next area in the world to bomb, Chomsky asks, Who is served by this response. The British govenment did not bomb Belfast in retaliation for the IRA attacks, or Boston, which was the source of most of the IRA funding. More to the point, however, is the history of Nicaragua where the U.S. was obviously the aggressor against a fellow republic and was condemmmed by the World Court for unlawful use of force, i.e., state terrorism. Then the U.S. and Israel vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on the U.S. to desist. It is why the U.S. for the first time in history was not included among states which respect human rights in the last U.N. report. The brutal attack on the helpless population of Afganistan is not an action which shows the U.S. as a nation which respects international law or the integrity of others nations or its peoples. Nor has its purpose, the apprehension of Bin Laden, been accomplished.Those who find Chomsky disturbing tend to be folks who do not read news or opinions outside the U.S. Dialogue on controversial international subjects tends to be circumscribed by the media in the U.S. and the limits clearly set out. Few students of history have read The Irish Soldiers of Mexico by Michael Hogan or the Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galleano which are required reading for most international students. Both books show a history of U.S. forceful interventions which would certainly make reflective readers see more dimensions and more appropriate responses to terrorism than retaliation which results in the collateral damage of tens of thousands of innocent lives."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book is a series of softball questions seemingly designed for Chomsky to belt out of the political ballpark where well constructed \\"answers\\" are a means of pushing his political agenda which paints the government as nefarious evil doers while casually shrugging off critics as \\"idiotic\\" or \\"laughable\\".This is Noam Chomsky.So why do I rate this book 4 stars? I do so because I have to be honest with anyone who is going to read this review. I will always contend that delivery is a large part of any book. Because of the delivery, this is a 4 star book and not a 5 star book. But it doesn't take away from the underlying message which Chomsky tries to send.What is that message? Anyone familiar with Chomsky will know that his ultimate message is this. Motives and actions of the US government are frequently underhanded and inhumanitarian. He contends that our government routinely practices terrorism (government defined) and that major media outlets ignore the reality of how our government operates in various theaters of the world.Chomsky's message, despite his delivery, is one that is often hard to counter and lined with truth. The hard part about reading this book is that Chomsky demands you believe him 100% and dismisses any disagree with him as uneducated, uncaring, or evil.I think it's easy to see Chomsky as an anti-rhetoric rhetoric machine. In an effort to counter the rhetoric of the US government, he does that which he criticizes. The government says \\"war\\" and Chomsky says \\"slaughter\\". He practices what he claims to despise.A second Chomsky flaw is hand waving off counter arguments. Instead of attempting to debate an argument, he points to other texts and claims that the proof is there. Instead of attempting to take on issues head-to-head, he bobs and weaves with vague references which are not readily available to the reader.My third complaint with Chomsky is his insistence that he knows the unknowable. In one instance he says the government has a \\"program of silent\\" genocide. Additionally, through the book he states (as fact) what Bin Laden wants to come of the 9-11 attacks, while later claiming there is no proof Bin Laden was involved. Alluding to these facts instead of calling them what they are, namely opinions and speculation, is what he builds many of his points on; points which rest on a suspect foundation.My basic problem with him is that despite it all, this is still a very good book. Chomsky is a good thinker. He is well read, well informed, and sometimes well spoken. He doesn't need to resort to these tactics, yet he does. Chomsky is like a teenager in his maturity level at times, belittling those who don't agree with him and hand waving his way through topics by saying things are so obvious it's foolish to bother explaining.What is good about this book again?Now to some of those points I refer to when I claim he does have a good message beneath the childish rhetoric. Considering the time frame, a mere 7 days after 9-11, Chomsky correctly predicts that Israel would eventually use the Bush anti-terrorist rhetoric to step through a huge hole opened when he declared countries as either with or against the US.In understanding the element involved here, Chomsky also suggests we should strive to apprehend the wrongdoers and attempt to comprehend the forces at play. When Chomsky says we should try to, \\"Understand and address the cause,\\" I'm right there with him.Additionally, he elucidates a great thought which entails the continued oppression by the US and Israel of Iraqi and Palestinian people, respectively. In continuing these oppressive actions, many people look at the US and the Israel with disdain. When Bin Laden speaks out against these acts of oppression, even those who hate Bin Laden identify with him. His latching on to these key points, and the US government's continued actions to support what he says, rally a large part of the Arab world against the US.These are the points that Chomsky brings to light. Similarly, when people, no matter how hated by society, speak out against the US bombing of a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant - the same plant that supplied half the country with its medication - people listen and begin to foster strong hate towards the US.The book helps in giving you a better understanding and perspective of US actions and their consequences. What would US citizens think if they knew what our government was doing in various arenas of the world? Again, it goes back to trying to understand the impetus for 9-11.Chomsky reminds you of the question which occasionally plagues you. Why do we support Saudi Arabia, the center for much of this anti-American sentiment? Why did we support Iraq in the 80's? The Mujahadin in the 80's? Chomsky's point is this. Why do we stop asking these questions even though we know what the answers are?Back to Chomsky. Yes, he is unobjective. He will never present the reader with a balanced picture. Yes, he selectively looks at history through his one-eyed microscope to prove his point, even drawing on history 40 years past to support anti-US opinions of today. And yes, he will beat his selfish \\"I am right you are stupid\\" drum incessantly.But the reality is this. When you cut through all of this, his message is clear and hard to refute. It's not a rosy picture out there, just beyond the fingertips of what you can see, hear, and read every day in the media. The citizens of this country are implicitly supporting these atrocities that go on in the world by not questioning them. And in his petulant and annoying manner, Chomsky reminds you what the questions are and why you should be asking them.I clearly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book couldn't come at a better time. I've read other works by Chomsky, but I appreciated the brevity and cutting edge analysis that is needed to help see through the fog of distortions, propaganda, and lack of historical analysis that is used to gain support for what Chomsky calls a terrorist attack on the innocent people of Afghanistan.Though Chomsky repeaditaly states that the 9/11 attack is unjustfied, he rightly argues that if we fail to understand the context of such an attack, then we're doom, like the state of Isreal, to live without any hope of peace and justice. Throughout the various interviews reproduced in this book, he maintains that &quot;we should recognize that in much of the world the U.S. is regarded as a leading terrorist state, and with good reason. We might bear in mind, for example, that in 1986 the U.S. was condemned by the World Court for 'unlawful use of force' (international terrorism) and then vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on all states (meaning the U.S.) to ahdhere to international law.&quot; What the U.S. has done or supported in Vietnam, Granada, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Sudan, El Salvador, Chile, occupied Palestine, etc. constitute a recent history of political terrorist repression, whereby hundreds of thousands of innocent people, especially women and children, have been killed primarily to protect the political and economic (e.g. oil, coffee) interests of the United States.Chomsky reminds us that the current war is nothing new or partisan. The attack on Afghanistan is/will be 10 times as devistating as Clinton's attack on the Sudan in which the &quot;death toll from the bombing has continued, quietly, to rise...Thus, tens of thousands of people--many of them children--have suffered and died from malaria, tuberculosis, and other treatable diseases...&quot; And this attack as we must remember was done based on the same current erroneous reasons given for the current attack on the people of Afghanistan and Irag--all three in persuit of a despotic leader.Not a supporter of the Islamic fundementalist bin Landen, Chomsky does remind readers of the history of the U.S. in Afghanistan whereby in the 1980s, the U.S. trained and funded networks to committ a &quot;holy war against the Russian occupiers....By 1989, they [the Mujahidin, in which bin Landen was a principle leader] succeeded in their Holy War in Afghanistan. As soon as the U.S. established a permanent military presence in Saudi Arabia, bin Landen and the rest announced that from their point of view, that was comparable to the Russian occupation of Afghanistan and they turned their guns on the Americans, as had already happened in 1983 when the U.S. had military forces in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia is a major enemy of the bin Laden network, just as Egypt is. That's what they want to overthrow, what they call the un-Islamic governements of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, other states of the Middles East, and North Africa. And it continued.&quot;This type of history and analysis provides us with the context for 9/11--one that we simply will not get from watching or reading the dominant media. While many may argue with Chomsky's analysis, he nevertheless provides the necessary rebuttal to what, in my view, is the perfect war for someone like the unelected president of this country.Finally, the only problem I have with this book is that Chomsky or the editor should have provided documentation for the many &quot;reports&quot; refered to in this work. Without identifying specific sources, Chomsky weakens many of his arguments, for we simply don't know where he's getting his information."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Much of the material on \\"9-11\\" from the talks Chomsky gave shortly after and made it into this book can easily be found on the internet for free. The material in the book is decent and I understand that 7 Stories Press wanted to get out a book on this most important event in a hurry... But for those really interested in reading Chomsky's core political critique and philosophy I'd recommend turning to the new \\"Understanding Power\\" or \\"Profit Over People\\" which are more representative examples of his work."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I was particularly anxious to read this book after observing the controversy pertaining to it. An iconoclastic leftist journalist-author attacked Chomsky for softness toward what he termed Islamic terrorist fascism, contending that the MIT linguist was in a sense apologizing for 9-11 by contending that it occurred as a result of U.S. policies.Chomsky begins by pointing out that 9-11 placed America, for the first time, in the same position it was in 1812, when it last faced a direct attack from an enemy force on its own shores. In the earlier instance the invading force was the British army. He then makes a prescient point, delivering a fervent hope that the U.S. would not fall into the trap of responding with such overwhelming military force that the minions of Ossama bin Laden would derive a propaganda benefit. Regrettably the response was not as precisely targeted as should have been the case. Whereas 3,000 lives were lost as a result of 9-11, some 3,500 Afghan peasants died during the American bombing campaign. In addition, many other Afghans flooded the Pakistan border in the wake of the firepower, creating a refugee tragedy as the number soared to one million.Chomsky also mentions the tragic element of blowback, in this instance relating directly to bin Laden. Following the dangerous doctrine of \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" the United States initially under Jimmy Carter and later, with great gusto, under Ronald Reagan, provided Afghan rebels with stinger missiles, which led to shooting down Russian planes, which ultimately led to the moderate Soviet-backed regime being supplanted by Islamic extremist forces, and finally the Taliban. Bin Laden was vigorously involved in that campaign as a field commander and was aided directly by the CIA. Would it not have been better to stay out of the conflict? Was a Russian-supported government not infinitely better than the fiery dragon which ultimately emerged?Chomsky constantly hits the note that what is needed to defeat murderous terrorism is international cooperation, pointing to the cowboy antics in Nicaragua where, amid death squads, drugs, and runaway CIA activity, President Reagan referred to the murdering Contras as \\"the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.\\""},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This is a collection of talks and interviews so it lacks the political models and theories that Chomsky applies to U.S. politics and media that are found in his larger and more in depth works.This book is probably best suited for the moderate dissident or progressive who has read only minimally on the subject. This text has nothing to do with 9/11 conspiracy theories or the 9/11 truth movement.What it does contain is context to help people put the 9/11 attacks in perspective. During the Russian occupation of Afghanistan the U.S. and others armed, trained, and funded several radical Islamism groups to engage in low intensity conflict with the Russians. Many of these groups ascribe to a purist form of Islam that deems any foreign influence in Arab lands as an abomination. These groups were not particularly popular among Arabs, but through foreign support they became quite powerful militarized organizations.Since then they have been doing more of the same, which is basically fighting a holy war against imperialism in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are constantly being targeted by them. These groups have dissolved and reconstituted themselves and have had a variety of names over the years, they fight each other and are mostly funded by drug profits. Al Qaeda is one of these organizations. They had very little power before they received foreign support to fight the Russians.Basically the people we gave the guns to do our dirty work turned them on us after they had served their purpose.In the book, Chomsky advocates a peaceful approach to resolving the conflict, predicting the negative affects on the civilian populations that result from military conflict will lead more people to sympathize with Bin Laden's cause. The bombing Afghanistan halted U.N. food aide shipments to the millions who are starving there, resulting in unknown death tolls. While the Arab world was overwhelmingly appalled by the events of 9/11, taking it out on civilian populations (unintentionally, incidentally or otherwise) will only increase support for Bin Laden's efforts.This prediction has been proven true by a NSA report two years ago that said as a result of the war in Iraq Al Qaeda has increased in number and organization and we are now more at risk of an attack as the result of our actions.After reading all the one star reviews, would estimate that at most 4 of the people who left them have actually read the book, and every single one of them misrepresents Chomsky's views completely.If you're interested in this book, read it and form your own opinions."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I am a big fan of Noam Chomsky, and if you like to read a short book about 9/11 and the lies and deceptions attached to this tragic event, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I've long been a fan of the political analysis of one Noam Chomsky, as well as his interview based books such as &quot;What Uncle Sam Really Wants&quot;, and &quot;Secrets, Lies and Democracy&quot; so I was quite looking forward to sitting down, and having a read of this, his latest interview based book. I was a little shocked however that it seemed to be little more than a cash-in on Chomsky's status as an intellectual than anything else.Though the interviews were good -- many done by foreign journalists -- they really seemed to lack in the analysis department, and offered little critical commentary on the current &quot;War On Terrorism&quot;. I would have much preferred to have waited until many more facts were known relating to the 9/11 situation, and it's aftermath in a much better thoughout book than to have read this...what's even worse is that the majority of the interviews were done prior to the October 7th airstrikes!I would recommend this to those wishing to get a better idea of Chomsky's ideas, but I wouldn't recommend this to his fans who really would expect a lot more in the way of analysis."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I find it humorous that one \\"patriotic, America loving\\" reviewer wanted to charge Chomsky with treason under the Patriot Act, even though the Constitution clearly spells out the criteria for treason, the only crime it explicitly defines. You would figure that someone who loves America so much would find it abhorrent to circumvent the Constitution like that.It is completely illogical to equate questioning America with hating America. If you had a family member you thought was making a grave mistake, you most certainly would speak up. I see no difference in this case. In fact, I think it would be treacherous if someone who thought a loved one was making a grave mistake stayed silent, instead of trying to help. America is great because everyone is free to express their opinions, and remains viable because Americans can sort out valid opinions from trash. There is no need to censor them, bad opinions will simply marginalize themselves. If Chomsky's words are those of a loony radical, then people will disregard them. However, if there is validity to them, which many seem to feel, then they are a constructive part of American political discourse.Chomsky doesn't defend terrorists, he just points out that it isnt the hatred of freedom that spawns them. Our foriegn policy (especially post WWII) has alienated and aggravated a large number of people around the world. That doesnt justify the actions of terrorists, it just helps explain why these people are so determined to destroy us.Overall, I think this is a solid book, although I am not a huge fan of Chomsky's writing style."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book and its author try to provide people with right information.

Chomsky reminds that the US has at times celebrated attacks on other lands that have killed thousands of innocent people as well.) Please don't mistake Chomsky's comments for sympathy for the attacks on New York or Washington. Chomsky readily agrees that the attacks are terrible - &quot;horrendous&quot; is the word he uses. But he warns that a swift and violent retaliation by the US is exactly what bin Laden would like so as to recruit others to - what Chomksy again describes as - his &quot;horrendous&quot; cause.All Chomsky is asking is that we look to cause and effect and accountability: the US has been violent to other countries, and the violence has now come to the US (Chomsky notes that, sadly, it is not the scale of the attacks, i.e., the amount of people killed, that makes September 11th stand out, but the fact that for the first time in a long time the guns were pointed at a superpower nation). Violence is wrong, Chomsky says. So all sides need to take a look at themselves and realize that violence only breeds violence."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Now that I get a chance to reread this volume after almost four years, I don't know what I was thinking the first time I reviewed it!By the way, the reason I give it four and not five stars is that, because it consists of a number of interviews, it can be repetitive.Oh, and for those who gave those one-star reviews and comment on how Chomsky \\"hates America,\\" go back to your Jack and Jill magazine and Sean HATEity and bill o'lielly shows. Your reviews are so transparent as to be laughable. Especially those who comment, \\"Chomsky just got on the bandwagon RIGHT AFTER 9/11 to make a buck.\\" He \\"did so\\" because media all over the world were interested in Chomsky's opinion on the subject.Perhaps most important is that Chomsky fits the 9/11 event into a context. It didn't happen from the blue: Some god-hating Muslims attacked the humanitarian, warm, cuddly US and we're just helpless victims.Remember that we have some US military bases in Saudi Arabia, one of our butcher client states, in which some of the holiest of Muslim grounds are located. How would Catholics react if the Saudi Royal Guard set up a base in the Vatican? Yeah...That bin Laden's movement was trained and authorized by our friends at the CIA is well known, despite a few one-star reviewers who deny it. (Isn't it difficult to remain SO ignorant?) So, did we bring this onto ourselves, the proverbial \\"blowback?\\" Something to think about very seriously.Very important: the predictible American response--covered also in \\"The Lies of George W. Bush,\\" is that bin Laden and his cronies attacked the US because of our freedoms, our \\"democracy\\" (yeah...), our ability to buy SUVS, you know, the stock response. I agree with Chomsky that bin Laden couldn't care less about such issues. He's a religious fanatic--not unlike that guy in the White House. Such proclamations of our freedom may make us feel good about ourselves, but that's irrelevant so let's not even go there.And to me it's pretty common sense that more violence, e.g., a contrived war on Iraq, is going to stimulate terrorist responses, again despite what some one-star reviewers are commenting (after watching another Gunsmoke rerun, I imagine.)Perhaps the most eye-opening revelation is the lengthy answer to the question on the book's page 43 regarding the US as terror state. Suffice it to say, the Sudanese would have given us information that we could have used to stifle 9/11. But we were simply too good to accept it.To deny that the US is a terrorist state is to buy the \\"mainstream\\" line on Nicaragua, also on Iran, Guatelama, Cuba, et al. Oh, and \\"terrorist\\" we have conveniently defined. So Chomsky reminds us to look in the mirror.Some have suggested that Chomsky frees bin Laden of responsbility. Utter nonsense (and proof positive that those reviewers haven't read squat.) Chomsky acknowledges that what happened was a terrorist CRIME and needs to be treated as such. Would, he asks, the Irish bomb Boston, the source of many of the IRA donations, after an IRA bombing? No. They'd pursue the bombers and hold a trial for their criminal acts. (Now, much later, of course, we see what's happening in the \\"mission accomplished\\" Iraq, but that's for other volumes still).Again, the book is a little repetitive. But it's important that you read this to fit 9/11 in context, and to be able to examime what needed/needs to be done to make us safer, NOT provide more Al Qaida members than bin Laden thought possible in 2001!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book is outstanding for its clarity and common sense. It is obvious that Chomsky loves his country. It's very patriotic to speak out and tell the truth about what the government does in your name and with your money. Americans have a glorious history of dissent, especially in times of war. I highly recommend this book and intend to loan mine out until it becomes worn and tattered."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky has long been known to compile books of various interviews relating to a specific subject, and '9-11' is another fine adition to that ever-growing list.What '9-11' gives us is Chomsky discussing the actions of 9/11, their meaning, and consequences to the whole of American social, economic, and political ideals. Throughout the interviews (most done with foreign journalists) we are given a complete piecing together of the puzzle called foreign policy, and America's well-known history of supporting terrorism, and committing acts just as vile -- if not more so -- than those committed on 9/11.Read this book without the blind sense of patriotism I'm sure many have you have fallen into."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This sudo-book (closer to a phamphlet) is very important in a world where it is taboo to question the US government without shouts of \\"terrorist\\" comming up. It is rather repetive, but this can be attributed to the fact that these are interviews assembled by a third party, not a book/essay by Chomskey himself. None the less, it does detract from the reading. In short, an interesting set of oppinions with solid factial backing."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Sobering and unsettling pronouncements jump off the pages (ALL the pages) of this work. Colin Powell, in an interview shortly after the atrocity, was asked \\"Why do they hate us?\\" Powell responded to the effect that they hate us because we love freedom. Powell is well-liked in this country -- but somewhat naive if he truly believes his own statement. Such short-sightedness permeates our culture and we need to apprise ourselves of the complexities of world affairs. We also need to face the fact that the U.S. (along with Israel) voted against a UN resolution condemning terrorism. Can we handle the truth that the U.S., since the end of World War II, has BOMBED forty countries? That millions of innocent civilians around the world have died as a result of our adventures. That Uncle Sam has been in bed with rather unsavory characters like Suharto, Noriega, Hussein, Bin Laden and many leaders of supremely repressive regimes. Chomsky helps us to realize the inescapable conclusion: the United States is the world's foremost perpetrator of terrorism."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Noam Chomsky's book '9-11' is a relevant critique of the WTC and Pentagon disasters that will prove to be an eye opener. While I have read various bits of Chomsky's work (including a video of Chomsky's lectures), I favor his view. I have overall little interest in political science, and so much of what Chomsky brings up in this book is new to me. Yet, this did not stop me from catching the underlying theme of what Chomsky is saying: that America is, by definition, a terrorist state. This is what makes Chomsky so controversial. I believe Chomsky makes this statement purely out of objective fact of the US Code. What is purported through the media as the definition of terrorism is that which is attacked against us, or to those nations we \\"like.\\" It is not a popular belief that this works the other way around. Aside from this, Chomsky addresses the the possibilities of why it happened, and what the possible consequences of \\"war\\" may be. Making many analogies to past events and relating world patterns that may prove useful in understanding our current situation. The book is short, but packs a good deal of information where little is repeated. Like most Americans, the events of September 11th had a impact that will be remembered, perhaps for the rest of your life. I highly reccomend this poignant book as it will illuminate some of the myths surrounding the events, as well as give you a keen perspective of what our country is doing without our knowledge."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Few commenters on American political life are more astute than Noam Chomsky, famously referred to by the New York Times as \\"arguably the greatest living American intellectual.\\" Since the attack on the WTC, he's also become (arguably) the most reviled American intellectual.Chomsky-bashers would do well to read this instant book, rushed into print in the wake of the attacks in September 2001. Cobbled together from a string of interviews with the world press, 9-11 shows Chomsky at his best: a thoughtful, compassionate analyst of terrifying world events.9-11 is flawed. The editors seem to think we have the IQs of porch light moths. In chapters taken from overseas interviews, references to events in those countries are followed by bracketed reminders that the interview took place in that country. Elsewhere, the editors place unnecessary notes saying they've excised material repeated elsewhere in the book, as if Chomsky's words were holy writ to be edited trepiditiously.Still, 9-11 is invaluable. Chomsky abhors the loss of life committed by 9-11's perpetrators, and asks us to similarly abhor the murderous acts committed with our tax dollars in our names. Perhaps the single most valuable part of the book is Chomsky's analysis of Bin Laden's ideology. While some have imputed anti-globalization motives to Al Qaeda, Chomsky will hear none of it. Pointing out that bin Laden \\"has probably never even heard of globalization,\\" Chomsky says that Al Qaeda \\"has as little concern for... cultural hegemony as they do for the poor ...of the Middle East who they have been severely harming for years.\\" To read progressive intent in the atrocities of last fall, says Chomsky, is to \\"wallow in self-indulgent fantasies.\\" 9-11 is a salutary antidote to some of the pronouncements of the American left in the last year, and well worth reading despite the obstacles the book's editors place in our way."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"In this diminutive book, world renowned linguist Noam Chomsky responds to questions posed by journalists (many foreign) following the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States. It should be emphasized that these \\"interviews\\" (mostly conducted by e-mail) have been edited and revised for publication in book form so that included are quotations from journalists and commentators to support Chomsky's arguments, quotations that would not necessarily have been at the ready during the interviews.In reading the political Chomsky one is struck by his almost singular desire to focus on the short-comings of the United States and to balance terror against the US with terror by the US. Several times in the book Chomsky calls the US \\"a terrorist state.\\" This is a view that many in the world find persuasive, especially those who have experienced the use of force and violence by the US, or even those who believe that they are being exploited by the US economically. And one can argue from a definition of \\"terrorism\\" as Chomsky does that the US has committed acts that are terrorist in nature.But the same thing could be said of every significantly non-isolationist state throughout human history.The problem then with Chomsky's critique is not so much that it is false, but that it is unfair. He does not take into consideration what another people or another nation state would do if they were in the position that the United States is in. We can imagine how Nazi Germany might deal with terrorist attacks were it the only superpower left in the world. We can speculate on how the Soviet Union would handle the First and Third Worlds had it won the Cold War. We can even imagine how France or China or Iraq or a hundred other countries might behave had they the opportunity (and the responsibility) of being the nine-hundred pound gorilla in the jungle of nation states. Would any of them do a better job than the US? Would they be more humane and kill fewer people? Would they take less for themselves and leave more for the underdeveloped, undereducated and vulnerable peoples of the world? Or would they take more, and more brutally repress challenges to their position and prerogatives?No one knows the answer to these questions, but Chomsky seems ignorant of their relevance. In a sense he argues from the position of an ideal that does not exist in the real world. He argues not from an ivory tower so much as from a pearly gate. And I would like to remind him that the United States is the only country in the history of the world to rebuild the societies of the vanquished as we did after World War II, and as we are trying to do in Iraq.I also think that Chomsky is mistaken in his belief that an armed response to terrorism only brings about more terrorism. On page 64 he quotes London Times journalist Simon Jenkins as saying that \\"what the perpetrators of the Manhattan slaughter must want above all\\" is a massive military assault that would kill many innocent civilians. Chomsky adds that such a slaughter would \\"mobilize others to [bin Laden's] horrendous cause.\\" I think it is more likely that others would be mobilized to further terror against the United States if we did not act at all. The point is to respond as EFFECTIVELY as possible. This is what the US is trying to do. Whether we have the skill and the knowledge necessary to be effective against terrorism remains to be seen, but clearly we are steering a course between mass murder and doing nothing, which is really the only reasonable course.Finally, I don't agree with Chomsky's idea that a proper first response to terrorism is to look into the causes of terrorism. The causes are murky and multitudinous, often triggered by social pathology. The first response is to make terrorism a high risk venture for both the perpetrators and their supporters and to take defensive measures to protect ourselves from them. Then, and only then, can we look into the social, political and economic causes of terrorism and see what we can do to change them. Be assured that as long as the US is rich and powerful there will be those who out of jealousy and hatred will want to harm us. No amount of perfect behavior on the part of the US will change that.While I have a great respect and admiration for Chomsky as a linguist--his demonstration that the basic structures of language are mostly innate attributes of human beings and not something learned is one of the great scientific insights of the twentieth century--I don't think he is entirely effective as a political commentator. Nonetheless I think we need him as much as we need, say, ex-army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, whose views on terrorism (see his recent Beyond Terrorism) may be contrasted with Chomsky's."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Noam Chomsky has been applying basic logic and a single moral standard to analyzing international relations and the official justifications for U.S. foreign policy since the Vietnam War. Rather than assume \\"my country right or wrong,\\" Chomsky condemns the U.S. government when it does wrong, which unsurprisingly is all the time. Why unsurprising? As Lord Acton said, \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" As the philosopher Karl Popper said, \\"[t]he history of power politics is nothing but the history of international crime and mass murder...\\" The U.S. emerged from WWII as the greatest Empire in history (which was no accident, but the result of cold realpolitik planning), and has used and abused that power ever since. This little book is a necessary antidote to the wave of blind patriotic propaganda following the 9/11 attack, but I doubt that it will persuade anyone not already in basic agreement with Chomsky.For those who want to read a more in-depth analysis by one of America's leading dissidents, I recommend \\"The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism\\" (1979) and \\"Deterring Democracy\\" (1991). On the Middle East, there is an updated edition of \\"The Fateful Triangle\\" about the U.S., Israel and Palestine (originally published in 1983). The key source on U.S. planning during WWII is \\"Imperial Brain Trust\\" by Shoup & Minter (1977), now out of print.

The reason is they cannot imagine his imaginings. To them, the United States is the greatest country in the world bar none, the most caring, the one with the most opportunity, its culture is more diverse and open than any other and it is, above all, eminently practical and can-do.Now those attributes may not be attractive to academia but they are what has sustained us for over 200 years. Chomsky has left a once-promising career and moved into his own fantasy world lock, stock and barrel. In the Universe according to Noam freedom is oppression, slavery is liberty and happiness is stupidity. It never fails to amaze me that the folks who protest our Western culture, its pluralism, freedom, democracy, solutions through ballot and not violence, diversity, would not be allowed to open their trap in a society run according to their dictates.People say \\"this is not a blame America\\" book. Of course it is and then again it is a brazen attempt to cash in off that tragic disaster. Although the corporate world is, for Chomsky, the second rung of hell, he doesn't mind accepting a few coins along the way. Amerika is the new imperialist power in case you have forgotten. We practice evil capitalism, plundered markets, poverty and the sheer dumbness of the American people. One could ask, \\"Why do plain folk risk their lives to come to this country and not try for, say, North Korea or Cuba or one of the many Arab dictatorships?\\"His \\"historical\\" arguments remind me of those creationists who start with a premise then change the facts to match the desired outcome.

It is basically a collection of interviews and essay concerning the events of 9/11.

Bin Laden, however, and a good number of his cronies are not Palestianian ghetto dwellers. Bin Laden is a wealthy Arab who had many political connections. The reasons behind the terrorism may very well be more religious than political.Chomsky has moved beyond criticism and analysis of American foreign policy to outright condemnation of the US, its government, its people, and Democracy itself. This book is a vicious attack launched from the ivory tower, paranoid and unreasonable.There may have been celebration in the Chomsky household when the twin towers fell, but for most of us, sympathy and understanding for terrorist groups is out of the question.

Chomsky relates how the 9/11 terrorist attacks are nothing new to the world, simply stating that such massacres have been perpetrated by one country against another for hundreds of years. This will rile-up many people, but Chomsky points out that what was really unique was that \\"FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE GUNS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED THE OTHER WAY.\\" European Powers colonized most of the rest of the world in the late 1800's and the early 1900's but they were never under attack from the countries that were taken over: \\"England was not attacked by India,nor Belgium by the Congo, nor Italy by Ethiopia, nor France by Algeria...\\" Other information given is that it was the CIA who covertly recruited and brought together the most radical Islamic Fundamentalists during the 1980's to fight in Afghanistan, and that these Islamists have been following thier own agenda since 1981, when President Sadat in Egypt was assasinated. Also, according to Chomsky, is that if every country followed what the US is doing in its \\"War on Terrorism\\" countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Lebannon would be justified launching massive bombing campaigns and terrorist attacks on US soil in retaliation for US actions against their countries.

To posit them - as some have done - in a series with Shoah is a blasphemy: the Shoah was committed in a methodical way by a vast network of state apparatchiks and their executors who, in contrast to the bombers of the WTC towers,lacked the suicidal acceptance of their own death - as Hannah Arendt made it clear, they were anonymous bureaucrats doing their job, and an enormous gap separated what they did from their individual self-experience. This \\"banality of Evil\\" is missing in the case of the terrorist attacks: they fully assumed the horror of their acts, this horror is part of the fatal attraction which draws them towards commiting them. Or, to put it in a slightly different way:the Nazis did their job of \\"solving the Jewish question\\" as an obscene secret hidden from the public gaze, while the terrorists heroically and display the spectacle of their act. The second difference is that the Shoah was a part of EUROPEAN history, it was an event which does NOT concern directly the relationship between Muslims and Jews: remember Sarajevo which had by far the largest Jewish community in ex-Yugoslavia, and, on the top of it, was the most cosmopolitan Yugoslav city, the thriving center of cinema and rock music - why? Precisely because it was the Muslim dominated city, where the Jewish and Christian presence was tolerated, in contrast to the Christian-dominated large cities from which Jews and Muslims were purged long ago. Why should the New York catastrophe be in any way privileged over, say, the mass slaughter of Hutus by Tutsis in Ruanda in 1999? Or the mass bombing and gas-poisoning of Kurds in the north of Iraq in the early 1990s? Or the Indonesian forces' mass killings in East Timor? Or... the list of the countries where the mass suffering was and is incomparably greater than the one in New York, but which do not havethe luck to stand in the focus so as to be elevated by the media into the sublime victim of Absolute Evil, is long, and therein resides the point: if one insists on the use of this term, these are all \\"Absolute Evils."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"A short read which is simply a set of interviews conducted with Chomsky after the 9-11 tragedy. Obviously this book wasn't meant to provide any details, there is nothing in this book that isn't covered in MUCH greater detail in Chomsky's other works, and though I like Chomsky's work I feel this piece was rushed to print merely for profit and not for the benefit of the reader (my own opinion). If the reader has little background in US foriegn policy or mid east politics, then this book might prove worthless. But, as an optimist, I have to say that this book does give the reader some information that can be used as a guide to further research. If it weren't for Chomsky's articulation of how to deal with terrorism, I would have given this book only 2 stars. The book is inexpensive and can be read in one sitting easily. So it's okay for curious readers who just want to get the gist of what is rarely (if ever) heard in the mainstream media. 3 stars."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"There is a reason that this book has been at the top of bestseller lists in Canada for the last while: Canadians, likemost other people in the world are exposed to a variety ofviews about US foreign policy and can see for themselvesthat US policy has hurt many people around the world.Chomsky concisely summarizes much of this history andapparently strikes a chord among Canadians. Not ifAmericans became a little more aware of these alternativeviews, the world -- and the USA would be a lot better off!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky&#65533;s credentials in analysing terrorism and international politics are unimpeachable. In this series of interviews, conducted by various international journalists, he demonstrates his knowledgeable grasp of the realities of \\"terrorism.\\" From the outset, he makes clear that definitions of \\"terrorism\\" must include the United States with its history of state-supported acts in various countries, most particularly in the Middle East. He makes us aware that the Middle East population is cognizant of American activities there, even as the bulk of the American public is not. He steadfastly refutes the belief, held by many American intellectuals, that the World Trade Centre attacks are due to resentment over the American push for a \\"globalized economy.\\"Chomsky recognizes that the WTC attacks were unique - never before had an assault been carried out directly on American territory. Pearl Harbour cannot be equated with the 9/11 attack. He cautions that the attacks were not carried out at the direction of a foreign nation. There is no state of war with another country, and the term \\"war on terror\\" is merely political sophistry. Nor, as he reminds his interviewers, is Amerika alone in its negative impact in the Middle East and elsewhere. Each of his interviewers is reminded of the history of their nations in colonial and post-colonial eras.Amerikan machinations were designed to foster the very forces opposed to them now. Saudi Arabia has been a \\"client state\\" of the US since its founding. The Taliban were supported so long as they represented anti-Soviet policies in Afghanistan. And that personification of Evil, Saddam Hussein was provided with weapons, advice and money in his campaign against the Ayatollah&#65533;s Iraq. He stresses the inconsistencies in Amerikan policies. When Oklahoma City&#65533;s bombing occurred and militia groups in Montana and Idaho were identified as likely funders, why weren&#65533;t those states bombed and their governments deposed? Equally, Britain would have been justified in bombing Boston, a major source of funds for the IRA.What, then, is Chomsky&#65533;s recommended course of action? He reminds us that the United States is the only nation that has been reprimanded by the World Court for acts of terrorism against Nicaragua. Although the United States \\"dismissed that court&#65533;s judgement with contempt,\\" Chomsky argues for adherence to international agreements and conventions. He recognizes the Sisyphisian task this presents, but hopes good reporting to the wider public will result in international pressure to bring it about. He knows the American public must be led away from the political rhetoric. These interviews are designed to provide help with that first step to better knowledge and understanding.The format of this book, a collection of interviews taken over a brief period after the attacks, inevitably result in brevity and repetition. Chomsky is not given opportunity to present resources, although his contentions are ably supported by material in the bibliography. These recount acts and policies undertaken in your name and using Amerikan tax dollars. While the change of approach he recommends entails an epic change in mind-set, the revision is neither impossible nor impractical. He stresses that we all need to live together, and unilateral policies will result in greater expense and increased loss of lives. Neither result is practical nor desirable. It takes only political will, supported by the population of the world&#65533;sgreatest democracy, to enable it."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"No one speaks as intelligently and as clearly about such important issues as Chomsky. Well worth what ever the price may be."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Exposer of truths, Noam Chomsky, is back with another timely book addressing the pain, suffering, misrepresentation and subversion ensuing from the events of September 11, 2002 in the United States.9-11 is a compilation of the transcripts of interviews given by Chomsky following the event. Focusing on the event, 9-11 presents the facts as they are, as opposed to how they are portrayed. As is typical for the author, issues are examined with a keen and critical eye neither prone to jingoism nor to rhetorical caricatures. As Chomsky puts it, &quot;We can choose to ignore all the facts and wallow in self-indulgent fantasies...at considerable risks to ourselves.&quot; Which is why 9-11 presents events, facts and root causes free from aggrandizement and ulterior motive. Chomsky, while calling the events of 9-11 &quot;horrifying atrocities&quot;, reminds the reader that there are bin Ladens on &quot;both sides.&quot;In the course of his interviews printed within the author reiterates that in order to deal with terrorism (as with any issue) there needs to be an effort to understand - something lacking in modern discourse.If one criticism were to be levelled at the book, that would be the price tag given that the content is a series of transcripts. Still, as far as intellectual dialogue goes, 9-11 is both a worthy and courageous book."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Although the book is quite unique--being a collection of interviews--the content is more than pleasing. Noam Chomsky is asked by journalists from abroad about 9-11 and the events leading up to it along with an aftermath. Chomsky's opinions are those of a humanist, consistently stating its not necessary for countless civilians to die. In Noam's way, he leaves no room for rebuttal. His statements and opinions are backed with facts that cannot be argued. Purchase this book, quite the bargain indeed!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This is the perfect book both for the Noam Chomsky aficianado and the reader meeting Chomsky for the first time. For the former, some of the positions here will be familiar, but worth hearing again, and for the latter, \\"9-11\\" provides a perfectly engaging and accessible introduction to Chomsky's thought, as no one in the mainstream media speaks the way he does about politics, government and world affairs.The book compiles interviews given by Chomsky to various reporters following the events of 9-11. It's sad how few of the reporters are American and one wonders in the face of Bernard Goldberg's successful book, \\"Bias,\\" why, if the media is so liberal, so few members of the American press interviewed Chomsky, (or Gore Vidal? or Ralph Nader?), following 9-11? I heard Chomsky speak about terrorism and other subjects on CSPAN's BookTV one weekend a few months ago, in a talk that touched on some of what is in this book in fuller form. If you managed to catch that forum, sponsored by FAIR, and liked it, then you will probably like this book also. The interviews here, some of which have been translated, are grouped by subject in a way that is helpful and not at all artificial. Chomsky gives detailed, well-formed answers to the questions asked, most of which, the editor's note informs us, were posed and answered via e-mail.There are few disappointments in this book, so I will dispense with these first to get them out of the way. In a couple of places, Chomsky alludes to comments he's made elsewhere that the editor might have been kind enough to footnote and direct us to. The first appears on page one, no less. Regarding the geopolitical fallout of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, part of Chomsky's answer-and this is only a part-reads, \\" . . . I've tried to explain my reasons elsewhere and won't go into it now.\\" Granted, there is a nice selected bibliography of Chomsky's works in the back from which likely these discussions can be found, but what are we expected to do-plow through all of these books to find them? This is what footnotes are for.Another problem results from the publication lag between press time and distribution (not to mention the fact that is has been very popular and has sold out in some places from time to time). Since some of these interviews took place only days after the attacks, there was not as much known about the players involved as there is now. These interviews pre-date, for example, the well-circulated videotape from what is supposed to be late October showing bin Laden discussing and laughing about the 9-11 attacks. As a result of this time lag, one comment in particular is quite jarring: \\"It's entirely possible that bin Laden's telling the truth when he says he didn't know about the operation.\\" This comes from a September 21st interview. So, if readers maintain an historical perspective, these anomalies shouldn't bother anyone. In fact, Chomsky should be admired for being willing to write so candidly about all of this so soon, and let the book be published while facts were still accumulating. It's interesting to hear an intellectual think through something like this as it's happening.Now onto the book's strengths, which are far more substantial than these few faults. One of the greatest features of this book is that it is a small-scale historical retrospective of 20th century history in the areas of state-sponsored terrorism, US intervention in various conflicts, the CIA, the Gulf War and the Middle East generally. Like a good historian, Chomsky traces current events backward to their causes and fleshes out events in detail. Nicaragua's appeals to the World Court, the UN Security Council and the General Assembly in the 1980s are presented along with the US reactions to each. In greater depth, ten full pages are devoted to recounting and analyzing the story of the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in August of 1998. A surprising revelation emerges at the end of the discussion, showing a direct link between the Sudan situation and 9-11; read it to find out. Chomsky is at his best when reminding readers throughout the book that \\"the literature on all this is voluminous.\\" His book \\"9-11,\\" then, gives just enough to set down the issues, before directing readers to resources where more can be had. In this way, besides covering a topic, \\"9-11\\" also serves as a Chomsky primer of sorts for the open-minded.The book also contains lots of tidbits such as on page 16 the text of the United States Code's official definition of terrorism; in appendix A, \\"the current list of Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (as of October 5, 2001),\\" as well as the legal criteria for designation of such groups, the effects of designation and in Appendix B, a recommended reading list containing Chomsky titles as well as those of others dealing with the terrorism topic. These alone are worth the price of the book; even though the information can be had elsewhere, it's handier here in this slim, attractive pocket-sized book.Obviously, Noam Chomsky isn't for everybody. But anyone who likes Chomsky already will most certainly enjoy \\"9-11.\\" And, if you're not sure whether someone will like it or not, the book is inexpensive and unassuming enough to make it worth a try."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I've read some of the critiques of Chomsky here and whilst not an unreserved fan of his work, I do think he asks some very interesting questions about aspects of American foreign policy that are rarely asked. For some, this makes him a threat since his questions and the evidence he produces often do not sit well with their personal worldview or unexamined opinion of America and its behaviour on the world stage. That he does make people angry goes to show that he is saying something worthwhile, in my opinion. While this book suffers from being a rush production and not entirely coherent in its presentation, you've got ask yourself that if America is so publically concerned with democracy and uses that as a justification to continue the embargo against Cuba, then why does it not do the same with Saudi Arabia - perhaps the least democratic nation on the planet?? I don't condone the killing that occured on 9 11 but to explain in ways that excuse America from having any part to play in the dynamics that created that incident does much to dishonour those who died that day."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book puts the events of 9-11 into perspective against Western foreign policy since WWII. Chomsky reminds us of the USA's own spotted history of supporting/perpetrating &quot;terrorism&quot; in places like Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cuba, Sudan, etc.I have been personally disappointed with the media and the public's overall reaction to 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan since. The mainstream media needs to give more air time to people like Chomsky so his type of views enter the public debate.The book's only real liability (and it is explained several times in the forward and in editors' notes) is that as the book consists largely of interviews conducted by phone/email with reporters around the world, there is some repetition of points Chomsky makes (although the editors pruned a great deal of repetition out, according to the notes). There is also some awkward language, presumably due to English being a second language for many of the reporters involved.Another important book by Chomsky."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I find Noam Chomsky's &quot;9-11&quot; to be a very difficult book to review, but still feel compelled to offer my assessment. First, the basic facts: this book consists of a series of interviews with Chomsky; these interviews were conducted in the first month after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In his comments, Chomsky offers a radically contrary view to the flag waving, &quot;I-support-the-President&quot; attitude that has seemed so pervasive throughout the U.S. Chomsky seems to be assuming the role of the angry prophet who points an accusing finger at a nation (the U.S.) and its leaders. Chomsky's interviewers in &quot;9-11&quot; include many different individuals and media outlets: Italy's &quot;Il Manifesto,&quot; the &quot;Hartford Courant,&quot; Greece's Alpha TV Station, and more.Chomsky does not rationalize the 9-11 attacks, and in fact condemns them as &quot;horrifying atrocities.&quot; But he also claims that the United States' &quot;war against terrorism&quot; is essentially a hypocritical sham. Many times he makes the claim that &quot;the U.S. itself is a leading terrorist state.&quot; To support this contention he cites such history as the U.S. actions in Nicaragua under the Reagan administration. He also discusses at length the Clinton administration's bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan. He criticizes the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan up to the time the book went to press, and discusses other connected issues.The book includes many citations from mainstream media (&quot;The New York Times,&quot; the &quot;London Observer,&quot; the &quot;Christian Science Monitor,&quot; etc.), so one can't accuse Chomsky of just making his claims up. I would also note that David Rose, who is one of the many journalists cited by Chomsky, has a relevant piece in the Jan. 2002 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;; those interested in this book might want to also check out that article.Much of what Chomsky says is compelling. But some of his claims and analogies strike me as flawed. For example, he claims that, in the wake of 9-11, the U.S. should have followed the response model demonstrated after the bombing of the Oklahoma City building. But Timothy McVeigh was not being sheltered by a regime at odds with the U.S., so the comparison hardly seems logical. And his accusation that the U.S. is engaging in an &quot;ongoing process of silent genocide&quot; in Afghanistan also strikes me as hard to defend.The book is, in my opinion, greatly hurt by Chomsky's own tone. He seems to show little compassion for the victims of 9-11; actually, his words have a cold, arrogant flavor to them. Whether this is the fault of Chomsky or his editor, I do not know, but I imagine this tone will only alienate potential readers.I applaud Chomsky for pointing out some relevant data from recent history, and for his willingness to raise a contrary voice in a time of crisis. But there is much in &quot;9-11&quot; that I must question. Despite the book's flaws, however, I recommend it to critical readers who want to better educate themselves on the issues surrounding 9-11."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"By way of introduction, I would like to say that Chomsky is one of the most intelligent and proficient writers in the world. Most importantly, he always assumes an objective view to international conflicts. In this book, Chomsky accounts for the events that led to September 11 attack. It should be stressed that Noam by no means attempts to justify the atrocious attack on World Trade Center. Instead, he seeks to explain why a great number of third world countries view the US as an enemy. Killing innocent people must not be justified under any circumstances; this is irrefutable! Nonetheless, understanding the underlying causes may be of great importance in forming an objective opinion of the conflict. Undeniably, there are numerous aspects of the US foreign politics that are erronous, unjust, debetable and ambiguous! Noam Chomsky provides an invaluable insight into US involvement in international conflicts. The greatest strength of this book is clear and lucid arguments that are supported by empirical evidence!

No, it isn't the same. An explanation is not an excuse. One insane agenda can be the trigger for another without either being justified on any grounds. To unthinkingly accept the righteousness of American foreign policy without considering its consequences is precisely the kind of infantile \\"either/or\\" mentality the American right relies on: \\"You're either with us, or you're with the terrorists.\\" Actually, Mr. Bush, I'm with my conscience and common sense. Open your mind. Read this book. You might not change your views, but at least you'll have tested them against something more than White House press conferences and other forms of infotainment like Fox News. Chomsky condemns the 9/11 attacks, as any rational, moral human being does. But he's brave enough to think seriously about what motivated them, even when the answers might be painful. How brave are you?"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"More and more postmodernist icon Noam Chomsky is coming to resemble no one more than that feckless dand compulsive do-gooder Ralph Nader. Anyway, I saw a portion of this monologue somewhere on public television, and was as rankled and yet also as intrigued by the contradictions that Chomsky represents whenever he speaks or writew, for he is certainly not an easy or uncomplicated scholar or thinker to classify. So too this offering is a mixed bag of observations, threading together a number of points made for other reasons in other works, and so at times can be a little frustrating to work your way through. But bear with it, folks, for Noam, as always, has some interesting things to say.First, he understands very well the degree to which the foreign policy of the United States is an extension of craven corporate business interests, so he always speaks with authority and vision regarding the real motives underlying the reaction of the current administration to the attack on the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon. He also appreciates that the acts by the terrorists were despicable and horrific, and that there can be no exuse for such murderous behavior. So far, so good. One can agree with the logic and examples he cites. He is best when he argues against conventional logic that always seems to result in patently absurd and meaningless acts, like our attacks on peasants in the Afghan countryside.Unfortunately, he sometimes lapses into a style that is neither clear nor coherent by assuming the reader has read things not in the present argument, such this glued-together set of essays does him and his ideas a serious disservice by making them appear less logical and less feasible than one might otherwise conclude. Which is not to say that I necessarily agree with all his precepts or conclusions. Yet I find his attempt to clear the air and present ideas not pre-packaged by some media maven into a neat little sound-bite quite refreshing. As he intimates, the reason the radical muslims hate us so fervently has little to do with our beliefs or our democratic principles, regardless of what the President may claim over and over again. Rather, they hate us because we have sponsored despots to rule over them, enriching the few at the expense of the legions, and we have done so to enrich ourselves at the same time. They don't hate us because we're democrats; they hate us because, in their minds, we are pigs!This is not a book for someone looking for easy answers or a comfortable philosophy or worldview to view current events with. But it is an interesting and provocative little book one can easily devour in an afternoon to get an entertaining ans foten fascinating glimpse of someone who is ready, willing, and able to think , out loud and in public, for himself. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This thin volume (which I came to as a first-time Chomsky reader)has its limitations: it is a compilation of interviews, many in e-mail format, and many with non-American journalists. Because the interview questions all focus on the same subjects, there is a surprising amount of repetition (some of which the editors claim to have elided) for such a short book. Nonetheless, Prof. Chomsky needs to be heard. He is one of the few to question the reasons for the attacks, whereas most commentators wallow in the Hollywood tear-jerker approach of the recent CBS documentary. While Prof. Chomsky often overstates his case, and seems to be relishing his provocateur role, he effectively attacks the inability of the U.S. to maintain what Mr. Clinton called (in a different context) a firm \\"moral compass\\" in its foreign policy. Some of us remember Mr. Carter's attempt to institute a human rights-based foreign policy, while at the same time (according to Prof. Chomsky) his national security adviser was goading Russia into an invasion of Afghanistan that caused tremendous suffering. The fate of Afghanistan is truly horrible and ironic. After inducing the Russian invasion, arming and training the \\"freedom fighters,\\" who then turned to bin Laden (\\"blow-back\\"), our solution was ... to bomb Afghanistan. While artists and intellectuals in Kabul may celebrate the departure of the Taliban, how much suffering was unleased by the U.S. attack? In remote Abdulgan, to name just one area, there was unimaginable misery, as the American bombers flew overhead, oblivious to what was occurring (See Michael Finkel's excellent NY Times Magazine piece from January of this year on the subject of starvation and suffering during the American bombing.) Sadly, those who suffered in Afghanistan during our attacks, whether or not previously allied with the Taliban, will likely join the ranks of the worldwide dispossessed who find it easy to blame the U.S. for their plight. And from their ranks may come the next Mohammed Atta. If this should happen (God forbid), and if Prof. Chomsky's ideas are not considered, our response will be to wring our hands, break out the patriotic bunting, and continue to wonder why in heaven \\"they\\" hate us so much."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Regardless of whether or not you think Chomsky hates America, what he brings to the table is indispensable. He simply points out flaws in America's failed foreign policy, and the consequences of it. Chomsky also brings to light the tyrannical acts of the Taliban, al-qaeda and several others.

And Europe and the USA were not better!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book compiles interviews of Chomsky conducted mostly by foreign journalists (who know of Chomsky quite well, even if he is virtually unknown in his home country, the USA) via e-mail in the days immediately following 9/11. This book was meant to be a timely response and was sent to the publishers on October 15. Its rush to market shows at the edges. If you are not sure why the author's name is written in extremely large type above the title, you had better skip this book unless you are extremely open-minded and very willing to let go of your assumptions. Otherwise, you will be baffled, frustrated, and angered.Regular readers of Chomsky will find familiar themes, such as the United States as a \\"leading terrorist state\\". In searching for an appropriate response, he draws parallels with some of these favorite examples, including the official condemnation by the World Court of \\"unlawful use of force\\" by the Reagan Administration in Nicaragua and the IRA bombing of London.Although Chomsky doesn't excuse the 9/11 attacks - he does use the word \\"atrocity\\" after all - he sounds a bit cold-hearted at times because his main thesis throughout these interviews is that however atrocious the 9/11 attacks were, they pale in comparison to the atrocities of the United States' ongoing campaign of \\"soft war\\" (a euphemism for terrorism when us \\"good guys\\" are committing the acts) throughout the world and the United States' long history of \\"imperial violence\\". He cites such examples as the Clinton Administration's bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and the growth of the war on South Vietnam into the devastation of Indochina. These are bitter pills to swallow, but Chomsky has never been one to sugar-coat or judge, instead preferring to cite his usual parade of concrete examples.Those who are not regular readers of Chomsky will find this book to be utterly \\"Un-American\\" in its accusations. Like most of Chomsky's writings, his foundation of assumptions is clearly a world apart from the typical US citizen's base (although it is not so alien to Europeans, whose journalists are conducting most of the interviews here). His casual remarks, such as the aforementioned labeling of the United States as a \\"leading terrorist state\\", are stunning unless one has read his numerous other papers that back these assertions with a thorough scholarly barrage of footnotes and bibliography. Without such notations, as is the case in this book, these remarks seem as judgemental and baseless as any other propaganda. This book is not a good introduction to the political writings of Chomsky.In addition to these parallels, Chomsky also directs attention directly at the region. He discusses the divergent perceptions of Americans and Middle-Easterners regarding US involvement in the region. He addresses Bin Laden's motives (at the time of publishing, Bin Laden's involvement was still in great doubt as far as the international community was considered) and shows how different they are compared to the popular \\"excuses\\" used in mainstream press, even as he uses mainstream press materials to back his thesis. His direct comments about Bin Laden and Middle-East politics will stand in stark contrast to mainstream news coverage that is still fresh in our minds, including the origins of Al Quaeda.Chomsky has always preferred to keep his emotions and ideology out of his writings, avoiding the name-calling that some of his detractors resort to. But in these interviews, one does see a glimmer of his ideology. He urges peace. Violence responded by violence begets more violence. He tries to maintain scholarly distance by citing history and quoting the Wall Street Journal. But he is human. If 9/11 has done anything positive, hopefully it has made us all \\"more\\" human.Chomsky illustrates, yet again, the oft-confused difference between nationalism and patriotism."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I have never read Chomsky before which, given my leftist leanings and interest in politics, is perhaps surprising. I have a feeling that this book may not have been the best starting point.9-11 is not a sustained critique of US foreign policy and the \\"war on terror\\" but instead an edited collection of newspaper interviews (often foreign media) Chomsky gave in the immediate aftermath of 9-11. Given that Chomsky is often the devil of conservative popularisers what struck me is the lack of bite his interviews demonstrated. It is true that that Chomsky states that \\"we should not forget that the U.S. itself is a terrorist state\\" (p. 40) but, as his discussions makes clear the definition of terrorism (one I do consider fairly reasonable) would encompass a great many different political actors, including many states.It is clear however that events quickly overtook the subject matter of the book to the extent that I see very little real value in the book as it stands today, particularly given the fact that the book has not really been updated in line with contemporary events."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I'm a pretty avid reader of Noam Chomsky, but this book was a disappointment. What I found absurd was his comparison of 9-11 with Clinton's bombing of Sudan. They are not morally equivalent-actually Chomsky actually goes farther than claiming moral equivalence and says Clinton's actions were worse. It should be obvious that the bombing of Sudan was an attempt to kill Al-Qaeda members, not civilians, while the 9-11 terrorists deliberately targeted civilians, in the hope of killing as many as possible. Sam Harris does a great analysis of this book in his work The End of Faith. Todd Gitlin, as far from a right-winger as one can be, also harshly criticized 9-11 in the Nation.I cannot recommend this book.

Of course Bin Laden was a CIA asset. We don't need chomsky to tell us that but, it gets annoying when some people insisting on refuting the claim and use lame official statments from less than credible parties as their source.

My only problem is that at times I wish it was more indepth and this is why I say starter book. The main element that contributes to its lack of depth, which of course given the proper format Chomsky is anything but shallow, is that, if I remember correctly, all of the topics discussed are taken from radio and television interviews. Given the inherent brevity required for these two mediums Chomsky is unfortunately limited by time constraints. Give it a read, though!

Really what I feel the book does best is tells us how the US is truly arrogant in many of its actions. Chomsky states plenty of examples that I believe would be difficult to argue with, and thats where this books real importance is. Chomsky tells of the many atrocities committed by the United States and how the rest of the world reacts to this. Several times he talks on how we act and asks what the reaction would be if other nations did the same. The example of Nicaragua is given, and how we deliberately broke international law, with almost contempt for anyone that should even think we could be wrong in our actions and total confusion for anyone thinking Nicaragua should be able to have the audacity to *defend* themselves from our attack.Also, this book helped me to see a connection with Orwell's \\"1984\\" where (for those of you who dont know) a state tells its people it is at war with one state and friends with another and it has always been this way...then they turn around and say they have never been friends with that state and have always been on the side of the other state. None of the people in the book ever stop and think otherwise. I find this similar to our support of what became the Taliban, which is now our enemy, but none seems to notice or remember we actually started this \\"government\\" and they were an ally at one point. Chomsky takes up this issue several times, along with our support for Saddam Hussein (never mentioning anything Orwellian, that was just me).The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I feel that it was thrown together too quickly, certain parts are repeated unnecessarily, the book is fairly short, and really I would also have liked Chomsky to wait awhile to observe events taking place well after 9-11 to elaborate on, particularly after Bush declared war on the world and signed the \\"Patriot Act.\\" But I guess we will have to wait."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky, as usual, makes comments that the majority of American society hates to hear. If you like to think critically and hear many different arguements on a subject, have an open mind, and instead of blindly supporting a cause or in this case, A WAR, I strongly recommend you read this book. Some comments that Chomsky makes are supported by logical and historical facts; however, others are of course questionable and lack the context in which America acted upon. I only wish Chomsky had of waited until the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; had played out instead of only waiting a number of months to react to the events of 911. The only reason why I don't recommend buying this book is because as you know, the war is an ongoing development and Chomsky's best work on the subject will not come out until deep into the war or after. I say this mainly because it would be interesting to hear what he has to say about the possibility of a war in Iraq. Chomsky is finally getting somewhere in his rants against America and anyone blind enough to not see Chomsky's warnings playing out in the world today, should really ask themselves a question. How would you feel if your country, already war-torn and impoverished, came under attack by a far superior power, killed innocent civilians and destroyed what little remained of the infrastructure because of one man(all concede supported by a political group) and some oil?(convenient how recently an oil line has now been discovered in Afghanistan). Notice how this can apply to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Read Chomsky with that question in mind and some of his &quot;RADICAL&quot; arguments don't seem to crazy anymore."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky is as articulate as ever in condemning the attacks of 9/11 while providing some historical background and explaining how the US might respond if it had any respect for International Law.It certainly does not justify the attacks, but it is important to note that the widespread hatred for the US among Arab and Islamic peoples stems not from their \\"hatred of freedom\\" as Bush Jr. would have us believe, but from very concrete aggressive actions taken by the US and its client states against the people of the Middle East, including the Palestinians, Iraqi civilians and dissidents, and the people living under corrupt and repressive governments in states like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Algeria, to name but a few.Does this rationalize the attacks of 9/11? Never. Does it make them OK? Never.After the OKC bombing, did we bomb Elohim City? The Idaho panhandle? Did we bomb the Michigan militia as part of the \\"network of terror\\" that supported McVeigh? No. We found the guilty parties, tried them, and punished them. The media, meanwhile, explained what motivated them. Did Waco justify the OKC bombing? Never. Is it important to understand the motivation? Yes.Why did we attack Iraq in 1991 to get it to retreat to Internationally recognized borders and to abide by UN resolutions? Why not hold Israel to the same standard? Instead, we provide Israel with billions in military and economic aid, and helicopter gunships to be used in assassinations and state terrorism, like the terrorism committed against the refugees in the Sabra and Shattila refugee camps under the direction of Ariel Sharon in 1981, and the terrorism that continues to be directed against Palistinian refugees in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.Why did we mine the harbors of Nicaragua and provide the mercenary Contras with a CIA-produced manual on assassination, torture, and terrorism techniques to be used against \\"soft targets\\" like farmers and villagers?Why, when ordered to stop by the World Court and UN Security Council, did we escalate our campaign of terror?And why do we refuse to extradite Emmanuel Constant, terrorist leader of Haitian death squads believed to have killed 4000-5000 people? Despite overwhelming evidence provided by the Haitian government (far more than we have provided agaist Bin Laden) the US government has systematically refused to extradite Constant.These are important questions that must be asked, and must be understood if we are to speak of terrorism in a non-hypocrital way.Perhaps Chomsky's most important lesson in this book is the understanding that the popular definition of terror (and the one used by our government and most of the media) depends not on the ferocity or viciousness of the act, or the innocence of its victims, but whether it's rich people attacking poor people or poor people attacking rich people.For those who condemn this book (and have actually read it), show me one fact that Chomsky states that is not correct, or one single conclusion that does not draw logically from those facts. I'll bet you can't do it.Facts and logic sound very strange when you're used to hearing the voices of the Corporate media on ABC and CNN and Fox. Even the New York Times is not speaking the truth or asking important questions.Thank God we have Chomsky to supply us with what our media environment so desperately lacks: facts, and logic."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Unbelievable that this was publsihed less than a month after the tragedy.

History has already proven him wrong just by looking at the lives that have been saved in Iraq and Afghanistan by removing oppressive regimes.Chomsky failed to realize that the US is capable of careful, controlled military actions that minimize civilian casualties, and greatly benefit hundreds of millions of people. His cynicism also prevented him from foreseeing the selfless nation building exercises now underway in Iraq and Afghanistan that stabilize the mideast; despite the obvious historical precedence of US charity in response to war in nations like Japan, France and Germany to name a few.It's important to realize that despite good intentions, the US isn't perfect and no better than other civilized societies. However, most of Chomsky's criticisms are way off base, and include his typical distortions of the truth to paint a black picture of what is really quite a great country.Ultimately, Chomsky gives himself away as someone motivated by bitter hatred by publishing this horrible book less than a month after the atrocities while the smell of still burning flesh was hovering over the southern half of Manhattan.There's no denying Chomsky tastelessly tried to make money on the tragedy by churning out this drivel immediately afterwards. He rightfully takes his place alongside the worst scum of the earth, including the hateful dastards who flew the planes into the buildings."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Everyone should read a little Noam Chomsky, one of the most formative influences and Grand Masters in the pantheon of modern American liberal thought. Chomsky's tired old flesh serves as a roadmap of where we've been and why we're here: a radicalizer. A revolutionary. A ghoul. A man whose tirades, screeds, and bromides against America are critical to understand in order to better grasp the vast divide that made our last two presidential elections such potboilers, have cast a once vital and moderate political opposition into something akin to a secular outer darkness, and today leads so many of our commentators to wring their hands at what they consider a divided nation.Read Noam Chomsky in the same way you might read \\"Mein Kampf\\" by Adolf Hitler. Read it to drink in the sickness of a diseased mind gone wild with the fever heat. Read it as a diary of madness. Try not to be infected. Read it as a literary warning beacon. Read it to better sense the ravings of a gifted lunatic. With that in mind, a little Chomsky is called for, not a lot.\\"9/11\\" fits the bill perfectly for the uninitiated: it is a pure distillation of the red rage and intellectual fossilization that has characterized Chomsky since the sixties, when he turned his passion for linguistics into a fixation on the injustice and evil of a nation, the United States of America, that had provided him with leisure and a sounding board. It is a sounding board for the modern Democrat party, for a party that stands days away from electing the frothing-mad Howard dean as its titular head, from anointing Michael Moore as its patron saint, heart, and soul.Chomsky's \\"theories\\" make up a fearsome if fossilized triumvirate of ideas:1) America's consumerist culture of death has resulted in a kind of uber-political \\"shop til you drop\\" institutional structure that hates starving children and seeks to export its greedy, amoral capitalism abroad.2)Israel is the primary beneficiary of this consumerist, Mickey Mouse \\"Culture of Death\\".3)9/11 occurred precisely because of our neo-imperialist retro-colonialist desire to export our consumerist Armaggedon through Israel into the Arab world. In Chomsky's distorted, sick, twisted, paranoid world view, America is guilty because the indigenous cultures---The arabs, the pygmies, the Zoroastrians, the Hindus---want to buy what we're selling. Never mind their free will, we should have been advanced enough never to sell, let alone manufacture, the goods we offer up in the Arab soukh.4) As a result, according to Chomsky, we deserved 9/11. Stop. Breathe. Focus. Because of our policy---that is to say, our preference for democracy, property rights, privacy rights, freedom of speech---in a time of peace, 3000 plus people who did nothing more than put on their trousers and go to work deserved to be vaporized.This is the very anatomy of a diseased mind, of a degenerate nature, of a diseased soul. Pick up 9/11 and read it: to bear witness to its madness is to serve as bailiff to the mind of Evil and insanity. If you agree that a jogger in Central Park at 7 in the evening deserved to be raped, then you'll love Chomsky. If you have even a shred of humanity, you'll want to vomit."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"this book was really dom it needs more imformation in it"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Adequate notes for the early panic stricken and taken by surprise effort to process the events. The author does note history of warfare on the North American continent aimed at the US, The War of 1812. The 9-11 Report had not been published yet, so what did anybody really know? We had to wait for the raft of tangential media reconstructions to start piecing together the story, and it all looked like an effort to hide the apparent pyrotechnics complications outside the forum of law, government and the 9-11 Commission--another tell tale sign of history revision, when NOVA and The History Channel are essentially overriding the investigation of a crime scene. This book does not address measurement of the evidence universe or lack thereof, neither does it register the manipulation of the public. Those complications remain in place, and only further jeopardize the future by their not being processed--they will make gains on it for further power grabs from more national smoke and ashes. In fact, they will create a television series foreshadowing the obvious escalation: \\"Jericho\\", this Fall, Wednesdays on CBS.His other book, \\"Hegemony or Survival\\" does not speak to readers who might want to contemplate such terms either, but in a different way from scarcity of information, it grouses in the customary panache of Chomsky's meandering style, and is a case of yet another bait and switch disappointment--detours to conclude the American people have no recourse through their common justice system, what all has to bow before a fabrication of world government's ways and means. Debating whether terrorism is crime and the \`time wasted' in 1993 to treat that bombing as a crime scene, got called into question by Rep. Heather Wilson of N.M in H.R. 861. Such practical recourses to our survival as our code of laws and justice system cannot be allowed to steal the thunder of staged sensations, nor the mystique riddled, abracadabra nomenclature so brilliantly pronounced as if in a ceremonious incantation rite, on Democracy Now Radio, over a crystal ball--very, very hypnotizing those Arab names. And of course to the American ear, there is no sorting out what's going on based on that obstructionism. The ciphers are merely recycled and held up in contempt of the public's review, the systematic deconstruction of the scope of evidence, evidentiary proceedings, admissible scope, or any form of examination--just voodoo. There's a book about this called \\"The Anthropology of War\\", chapter on \`witchcraft', would you believe it? There's also a section on fragmentation review barrages.Valid address of the cause and effect line of questioning would have tied the 1993 bombing attempt to a massive reorganization to regroup and study the problem of skyscraper demolition more carefully, multimarketing with compromised U.S sections of \`security' encompassing war planning for the whole problem of the new millennium, and notoriously signal jammed by the buzz word Y2K in the 1990s. Cause and effect could have cited references to the Twin Towers, depicting an anomalous realty market initiative to carve up and sell off the buildings' assets under that blueprint's logistics time frame (Teleport versus NYNEX's million channel landline hub in the Twin Towers) Cause and effect could have noted hostility openly expressed by factions of city government to the WTC project ever being built, and probably always living to see the day it came down. The cause is thermite (what also asphyxiated the jumpers), pyrotech by RC, and the subversion of the United States government--literally espionage on the FBI and interference cued thereby with a federal passenger list screening investigation under Title 22, The Transportation Safety Acts of 1993-4. FISA in non-applicable, a passenger list is not any form of \`communication', the FBI had eminent domain and more than enough warrant to arrest an obvious build up of \`men at arms' amassing coordinated hijacking by overwhelming force--ipso facto violation of \`Armed Vessel' statues by virtue of commandeered vehicle weaponization, thus no certificates in any ports to ward off full inspection on grounds of civil liberties, automatic impound and full arrests, certainly with tracked suspects (the tell-tale insider yearbook). All else is accessory hazardous communication in collusion abetting capitol mass murder, welcome to civil defense. Read the United States Code Annotated at your local public law library.And to finish with a word on Chomsky's speech to the Naval Cadets on C-SPAN recently, \\"just war\\", is just how it sounds, it's just, \`war', and there are no more rules regulating it today than were ever abided in the past. This presents a serious problem for democracy having to deduce it is controlled by an overriding militaristic syndicalism wanting to make war against its own namesake, hold the people in contempt, and then impose oppression further by converting the stonewall of denial and non-recognition into the most potent form of mind control--a simple grudge match of the hegemony's deceit against the duped and destroyed electorate whose vain trust always provides more coy opportunities. The President has to be photographed on the cover of TIME, next to the seal on his jacket \`air force one', and with significance of literacy, reading glasses, for the ever vigilant manufacture of his legitimacy (week of July 29, '06). And Noam Chomsky, if he's to really make a speech, ought to speak to people who matter, and about the right attitude with regard to war, the irrelevance of the Geneva Convention, cozying up to a trivial affectation of uniformed officiousness that pads a diseased abdication of leadership."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky is an intellectual leader of the anti-war left.

I picked it up originally a year or so ago, read it then, hated it, and put it away. I picked it up this week and read it again, wondering if I would find insight that I could not get the first time through. All I came to understand is that Noam Chomsky loves to label everything a conspiracy, and he loves to purport that American capitalism is to blame for the 9/11 attacks. I guess we incited the fundamentalist terrorists to be so offended by our globalization that they had no alternative but to fly airplanes into our buildings.So, according to Chomsky's reasoning, if some neighbors move in down the street and I happen not to like their religion or their occupation or their way of dress or the color of their cat, then I can always bomb them and blame the bombing on the \\"offense\\" they caused me?Give it up, Chomsky! America is not to blame for every ill that we experience. Have you not heard of people hating us for our ideologies -- i.e. we are the \\"infidels\\" -- and *THAT* is why they attack us!?! Have you not learned that there are true evils in the world, and it is not always an American conspiracy?"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that \\"Dar es Harb\\" does not deserve its prosperity and \\"Dar es Salam\\" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.\\"the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan\\"This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Though I've never really much much of a fan of Chomsky's interview based works, I felt the need to read this with an open mind. Based entirely around the terrorist attacks of 9/11 this was really the first (and thus far only) critical work which put the blame upon the United States as well as those who carried out the attacks, namely one Usama bin Ladin.Throughout this book containing mostly interviews conducted via email following the 9/11 attacks Chomsky gives us a deeper look at the roots of the terrorist attacks, and their significance upon the whole of global politics as well as economics. Never one to stop speaking his mind Chomsky lays out in detail the reasoning, the significance and most importantly why something such as \\"terrorism\\" cannot be beaten with military action.I highly recommend this book to anyone who sees the 9/11 attacks from something other than the vengeful retribution of most patriotic Amerikans."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"I have read this book and found it to be very helpful in understanding why people would cheer an evil man such as Bin Laden.I understand why people would like to dismiss Chomsky as an arrogant liar however he did make very valid points that can not be ignored.

If you look at some of the actions the US has done in the past, it looks to be a bit like the old saying 'do as I say not as I do'. But then again it might just appear that way.However a couple of things I wish were different were, when Chomsky talks as always he tends to speak in circles which might make it hard to follow and little boring, and It would also have been nice to see more references."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky's material is always both pleasant and shocking, but always informatively fulfilling.

He analyses 9-11 from a global, more objective perspective that is in stark contrast to the nationalistic, overly emotional, biased perspectives offered by most other American commentators. He rewinds for us the historical record, playing back pertinent events that preceded 9-11, and shares with the reader a variety of reports from domestic and foreign sources that help provide deep insight into the event.Chomsky's perspective is a reminder that the very highest form of patriotism is to champion the good of our country while being also mindful that we must recognize, acknowledge and demand correction of our nation's faults. One of the corrections could be to respect and abide by international law (something we have notoriously refused to do historically, as Chomsky notes). Another could be to rethink our arrogant bullying around of underdeveloped nations for selfish aims. This work provides copious examples of this.\\"9-11\\" also brings us back to the DEFINITION of \\"terrorism.\\" Chomsky provides numerous examples of terroristic acts, including those committed against other nations, wherein our own government took part. Though it is not always comfortable or easy to face the mirror when we are flawed, it is no more comfortable or easy to acquiesce or condone acts committed wrongfully against others when we possess a moral consciousness and hold a strong desire to do what is right and to refrain from creating enmity and hatred (and thus potential threat) from others. This work made clear to me Chomsky's insistence upon having and maintaining integrity, and speaking up in that respect even when that may mean being labeled \\"unpatriotic\\" by those who are comfortable with being blind, uninformed patriots.Any citizen concerned about \\"homeland security\\" would give serious thought to the implications of the historical atrocities reviewed here by Chomsky. I highly recommend the book to anyone who has sought answers to unanswered questions about 9-11, as well as to anyone who is not well-informed about our nation's history with other countries. \\"9-11\\" answers questions about the Northern Alliance and how was it established, why we have historically supported various known terrorist regimes, how many INNOCENT people have been killed since 9-11, in the names of those innocents killed ON 9-11, and more.

They would certainly help an American who still does not understand why the Middle-East dislikes America and why terrorist are out to get them. This would help ofcourse if one thinks beyond the neocon ideology of the American superiority in culture and race. The book is not good if you are looking for details of any particular US military intervention; i would recommend this book for those who are reasonably well aware of the US war crimes outside its borders. May be for starters you could read some of the other books by this author and then read this.Finally, I must say overall a great book, Mr.Chomsky's replies are very informative and elucidating. The book addresses some important questions so it might help all those curious jacks out there."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky's a truth-seeker in a world full of lies. His arguments cut through all the rubbish and nonsense we're all exposed to here in the US everyday and present an alternative, informed perspective.By using comparative analysis and sticking with only the &quot;known&quot; facts, Chomsky forces the reader, (if open-minded), to reconsider what the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; really means.The strength of Chomsky's argument lies in the obvious double-standard he continually presents us with. For example, in 1986 the US was found guilty of international terrorism and ordered to pay reparations to Nicaragua. The US immediately responded by denying the authority of the World Court. When the UN tried to pass a resolution requiring all UN-member states refrain from international terrorist activities, only Israel and the US vetoed the vote.The irony here is that the US is fighting a &quot;war on terrorism&quot; but is, in fact, the only Western power ever to be cited for conducting terrorism abroad. How come that nugget of information was never part of the analysis the networks brought us? Surely, it is an important point? Surely, it adds perspective?Chomsky's message is that the US has conducted it's own terrorist activities and backed terrorism whenever it has suited its purposes. Well documented examples include Nicaragua, Beirut, the Sudan, Chile, Guatamala and Iran.Where the talking heads on TV enthusiastically talked about terrorism as &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot;, Chomsky points out that nation states have quite happily used terrorism (as defined by the US military handbook) for their own ends, usually changing the term to &quot;counter-terrorism,&quot; &quot;counter-insurgency,&quot; or &quot;humanitarian efforts.&quot;The &quot;war on terrorism&quot; is a war inside a mirrored fun house. Our allies are Turkey and Russia who are both terrorizing minorities in their own territories, ethnically cleansing at home while they fight terrorists abroad. Saudi Arabia is taking out feel-good ads in Time magazine while key members of the Saudi Royal family continue to help fund the very Islamic Fundamentalists who cheered 9-11. Meanwhile, the Northern Alliance, our allies on the ground in Afghanistan, are renowned for their past as even bigger butchers than the Taliban and will likely be a source of more blowback later on this decade.If you care anything about the situation we all find ourselves in since 9-11, read this book.

Chomsky reminds all of us about America's terrorist activity and if there is one crititism to be made of him, is that he is too naive into believing that Americans would actually put as much value into the deaths of third world, dark skinned people as equal to the deaths of New Yorkers. One can be ignored with the other must be avenged by awesome cruelty not even on the person that committed the act, not even on the organization that committed the act, not even the government that committed the act, but THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT THE PERSON OR ORGANIZATION BELONGS even if that country was already in dire straits and that it would result in the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians. But that is America.America is a funny country as we so often attack the same people we gave weapons to when during the 80's. Why? To stop the Soviets, we didn't care about he actual fate of the Afghan people just as long as they didn't say they were Communist. Human rights? Can be ignored , what do Americans care about the conditions in third world countries unless we tell them to care of course if they become too left wing or go against American interests. Then we need to bomb them, illegally depose the government, commit terrorist acts on innocent people, or impose a inhuman and widely condemned embargo on that country to teach them a lesson, only then will the American people care, when we want them to.That is certainly American policy towards nations of the third world and the most important thing Chomsky uncovers, besides the obvious bias of the media in reporting terrorist events when the government wants us to know about them so they can have excuses for wars they always wanted, but the underlying bias Americans have in treating the deaths of Americans and the deaths of people in third world nations.And how about the Northern Alliance? The Drug Lords of the Middle East now wholeheartedly supported by so called Drug Warriors of America that spend billions of dollars on a so called Drug War, I guess Bush is not thinking about fighting the drug war internationally, I guess he wants to concentrate on the home front. Which is not surprising given his daughters habit to drink illegally and his own habit of drinking and past use of drugs when he was younger. Not surprisingly, Bush has now made it so that students applying for federal aid to go to college must answer if they were found guilty of using drugs and if they answer yes, they will receive no aid. The same thing Bush has done! Talk about major hypocrite! And this is a guy that sneaked into Yale with SAT scores and a GPA that was lower that other applicants that were rejected and a so-called veteran that loves the military yet mysteriously found a way to the Texas National Guard BUT not only that, took a ten month \\"leave\\" while serving!!!

Despite the enormously important new developments, most of this publication's arguments have already been presented in the author's other works concerning the Middle East. Still, this volume stands as a valuable volume in the September 11th library. Chomsky has accurately been called America's conscious and that was a more valuable role than ever in the days following the attacks. 9-11 offers peaceful, sensible ways for the US to lower the threat from the Middle East; examines the concept of terrorism from a view unspoiled by an us-vs-them mentality and unravels many of the myths surrounding Muslim extremists and their motives. Chomsky is one of the US's greatest thinkers and his commentary concerning the September 11th attacks and the continuing conflict of which they are a part should be appreciated."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"A year and a half after 9/11/01, this book is nearly in the top 500 of best-selling books on Amazon. Defying all logic in the ultra-conservative wake of 9/11, this book became an international bestseller.Why? Because people needed an independent analysis that they could trust. People needed to hear Noam Chomsky's point of view. I believe that is why this book was \\"rushed into print\\" after 9/11 (not to \\"cash in\\" as critics would have you believe... The Patriot Act is an example of cashing in on 9/11, this book is not). Someone decided it would be a good idea to edit his post-9/11 interviews into a book to get his point of view out to the public, and he agreed to it.Yes, this is a collection of interviews, similar to the format of the best-selling \\"Chomsky Trilogy.\\" His interviews are often much easier to read than his writing; it is easier to follow his informal speech than his academic prose. As such, this is a readable introduction to the ideas of Noam Chomsky. Love him or hate him, he should not be ignored.It's been over a year since I read this, and what sticks out in my mind is his analysis of Clinton's bombing of the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory in 1998, under the apparently mistaken impression that it was a terrorist training facility or something of that nature. Chomsky points out roughly half a dozen various effects of that bombing, leading to the deaths of innocent civilians, instability in the region, decreased likelihood of democratic government, resentment towards the US and refusal to cooperate with the US in hunting for Al Qaeda. Chomsky's analysis makes it clear that this bombing was a greater tragedy than 9/11, in terms of over-all lives lost. Republican Clinton-haters should love this section of the book.Chomsky has been criticized for being \\"wooden\\" in these interviews and not sympathetic enough to the victims of 9/11. In his defense, he has studied mass atrocities for the past 35 years -- many of which the US was responsible for -- many of which involved the death and torture of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Take East Timor as an example. The East Timor atrocities did not have the support of 24/7 media coverage like 9/11 did.Chomsky is an internationalist. In his eyes, a Timorese life is equal to the life of a New Yorker. Chomsky was no doubt saddened by 9/11 -- and he clearly states that it was an unjustifiable atrocity -- but he was 70 times more saddened by the US-supported Indonesian invasion of East Timor, because 70 times as many people died. (My statistics might be off, but you get the picture.) If he is not adequately expressing his grief, then all of the Americans who were blissfully ignorant of the East Timor atrocity are far more guilty of not expressing proper grief for those lives lost. You do not have to feel more pain merely because it was American lives lost, merely because the television tells you \\"Now is the time to be sad.\\"If Chomsky truly wanted to \\"cash in,\\" he would gush about how horrible 9/11 was, just like everyone else in the media. Instead he had the courage to present a cogent and politically incorrect point of view -- for which he is still being rewarded with best-seller status.Check out Chomsky's sequel to 9-11 as well as Rahul Mahajan's \\"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism.\\""},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Any book by Noam Chomsky will immediately be rejected by myopic conservatives who dismiss him as a mindless liberal or a dangerous socialist and yet those conservatives are exactly who should read this analysis of American foreign policy.I have been rummaging around in the history and contemporary politics of a reasonable part of the globe for many years and the way in which Chomsky pieces together the world that we live in is totally accurate according to the information that I have accumulated.In this book Chomsky has assembled the various interviews he has given to journalists from around the world and will throughout this short book illuminate his ideas as to why September 11 happened. I'm sure that the power brokers of America will be dismissive of what Chomsky says in these interviews and they will use their traditional bent and ignorant interpretation of contemporary affairs to justify policies that determined the events of September 11. It's appaling for the world to realize that while the Americans do not understand this world there are people like Chomsky who do but who are marginalized and derided while others who know little more than barrel-pushing make decisions that impact negatively all of us."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"A short read which is simply a set of interviews conducted with Chomsky after the 9-11 tragedy. Obviously this book wasn't meant to provide any details, there is nothing in this book that isn't covered in MUCH greater detail in Chomsky's other works, this book was really rushed to print to provide curious readers (who'll probably search &quot;9-11&quot; as a keyword) with basics that they won't read or hear from mainstream media. If the reader has little background in US foreign policy or mid east politics, then this book might prove worthless in terms of gaining detail, but this book does give the reader some information that can be used as a guide to further research. For example: One might not have previously been aware of certain policies the US has in southwest Asia, this book makes mention of some of these policies, and the reader's focus now turns to finding more about these policies from other sources. Chomsky meant for this book to act as a keyword &lt;META TAG&gt; to attract a larger audience to important issues. The book is short and lacks detail, but has the veritable punchlines to attract the curiosity of the laity. The book is inexpensive and can be read in one sitting easily. So it's okay for curious readers who just want to get the gist of what is rarely (if ever) heard in the mainstream media."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book provides what this country desperately needs: a dose of TRUTH. Chomsky brings to light the terrible truth - the events of 9/11 did not occur in a vacuum, but were a direct result of our foreign policies in the middle east and elsewhere. The US must realize, before it is too late, that this planet is NOT a playground for the wealthy. There are billions of third world citizens suffering due to our... foreign policies, which are almost without exception based on hoarding a majority of the world's resources for a minority of its citizens.Chomsky's book will likely be trashed by critics, as I have already witnessed on this site, but this 'trashing' appears to be primarily based on anger at being forced to a mirror more than any objection to Chomsky's FACT BASED writing. The United States is the ONLY country condemned in international court for terroristic acts, and the US refuses to pay reparations that were ordered to this day. We provide Israel, an industrialized country the size of NEW JERSEY with more foreign \\"aid\\" (if you can call weapons of mass destruction \\"aid\\") than all of India. We debate over whether we can \\"afford\\" to provide aid for AIDS medications to Africa, but apparently we easily \\"afford\\" to pay for the further oppression of the Palestinian people. If we insist on continuing our role as the world's bully, we will continue to be the target of terrorist attacks. Middle and upper-class Americans would do well to heed Chomsky's call for truth and justice. If not, they can hardly refer to themselves as \\"innocent victims\\" when the next attack occurs."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This may sound like a bizarre statement to make about a book that runs slightly over a hundred pages in length, but the main problem with Noam Chomsky's 9-11 is that it is too long. Because this slender volume is a compilation of interviews that Chomsky gave shortly after 9-11-2001 with various North American and European media outlets, it has the unfortunate flaw of being repetitive. As a result, many of his points are made, to the reader, over and over, and then, over again. Furthermore, some of the interviews provide no new information, and appear to have been included primarily for padding in an attempt to lengthen the book slightly.Nonetheless, the book is otherwise utterly fascinating. Chomsky is a polarizing writer. Few people are going to be lukewarm about his ideas. Either you will, like me, find them fascinating, provocative, and dead-on, or you will be horrified, outraged, and defensive. But even someone who does not care for Chomsky will inescapably be impressed with his breadth of knowledge of foreign affairs and the local political situation throughout the world. For someone who is primarily known for his pioneering work in linguistics, Chomsky possesses a stunning knowledge of, apparently, every corner of the globe. I, for one, stand in awe of how much knowledge he has been able to assimilate in his two fields of endeavor.In a way, this book is an extended footnote to his book THE FATEFUL TRIANGLE, about the political situation in the Middle East. While Chomsky thoroughly condemns terrorism in every form (including state terrorism, which he views the United States, Israel, and many European nations as engaged in), he feels it is crucial for Westerners to understand the real reasons that many Muslims in the Middle East do not like the United States. These reasons, he repeatedly points out in these interviews, have nothing to do with a supposed hatred of the material success of the US, or the expansion of globalism, or modernity. Rather, their anger is over very specific complaints about the suppression of Palestinians by Israel, US military presence in Saudi Arabia, European and American intrusion into the political life of Islamic nations, and similar causes.The part of the book that many readers will feel less comfortable with are those parts where he equates many US actions overseas with state terrorism. I personally found these parts of the book both very depressing and very compellingly discussed. But even if one disagrees with Chomsky's assessments, it is important even for his critics to realize that many of those who hate us in other parts of the world view the US in ways similar to the picture that Chomsky draws of US foreign involvement."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book is a collection of interviews Chomsky has done related to 9-11 and in each of them it feels like he's in a hurry, tired of repeating himself, having said what he says in this book many many times before. I knew when I bought this that it probably won't be a good introduction to Chomsky, and I regret buying it. Chomsky frequently says things like, &quot;...but this is common knowledge convered very well elsewhere...&quot; and this book felt like an illustration of that, like a web page that just links to good bits elsewhere. It felt more than a little opportunistic. Buy something else by Chomsky!"},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"This book collects interview and discussions with Chomsky shortly after the September 11th attacks. For those who want something a bit more enlightening, Chomsky puts forth bold assertions that many people wouldn't be willing to even consider in the wake of the attacks. One of his main assertions throughout is that if the US wants to really fight terrorism, we should stop participating in it. He cites specific, uncontroversial examples such as Nicaragua and the Contras, or Turkey, where massive US aid (by Bubba) helped the government do to the Kurds what we bombed Milosevic for when he tried it with Albanians.I don't agree that Chomsky is insensitive to the victims of 9/11 in this book. I believe that his attitude is similar to many others': that such an event, while shocking, is not entirely surprising, especially to anyone who's been paying attention to the world in the last decade. Of course, he condemns the actions. He does not rant that American lives are paramount in the face of other atrocities, which may not make his critics happy, but he also regularly acknowledges that, in our society, we simply do not ask certain questions.Therefore, it's disconcerting to some that Chomsky is able to discuss the matters of 9/11, terrorism, and the USA's global presence with what sounds like an almost arrogant detachment. Unlike the countless pundits on TV though, Chomsky rarely generalizes and cites sources for his facts. He may skew them how he likes, but he rarely makes up whoppers to prove a point, a favorite element of television debate.Chomsky has been vocal about America's foreign policy for decades, and it's entirely reasonable to suggest that his tone is now relentlessly radical left with an evil eye for capitalism. However, I still believe reading Chomsky is a heck of a lot more valuable for the average reader and more enlightening than hours of CNN, Fox, or the wrapped-in-the-flag latest book from a TV \`pundit'.It's funny, whenever a corporate media pundit mentions Chomsky, it's usually to rip him as 'anti-American', yet the points he actually makes are rarely refuted. Just calling him an 'intellectual' (he does not consider himself such) or an 'academic' is enough to discredit him in the eyes of those who see intellectuals and anyone critical of America as evil incarnate and in league with terrorists. Since he often cites specific facts though at times selectively, and he jettisons bombast in favor of serious consideration, he is the complete antithesis of loudmouth talking heads. Chomsky's arguments are certainly not airtight, but his presentation of facts, his acknowledgement of the de facto state of opinion, debate, and education in America, and his straightforward tone (he is very lucid in his speech and writing) make this a very compelling and important read."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"those who do not like or learn from this book are people who are simply blinded by the flag. while brief, it's contents are grand. like it or not, this country is the new empire, and many regions of the world (not only the mid-east) resent it. with over 800 military instillations throughout the world, and not a single foreign instillation on u.s. soil, america has done a fine job of lifting itself up by stepping on others. this is an important book. you should read it."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Quite simply, unless you read Chomsky, you cannot possibly be fully appraised of what is occuring around the world particularly in regards to the role of America. 9-11 offers a much needed elucidation of the United States' barbaric foreign policy that precipitated the equally barbaric attacks on New York and Washington. The book is comprised of a series of interviews conducted in the weeks following September 11 . This informal approach allows Chomsky to present his ideas with passion and clarity and makes for a compelling and insightful read. Chomsky, whilst condemning that attacks, correctly points out that the United States has itself for decades, been actively involved in sponsoring and supporting terrorism, citing such well known examples as Nicaragua, Angola, Iraq, El Salvador, Chile and the Clinton administrations despicable bombing of the Al Shifa factory in the Sudan which for the most part has been ignored by the mainstream media. Indeed in the case of Nicaragua , the US became the only nation to be charged with \\"terrorism\\" by the UN.(A charge which they vetoed whilst subsequently escalating the destruction of that country). When one considers the amount of lives that have been lost at the hands of American policy in the Middle East alone, then the attacks of September 2001, can hardly be deemed unprovoked let alone unexpected. He rightly concludes that until the Bush administration and the nation at large, recognises the hypocrisy in which the United States indulges, there will be no resolution of any kind. Critics of Chomsky repeatedly state that he is biased in the presentation of his ideas. I fail to see how this line of argument can be maintained. One can not dispute the numerous damning indictments of the United States' blood stained hegemony and the appeasement with which it is met domestically. 9-11 is the most accurate, most intelligent discussion of the events of September 11 2001 and the circumstances that surround it."},{"Title":"9��11��","review":"Chomsky is somewhat predictable and irritating in his repetitive condemnation of all past and present U.S. interventions around the world, and he harps heavily on the U.S. being the only country in the world actually condemned for terrorism (against Nicaragua) by the World Court but one has to give him credit--his is one of the few credible voices seeking to enlighten the American people with respect to two major global realities: first, that America is violating others with impunity and regularity; and second, that we have no idea just how hated we are for these actions.There were a couple of tid-bits in this book that made me especially glad to have obtained it for reading and retention. His evaluation of the Sudan situation, and his detailed review of the impact on Sudanese reliant on the low-cost medicines from the factory bombed into oblivion on the now-disputed suggestion of the CIA, provides a perspective that needs more respect.His lengthy discussion of the contradictory record of the United States on human rights--in favor when it does not interfere with business, actively obstructionist when it takes place in Saudi Arabia or Indonesia where financial equities (generally mining and energy company equities) are great, is disturbingly sensible.I will always read Chomsky, for he provides a leavening of forthright candor and intellectual honesty that is too often absent from mainstream discussions. Indeed, as I was reading the bit on Sudan, it occured to me that we are long over-due for the next revolution in learned discourse--the digitization of all such books so that a reader can, to take Sudan as an example, see on their screen a &quot;map&quot; of Sudanese issues, and then select from across a range of competing viewpoints on any issue. One has to seek out Chomsky now--in the future it may be salutory to find him automatically served up as a side dish whenever the pundits wax too pontifical."},{"Title":"Heavenly Creatures The Story of God\\\\'s Love for His Animals and All of Creation.","review":"Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful book for anyone who has ever lost a pet or wants to know if animals go to Heaven. The answer is YES you will see your friends again in Heaven.I purchased Heavenly Creatures a few months after Casey our dog of 8yrs died of cancer, my husband and I were devestated, it felt like we had lost a daughter, we are both Christians and wanted scripture from the Bible reassuring us that we would see Casey again in Heaven. This book gave us the reassurance we were looking for. It begins with Genesis and continues through Revelation, it reveals through scripture God's plan and love for all his creation. Heavenly Creatures is beautifully written and Dee Ann's love for animals is evident in her book. It has helped us so much in our grief. We still miss Casey very much but we know we will see her again one day in Heaven and we look forward to that day.I recommend this book to anyone grieving the loss of a pet, it will give you blessed assurance that you will be with them again in Heaven.In the Preface part of Heavenly Creatures the Author Dee Ann's prayer is that her book will soothe grieving hearts and offer hope to all who miss, beyond measure, their loving companions.

The Critter Hall of Fame is a chapter of witty, upbeat, short stories focusing on various animals with scriptural references; my favorite is Lazybones, (I have a new appreciation for ants).

He makes it clear in the introduction to the book that this volume is not concerned with a detailed look at the theology of the Old Testament (p. x). It grows out of the insight that understanding the biblical texts \\"presupposes insights into the historical context\\" (p. ix); however, the biblical texts are \\"the most important, indeed for the most part the only source\\" (p. ix) for the historical context. This reciprocal relationship of the biblical texts and the historical context shapes the entire book.This reciprocal relationship is described in the three parts of the book. The first two sections develop this relationship quite fully, by approaching history and the text from opposite perspectives. When you are finished with the first two sections of the book you are left with an appreciation of the tensions that exist between the Old Testament text and the history of Israel.The first part looks to the Old Testament text as a source of the history of Israel. It takes a chronological approach to the texts and attempts to reconstruct the history of Israel. Rendtorff gives many examples of the difficulties in doing this by making clear the various gaps in the Old Testament's record of Israel's history.The second part takes the opposite approach and explores how the Old Testament, as literature, grew out of the social structure of Israel. Here Rendtorff uses five different aspects of ancient near east culture-local community, legal system, religious system, the monarchy, and the prophets-to develop his theme. In each of these cultural areas he shows how different genres of the biblical literature grew naturally from their life settings.The third, and longest, part looks at each individual book of the Old Testament. In this section Rendtorff follows \\"the course of the traditions as \`literature'.\\" By looking at the final forms of the books as the theological literature of Israel Rendtorff attempts to show the Jewish religious community at work. In doing this, he synthesizes separate ideas that were developed in the first two sections of the book. There are many difficulties with this book. The flaws in it are very serious. In spite of the many problems with this book, there are several reasons to recommend this book to the reader.The different approaches the book takes to the Old Testament text gives the reader new insights into the meanings of various areas of the Old Testament. The third section of the book gives a wealth of information in one location about the natural breaks in the biblical text. This kind of information can help with interpretation of the text as well. Careful consideration of this third section would help anyone trying to understand some of the more obscure passages of the Old Testament.There is an extensive bibliography at the end of each topic. This arrangement is useful for someone searching for a specific type of text. The usefulness of these bibliographies, however, may be limited for English speaking readers since many of the works listed seem to be in German.The editing of the book is poorly executed. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors. It would appear that the translator doesn't know English as thoroughly as German. And the editors of the English version apparently spent little energy in proofreading the manuscript. The reference system in the margins of the book could be very useful to the scholar. Its usefulness, however, is compromised by numerous errors. For instance, the discussion of Exodus in the third part of the book is labeled by the reference system as \\"Genesis\\" (pp. 139-144).Rendtorff handles the Bible as if it were any other important historical document. In ignoring the issue of inspiration from God, Rendtorff wanders astray in some of his thinking. This is the most damaging problem in this book; even though Rendtorff handles the text carefully and with respect, he seems unaware of the living nature of the text. Nowhere in this book will you find a discussion of the central theme of the text, the record of redemptive history. By handling the text like it is merely an important historical document Rendtorff has ignored the meaning and the importance of God's Word."},{"Title":"Final Fantasy IX Visual Arts Collection:","review":"I was immediately drawn to this book(around A4 size) by the marvellous cover of Vivi surrounded in a whirlwind of blinding light.

Now if that wasn't enough, Mr. Burkett occasionally peppers his text with his personal (I'm tempted to say narrow-minded)opinion about government agencies (describing the EPA as commiting terrorist acts) and political structures (socialism).

They are both mutually respectful and intellectual people open to hear another point of view. The idea and the example are both great and ought to be repeated elsewhere. If anything the book is too polite and far too short. There are hundreds of issues to be discussed and a little further give and take would be more enlightening. It is not really a confrontation, and there is only one go-around on each issue. The writers are courteous to a fault. Eco knows and presents the Catholic sided as if he were on it, and in reality he is not so much skeptical as merely incredulous about a number of things, a kind of crypto-Catholic.

Although the paperback version claims &quot;A Dialogue&quot; it is most definitely a confrontation that forces the reader to make some decisions or at least consider issues that are all to easily relegated to consideration in a distant sphere rather than our hearts."},{"Title":"Belief or Nonbelief? : A Dialogue","review":"In this small volume two of the best-known minds of Italy exchange letters trying to find a common ground and to clarify differences between the secular and religious worldviews. On the one hand we have Umberto Eco, an academic philosopher best known for his novel \\"The Name of the Rose\\", and on the other hand Cardinal Martini, one of the most intellectually gifted princes of the Catholic church. The format is questions and answers; Eco gets the first three questions, Martini the last one. In general I found the questions illuminating; they are clearly stated and challenge the other party to clarify its position. Neither Eco nor Martini give resounding answers though, and reading between the lines one feels a certain unease in both.Eco's first question is not really a question but rather a commentary on the secular and religious ideas about history and the end of history. Both agree that history has meaning and direction and that the fears about a disastrous end can be vanquished by hope.The other three questions are ethical and are much more interesting. After a short and delightful investigation about what human life is, Eco asks about abortion, and specifically about when human life begins. Martini explains that there are different kinds of human life and that the kind that counts is not physical life but rather spiritual life which is part of God's life. Being a cardinal, he cannot but answer Eco's question with the Church's official position, which is that human life begins at inception. He reasons that this is so because at the inception a person's genetic identity is fixed. To me this argument sounds rather superficial. After all a seed fixes the identity of the tree that may grow out of it, but that does not mean that the seed is a living tree. Surely, if, while eating an apple, I inadvertently swallow a seed, nobody will claim that I have just eaten an apple tree. To be fair, Martini is only stating that human life starts at inception, not that a fertilized human egg is a human being. But in this case then we get the equally strange claim that human life is present in something that is not a human being.The third of Eco's questions is about the ordination of women. He argues that there are not really any dogmatic impediments for women becoming priests and, also, that common sense dictates that half of humanity should not be excluded from serving God in any capacity. Martini's answer here is very problematic. He starts on a fine note stating that we should not impose our morality on others: \\"Any external imposition of principles or religious behavior on the nonconsenting violates freedom of conscience.\\" Exactly two paragraphs later he contradicts himself writing that \\"religious bodies can try to democratically influence the tenor of laws they find do not correspond to an ethical standard that might indeed derive from religious practice\\". He concedes that ultimately there are no good arguments for denying the priesthood to women, but that nevertheless this must be denied them because it is God's will, according to the opinion of those \\"who by Episcopal succession have received the power of truth\\".The fourth and final question is Martini's, and now I think it is Eco's answer that sounds strained. Martini asks what the foundation is for an atheist's moral principles, up to documented extremes where atheists gave up their lives trying to do what they thought right. Implicitly in this question one reads the presumption that the foundation of morality can only be a transcendent religious awareness. Eco starts, interestingly enough, explaining that there can be no true atheists because even though nobody has found a convincing proof for the existence of God, neither has anybody found a convincing proof for the nonexistence of God. He responds to Martini's question explaining that moral ideology is a result of the requirements of our cohabitation in close proximity. He recognizes that this standard explanation for morality does not explain the phenomenon of secular people offering a personal sacrifice comparable to that of Christ, so he ventures that the reason here is that people have a deep need to give a good example, to leave a message to others, sometimes even if it costs their life. He does not explain how this instinctive need to communicate good has evolved with human life and culture, so he is merely transforming the original question into a different one.Ultimately, Eco and Martini do not really connect, and it would be too much to expect such a miracle. I think that the religious and secular world views can only touch and derive worth from each other if each side abandons beliefs that are deeply felt but not really central to the respective world views. Secular people should stop talking about \\"meaningful life\\", \\"universal harmony\\", a \\"higher power\\", or \\"the other\\" and simply give it a name and call it God. Religious people should recognize that the origin of truth is not in books of revelations or leaders who \\"have received the power of truth\\" but God alone with no intermediaries. When secular people accept that truth comes from somewhere, and religious people accept that where truth comes from we can go ourselves, then the foundations of a very meaningful dialectic will have been set.One star less than the deserving five, because the English edition omits the commentaries by several other authors which were included in the original edition."},{"Title":"Belief or Nonbelief? : A Dialogue","review":"I loved this little book. Eco is one of my heroes, and I knew of Martini's reputation, since there's been much speculation that he is one of the favorites to become the next Pope.What I liked most about the dialogue is that the two men clearly present their views and fully address the other's questions, without breaking down into the type of sensationalistic diatribe that passes for debate in the United States. Eco and Martini show respect for each other and each other's views, while clearly making a case for their own beliefs.My sole complaint is that of several other reviewers - the book was too short.

As other reviewers have rightly pointed out, the confrontation is internal and thoughtful in this book, not a \\"confrontation,\\" as is usually understood, between two men. This is a dialogue.

I'm not much of a western reader, having only read Riders of the Purple Sage since it's such a great classic of the genre, but I've read the occasional scholarly article on the history of the western novel, and heard one or two literary profs speak on the subject, and I learned that Savage occupies an important place in western writing history. Occasionally when I see very old books like this, I look them up on Amazon to see if they're listed, but many of them are not. Although this one is listed, I'm not surprised to find that there are no reviews since it's such an old book. But the talented, prolific Savage wrote 24 novels and over 90 short stories, all about life on the frontier. He was ahead of his time in that he often portrayed ethnically mixed marriages in his novels, which were common on the frontier but not in the western fiction of the day, which sometimes caused problems with his editors. Recently a few of his novels have been restored by returning to the text of the original manuscripts.

One of my very favorite Acker books, and obviously I'm a fan."},{"Title":"In Memoriam To Identity","review":"A Review of IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITYby Dr. Joseph SugliaResonating with the title of Kathy Acker's most mature work, IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITY (1990), is the notion that the self is inseparable from its own becoming-other, from the forms that it assumes and the masks that it dons. The book serves as a series of largely disconnected epitaphs to a discarded concept of identity---that is, to \\"identity\\" conceived as transcendental and substantialized subjectivity that endured unchanged through time and exist a priori independently of all relations to the other. What Acker's book suggests, in a manner that seems disjointed and even at times haphazard, is that personal identity is based on the exposure to the other person that is revealed by sexuality (the final and perhaps most significant word of the book).Three cycles of narrative intersect with each other: 1.) A willfully anachronistic and reconstructive transcription of Rimbaud's biography (broken off arbitrarily when Acker grew disgusted with the poet's imperialist conversion) interspersed with references to AIDS and postmodernist theorist Jean Baudrillard (here decried as a cynic), deliberate mistranslations of Rimbaud's verse, and intentionally unacknowledged citations from Buechner, Lautreamont, and Artaud---members of the counter-tradition of subversive literature within which Acker would like to insert herself. Of foremost importance is Rimbaud's impassioned relationship to Verlaine, who is compelled to choose between a socially unacceptable liaison with the boy and his responsibilities as a father, husband, and member of the bourgeoisie. The narrative is set against the background of the Franco-German War of 1870. According to the logic of Acker's repoliticization, the Germans appear as yuppies who wage a ceaseless battle against the unemployed and arrogate to themselves services that only they can afford. 2.) A narrative oriented around Airplane, a young girl who exists in a relationship of absolute dependency to her rapist (later nominated as her \\"boyfriend\\")---a relationship that mirrors, despite Acker's own self-interpretive claims, Rimbaud's relationship to Verlaine. She is inexorably driven to dance at a strip club. 3.) A transformative replication of Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY that concerns the sexually voracious Capitol, who is erotically obsessed with her brother Quentin. Her goal, to couple with every man in the world, is the indirect endeavor to achieve sexual congress with her brother, the only man who matters to her. Capitol is the pure desire to consume men, the will to conquer through copulation; she generalizes her male sexual partners to the point at which they are reduced to nothing. Because Capitol can never remember any of the men with whom she couples (and does not exercise any discrimination in her choices), she not only erases these men as individual human beings: by eliding all memory, she effectively destroys her self as an identity that would persist through time. She \\"herself,\\" a female Don Giovanni (and this is the joint that links her narrative to the Rimbaud section), is \\"No One\\": non-identical with herself, \\"she\\" is a multiple series of drives to overcome men through sexuality. 4.) \\"The Wild Palms\\" alternates successively between the narrative of Airplane and that of Capitol; both narratives are sutured together in counterpoint (this is a Faulknerian practice).To love, in each context, is to demolish and shape one's personal history. The work is an extended, productive commentary on Rimbaud's dictum, \\"Je suis un autre.\\" The most productive point of departure for an analysis of this work would be the first narrative, which concerns this dictum most directly. Rimbaud longs to free himself not merely from the self that he is and has been, but from the stability of identity in general: \\"*I* want to die\\" [21]. He desires \\"to wake inside someone else's skin\\" [23] (a direct translation from Rimbaud's correspondence), and this self-transformation is only possible by way of a relation to the other human being: \\"Human flesh needs human flesh. Because only flesh is value\\" [27]. And later: \\"I'm waiting! I'm waiting for what I want! A certain type of life which I call LIFE. So far I haven't been able to get there because I need another person, V, and what's happened and is still happening between me and V is nothing, ****... I want blood\\" [28]. Rimbaud prefers \\"the vulnerability of real identity\\" to the bourgeois self (a pre-existing self that would be identical to itself). R's identity is, strictly speaking, a non-identity: he is a multiple series of selves rather than the self-sameness of the unique self that would come before all others. His desire to become other-than-himself, to be exteriorized as his own double, is inextricably bound to his relation to V. Identity is both constituted and destroyed by the sexual relation.It is a relation that gives rise to the most intense experience of pain. Sexuality is not absolute communion, the fusion of the self and the Other, but rather absolute loneliness: what is most distinctive about the sexual relation is the *absence* of all bonds between the persons involved. Whereas R's relationship to V is one of submission, fragility, and addiction, the latter's relationship to the former is something that could be reduced to a moral decision (Verlaine is able to choose between Rimbaud and his responsibilities as a husband, father, and member of civil society). One witnesses a certain dissymmetry in the relation between R. and V. in scene after scene of this work. What marks their rapport is the fact that this relation is unequal and without a future. The hopelessness of the relation belongs to it essentially and defines both of its members. Love becomes, as well, synonymous with coercion, the penetration of rape, and the agony of torture: \\"R's consciousness of his love for V was a torture rack\\" [62]. R hates to desire V. He desires V because he hates V, because V is killing him. As Rimbaud says to his mentor African Pain: \\"I need what you're doing to me because it's only pain and being controlled which're going to cut through my autism. Because it's pain you give me I love you\\" [5]. Acker's \\"Rimbaud\\" is inescapably drawn to Verlaine because of the pain that the latter inflicts upon him. He discovers love through pain and this is the only experience that would allow him to \\"demolish\\" \\"identity\\" [18] altogether: \\"There's no way out but death or consciousness... Break the heart's dead ice. He knew that the habitual self had to be broken\\" [16].When V. withdraws from R's life altogether in order not to be named a \\"homosexual,\\" R accedes to another relation... It is at this point that R renounces poetry and pronounces poetry's end---although one cannot assign a precise date, August 1873, for instance, to this renunciation and pronouncement---and is transformed utterly: \\"Each person has the possibility of being simultaneously several beings, having several lives\\" [92]. It is not as if Rimbaud discarded his past self as if it were an old shell and entered into a new one (that of an arms dealer and ivory trader). What is affirmed is the esential instability and uncertainty of all identity: that the \\"I\\" is already the \\"Non-I.\\"The renunciation of poetry corresponds precisely to the renunciation of Verlaine and what he represents: the self-sameness of subjectivity conceived as substance. Such is Acker's implicit explanation of R's alleged \\"silence\\"---which was not a form of silence at all, but the accession to another order of writing. It is not merely the case that R has broken with his past self and is transmuted into an imperialist (such is a conclusion that Acker has rejected). He enters into an experience in which the self is continually annihilated and reformed, an experience in which the self proliferates into a series of duplicable selves or non-selves. R's narrative ends with the affirmation of an *other* consciousness: not a new consciousness that would supersede one that would come before it, but a consciousness that is always entirely other-than-itself. R's apparent renunciation of poetry, mistyped as his \\"silence,\\" was in fact a phenomenological turn toward the experience of the self as an other.All of Acker's work is severely flawed and IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITY is no exception. But these flaws are tied to the success of her densely individuated style. Acker's \\"bad writing\\" (and carelessness is in evidence here---I have seldom read a book with more typographical and syntactical errors) may be read, charitably, as a mark of her iconoclasm, her refusal to fashion a well-crafted masterpiece that would be accepted within the canon of traditional literary history. Unfortunately, the stylization of the narrative is not immune to this prctice. The description of the relationship between R and V is, I'm afraid, only intermittently compelling and tends to veer toward mere compilation and summary of biographical data. The deadpan repetition of \\"facts\\" from R's life denies any pathetic identification on the part of the reader. This, in itself, would not be disturbing if pathos were not what IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITY were all about. The work is most impressive when Acker gives herself over to the desire, however juvenile, to shock her audience and approximates the punk sensibility of her vastly inferior early novel, BLOOD AND GUTS IN HIGH SCHOOL (1980), while bringing to the work a far greater intelligence. And yet the work lacks the critical naivete that made Acker's early writing powerful. Most troubling in this regard are the frequent intrusions of Acker the Professor and Literary Theorist into the space of the narrative. Everything proceeds as if the author had surfeited herself with postmodern theory to the point at which she could only write narratives fraught with savvy, self-interpretive statements. She *anticipates* the interpretation of her work in the hands of her informed readership. IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITY thus takes on the strange appearance of a book that reads itself.Dr. Joseph Suglia"},{"Title":"In Memoriam To Identity","review":"This book was just way over my head. I was impressed with Acker's ability to vividly expose the true inner monologues of her characters, but I just didn't grasp the point or even what was going on half the time.

It is one of the few times I've ever \\"walked out\\" on a book, because it was simply unreadable.Perhaps in 1992 this would have been considered shocking and oh-so-postmodern, but today it seems ridiculously contrived in its attempts to use offensive language, and to blur lines of pseudohistorical drama and political tracts, that it's actually laughable. Acker proves herself the queen of the non-sequitur; as these non-characters explore their useless, sex-and-violence-based relationships, they'll throw in comments about the smell of their ..., or half-baked sociopolitical theories for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. One fun game is to count how many times a character will use the phrase \\"I love you\\" or \\"I hate you,\\" with no provocation whatsoever -- somehow it reminds me of awful Italian modernist movies from the 60's. At first, her awkward style is mildly intriguing, but about 20 pages in you realize that Acker relentlessly continues in this vein, ad absurdum.You will get NOTHING out of this novel. No insight, or even much entertainment, I expect. Perhaps for some historical value, that is, to rediscover what kind of ... people were fawning over back when postmodernism was still hot in academic (not so much artistic) circles.

In here Frege establishes the nature of arithmetics as founded in logic, which is his logicist proposal. For that, he refutes the assertion that logic as such is founded on psychology.Sometimes he distorts a little bit what others say about logic, so he argues against those thinkers more effectively. In here he establishes the anti-psycology difference between concept and object; though he has not made a difference yet between sense and reference. He also refers to a principle called the contextual principle, in which the word makes reference to something depending on the context. Afterwards after he wrote the book, he would reject this principle, because of his doctrine of sense and reference: the sense of the words determine the sense of the sentence; and the reference of the words determine the reference of the sentence.This is a great philosophical work, and I would suggest it to anyone who is starting to study Analytic philosophy (philosophy of mathematics, logic and language), and also those who want to consider the platonist proposal."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Arithmetic, A logico-mathematical enquiry into the concept of number","review":"You know how _frustrating_ it is, reading a platonic dialog? Some question like \\"What is virtue?\\" or \\"What is justice\\" is asked, and Socretes goes on for pages showing that the so-called \\"experts\\" don't have a clue about what it really is?But what's _really_ frustrating is that you're all expecting, at the end of the dialog, after following a hard line of argument, that you'll be rewarded with THE definitivie definition of 'virtue' or 'justice' or whatever--only to be disapointed. All you get in the end is a new appreciation of your own hopeless ignorance......well, imagine a platonic dialog which started the same as any other platonic dialog, but with the question \\"What is a number?\\" Only this time, at the end of the dialog, you actually get an answer to the question?In retrospect, its pretty amazing that Plato didn't write a Socratic dialog concerned with the question \\"What is number?' After all, Plato considered numbers more real than physical objects, and people like the Pythagorians were going around claiming that everything _was_ made out of numbers. But what the heck _is_ a number, anyways?Perhaps the reason was that everybody thought they already understood what numbers were. But Frege, like Socretes before him, realized that this so-called knowledge was really just a collective ignorance. So Frege starts out this book with a thorough, merciless review of what his coleages and predicessors were saying about what numbers were, showing that they ranged from cocksure to confused, from pompously-wrongheaded to just plain silly.But then Frege does something really amazing--for the first time in history, he goes on give a real answer to the question \\"what are numbers?\\" Building on the work of Hume, he gives a sustained argument now known as \\"Frege's theorem\\" which shows how numbers can be grounded on an understanding of one-to-one correspondence.Unfortunately, this work had to wait almost a century for the rest of us to really catch up to its significance. Russell found a contradiction in the arguments presented here, and for the next 80 years attention shifted elsewhere. But first Charles Parsons, in 1964, and then Crispen Wright and others in the 80's and 90's begain to realize that Frege's theorem could be reconstructed without the paradox. This sparked a whole flurry of neo-Fregean studies which is one of the most active branches of analytic philosophy today.This revival means that Frege's importance, and the importance of reading and comming to grips with the arguments presented by Frege in this book, are going to continue to grow. Although tragically Frege didn't live to see the day, we now realize that the line of reasoning he followed in this book was one of those signature moments in human history, every bit as profound as the invention of the wheel or the discovery of the pythagorian theorem--it was the moment where, for the first time ever, the question \\"what the heck _are_ numbers, anyways?\\" got a real answer."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Arithmetic, A logico-mathematical enquiry into the concept of number","review":"possibly one of the greatest works in history of philosophy and the founding book of 20th century analytic philosophy...

The first three quarters of the book are devoted to a critical analysis of the idea of previous writers (Kant, Leibnitz, Grassmann, Mill, Lipschitz, Hankel, Jevons, Cantor, Schr&ouml;der, Hobbers, Hume, and others) on the subject of number, and Frege does not find the ideas of any of these philosophers and mathematicians entirely satisfactory. His conclusions is \\"that a statement of a number contains an assertion about a concept,\\" and his definition of number is: The number which belongs to the concept F is the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept F.\\"Frege regards the number zero as belonging to to the \\"natural\\" or \\"counting\\" numbers, whereas we subscribe to the view that zero is not a counting number at all (the first of the counting numbers being 1) and is only properly used when we regard a number as a \\"relative-magnitude,\\" zero being the relative-magnitude of two equal counting numbers.This work of Frege's has considerable historical interest as a forerunner of the work of Whitehead and Russell.

It did exactly that."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Arithmetic, A logico-mathematical enquiry into the concept of number","review":"Following his Begriffsschrift, eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens of 1879, Gottlob Frege published Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik, eine logisch-mathematische Untersuchung &uuml;ber den Begriff der Zahl in 1884, of which The Foundations of Arithmetic is a translation. In 1893 and 1903 he published respectively volume one and volume two of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, begriffsschriftlich abgeleitet.A translation of Frege's Begriffsschrifft is available in the source bookFrom Frege to G&ouml;del: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931where it is entitled \\"Begriffsschrifft, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought\\". His Grundgesetze der Arithmetik has not been fully translated into English, but a partial translation is available asBasic Laws of Arithmetic.In The Foundations of Arithmetic [1884], Frege is concerned with the nature of number and the question of what could be the foundation of arithmetic. He begins with an overview and critique of the thinking of various mathematicians and philosophers on these issues and finds them all unsatisfactory. He then presents his own view.Frege's position links numbers to concepts, which is rather like explaining one mystery through another. He asserts that \\"the Number which belongs to the concept F is the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept F\\"\\", adding in a footnote that \\"I assume that it is known what the extension of a concept is\\". (pp. 79-80; section 68) [Die Anzahl, welche dem Begriffe F zukommt, ist der Umfang des Begriffes \\"gleichzahlig dem Begriffe F\\".]From this he derives that \\"the proposition {the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept F\\" is identical with the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept G\\"} is true if and only if the proposition {the same number belongs to the concept F as to the concept G} is also true.\\" (p. 80; I've used the curly brackets to quote propositions which Frege quotes either by offsetting or by quotation marks; they have nothing to do with sets.)Note that Frege's definition of number (ignoring the translation's distinction between 'number' and 'Number') implies that the concept of number has a number belonging to it, and the number which belongs to the concept number is the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept number\\". It's not evident that Frege has clarified the concept of number, especially since he assumes it is known what a concept is and what the extension of a concept is.Frege continues by defining equality between concepts. Two concepts F and G are equal if and only if \\"there exists a relation ~ which correlates one to one the objects falling under the concept F with the objects falling under the concept G.\\" (p. 85; I used ~ where Frege used the symbol for phi.) He needs to define equality because he's defined the number belonging to a concept F as the extension of the concept \\"equal to the concept F\\".If F* represents the concept \\"equal to the concept F\\" then for any concept F, the extension of F* is the number belonging to F. So for any concept F, the concept of the relation of being equal to F is the concept F*, and the extension of F* is a number. (This notation is not Frege's but follows his meaning.)Any relation ~ which correlates, one to one, the objects \\"falling under\\" a concept with the objects \\"falling under\\" another concept establishes the equality of those concepts. Equality in this sense is numerical and need not mean the objects or the concepts are identical, although it allows for identity since F~F and so every concept is numerically equal to itself. The number belonging to F is the extension of the relation F* of equality with F.This equality between F and any concept G is defined as being a one to one correlation between \\"the objects falling under the concept F\\" and \\"the objects falling under the concept G\\". The extension of F* is then the number of objects \\"falling under the concept F\\" and also \\"falling under\\" any concept G that is equal (under F*) to F. This implies that F~G if and only if F*=G*, where = represents the identity of the extensions of F* and G*.Any two concepts related to F are related to one another via F. If ~ and ^ are two relations of equality such that F~G and F^H then, abusing notation, G~F^H is a one to one relation between the objects of G and H via F. Since F* is the concept \\"equal to the concept F\\", any concept G that is equal to the concept F would presumably \\"fall under\\" F* and therefore be in its extension. But the extension of F* is the number belonging to F.So it seems, unless Frege intends a distinction, that the extension of F* is both a number and all of the concepts equal to the concept F, including F itself. It's tempting to believe that Frege is is talking indirectly about what is now called an equivalence relation, with the number belonging to the concept F being the equivalence class of all concepts equal to F. But is he?Proceeding to define specific numbers, Frege defines zero as \\"0 is the Number which belongs to the concept \\"not identical to itself\\".\\" (p. 87; section 74) [0 ist die Anzahl, welche dem Begriffe \\"sich selbst ungleich\\" zukommt.] (The German 'ungleich' could mean \\"not equal\\" and so Frege could intend that 0 is the number which belongs to the concept \\"not equal to itself\\". I suspect this is what he meant, since he's defined equality but not identity. It makes a difference, but to shorten the review, I'll follow the translation.)If we refer to this concept \\"not identical to itself\\" as the concept Q, then 0 belongs to Q. So the concept \\"not identical to itself\\" is the concept Q, and the concept Q* is the concept \\"equal to the concept Q\\" which translates as Q* is the concept \\"equal to the concept \\"not identical to itself\\"\\". The extension of Q* is 0.If we understand the extension of the concept Q* as the number of \\"objects falling under\\" the concept Q, then the only way this is going to come out right is if there are no \\"objects falling under\\" Q. This appears to mean that Q has no extension, or has a so-called empty extension. So does there exist a one to one relation # such that Q#Q? Even though Q is the concept \\"not identical to itself\\", Q as a concept is identical to itself (you can see Russell with his pipe and his paradox approaching briskly from just over the hill), and since Q is identical to itself it must be equal to itself, if identity implies equality. So # must exist.However, Frege has defined equality between concepts as dependent upon a one to one relation, and if Q has no \\"objects falling under it\\" how can there be such a relation? Frege gets around this by asserting that any relation whatsoever suffices to demonstrate Q's equality with itself since \\"no object falls under it\\". (p. 89) Although Q has no extension, the extension of Q* is 0, and since Q#Q, it seems that Q \\"falls under\\" Q*.Frege defines a successor n of a number m such that \\"there exists a concept F, and an object falling under it x, such that the Number which belongs to the concept F is n and the number which belongs to the concept \\"falling under F but not identical with x\\" is m\\". (p. 89; section 76)Replace x above with 0. Replace F above with the concept \\"identical with 0\\". (p. 90) However, following Frege, replace 'falling under F but not identical with x' not with 'falling under the concept \\"identical with 0\\" but not identical with 0', but rather with 'identical with 0 but not identical with 0', which comes to the same thing, since whatever \\"falls under\\" the concept \\"identical with 0\\" is presumably identical with 0.We then have: there exists a concept \\"identical with 0\\" and an object 0 falling under it, such that the number which belongs to the concept \\"identical with 0\\" is n and the number which belongs to the concept \\"identical with 0 but not identical with 0\\" is m. [\\"gleich 0 aber nicht gleich 0\\"] Frege tells us that 0 is the number which belongs to the concept \\"identical with 0 but not identical with 0\\", and that 1 is the number which belongs to the concept \\"identical with 0\\". (p. 90)Q is the concept \\"not identical to itself\\". Q* is the concept \\"equal to the concept Q\\". The extension of Q* is 0, the number belonging to Q. The concept Q is empty.If we represent the concept \\"identical with 0\\" by E, then E* is the concept \\"equal to the concept E\\". The extension of E* is the number belonging to E. Frege tells us that 1 is the number belonging to E. So the extension of E* is 1. The concept E is not empty.The extension of Q* is 0. The extension of E* is 1. If the concept \\"identical with 0\\" is equal to 0 then E~Q* where ~ is a one to one relation. In modern set theoretical terms, it appears that Frege is almost saying that \\"0={}\\" and \\"1={{}}\\". If this is correct, then the object \\"falling under\\" the concept E is the number belonging to the concept Q. This makes sense of the assertion that E is the concept \\"identical with 0\\", as well as the relation E~Q*.See the book for more details."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Arithmetic, A logico-mathematical enquiry into the concept of number","review":"His conclusion (p.99e) is that the laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a priori.Note that he is very consistently hard on Mill.Some interesting quotes: p. 115e #106. \\"...number is neither a collection of things nor a property of such, yet at the same time is not a subjective product of mental processes either, we concluded that a statement of number asserts something objective of a concept....

Austin (who translated the work for the use of an Oxford undergraduate course); and perhaps Frege's platonism got the best of Austin, and this work is really just as , well, Kantian as it appears, \\"a good sight\\" more Kantian than \\"standard\\" Frege is typically allowed to be. Frege's definition of number in terms of equipollence (one-one correspondence of sets) is legendary: that is to say, it is traditionally understood to do a great deal more work than the \\"thin\\" version allowed by mathematical logic as reconstructed to avoid Russell's paradox.But here Frege's work-up of the concept for a general readership is so \\"genteel\\" as to suggest that this may not in fact be the case, and that Frege actually partook more heavily of Neo-Kantian bromides than his *theory of arithmetic* suggests; to wit, that this theory was always intended to be situated within a general philosophy of mathematics obeying the strictures of reasoning involving Kantian \\"intuition\\" (as is typically said of Frege's last efforts in the field). As such, it would be unfortunate that we cannot effectively read this book (formerly available *en face*, and unfortunately much the worse for the original's omission) in conjunction with its contemporary geometrical counterpart: long out of print, rarely making its way into the philosophical Frege literature, and perhaps in all parts an *anticipatory* if \\"crochety\\" rebuke to Hilbertian formalism.Perhaps Frege was to a certain extent wholly other than the mathematics of his time; perhaps we are not well-served by a Frege \\"out of time\\"; we certainly have one of the great prose stylists of English on hand here, and perhaps it would actually do to consider his aptitude for \\"gold\\" extraction here as a clue to puzzling out the rest of Frege -- a figure supremely unconcerned with sameness of meaning, and already owing a certain debt to those para-philosophical figures all his work is at cross-purposes with (the German '70s having been quite a time indeed).

It also includes appropriately beautiful photographs of old places and buildings, lending it a sense of some of the places where the Celts once live. It synopsizes many popular Celtic myths, like that of Rhiannon and the tragic story of the Children of Lir, and refers often to Taliesin the Welsh bard.However this book also is heavy-handed with western preconceptions which color the author's telling of supposed truths. To her credit, she mentions several times that the Celts passed down knowledge by oral traditions rather than written texts. There is a juxtaposition of many Christian ideals onto the Celtic history, including a rather stilted reference injected into the aforementioned 'Children of Lir' retelling. The setting for this myth was long before St. Patrick came to Ireland and reveals this to be a rather telling mistake. There is sufficient evidence to be found in studying Celtic history and lore that the Celts believed in reincarnation, a fact mentioned in a quote in this book attributed to Taliesin, however the conclusion is still drawn here that the Celts believed in a Judeo-Christian style of living their life to try to get into a good afterlife which would end their days incarnate.These glaring cosmetic errors aside, I cannot divine the ultimate point of this book. The back cover text seems to indicate it is a collection of Celtic wisdom, which does not sit well with the interior flaps' comparison of this book with the Tibetan Book of the Dead -- a book illustrating the process believed by the Tibetan Buddhists to take place during and after death. The book glosses over the darker aspects of Celtic history and myth, and again displays a knack for making assumptions that have little basis in the work itself. It seems almost like fluff material, a simplified, mainstreamed version of the prettier and more 'acceptable' (by western standards) aspects of the Celtic culture.

But the foundation of my point comes when we are faced with the study of previous points to the well defined P1, P2, and P3. Here, as we are introduced to the use of a previous point to the P set, that new point is being referenced as P1, and the subsequent points as P2 and P3. So, now the new point is P1, what used to be P1 is now P2, and the old P2 becomes P3.

The color photos, all taken by Marilyn Newton, are grouped together in the beginning of the book, comprising 20 slick pages of almost 50 photos. It's hard to believe that wagon ruts from over 150 years ago still exist in places; happily, our continuous farming, building and paving haven't obliterated all traces of the route that so many people rode--and walked--in order to reach California.Portraits, maps, drawings and sketches from the period are interspersed with sepia-toned contemporary photographs, some taken by Newton and some by other photographers, and appear on every page of the book. &quot;The Donner Party Chronicles&quot; is visually rich and stimulating. The area around Donner Lake and the route the relief parties followed are depicted in all seasons of the year. Even in black-and-white, the photos of Donner Lake and the surrounding mountains demonstrate the ruggedness of the terrain and deeply impress upon the reader the hopelessness the members of the Donner Party must have felt upon being snowed-in at the lake.The book reads like a journal that would have been kept by one of the emigrants traveling with the Donner Party. The text is reprinted from installments journalist Frank Mullen, Jr. published in the weekly newspaper &quot;The Reno Gazette-Journal&quot; over the course of an entire year. The daily routine followed, problems encountered, and decisions made by the Donner Party are chronicled in a concise manner. The entries are short, most three or four paragraphs in length.One very interesting feature of &quot;The Donner Party Chronicles&quot; is the map of the Emigrant Trail that appears on every left-hand page of the book, with the progress of the doomed emigrants clearly marked with a red dot. As you read along through the book, you see on every other page exactly where the emigrants were as the day's events took place. I found this map extremely helpful and fascinating. Watching the movement of the Donner Party as they traveled on foot at the pace of slow, plodding oxen made me better able to understand how great an undertaking their overland journey was. I shared this book with my husband, my Dad and my father-in-law, and they enjoyed it almost as much as I did!This book is well worth the price, for the interesting text as well as the terrific photos; you can easily find what you're looking for in the pages, as each page is dated and the day's entry fairly short."},{"Title":"The Donner Party Chronicles: A Day-by-Day Account of a Doomed Wagon Train, 1846-47","review":"Frank Mullen has added an important book to the history of Donner Party.

The Donner Chronicles tells the story of doomed pioneers and their struggle to survive. It keeps the reader at the edge of his seat and provides great detail of the period and the people.

Mullen obviously took copious notes to piece together the history of the Donner Party from many sources, including retracing the path of the wagon train.

If you are looking for an in-depth telling of the Donner Party story rich with anecdotes and emotion, this is not the book for you. I made the mistake of assuming that the chronological format of this book would give the author an interesting opportunity to share details from specific days of the party's journey. Instead, every chapter is a wash, not nearly using the referenced primary sources to their fullest, most revealing and telling potential. The book is formatted much like a middle-school text book and reads like one, too. The writing is poor, bare-bones, repetitive and elementary. However, if you're looking for a coffee-table book that guests can simply open and say, \\"Oh, you have a book on the Donner Party\\", get this book; that is all it is good for."},{"Title":"The Red Network: A \\"Who's Who\\" and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots","review":"Elizabeth Dilling Stokes was born, raised, and educated in Chicago. After attending the University of Chicago she married, and for many years devoted her life to her children, social activities on the North Shore of Chicago, and being a concert harpist. After hearing of the great \\"humanitarian experiment\\" in Soviet Russia, she traveled there in 1931, and was able to go behind the scenes. She was shocked at the forced labor, the squalid living quarters, and deplorable living conditions, and the atmosphere of fear created by the Soviet dictatorship.She was most shocked by the virulent anti-Christianity of the atheist Communist regime.Following her return to the United States she lectured and wrote about what she had seen, realizing from the opposition which immediately arose that a substantial Marxist movement was active in the United States. In 1934 her first book The Red Network was published, and expos&eacute; of the persons and organizations furthering Red causes in the United States. In 1936, her second book, The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background, was published.Almost immediately after these books were published, she was attacked as \\"anti-semitic,\\" although she had actually offered her anti-Communist services to Jewish organizations, and knew nothing of organized Jewish involvement in the Marxist movement. After researching and studying, however, in 1940 she published her third book The Octopus, which dealt with these subjects.After World War II commenced, Mrs. Dilling became convinced that, despite President Roosevelt's protestations that not one American boy would ever again fight on foreign soil, there was a movement afoot to involve the United States, with the result that a substantial part of the world would be communized later. In 1941, she led a Mother's March on Washington to oppose the \\"Lend Lease\\" bill, proclaimed to help keep us out of war by its sponsors, but proving the last step for our involvement. The bill passed by only one vote. A few months later, the United States went to war.In 1944, Mrs. Dilling's views involved her in the now infamous mass \\"sedition\\" trial. The case was ultimately dismissed by a Federal Court as \\"a travesty on justice.\\"She was later remarried to Jeremiah Stokes, a Christian anti-Communist writer, and she continued to write and lecture in behalf of Christianity and Constitutional Americanism. In 1964, she published The Plot Against Christianity, arguably her greatest work.Mrs. Dilling Stokes died in 1966 at the age of 72."},{"Title":"The Red Network: A \\"Who's Who\\" and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots","review":"Here are the first two paragraphs of her wiki.Elizabeth Dilling Stokes (April 19, 1894 - May 26, 1966) was an American anti-communist, antisemitic, Nazi-sympathizing anti-war activist, and writer in the 1930s and 1940s, who stood trial for Sedition in what is now called the Great Sedition Trial of 1944.[1][2][3]The author of four political books, Dilling claimed that Marxism and \\"Jewry\\" were synonymous.[4] She believed that Francisco Franco was a brave Christian.[5] She claimed many prominent figures were Communist sympathizers, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Mahatma Gandhi, Franz Boas and Sigmund Freud.[6]...So consider yourself warned."},{"Title":"The Red Network: A \\"Who's Who\\" and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots","review":"I was hardly able to contain my rage as I read this book, but, after having some time to digest it, I can only thank Miss E.

Having a computer science background, I could grasp the concepts easily and never seem to get bored of the book. Even if you don't have a background in programming, I definitely recommend this book to start you off because its an easy read, and you will not have go through tons of concepts before reaching the code but instead, it'll present useful coded examples followed with important explainations on how/why its done.I got this book because I wanted to start off my Delphi adventure, and it delivered! Its also comforting to know that its not a thick book!! It gives you plenty of examples and teaches you what you REALLY need to know, using Object Pascal and the RAD components! Not only that, it gives you self-review and practice questions to work on after each chapter. So basically it cuts to the chase and tells you what you ought to learn rather than what you might find useful.As a conclusion, I recommend that you buy this book whatever your level of programming may be as it not only shows you how Delphi is used but also builds up your foundation on programming principles as shown in the book."},{"Title":"Discover Delphi: Programming Principles Explained (International Computer Science Series)","review":"I have two semesters of Turbo Pascal 7.0.

This book and it's examples all work with this version. If you are a newbie (like me), inexperienced and unsure (like me), this is the book for you. It is definitely worth the money. The chapter quizzes and exercises require you to review and practice the things you learned throughout the chapter. It is not written in &quot;technical terms&quot;.

It goes straight in with programing examples and doesnt provide a good foundation for understanding how delphi programs are structured. The tiny chapter on objects was very poor. Also they never explained how find the info on the components. I think the fact that delhpi is so easy to use may make this book seem better than it is. It is a bit like giving people instructions without ever helping them to undestand what they are doing. I expect beginers will like it because it avoids the in depth explanations and is more about trying out examples.If you are already a proficient programer then you will find this book far to long. It could be easily sumarised it into 50 pages and still contain all the info. If you want to learn about Object Orientated programing forget this book. The thing that most anoyed me was the fact that they had code snippets that were numbered as if from line 1 when the code was not from the start of the program. To the novice programer this could be very confusing. And they had snippets with no line numbering.

In the late 1970s a boy who was being overseen by former government officials,\\"Patsy\\" was assigned a female social worker by the name of Debbie Richards, a name mentioned in this book. Patsy was bounced around in state child care while William Bulger was in the Senate. In 1982 Patsy was befriended by \\"Tim\\",a man claiming to be a former \\"mental health counselor\\" undergoing a career change while at technical school. Just prior to meeting \\"Tim\\", another man appeared in Woburn,Mass ,where Patsy lived, going by the same name at a different address. \\"Patsy II\\" began creating problems for Patsy I, notably going AWOL in the army and much more while sending authorities after Patsy I.In 1992 Patsy was introduced by mutual friend to \\"John Doe\\" and a new friendship was formed. In 1995 Whitey fled after a local newspaper article in the Boston area did a story on Patsy' search for his unknown father and family roots.About the same time, \\"Tim\\" and \\"John Doe\\" began acting strange...\\"Tim\\" began acting inexplicably hostile while \\"John Doe\\" began acting hostile and accusatory. Later,John Doe claimed to be taking notes and possibly tape recording staged conversations, in which Patsy was steered into making statements which could be taken out of context as if building a case for later use. Tim began doing the same.Tim hailed from the area where an FBI office existed in Merrimack Valley in Massachusetts. This whole situation appeared as if a boy tied to one of the principals in the Bulger case was systematically assigned monitors to keep tabs on him during the period Bulger and Flemmi operated and when Bulger fled and the situation unravelled, the boy,now a man,became a target of revulsion and blackballing. The boy might have had ties to Bulger's victims,adversaries, government agents, etc.Even the Dept. of Justice, which Patsy corresponded with concerning the harassment, claimed no knowledge of the correspondence, citing its classified records section."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I have read many books and of all the books I have read I have only left 1 unfinished.

Why are documents only now coming out? If it is as alleged, how could this relatively small group have operated for so many years and held the Justice Dept and FBI headquarters at bay? Were there serious crimes going on that the agents and informants in the region were battling that we know nothing of? Given the success of the program, was it mimicked all over? What,if any plans for perpetuating the program were or have been in place? Were successors planned?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In addition to all the obvious ones in this book serious concerns about tactics and such can be raised. The amount of monitoring intrusion is alarming in that the intrusions are basically carte blanche and without rigorous judicial oversight and conservatism.Do we want any agency of our government to monitor our most personal conversations or activities? Do you want government agents monitoring you as you cry,pray,masturbate,make love to someone special,etc.? Even if there is a legitimate need, how do we know this information is not gathered simply to publicly humiliate later on? Has the government and its agents proven trustworthy in this case,MK Ultra,Cointelpro, and so forth?What protections do ordinary law abiding citizens have to offset approved institutional tyranny or by rogue agents thereof?

For that matter, the authors hold such deep contempt for John Connolly that their reporting of &quot;true&quot; incidents seems terribly biased. I don't doubt that after all the court cases have made it through the system, they will right yet another book.

It was so redundant. The authors attempted (rather weakly) to create all this hype. I can summarize the book in a few sentences-- Mobsters and FBI agents conspire to commit crimes and cover up those crimes using the power of the FBI office. They get cocky, they get busted. Wow, end of story. And oh- paratroopers dont \\"storm the beaches\\" they \\"parachute\\" usually behind enemy lines to create shock and awe and disrupt the enemies supply lines.

Either these guys are really as dangerous as is alleged or something is wrong here. Did these guys choose this or were they forced to do this? How much did they do and how much is attributed to them as whipping boys? Who in their right mind would choose this sort of life? Bulger has been alleged to be a serial killer-- but no one is contemplating the difference between one who murders for hire and one who murders from some psychological disturbance. Society is designed to handle the serial killer but not the sociopath who kills because of a VALUE problem, not because of mental incompetency. Bulger and Flemmi have been alleged to demand 'their cut..' but a further question remains-- who demanded 'their cut' from Bulger and Flemmi? Human nature is largely to blame for this scenario. If you do not pay your taxes, fail to pay traffic tickets, or are unfortunate enough to have a court rule against you, men and women with guns, not bibles, come to see you.And with vague construction and swift stroke of pen, legislators can initiate a chain of events that can hurl individuals into financial ruin or homelessness,effectively harming them as much as an overtly violent act can.As long as a 'survival of the fittest' mentality prevails, we will always have organized crime,public corruption and sheep and wolves."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There is a man who was driven out of Massachusetts and totally impoverished when Whitey fled the state. The man is mentioned in some reviews here and seems to have become a target for major harassment. The man,following this case becoming a media spectacle,attempted to contact Dan Burton but Mr. Burton's phone number was promptly disconnected while just prior his aides gave the man the run around. Before trying to contact Mr. Burton, the man attempted to contact Senator Kennedy,Marty Meehan,Scott Harshbarger,John Kerry and many more but was ignored on all accounts.This might seem as Powerful forces ignoring some nutcase, but consider the following:1) A few years before Bulger fled the man was &quot;briefed&quot; by a government official about an ongoing project at a defense contractor in Massachusetts but not told what the project involved or how he was connected to it nor the duration while being forced to sign an acknowledgement.2) The man had as key adults in his life growing up links to names or organizations pertinent to some of the government personnel scrutinized in this case.3) The man has been kept in a state of impoverishment particularly the past 3 years while creditors such as Citibank Discover and many more have been extremely unsympathetic despite being given extensive explanations of the circumstances.4) The man, until 1995 and after, was always able to care for himself and often worked 2-4 jobs simultaneously to do so.. making the circumstances following Bulger's 1995 flight from justice appear as if the man was being forced to fail in every way and aspect of life, similar to treatment State Trooper Johnson received after stopping Whitey at Logan airport and before Johnson committed suicide.5) The man is said to have been befriended by associates with links to John Connelly as a young child and which acquaintances suddenly turned hostile and manipulative when this all broke out.6) The man apparently has convenient telephone problems in sync with the Government Reform hearings or when a major news story appears about developments in the Bulger case.It is quite likely for example, if the Government Reform committee attempted to contact the man in person,by letter, or by phone that such attempts would be intefered with in an aura of convenient coincidence."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One might ask after reading this excellent book whether 2 kids,say brothers, were groomed to follow in the Bulger's footsteps but perhaps something went awry??I know of 2 brothers from Massachusetts. Both were raised in state care during Bulger's reign. The older brother went into the army and a couple years later the younger was being harassed by activities a man who bore the same name in the same town, as if the younger brother had another identity created and which was made to look bad to hurt him in the identity confusion following. It is speculated the older brother set up the younger brother, both from Woburn,Mass and that the older brother after a name change went into FBI service at his younger brother's constant expense.Wherever the younger brother went the older followed and bad thingsalways happened to the younger as a result. There is a lot that went on but it looks as a duplicate of the Bulger's good guy/bad guy pairing for controlling different levels of influence was going on."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"It may be possible Bulger and Flemmi were selected as young children to be future informants because of a combination of street smarts and intellect. If this is the case,the future of these guys may have been mapped out for them by Intelligence and Law Enforcement officials without their ever knowing at a federal level.As an example, i know of one man who grew up in state child care abandoned by his family, abused and neglected. This man tested high on academic achievement despite this history using conventional measures. As a child the boy was shuffled about in a seeming random fashion until junior high and high school.At the beginning of high school the boy was tested and deemed college ready immediately at any college in the US. A large number of state and state-funded private workers,some with government service backgrounds, handled the child and there was considerable sanitization of his records as time went on. At key points if the boy competed in contests where intelligence was in some way measured, unusual outcomes resulted in his &quot;underachievement&quot;, as if to keep the boy from generating attention or interference from individuals who might have an educational interest in the boy's future.In high school a man going by the same name as this boy appeared in the same town he lived in.This man had a military service record and used this boy's address sometimes to mislead. On several occasions the identity of the other man was confused with this boy,inviting local police scrutiny. Eventually the boy (now a man) 'ended up' at a defense contractor and was subject to intimidation and numerous personal intrusions. Nearly 20 years later the man joined a prominent local church and this man who had been using his address and name was still following him around! How many career prospects were destroyed for the boy now a man? Does he even know?If Bulger and Flemmi had this sort of thing going on, they were set up as young children and steered into a future they had zero control over.This may have involved agencies far beyond the FBI or the Justice Dept, but the FBI is left holding the bag for it. The nature of classified work is such that a handful of people know the truth and even if information is shared, it is selective and can be misleading in the way it is given. if our government is hypothetically capable of molding children 'La Femme Nikita' style, how much blame goes to the kid and to the government officials that permit this to happen?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"When this case broke in 1995, i worked for a company with many government contracts and heavy political ties and affiliations with government agencies. Not long before it broke, I was pulled into an office and threatened that i was going to be 'monitored' by an agency with ominous overtones.Over the next few months my apartment was entered twice while i was away on vacation after the security rep at work seemed to make friendly and innocent inquiries as to how long i would be away etc. I began getting strange calls to old friends by 'official sounding' unidentified individuals. Shortly after Bulger disappeared, i was suddenly fired from my job and maneuvered into a position in which several individuals suggested they had ties to law enforcement and government agencies.

This case brings many questions to bear. The Justice Dept oversees the Bureau of Prisons and the FBI so has powers of prosecution and incarceration. The FBI investigates itself and the Justice Dept via the Office of Professional Responsibility. The CIA investigates itself, as does presumably the NSA. Informants,their friends and family members are used all over.Sometimes informants even go so far as to become lovers with targets or unsuspecting associates of them only to break their heart later, unconcerned about the trail of heartbreak and hurt left behind. All too often we find the truths we suspect but cannot be proven true later when a final confession is made by an agency or its agents of morally and ethically questionable tactics. One problem in this case is that it seems as if agents are attributed with morew authority than they probably have, thus protecting higher ups who really did have the authority. We do not know what happened with the profits from this operation nor the forces that went into making Flemmi, a former Army paratrooper, and Bulger , a former Air Force veteran informants. Bulger came from an environment where police beat suspects mercilessly, and rival gangs struggled for power. Much has been made of Bulger and Flemmi's 'gang' but the reality is that all of us need membership in a 'gang' to survive. And once the intelligence agencies get involved, the target becomes the subject of harassment, extensive privacy invasions, and psychological warfare and character assassination using any means to alienate the target from friends,family, employers,etc. all but those cleared for the activities of the operative. Only a handful know the true purpose of the operative and those fulfilling the profile requirements. Until all the facts are in we cannot know if Flemmi and Bulger truly acted on their own or where threatened,coerced or otherwise manipulated by the FBI, CIA,Secret Service,NSA or other agencies.

From the experience of someone i know, a lot is being ignored or concealed in this case. Whitey's flight occurred around the time 'A Civil Action' was released by Jonathan Harr, about water pollution and a cancer epidemic in a city in Middlesex County,Massachusetts. The earliest signs of the epidemic occurred in the 1960s around the time Steve Flemmi was recruited by H Paul Rico. The water pollution controversy involved at some point the communities of Burlington, Winchester,Stoneham,Reading in addition to Woburn. Many thousands of people were potentially exposed to contaminated water. Middlesex County was a hub for space and military contracts, and Boston was a hub for military contracts as well. The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars began in the 1960s and according to Willie Fopiano the dividing line was Somerville and Charlestown.In 1963 John F. Kennedy was involved with NASA with Middlesex County (Woburn)a primary site.As the space budget had JFK's approval, miltary bases were cutting back.2 groups emerged:1)NASA for Woburn, and 2)Save our Shipyard(Boston Navy Yard).The Boston Navy Yard employed 3,000 and at least 10% of those lived in Middlesex County.The number of new jobs in Massachusetts to be created by the NASA site was roughly equal to or less the number of jobs at Boston Navy Yard but of different skillsets. A small group of workmen(according to local newspaper) transferred from Boston Navy Yard to Portsmouth Navy Yard. Not long after the USS Thresher (first fast attack nuclear sub)sank off Portsmouth,NH killing 129 sailors.A military officer testified before Congress that 20% of the backpressure relief valves had been installed backwards. So in 1963 the Thresher sank,JFK was shot and not long after the NASA site in Massachusetts collapsed, leaving millions of dollars in potential revenues and thousands of jobs abandoned. Given the military and space efforts in the area and cold war concerns with Vietnam raging, high national security in Massachusetts is a given. The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars began around the time of the events of 1963. Within Middlesex County reside or resided many of the characters noted in this case:Ring,Morris,Rico,Connolly,Limone,Mawn. In the area of the Boston Navy Yard: Flemmi, Bulger. In the collapse of the NASA deal,the chair of the Save our Shipyard committee, Cark Roessler, headed up the local Woburn Redevelopment Authority. Instead of NASA, Woburn and surrounding communities had industrial parks developed and local property taxes became among the lowest in the state. The wells in Woburn were not officially shut down until May,1979 and the controversy from the late 1950s until 1979 perpetuated.If they had been shutdown earlier, could this have been seen as a threat to either the NASA site or the industrial parks? Could the events in Massachusetts be summed up in Fletcher Knebel's book, 'Seven Days in May'?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In 1995 2 things happened: 1) Whitey Bulger vanished ,and 2) Jonatha Harr's \\" A Civil Action\\" came out. The earliest signs of epidemic emerged in the early to mid 1960s in Woburn, when NASA was looking to locate the future site of the Houston space center in Woburn on a 1,000 acre site at a a cost of $50-60 million and to create 2-3,000 new jobs. JFK was involved in this site decision and 2 committees were formed at this time:1) NASA for Woburn and 2) Save our Shipyard. Mayor Gilgun headed the NASA committee while Carl Roessler,President of Burlington's Trans-Sonic Corp., a flow measurement device manufacturer, headed the shipyard committee.Both Gilgun and Roessler lived in Woburn. This book details the controversy over who knew what and when and the eventual closure of the wells under Mayor Gill's administration in May,1979. As JFK began promoting the change of the U.S. economy more on space, Robert McNamara was making decisions on base closings.The Boston Navy yard and Portsmouth,NH navy yards were in the area of base closings.Prior to the sinking of the nuclear USS Thresher in 1963, a small group of workmen from the Boston navy yard transferred to Portsmouth. The Thresher sank,killing 100+ sailors and a military officer testified 20% of the back pressure relief valves were installed backwards causing hull collaps while other speculated welding flaws-- both workmanship issues.Boston Edison approved the 1,000 acre site for development in Woburn. JFK was shot, the deal fell through at about the time of a physical survey of the site, and the site was moved to Houston and became the Johnson space center while part of it remained in Cambridge known as Draper Labs.In 1965 Steve Flemmi arose and 8-10 years later recruited Whitey Bulger.The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars broke out.In 1995,John Connolly, former FBI agent and Boston Edison executive, came under fire when Bulger vanished. So too, did Rico,Ring,Morris,Salemme,Mercurio,Condon most of which have ties to the Woburn area.As controversy surrounding Nick Paleologos and this book soared the Bulger case exploded also. At the peak of high emotions, Barry Mawn, of Woburn, appeared as head of the Boston FBI.In the 1960s-70s at the Woburn court was former FBI agent Ron Weafer and Tom Driscoll lived in the area at this time.Jan Schlictmann eventually worked for Tom Kiley who now represents William Bulger, Whitey's brother.Is there a common link, perhaps a child from the water pollution that binds the 2 cases?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Black Mass is the best I've read, by telling the true and factual story of Whitey Bulger. The authors have their tumb on the pulse of this story and know what the true facts are. Some authors have written many books on this subject but most are geared to making the author the subject and not the personality of Whitey.I wouldn't go elsewhere to purchase my books. Amazon has the best to pick from as well as great prices."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Other reviewers really captured my sentiments. This is a heavily researched book with great local color and stories without the over-written narrative that often plagues such books. The authors do a splendid job of building a story of Boston and its characters from nothing and then drawing out broader implications. What a shame these events happened to such a great city through both criminals AND public servants."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"With the advent of the capture of Whitey Bulger by the FBI in June of 2011, Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill's book, \\"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, The Boston FBI, and a Devil's Deal' will be read by many. This is a first hand account of how Whitey Bulger, and Steve Flemmi became part of the FBI as informants, and in turn the FBI became informants for Whitey and Steve.The story goes back to the early 70's in South Boston when Whitey was growing up and became head of the Winter Hill gang. He was always a kid in trouble, it seems and never graduated from high school. He wanted to become the 'Lord of the Rings' in his town and slowly he built a reputation via gambling, drugs, corruption, mayhem and murder. No one wanted to cross Whitey. At the same time his brother, Billy, beccame a lawyer and then a politician and the father of nine children. Billy the good child and Whitey the black cat of the family.This book pulls us into the life of a criminal in South Boston, the Irish neighborhoods, and the Irish Mafia, the Winter Hill gang. 'Southie' is explored, its lure and its people. We meet the people who inhabit Southie and those that were part of Whitey's gang. Slowly we are introduced to the FBI, the men who developed Whitey as an informant, and who were pulled so far into the lure of Whitey's world that they came to respect and admire this criminal. We get to know John Connolly, the biggest fraud of them all. He protected Whitey at all costs, and all costs meant loss of freedom. The kind of mind and commitment needed to remain in denial about the kind of work he was doing and what he did to the FBI, itself, is incomprehensible.We also meet the victims, none of these crimes were victimless. It is said that Whitey killed 19 people, all of them had friends and family. Many of the bodies were not found until someone gave up the secrets. We come to know some of the families and what they experienced. The lives of people in Southie were difficult and some turned to crime. The choices usually were to become a cop or a criminal.We meet the lawyers who defend the Mafiosi and the criminals and come to know them. Mostly brilliant people, who want to do the right thing. The right thing sometimes meant laying out scenarioes that would hurt others. The lawyers, the FBI, the State Police, the DEA, the criminals and the everyday \\"Joes and Janes', these are the people who explore Southie.The writing is precise and filled with accurate timelines. The writing also kept me quite absorbed. I understood the personalities of these players. One side was often pitted against the other. Substantial informnation was relayed and in such a manner that it was difficult to put this book down. This book is as relevant today as it was in the 1990's. I can only hope that Lehr and O'Neill will write a new book that follows the path of Whitey from 19995 when he went on the 'lam', until the day he was captured.Highly Recommended. prsrob 07-03-11Rogues and Redeemers: When Politics Was King in Irish BostonTrue Crime Authors Black Mass with Dick Lehr and Gerard O'neill.

I'd read other true crime books, and I knew of many criminals who \\"turned state's evidence\\" to avoid jail time. But this was the first time I ever heard of the top crime boss being an informer himself. It was also the first time I read about an FBI agent who let information flow the other way!James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger would have been just another Irish American hoodlum from South Boston. But some time in the late 1960's, he came across a man he'd known from childhood, now an FBI agent. he agent's name was John Connolly, and he was enamored with the \\"gangster\\" legends of Boston and Chicago. He allowed Bulger to sign on as an informant, which would provide anti-Mafia evidence for Connolly and protection for Bulger. Informer status does not mean the informant can commit murder, but Connolly let that side. Over the years, Connolly began to supply Bulger with confidential information, allowing him to intimidate local businesses, kill off witneses, and eventually flee the coutnry to avoid prosecution. Bulger hasn't been seen since.Black Mass is well-written and unbiased, without any style or taking sides. That may produce a long read, but the author doesn't induce the reader to make judgements. The end result is you feel that Boston's history is one of ruin and despair."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"If you live in Boston, as I did for a few years, the name Whitey Bulger is as resonate as Jimmy Hoffa. Both were men feared by some and idolized by others. Both had no qualms about victimizing those who feared and idolized them. Both were seen by some as the guy like them who managed to stand up to the Establishment. And both disappeared. But nobody thinks Whitey is buried at Gillette Stadium.Whitey Bulger was a mythic figure in Boston, especially his old neighborhood of Southie, the gangster who always managed to slip out of the hands of the law.But even Southie little boys and girls grew up dreaming of becoming FBI agents. Chances are their dreams didn't involve having gangster over to the house for dinner. John Connolly, another son of Southie, dared to have this dream and in pursuit of it he pretty much turned the Boston office of the FBI into Whitey Bulger and his Winter Hill gang's own little intelligence squad.Make no mistake about it, James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger and his partner Stevie \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmie were crooks, thugs, murderers, and all around low lifes. One could spend hours cataloging their many crimes. Oddly, they fail to get the credit they deserve for their pioneering work in the field of bromance. Any law enforcement agent can have an informant. Any crook can become a snitch. But it takes real imagination to turn it into quite evenings at home with your snitch/handler at the home of the handler's boss enjoying a home cooked meal the handler's boss has prepared. Candles, wine - champagne on occasion, steaks and the occasional visit from Whitey's powerful politician brother to share the latest family pictures. Just another night at Chez Agent Morris. Special dinners away from the cares of work aren't enough to keep a bromance alive, either. You need to show your bro that you care. Really care. Don't be afraid to give him a give now and then. A bottle of wine, a tasteful silver champagne bucket or a very special belt buckle says \\"I think you're the best\\" more than words ever can.This is one mind-bending story and Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill are perfectly suited to the task. Their journalistic style is spot on in terms of original research and the kind of prose that doesn't get in the way of illuminating facts. Lehr & O'Neill know when to let these looney-tunes speak for themselves as in this line from murderer Stevie Flemmie that actually made me laugh out loud:\\"I received a sweatshirt from (Agent) Nick Gianturco.\\"The next time you're wondering what to get that special multiple murderer in your life, look no farther than your local sporting goods store. I kept hoping it was some sort of demented joke about giving a fleece to a thief but no, ethically challenged FBI Agents John Morris and John Connolly and their pals thought this made sense.This is an entertaining, well-researched, well-written book. The only flaws are that it drags in the final chapters when they provide perhaps a bit too much detail about the grand jury proceedings that ultimately brought this sordid business to light and that the books begs to be updated to cover Connolly's recent convictions. Aside from that, this is as smart a book about the mob as any True Crime fan could hope for. Highly recommended for any True Crime fan, anyone interested in the Mafia and anyone from Boston.Kindle note: Photographs included."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"An associate to be referred to as 'Pat' has been a target ever since Bulger fled. In the past few months, Pat has been approached by an alleged relative of alleged Bulger murder victim Brian Halloran. This relative seemed bent on establishing a rigorous schedule for Pat and had barely concealed hostility for Pat. Pat has suspicions that Pat might be a child of one of the informants, agents, or murder victims in this case and that it may have been leaked out deliberately or not. Pat has had all sorts of problems since Bulger left and was warned by a Cellucci/Bush supporter to leave Massachusetts when Bulger fled &quot; or lose everything&quot;.Governor Cellucci hosted his transition team meeting at the office of Sullivan and Cogliano, a recruitment firm with past ties to deceased Rocco Solimeno's business partner.Many bad things happened to Pat after Bulger fled. Pat became the target of personal attacks, rampant unemployment, financial destruction and eventual homelessness, all following the threat of the Cellucci/Bush supporter's predictions. Is Pat paying the price for something Pat doesn't even know about their past?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I know an individual who may be a critical pawn in this case. Around the time of the transition between the Bush and Clinton administrations, this individual was employed by a company with government contracts and informed in an intimidating manner &quot; we will be monitoring you..&quot; by alleged government personel. A couple years later, a local paper did a story on that person's quest to find out who their father is. Not long after the article, the editor disappeared, Whitey Bulger fled, Jonathan Harr's book about kids afflicted by water pollution came out and &quot; all hell broke loose&quot; for this individual. The person received numerous IRS audits and problems with their accounts at Fleet Bank( where at the time the IRS issued refund checks). In the Merrimack Valley,Mass. region, a major IRS facility, regional FBI office and other government agencies are located. This was also the area Jan Schlictmann of Harr's book frequented at a prominent lawyer's law offices. It has taken nearly 7 years, the statute of limitations for many crimes, for the FBI to assign a specialist fugitive hunter to the case.. Over the nearly 7 years, the individual had a wide series of &quot;job interviews&quot; that were anomalous in that the interviews appeared to be fact finding missions by interviewers who knew far more about this person's work history and personal activities than is demonstrated by interviewers,suggesting perhaps investigators (govt or private) who have been briefed about the individual ahead of time and are looking for anything incriminating, now matter how far-reaching, to build a case against the person. These 'interviewers' often &quot; moved on..&quot; not long after the interviews. Question: does Whitey or some other party in this case have a child that has been a pawn since day one to control him/them? This is a major question for the Burton committee. Has a case been increasingly built around such a child to penalize Bulger before and after the flight and if so what tactics and results might one expect to be used against the child? Might not such forces use everything from portraying the child as mentally ill to an unambitious bum? There is a serious concern also as to how this case can be properly investigated. If Burton's committee wanted an honest appraisal, then perhaps an agency with no links to either the Justice Dept and its subsidiaries or the FBI might be called on. This case is an entangled web of professional and personal breaches across several agency/law enforcement boundaries. And if a child/children have been used as collateral in the case, the question arises who and what entities may be involved. Could state authorities but not the FBI or Justice Dept or all of them have known about such children? Would the children by hated by all and treated accordingly?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"On page 53 of Susan Kelly's &quot;The Boston Stranglers&quot; (1995), Dr. Ames Robey,forensic psychiatrsit is quoted as saying that George Nassar, an extremely violent man and whom many suspected as the real Boston Strangler, was a suspect in 17-30 murders involving the gangland violence known as the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars, as depicted in Willie Fopiano's &quot;The Godson&quot;. This number of murders coincides with the number of murders of which Flemmi and Bulger are alleged to have been involved but this has not been rigorously followed up while Flemmi stands charged with 17 murders and Whitey the balance. Why hasn't this been followed up?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Wow!What a great book. Granted, I may be a little biased due to the fact that I live in the Boston area and have family am constantly in Somerville, MA (Whiteys base with Marshall Motors)The story of how Whitey and John Connolly worked together and the how the &quot;Southie Code&quot; of silence was broken was explained in great detail was wonderfully put together. Its amazing how Whitey worked his webs of influence throughout the Boston area in the 1970's and 80's and had the whole underworld at his feet...and his disposal. I fully recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an excellent story of the Irish mafia...I recommend this book especially to those who are from or currently live in the Metro/Greater Boston area. We hear and see so much about the Italian mafia, its nice to have a book with a different twist to change show that organized crime is everywhere.Well written, very enjoyable book. I couldnt put it down. I can just picture Whitey walking amongst the neighborhoods that I see every day. Worth picking up."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I know a person who grew up in state child care who may have a father involved in this case without their knowledge, perhaps even Bulger or Flemmi during their alleged pornography days.In a predominantly Catholic area. Did Flemmi or Bulger have children as a result of these activities? How strong were their ties to the pornography business? Were Bulger and Flemmi tied in any way to the Boston Strangler killings which remains controversial?Around the time Bulger disappeared, everything hit the fan for this person. Loved ones around them were threatened and as they went to the FBI and Justice Department and State Police they were ignored. Before Bulger disappeared this person was approached by alleged Defense Investigative Service and FBI personnel at a business seminar. This was also prior to the release of Jonathan Harr's book, &quot;A Civil Action&quot; and when it was released Bulger disappeared as this person became a target of harassment in sync with escalating media accounts of the case.The person was connected as a state child to a reputed gangster in the area with alleged ties to John Connolly as a foster child without their knowledge. The person was very young and the particulars were arranged by combined private and public human services representatives.When this case opened up these same connections to the former child started acting bizarre, as if anxious that the whole thing was unravelling. It has been speculated that perhaps this person is a child of Whitey's without their knowledge and that state and federal authorities all had a role in the upbringing of the child and perhaps the child was bounced around and neglected and/or physically and emotionally abused in proportion to Bulger's cooperation.None of the media has raised the prospect that a confluence of state and federal representatives effectively managed the Bulger case.This book does highlight how information was frequently passed between DEA and the FBI in informal channels and why should we believe it was limited to only these 2 agencies? The state police and DEA are detailed as investigating Bulger here while Connolly had ties to the DEA and FBI.All one has to do is look in any major yellow pages and you wil find all sorts of escort services complete with corporate account capability to know that society and the government does not find these things objectionable. Bulger and Flemmi may have simply been regional coordinators for these services. What we do not know is how many services or gratutities were actually provided to government and/or political officials and whether their continued generosity or lack of it is what contributed to their prosperity or demise. Bulger and Flemmi may have been involved in providing services for many agencies and the FBI might be bearing the brunt of the heat.In this book nor anywhere else has anyone tried to interview former military associates of Bulger and Flemmi or investigated possibly military involvement in their activities, especially where McIntyre was concerned.Will Congress make inquiries of the Defense Investigative Service which overseas industrial security and background checks with the secret service (see James Bamford's 'The Puzzle Palace') or the DIA?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Did the FBI or some agenc(ies) have a child Bulger might have had raised in close proximity to families with government agency ties and then assert government security to cover sanitization of records and the identity of the child?In 1963 the Defense Investigative Service is said to have been formed and in the 1980s NSA opened its recruiting office in Boston,Mass. where McIntyre was allegedly killed being affiliated with the precursor to NSA.

Then suddenly after a period of fighting one or two individuals appears in which the collective rage is focused. They are indicted in the media which fuels the frenzy, sent off to prison and things calm down. What we may be seeing here is the very nature of our society at work and how disagreements are worked out. When DeSalvo confessed, the need for justice was quenched but prior to this police didn't know if one or more individuals were involved. To this day controversy remains over whether DeSalvo was the strangler or not. Prior to Lee Harvey Oswald being arrested, a policeman was shot- to what purpose? This only fueled the hysteria and demands for instant justice.. capture Oswald, blame it all on him,satisfy public curiosity,move on. Case closed.All that is needed is for the rival groups to agree on how the public overspill of their squabble will be decisively and effectively silenced.In the Bulger case, you have a large number of murder victims and allegations as to who did them. They may be true, they may not. No one has considered whether these guys were set up to look like they had committed murders as surety for such a contingency as has developed here since 1995.As the case has exploded an ' every man for himself' mentality prevails and is it safe to say everyone will be on the up and up?The story focuses entirely on the negatives in the program, but not on how many people were helped or how many people were not sent to prison based on information provided by Flemmi and Bulger. It is publicly assumed they did nothing but evil, but we really don't know that. There is also the question of whether Flemmi and Bulger can provide a full defense if reports and other correspondence cannot be released due to classification constraints. Were murders solved or prevented by actions of Flemmi and Bulger? Kidnappings of children? Drug trafficking reduced to a manageable level?How many agents from any number of agencies may have been protected by the close quarter efforts of Bulger and Flemmi, even if they are unaware of it themselves?Still, this case does raise broad questions of how far we wish clandestine law enforcement efforts to go. What is the line of distinction between informants and secret police? How much priority is given to informant reports, as in the Limone/Salvati case? If more weight had been given in the Limone case, could some decisive action to intercept have occurred? What is our capacity to factor in unavoidable human error in the handling of these complex cases? How liable for their actions are informants where they provide services but are not fully trained as a bona fide agent is?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"With all the hype in this case, policymakers may do very little to curtail similar such abuses in the future. Just as this case is gaining exposure now, what abuses are going on now that we will hear about 20 or 30 years from now?Shredding and altering incriminating documentary evidence from my own knowledge of human services and other areas is nothing new by the government. I have seen state records involving kids in state care altered or shredded or tossed out because of potential liability. In these records are reports and labels and subjective commentary that can help or hurt the child's future. If the government will do this to children, what will it not do to adults? Perhaps the FBI handlers in this case can be viewed as similar to a social worker managing a case, filing reports on the client while the client is unable to review the information or to rebut any discrepancies while strangers down the road make judgements on the child's future using information of which the child is unaware.I may have some tie to one of the parties in this case on either side and never have been told this. Shortly before Bulger disappeared, i worked for a company with government contracts and was intimidated by an agency that met with me while there. After Bulger disappeared, i was approached by individuals coming in as temps at another company who seemed nice at first and befriended me. Over the ensuing months and a couple of years, it soon became apparent these individuals were not my friends and were there to keep an eye on me, trying to compile information against me while issuing subtle and not subtle hints that they were watching me on a regular basis.These same individuals hinted that they had seen inside my home,reviewed some of my financial records, and had considerable detailed knowledge of my comings,goings and activities which i had not provided them with, even going to lengths to find out my video rentals. I had no criminal background and lived an ordinary life but with missing pieces in family background.These same individuals seemed very concerned about who i would vote for in state and federal elections. The complete lack of concern that they were following me around and harassing me seemed to be of little concern to them nor to the FBI or Justice Dept who ignored my requests for help after months and months of quiet intimidation about how one of these individuals in particular had been watching me come and go and specifically wanted to come to where i live for no good reason.

In the 1960s these two areas were in funding conflicts between those who wanted the space program(Somerville) and those who wanted the Boston Navy Yard (Charlestown).Question: did the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars result over money and how it would be spent in the Boston and metro Boston areas?With the Bulger case, you have Kevin Weeks showing investigators he knows where bodies are then attributing them to Bulger and Flemmi, but there is only his word that Bulger and Flemmi did it.You have Bulger and Flemmi who hail from Boston but take over Somerville turf. Then wreak havoc on both sides.Around the time of the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars, local newspapers estimated at least 24+ separate organized crime families in operation. I am no scholar,but some research of the local history and social phenomena in play suggests that 'mob wars' are triggered by major economic events in which one or more of the organized crime factions feel that have not received their fair share.If this is true, then the civil war between the space program advocates and the Navy yard advocates may have provided fodder for the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars.If the violence was at severe as has been alleged, perhaps Flemmi and Bulger, former military personnel were assigned the task of restoring order to a situation that exceeded the capacity of local and state law enforcement. How do you stop two factions hell bent on killing each other?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There are many many questions that can be asked in this case. How much of the allegations are true and how much is puffery? If you look at the distinction between personal and professional conduct outlined in the handbook on informants described in this book, it appears there is wide latitude between what is tolerated 'on the job' versus 'off the job'.There is a marked difference between Bulger's conduct off the job and on the job. Was this a man who acted as an informant for fun or out of desperation? There is much about Whitey's 'wild side', but one might note there are some positive attributes there also-- a fondness for libraries and reading, health and fitness, loyalty to family.Was he tough? Of this there is little doubt.Does the government either set people up or approach people who have been convicted and give them an alternative: work for us or spend many years in prison? How many people would do things they never thought possible to avoid this ugly choice?This case also shows the ends used. The FBI is alleged to tamper with home and car at will, play off sides against each other,feeding on healthy paranoia considering the inherent dangers organized crime brings. The book is also honest in that organized crime players are not portrayed as volunteers feeding the hungry at food kitchens either. What in a broad sense is played out here is groups at complementary ends of the spectrum slicing up pieces of the pie. Greed and hunger for power are the fuel.Is this case a fundamental issue of bad people in a good system, average people in a bad system, or a mix of good and bad people in a mediocre system? Is the convergence of these two worlds an economic necessity?One can also ask what makes an informant and why do they do it? How many are people who have become targets of criminal activity and seek help through the legal channels available? as children we are taught that if someone steals your car, you don't hunt them down-- you go the police.You go to the police and are considered a rat but if you take matters in yourown hands you are a vigilante.The guidelines described in here also allow for a wide array of crimes that are acceptable for informants. An informant, according to this book, could say break into your home, plant false evidence or rob you and there is nothing wrong with this. Informants could help with illegal wiretaps and other evidence gathering techniques and this is ok. Should informants be honest people trying to help reduce crime or potential crime?Bulger is alleged to have made a lot of money but to have lived a pretty down to earth lifestyle. This book does not suggest someone motivated by love of money."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Someone i know worked for a company with many government contracts and approached a local paper about help in finding out who their father is just before Whitey fled.

The person began having all sorts of problems at the college they attended and any Massachusetts state programs the person applied for ,such as retraining for those laid off from work, were quickly denied.In addition, these individuals alternately implied changing political affiliations between the Democratic and Republican parties. All of this seemed to stem from simply asking who their father was ,as this person had been abandoned into state care very young and was told little of their family history.This person worked for a company with government contracts and the question has been raised as to whether government agencies were offensively attacking the person. If Bulger,Flemmi,Rico,Connolly and others fell under the agencies that oversee security cleared employees, one might find that these guys were heavily controlled and prone to inordinate personal problems if they failed to comply. Their financial status may have been monitored and messed with as a behavioral modification gesture if they acted in a way contrary to organization goals. This person i mentioned had vehicles tampered with, financial and phone records monitored, individuals they associated with approached by govt officials and much more. Most of this was difficult to prove and this is how these agencies get away with it is by having several individuals mess with the target individual from different angles, as these guys may have experienced. Local politicians seemed to care less."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There are many many scary things going on right now. 60 Minutes recently had a segment discussing the FISA court, a secret court where the Justice Dept can obtain 24 hour long term surveillance warrants against targets without that target being able to see the probable cause or evidence against them and so has no defense. This permits the govt to search through your trash,enter your home when you are away,bug every room in your home and tap your phone, acquiring your deepest secrets and that of your family and friends. The Secret Service is beginning a childhood profiling program to 'identify' problem kids according to some model only they know as well as building voice and picture profiles on everyone. A National genetic database is being built so that even your family genes will not be safe. Carnivore and other as yet unannounced software programs allow the govt to screen email and internet activities and in general scan the internet environment looking for targets.Technologies are being introduced that will someday force you and i to have ourselves and/or our children implanted with electronic tracking chips ostensibly for noble puproses but which may have far more nefarious motives. And companies such as EMC and others are buildng vast storage capability that will one day allow massive amounts of information to be stored about anyone. Our privacy dwindles until one day nothing in our lives will be sacred. One of the many issues in this book is the amount of control the govt has over its employees, but also how much the govt will frame its own employees to save institutional face. Recently the CIA went after some of its own for having a secret chat room and fired and disciplined a number of them. Chances are these chatrooms were relatively harmless but they went back 15 years! The problem here is that any lawyers and judges brought in to defend the employees must be cleared by the CIA, not enough time to mount a defense on behalf of the employees. One thing of serious concern is whether there is an integral relationship between organized crime and organizations such as NSA or other such supersecret,elite organizations."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There is a man referred to in prior reviews who worked for Grace and was a state orphan who may be a target of harassment in all of this because of a link unknown to that man. When Jonathan Harr's book came out, a man of Italian/Irish descent with strong roots to Newburyport,Mass introduced the man to a supposed private investigator. Over the next few years it became apparent this investigator and his 'friend' began setting up the man by carefully orchestrated telephone calls and surreptitious taping of staged conversations. The Newbury man claimed to be his friend while threatening him,pretending to represent Jan Schlictmann and Grace,alternately.One question no one has explored is the possible link between Jonathan Harr's book and the gangland and political fallout so pronounced in the Whitey Bulger case. Was a child of one of the principals in the Bulger case sick from the pollution in Woburn and was this child treated under the condition of service to the government and/or private parties by that child's father. And was a promise made to look out for the child but when it was revealed that this was not done, the principal in the case fled, realizing they had been victim of a snow job?Also, could such a child have been the target of casebuilding against that child by individuals linked to state child care agencies as &quot;social workers&quot; who in reality were building a blackmail file against the child as that child grew up?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"1) Has the former business partner of Rocco Solimeno and associate of Cogliano, a supporter of Cellucci waged war against a possible child of Whitey Bulger or some other principals in this case?2) Has the government harassed a possible child of Whitey by controlling the means of income and therefore also use of credit in an effort to utterly destroy the child or have the Bulger forces done this to a child perhaps of one of their victims?3) Is a man who has been devastated since the onset of this case a target of pro-Angiulo/Patriarca forces?4) Could the concealment of Whitey's whereabouts be the efforts of both FBI and Justice Department forces,similar to their withholding info from the government reform committee?5) Have the official records of a child raised in state care and possibly the key to the whole Bulger case been sanitizedby state officials and subcontractors and does the appointment of Jeff Locke to head such an agency by Cellucci have anything to do with this?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Does the federal government have a vested interest in crime?

The man's family history had largely been withheld from him.Also, a man with out of state plates moved in next door claiming to work construction. As strange phone callskept coming into the man's home,one day the man saw his neighbor driving a phone company truck.That man soon moved out and the origin of the strange calls was the workplace in which he was surrounded by individuals blaming him for the Bulger case.8) As the Bulger case matured, medical records and other official records began disappearing on the man.9) Individuals who had been introduced as caretakers of the boy later completely disavowed the man when the Bulger case burst out.10) As the Bulger case hearings moved along, individuals, usually in the capacity of a new coworker began befriending the man.It soon become evident they were investigating the man and when confronted did not deny being involved with law enforcement or the justice department.Such investigations apppeared to focus on the man's home,dating habits,and financial transactions even though the man had no criminal record. Most of the individuals involved claimed roots in New Hampshire. As the congressional hearings matured, the man became the target of increasing traffic stops with each time the officer appearing to have knowledge about the person they could not have had in a random stop.11) Money vanished from the man's bank account without explanation; even with receipts showing a discrepancy had occurred and spending hours discussing it with bank branch personnel,no satisfactory explanation was ever offered. The bank at the time held Internal Revenue Service accounts and supported a major political candidate in the region.12) When the man went to vote, thug-like men appeared menacingly watching him."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Nearly 40 years ago a boy was born and hurried away by the mother because the husband, a bank robber( Whitey traveled with bank robbers), threatened to kill the baby. A couple of years later the boy ended up living in a hospital ward for more than 2 years as a cripple.During the 2+ years no one came to visit,leaving the child confined to a bed in an uncomfortable traction system. When the child was released a diagnosis of the condition not listed in the medical record at the time was given and no family history known. Six months after release to the mother the child was attempting suicide by exiting cars on the highway. While with his 'mother',the child experienced a house fire, repeated long term beatings and creative tortures by a stepfather in between attempted murder and later an attempted suicide of the mother all while the child was still effectively crippled.On being removed by the state,the child bounced around family to family unwanted and subject to continual humiliation (insults,threats,deprivations),obviously being situated with families that hated him( italian) and wished him no good. All of these placements occurred in the geographical vicinity of major players and in the Bulger case. When signs of severe abuse began emerging, the child was punished further with beatings or worse. The child seemed to never play or have toys and at one point some kindly school personnel gave the boy time to play and toys while others continued the regimen of beatings to 'get him in line'. Eventually the boy landed in a residential program near the time Whitey signed on to Top Echelon. He and his brother were separated long before this. At about this time and for the next 30 years the boy was introduced to individuals who later surfaced as having strong evidence of links to the players in this case. Nearly all were in some form paid for their connection to the boy. The boy didn't see this,but rather saw them as good people and loved them. Over the next 30 years the boy would be introduced to sexual predators,DOJ personnel,military personnel (army and air force-- Whitey was air force/Flemmi army) and be threatened with youth lockups(by a caretaker of the same name as one of the agents in this book), placed into a hard labor program breaking granite boulders with sledgehammers while being threatened by local police harassment by program administrators and suffer the loss of dozens of peers he was thrilled to call 'friend'. The boy was always told he was no good, a bad person, and would end up in trouble. When the boy eventually ran away, he did well in school,survived through high school by working 2-3 jobs and volunteered.In 1995 Bulger fled and the man's life changed. He couldn't find work, lived off credit cards,eventually lost his home and was forced to live in his car while working to eat. He became insolvent and defaulted on his debts after years of trying to establish good credit. A major creditor even raised his interest rate on a credit card after he notified them of his hardship. From this same creditor the man received almost daily calls with no message other than silence without explanation. Later, the former director of the FBI was hired by them. Individuals appeared in the boy's life claiming some affiliation with the FBI,DOJ, or Bureau of Prisons. In most of these introductions and the subsequent 'friendships' that developed through the brother as an intermediary, the end result was these introductions later led to harmful acts by those parties. This took the form of gaining the man's confidence,waiting for info that could be harmful to that man, then using it to deliver the sting. That sting took the form of job losses,police stops under suspicious circumstances,phone trouble, or sudden,spontaneous breakdown of friendships where these parties were introduced. All the while the brother claimed to have worked for one of foremost gangsters rivalling Bulger/Flemmi during a time when the 2 brothers were not in contact and perhaps even when the crucial info was being gathered that led to the downfall of that gangster. When the man tried to contact a principal government reform committee member, that number was promptly disconnected."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One might wonder if in all this chaos, what would happen if Whitey had children? How might Connolly, Rico, Morris and the Justice Department handle this? Could the children becoma targets for blackballing or manipulation by the FBI, DEA,CIA,NSA,DIS,or many more agencies?It is alleged there is at least person who might have connections to some of the people involved in this case and worked for a defense contractor in the 1980s and 1990s. About the time of the change between the Bush and Clinton administration, the individual was informed they were ' being watched'. A few years later, Whitey disappeared and this person suddenly became unemployable while individuals allegedly indirectly linked to Connolly and therefore Governor Cellucci through George Cashman threatened this person had 'flipping burgers' in their future. The individual attended a college and was promptly given one letter grade lower than earned after being asked if the individual would vote for Al Gore. The person went on to have an interview with a major defense contractor where individuals with NSA logo materials inquired if the person understood what a &quot;controlled experiment is&quot;. Additionally, the individual reported strange phone activity not long after an older man with TN plates appeared claiming to be in the construction field but was later discovered in a phone company truck. On being seen in the phone company truck, the man disappeared.At the last place the individual worked, colleagues claimed this person was paranoid or claimed the person worked with them for years but they did not know this individual's job title. Individuals with strong ties to recruiters and human resources in the Mass. high tech industry sector and with alleged ties to the Mass. republican party suddenly had no work of any kind in what was considered an ' employee's market'.What we know from this book and newspaper accounts is that circumstances can and are manipulated to make an individual 'paranoid', such as the ploys used against Whitey and Eddie Moiano. By controlling the environment with multiple individuals, a portrait is manufactured of the person as unstable should any legal action be taken."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Whitey was allegedly warned by his brother not to enroll in a CIA study. In a recent TV documentary inside the CIA lobby is allegedly a plaque that quotes &quot; ..And the truth shall set you free&quot; from the bible. Did Whitey find truth or consequences? Billy Bulger was strong advocate for defending children from child abuse and this should be considered. Whitey had support from Speaker of the House John W. McCormack and in his brother's book, William mentions that he felt his brother had enormous potential. Billy Bulger also made enemies during the forced busing crisis of the early 1970s,where desegregation was to provide racial integration and failed because parent's rights to supervise their children's safe education was usurped. The authors have a history with the Bulger family and this should be noted when reading this book.Whitey also worked as a custodian for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, highest court in the state. When considering this case one needs to see both sides. The FBI can influence NY Times bestseller lists, or destroy an individual's reputation or save a country from terrorists. You need to look further,where the public cannot see, to see the real danger as special interests claiming this massive authority as its own. 60 Minutes had a story on how even the NSA is subject to the whims of politicians and has arranged to use its incredible surveillance capabilities on US citizens and politicians. And the CIA has a long long history of establishing policy irrespective of its political overseers.On the one hand we have agencies with extraordinary capacity but a citizen populace with a herd mentality that many in authority view as ill informed about current events and therefore not capable of making good decisions.What seems to be a big issue in this case is the destabilization of a region (Massachusetts in the Irish violence of the 60s and 70s) and government efforts to stabilize it and stop the bloodshed. Under such circumstances and with limited knowledge, we can but second guess the tactics used. The victims in this case lost family members and there is the reality of broken families and its subsequent tragedy.But the Mafia is not known for its benevolence either. Take Rocky Graziano (allegedly set up by mob), or even Rocky Marciano ( financially drained throughout his career by his 'manager')and countless others who have helped and crossed the mob.The mob is about making money (lots of it) and power. Sometimes the mob does good and sometimes the FBI might do wrong, and this reflects human nature.Until a major spiritual trasnformation occurs in mankind, there will always be that battle going on between those skirting or flaunting the system and those whose job is to uphold the system."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is a study in how informants are made and maintained...

He suddenly lost a good civilian job,began getting routine IRS audits, had phone and email problems, and was approached by a number of women who befriended the man, rejected overtures for dates, then reported back the man was gay--falsely. Friends speculated NSA,the CIA or FBI was involved because all of these have a role in this Bulger case. Then the man became unemployable and had evidence of continuous bank record monitoring.

The crux of this case seems to center around events of the mid 1960s in Massachusetts and New England at the height of Kennedy power and where a minimum of 24+ organized crime factions are said to have existed.It seems plausible Massachusetts was the center of an economic civil war between the space and military camps for federal funds.The whole Mass/New England area was flooded with space programs and military bases and JFK was pro-space while Tip O'Neill and the Boston region favored the military bases or related sectors. As the space program gained favor, the military was seeing base and other cuts from Robert McNamara. what we see going on now seems to be a reverse of the struggle going on in the 1960s, a shift from military-based projects to high tech nonmilitary projects.Hypothesis: were the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars precipitated by the regional battle for funding between factions on the space side and those on the military side? A breakdown of the respective committees supporting each may shed some light on this question.Boston Edison approved land in Woburn for further development around the time NASA was to locate a site there and a Radiology lab was also established in the region. JFK was a proponent of the NASA site in Woburn and John Connolly later procured a job with Edison. Barry Mawn was brought into the Boston FBI office after Whitey fled, Mawn being a Woburn native. Whitey disappeared prior to the release of &quot;A Civil Action&quot; by Jonathan Harr,about Woburn and the aftermath of early leukemia epidemic signs emerging in the 1960s. Whitey is said to have had a girlfriend in Woburn. NASA did not come and this left an economic void in the region. Could all of this tie together? Was Barry Mawn to Woburn what Teddy Roosevelt may have been to Cuba in the Cuban missile crisis?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There are many troubling issues in this case.Bulger fled after it was leaked to the Boston Globe that Bulger is an informant- who leaked it? Has the Justice Dept/FBI made arrangements for replacements in its Top Echelon program to perpetuate the lucrative arrangement with Bulger,Flemmi and Mercurio? Were Flemmi,Bulger and Mercurio targeted as kids to become informants through long term monitoring and manipulation? Was Bulger made by the government? In his brother's book, William Bulger describes Whitey as quite intelligent but coming from a tough neighborhood and who frequently received harsh beatings by the Boston Police.It is said that when agencies such as the CIA recruit, they will cultivate a recruit and orchestrate events such that the recruit will have no choice but to relent and work for it. Some tactics employed are said to be: spreading rumors that cast doubt on the character of the target such that employment opportunities are few,if any..also, harassment of the friends and family members of the target or buying off family and friends to no longer have contact with the target thus controlling the relationships that person has. How did Flemmi 'recruit' Bulger? What does the handling of informants by the federal government say to all current and future informants? What is the government saying to its own agents in the manner it is treating the Boston FBI agents? Billy Breen in his book describes how after a time an informant can identify with the people under investigation, and even become one of them.But Breen also describes how the power of the govt will use informants in dangerous operations but then use things like IRS audits and the like to harass or control them.This case is so difficult to sort and to tell who is being truthful or not.

This ugly case should be thoroughly investigated from outside the FBI. The guilty agents who conspired and protected Bulger and Flemmi, the agents and supervisors who should have prevented the acts and the agents and supervisors who should have known about the acts should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.But it gets worse, now the U.S. Justice Department has made deals with the remaining Bulger gang members including Kevin Weeks. All the federal prosecutorial eggs are in one basket to build a case against &quot;Whitey Bulger.&quot; What if he is already dead. The Feds have made more &quot;deals with the devil&quot; for nothing.When the FBI commits all these serious crimes, why does the FBI investigate itself.

In his book,William Breen describes how the IRS was all over him if he tried to build a stash from his informing activities. Could these guys have evaded the IRS for 3 decades? Were Bulger and Flemmi informants for more than one agency simultaneously?Massachusetts has been a center because of the concentration of schools and high technology and all that goes with them. In such a high profile state, could these guys have operated without highly placed help?If they could operate without highly placed help in government, then this case is even scarier than one might think. The question then becomes how could they have achieved this? Whom did they control?And there is a question never considered: what if Bulger and Flemmi did not do much of that attributed to them but are being scapegoated to keep the radius of those involved small? This book and the media takes the view that these guys forsook legitimate careers and decided the life they chose. What hold could someone have over Bulger and Flemmi to make them do the things attributed to them? What could motivate them to do these things? What happened to all the money?

It may be that because they were so successful, replacements for them have been tracked as youngsters and maneuvered into circumstances to replace them. Whitey might not have been able to succeed in normal industry if the govt was all over him. Perhaps the govt made it such for him that he could not get meaningful work and had to resort to crime to survive. Perhaps Whitey even has a child somewhere who has been used against him so if Whitey did not comply with his handlers his child might be neglected,abused or worse. This coercion might have involved agencies other than the FBI or in conjunction with them."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"If you follow this case, there is a pattern..

John Connolly's sister-in-law's club was recently raided for gambling. Whitey's assets have progressively been taken. Maximum pressure seems to be applied here.The tactics seem so heavy-handed that one might wonder how much control this small core group really had for nearly 3 decades. The allegations made are indeed very serious, but as is all too common, one is presumed guilty before proven innocent.All the allegations may or may not be true but this remains to be proven in court.The media has permitted many allegations except the possibility that many of them may not be true. As the murder victims have found out, the govt is not always forthcoming with information where it might be exposed in a sensitive light.

But ask yourself this:Say Whitey or Flemmi or any other informants has children, does the government lay claim to those children to replace their parents in these roles? Will the government destroy such people if they do not want this kind of life? Take an example of one man who is said to have a father unknown to him but is alleged to have been a friend of Whitey unknown to the boy...Before Bulger fled the man worked for a company with defense contracts and was told he was being cleared for a basic security clearance. The process took over a year and a half and required the man to sign an affidavit with the alleged defense official claiming never to file for bankruptcy again after being advised it was the only way to get the clearance and keep the job at the time after a lengthy unemployment. About a year after this process, the man was featured in a local Massachusetts newspaper looking for answers to his long last father. The paper changed ownership shortly after and the editor and reporter were unknown to the new editor and reporters. Shortly after Whitey fled the man was suddenly fired but not before being told by an alleged government official that he was to be monitored for an indeterminate amount of time and with no definitive scope to the monitoring or reason why. After being fired, the man had an IRS levy with no notice, annual IRS audits,missing money from his bank account in which the IRS had an account with the same national bank and threatening calls. Progressively the man was financially strangled and it became apparent the goal was to ruin him financially and monitor his communications and parties to which he was communicating.The end result was to bankrupt the man, make him unemployable, and to ultimately make him homeless and without a means to maintain a phone. The man was sequestered with a group of 10 people(which number matches a group of 10 alleged witnesses sequestered and announced as witnesses against Bulger in 1999 but which has never come to pass)who tormented the man for being responsible for the Bulger fiasco whil staging photos,etc. to make it look like the man was happily working with such a group.New &quot;friends&quot; entered the man's life and as the man grew to like and trust them,they announced a friend or family member in the FBI just before the man was screwed in one form or another.This was a man with no criminal past.Why has the government reform committee and now the Massachusetts state police given up on investigating this whole thing and why would the U.S. government target and destroy a person for a past unknown to them?

This individual knows of a boy who was bounced around and with roots in the region of Salemme and Salvati. This boy bounced around different foster homes,was abused and even beaten as a youth by school authorities and may be the son of Flemmi,Bulger or someone else in this case. The boy's mother died young under somewhat questionable circumstances and when her obituary was published her age was listed as nearly 2 decades younger than she actually was, a fact overlooked by anyone who inquires about it.Notlong before Bulger vanished the boy, now a man, had a story done about his search for his father. Bulger disappeared, the man lost his job,school authorities who had been harsh now attempted to do good by him, and social workers where contact was still maintained began acting anxious,standoff-ish and perhaps even defensive.Some people he once knew began reappearing in his life with names different than ones he met them under.When this case became prevalent in the media, increased media attention in the case resulted in proportional harassment of this man in the form of threats,phone calls,and much more.The boy had been mistreated because of his family background, but the boy did not know his background because he was already in foster care before age 1.It appears that the boy was shuffled around and mistreated perhaps because of information provided about him to his caretakers that may have been misleading.If the boy is the son of someone in this case, it may have been leaked out and the boy became a target. Could the man be Whitey Bulger's son and have suffered much abuse because of the reputation of Bulger? If he is the son of Bulger, was the boy raised in close proximity to the families of government employees? Could a child have been forced to suffer if his father did not cooperate with either the government or organized crime?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is a surface tale of alleged mafia rivalries and the confluence of organized crime and government.One of the dangers in this case is to paint either the FBI or Mafia as victims. Neither group has a reputation as such..each is viewed more as predator than prey. This case also makes it easy to single out the FBI but what about the IRS, ATF,Treasury Dept, Corrections Dept and so on? In all these agencies you have good people and not so good people. If even half the allegations against the major players in this case are true, not only is lack of internal discipline and external oversight evident, but also the the extent,pervasiveness and real danger of organized crime.Organized crime in general is far greater than just the Mafia and cuts across all ethnic groups. Organized crime figures are often seen as flashy, intriguing, and the underdog, but how often do you hear of an organized crime member serving the community, say as a legitimate volunteer for a charity? The majority of images conjured by organized crime are of terror,intimidation, violence, and intrusion into all key areas of government. Sometimes organized crime does good but its basic purpose is not to help people but to further its own power and money base. This case is about a major event(s) that precipitated violence and other ends between rival but peer groups.The FBI's mandate appears to be to help and protect but many of its decisions may be simple business decisions. As long as the FBI withholds information on the rationale behind its actions the ends and means in this case will be suspect.Many other government agencies have been quick to target the FBI but how often has the public heard of abuses in other agencies? The problem is not one agency but the capacity for infiltration or exploitation of government power for a special interest group, in this case organized crime in general. In many ways it is the people that are responsible for the flourishing of organized crime for without a market, these groups would not survive. And not everyone linked with organized crime groups became so voluntarily, some were born into it,others married into it, others flock to it because they lack real family structures in their own lives and this may be a group who does accept them. And some aspects of organized crime involve things which are more of moral nature than legal ones, such as gambling."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In considering this book, all the customer reviews should be viewed as different ways of looking at this case-speculative but raising valid questions. Recent evidence released in the case suggest informants being used against one another and FBI knowledge of alleged hits in advance. On the surface it looks as if the FBI are the bad guys but another way of looking at it is that they may not have intervened to stop aggressive action between members of the same organized crime group, an internal matter. It may be that there is a line and two worlds: one is the law and law obeying and the other is organized crime with the harsh pentalties that go along with infractions.Once one steps over that line, one might be held accountable to the side they are on. Organized crime is not known for benevolence and often times organized crime being 'nice' might simply mean they are not harming but not helping either.Just as agents in the FBI or law enforcement risk their lives,so too do individuals getting into organized crime.Law enforcement and organized crime might be viewed as the 2 sides of the same coin.Organized crime is about loyalty, greed, discipline,betrayal,daring,trust,violence.In organized crime the member holds loyalty to the organization above family members or their own children. In the FBI and any of these field-based law enforcement groups, individual agents can be taken away from their families for extended periods, have to work odd hours and such and this can tear a family apart. There have been a lot of allegations in this case,but we don't know why such harsh measures may have been required by the FBI. Was the FBI running wild or was organized crime? If it was the FBI, what does this say about internal controls to stop it? If organized crime, what does this say about it?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One thing thse general public does not seem to be aware of and i have learned from past contact with numerous agencies is that many government employees are hedging on lucrative careers in the private sector after leaving the agency they work with. This is as true of the FBI as it is with EPA,OSHA, FDA and on and on. So when someone goes to a government agency with a complaint the losses that individual has suffered are counterbalanced by concerns of rocking the boat with a future employer.Many many government employees leave their positions for work within major companies and there is an informal exchange and network between existing and previous government employees. Like with the Jai Alai executive in this case, H Paul Rico left the FBI and went to work for Newport Jai Alai. Connolly left and took an executive position with Boston Edison. This sort of thing is commonplace and makes one reconsider what one's upward mobility in the corporate world really is. Another way of looking at this case is : does the government itself view whistleblowers and citizens who come forward with complaints as enemies of the state? Is the govt essentially a reactive entity and those who come forward prompting it to action considered acting contrary to the interests of freedom and democracy by urging the govt to exert tighter control?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"We have heard a lot about Bulger,Flemmi, Connolly.. but what about H.Paul Rico, Dennis Condon his partner, Agent Morris and Sonny Mercurio? What of the various agents we have heard little about? There are alleged to be roughly a dozen or more agents potentially involved. And why has the CIA not had something to say about this case? H.Paul Rico recruited Flemmi,Flemmi recruited Bulger. Who authorized Rico to recruit Flemmi and what was to be the scope of Flemmi's mission? We don't really know who is telling the truth in this case... Either Connolly is not or the government is making enormous efforts to make him look like he is not telling the truth. One of the things that is disturbing here is that Morris was given immunity in return for testifying that he accepted gifts and bribes from Flemmi and Bulger. But instead of holding Morris accountable, all is blamed on Flemmi and Bulger. Why doesn't the government offer immunity to Bulger,Flemmi and Connolly to get the full truth? How could Connolly help run an operation such as this for nearly 3 decades without FBI or Justice Dept interference or support? Is it possible that the government and organized crime compete in the same things?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"The Mclean-Mclaughlin Wars began in the 1960s, but how was the conflict resolved and more importantly how did it began? Was it the result of economic concerns between the forces who were set on the boomin space industry in Massachusetts and the forces loyal to the Boston Navy Yard? In the early 1960s around the time of the sinking of the USS Thresher off Portsmouth,NH, the Defense Investigative Service is said to have been formed. Was the sinking of the Thresher related indirectly to competing interests between the Boston and Portmouth Navy Yards at the same time the Boston Navy Yard was competing with NASA in Massachusetts? A group of workmen transferred from the Boston Navy Yard to the Portsmouth Navy yard not long before it sunk ,according to local newspapers. These events seemed to happen in roughly the same time period, the early 1960s. The Thresher sank in August,1963 and causes from faulty welding to backwards installation of back pressure relief valves were cited in hearings involving military personnel.And what of the children who survived from the gang wars that tore families apart? Were children of various warring factions abandoned and left into state child care, or were some of these kids grouped together and raised together to foster a new generation of compatible and close knit adults to reconcile the animosities that precipitated the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars to begin with?And were many of the players in this case approved for varying levels of clearances and agency affiliations? And how do we know that Flemmi,Bulger, Connolly weren't routinely monitored by the govt, such as their financial records,credit cards, bank accounts, or even phone calls and phone records?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I found this book to be riveting and compelling! The charm and allure of a gangster and an agent who both seemed to be enamored by the other's power. Whitey and John are cut from the same cloth; both are big men with little souls. They are more concerned about their image than what effect their actions have on their families and friends. Whitey is at least true to his calling- he becomes a big crook in a small city. John is not true to anyone- he becomes a braggart and a liar. Neither is even a friend to the other in the true sense. A modern day tragedy! In reading this book I wondered however, about the hundreds of other agents who were a daily part of John's life. Didn't any of them know or protest about this agent's dealing with a known mobster? The authors allude to agents who had run-ins and difficulties with the &quot;two Johns&quot; but didn't bother to investigate or include the many who must have questioned these two agents and their motives. As a reader who has two family members who are agents in the F.B.I., I found this book to be lacking in objectivity and too focused on the &quot; bad cop&quot;. A great book that leaves us either thinking that all agents are crooks or that the &quot; good cop&quot; doesn't make a good story."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In this case and perhaps ongoing is a lot of people manipulating each other with the government presenting itself as master manipulator.I have an acquaintance i'll dub \\"Harry\\". \\"Harry\\" began having unusual problems when the fallout from Bulger's sudden disapearance began.For example: as the court action began and Boston media coverage hyped up,an individual i'll dub \\"Luke\\" appeared in Harry's life as a temporary coworker.

Suddenly Harry had a series of missing videos and the store was claiming he owed hundreds in late fees even though the store had never indicated there was a problem nor would management discuss it with him. The point here is that Harry progressively began getting setup.Harry confronted Luke and Luke did not deny being with the FBI.

And, using his informant status as a shield, he grows his criminal empire and commits just about every crime on the books, including murder. As incredible as it sounds, it's all true and it's all here, and it's better than fiction. This is a powerfully written narrative by two prize-winning investigative reporters who covered the story and revealed some of its most dramatic elements. By combining their powerful reporting skills with rich writing flair, Lehr and O'Neill bring readers into the heart of darkness. They show how a relationship that began among children in the housing projects of South Boston evolved into a corrupt deal among dangerous adults that ultimately humiliated the nation's top law-enforcement agency and extended the reign of some of the very mobsters the FBI was supposed to eradicate. The book moves seamlessly from the streets and storerooms of Boston, to the corridors of political power, to the ornate federal courthouse where the deal comes crashing down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"\\"Black Mass\\" is the chilling account of how two killers from South Boston were able to manipulate the FBI for a period of decades. James\\"Whitey\\" Bulger and Stephen \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi were legendary wiseguys in Boston during the 1970s. John Connolly a childhood acquaintance of Bulger's who made good and joined the Boston FBI. When Connolly hooked up with the tough guy from his old neighborhood things began to go awry.Connolly was awed by his friendship with Bulger and used his contact in the underworld as proof of his prowess as an agent. For their part Bulger and Flemmi were able to pass along innocuous mob gossip to the Feds in exchange for protection form local law enforcement. Carefully placed tidbits of information helped the FBI to arrest enemies of the Bulger gang. With each arrest Whitey and Flemmi were able to expand their own power base. Those people who complained to the police were inevitably redirected to the FBI. Once the bureau had its hands on a case, the stonewalling began. This was a cycle that continued from the late 60s up until the mid 90s. During this period the \`invaluable informants' provided little of substance to their \`handlers'. However the agents were able to cook the reports and win commendations and promotions for themselves. At the same time, over a dozen murders are directly attributed to the pair.If there is honor among thieves you can't prove it from this book. \\"Black Mass\\" is a shocking story of deceit and corruption within Boston law enforcement, politics and organized crime. It is almost impossible to describe the level of hubris on the part of the crooks who were protected by the FBI and those very agents who cosseted the killers in order to advance their own careers. If they are lucky, the crooks end up behind bars, but many meet their fate in the trunk of a car.No small part of this seems to flow from good old-fashioned insularity, the \\"Us vs. Them\\" mentality so prevalent in South Boston. The area was still reeling throughout the 1970s from the forced bussing earlier in the decade. To many Bulger, was a mythic Robin Hood figure. He might be a crook but he was Southie's crook and a damned good one at that. With a cunning that allowed him to outwit the police at every turn, it was a blow for hometown pride that the Italian Mafia was failing while the Irish mob was waxing in power. This was the myth that the Bulger gang worked to promote while at the same time Whitey was murdering and extorting from the citizens of his old neighborhood. His cunning ability to outwit the police boiled down to being an informant for the FBI and his concern for the streets he grew up on is evident by how he promoted the use of drugs to the people in Southie.This account is a sad story of how the best intentions (Like the FBI informant program) can have the worst results."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"The plot of \\"Black Mass\\" revolves around a fateful decision by the Boston FBI concerning the so-called Irish Mafia of South Boston and its infamous boss-the notorious James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. The FBI was so eager to break up the local Italian Mafia that, for years it used Whitey as a confidential informant. Was there a payback? There certainly was: Whitey was allowed to run his bookmaking, loan sharking, shake downs and other criminal activities without serious interference from law enforcement. Were there \\"complications\\"? There certainly were: Apart from obvious slippery morality behind the FBI operation, certain local agents get \\"slightly too cozy\\" with Whitey and his right hand man, Stevie \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi. There is a great nickname! I won't divulge what happens but suffice it to say that a sharp eyed-or was it sharp eared? -Defense attorney unravels the deal. Is justice ultimately done? The reader will just have to find out by him or herself! Fair warning: the epilogue fails to tie up all loose ends. BM reads as if it were two stories. The early going is uneven, choppy and routine. Then BM finds its' stride and develops into fine true crime reading. Perhaps that was due to dual authorship or dual editing. The end result is ultimately satisfying. BM is an excellent example of the dangers of good intentions (stopping the Italian Mafia) unraveling into a its' own sinister crisis and creating its' own maelstrom of crime. BM is a 5 star work, but with one star subtracted for the weaker early stages. Boston residents can quite easily add back the 5th star.

The great lengths that Connolly went to cover Whitey's track will make your stomach turn. The writers capture that sense, back it up with hard evidence, and invite the reader into that dark place where the line between good and evil merge.O'Neill and Lehr have beaten everyone to the punch on a story that has never been told and will shock the senses.

The tale of, as the subtitle suggests \\"an unholy alliance\\" between mobsters and FBI agents. A story replete with larger than life killers such as Whitey Bulger, heinous crimes, cover ups, betrayals, and victims both innocent and deserving. The writing duo of Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill benefit from having unknowingly started work on the book years years in advance as reporters. They ultimately had access to volumes of interviews, background material to go along with their many first hand encounters the leading players of the story. Their intimate knowledge of the people, places and events made them naturals to tell the wider story and they came through with flying colors. The writing combines the best features of investigative reporting and dramatic non fiction.At the heart of the story are FBI agents John Connolly and Dick Morris who started off using notorious gangsters Bulger (whose very different brother has served as a Massachusetts state senator and university president) and Steve \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi as informants to help bring down the Boston area Mafia. In large part they succeeded but at what a price! The agents crossed the line -- more liked leaped over it -- and befriended the pair, literally letting the two get away with murder (along with other felonies) in the process. Bulger and Flemmi would dine and exchange gifts with the agents one day and go about extorting, drug tracking, loan sharking and killing the next.\\"Black Mass\\" is at times heart breaking, infuriating and fascinating. In it we see much of the underbelly of human behavior and the degree to which people in the public trust can be co-opted. Herein is my only quibble with the authors, as I would have liked more of an analysis of what made the agents, Connolly in particular, \\"go bad.\\"The authors are nonetheless to be lauded for a commendable job. \\"Black Mass\\" is a great read."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"If you research the history of Massachusetts you will find that the early to mid 1960s was a frenzy of projects and activity during the height of Kennedy power and influence. In Middlesex County Congressman F. Bradford Morse represented a district that even included Lawrence,Mass. In Middlesex County the space and military sectors flourished with projects as Apollo in Bedford, Voyager in Wilmington,a NIKE missile base in Burlington, the Boston Navy Yard, and such music greats as Bob Dylan,Joan Baez, and Muddy Waters playing at Club 47 in Cambridge. JFK, before he was assassinated, endorsed Woburn as the future site of the Johnson Space Center.One of the most constructive things which can come out of this case is to understand precisely the politics and sociological events in the wake of JFK's assassination and economic intrigues in the region as a precipitator of the violence that is tragically the focus of this book and case. In the 1960s a minimum of 24 organized crime families prospered nationwide. Hollywood portrays such groups as unsophisticated, but when one considers the nature of the beast, each organized crime family might be viewed as a clan of varying size and influence through all strata of government which forms the 'informal government'. To those not involved such groups a lot of things must seem like random events but not so to those involved.By understanding the dynamics involved we gain a better understanding of how events are orchestrated by the subtle interplay of cooperating and sometimes competing groups."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This work is quite interesting but one thing i am concerned about is that there has not been hard proof that Whitey Bulger and Steve Flemmi actually performed any murders or organized them. Much of the case against Bulger and Flemmi seem to stem from testimony by persons trying to get out of serious culpability for what transpired.Kevin Weeks for example, who was groomed by Bulger and now is looking at serious prison time is cooperating with federal authorities in laying all the blame at Bulger and Flemmi's feet.We don't know right now who is actually responsible for what and it may be premature to pass judgement on Connolly,Bulger and Flemmi until all the facts,if ever,are in."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In following this case i don't know what to think.The recent admission of a number of women now full-grown admitting to being targeted by Flemmi and Bulger for sex and porno films and the way it is described is quite believable. I know someone quite well who has had seen this sort of thing happen and with individuals associated with other branches of the government as well. Teen boys are often targeted by homosexual and bisexual predators and this person knew of some businessmen that targeted in particular kids in foster care or kids from dysfunctional families. These individuals got away with it because they had close ties, often family members, linked to high level government positions that could come to their aid if any local law enforcement action was taken. In the case of this person mentioned, teen boys were targeted and bribed with money or gifts or favors for sex or if that didn't work, their 'connections' were mentioned as a potential threat.One man in particular hinted at violence as well.What might be coming out in this case is that there is a whole economy based on a confluence of drugs,prostitution,pornography, blackmail and extortion of which the government itself has a strong financial interest in perpetuating. Vulnerable teenagers from broken homes or without homes may be a prime choice of recruiting for these economic sectors and people like Flemmi and Bulger are relatively small with respect to this whole underground economy which is global in nature. The women who have come forth do sound quite believable in describing what went on but the question in all of this remains: did Flemmi and Bulger voluntarily choose this or were they pushed into it,only later to adapt or accept that lifestyle? In other words, will locking up Flemmi and Bulger and 'throwing the key away' do anything to change future exploitation of unwilling girls and boys? Would we feel differently if individuals choose this lifestyle after they have become adults?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I've had an interest in Boston and the organized crime around Boston for a while.

It is also a classic example of consequences by trusting the crooks, and how easily investigation agencies fall in trap to get any information about the organized crime.John Connolly, an FBI agent, trusts the mobster James Bugler (a.k.a Whitey Bulger), who after spending time in Alcatraz became an FBI informant along with Stephen Flemmi. Both of them brilliantly used that position to eliminate competition from other mob groups and thus managed to get their own control on organized crime in Boston.In this book Connolly is often portrayed as the victim, who fall into the trap in order to rise within the FBI. However, in reality, FBI thinks that Connolly alerted Bulger and Flemmi of investigations carried out by FBI and Boston Police Dept., and gave false reports to FBI, which helped the Bulger and Flemmi cover their crimes. In 1998, the FBI also accused Connolly with charges of bribery. Connolly and Flemmi are still serving time in prison, whereas the Bulger is still maintaining his position in the FBI Top 10 Fugitive list. The sympathy with Connolly can be understood, but presenting him as a victim is not justified either.Having said that, Dick Lehr, and Gerard O'Neill have done an excellent job in providing the accurate details of the events. Their experience as journalists helps a lot in keeping the readers glued to the book. The way events unfold, and facts revealed, are interesting enough to keep your pages turning.

For years Connally and Morris served as Whitey's enablers, overlooking or silently sanctioning years of crime, corruption, and violence.While the book gives Bulger credit for shrewdness and duplicity in outwitting the FBI, it also leaves one in no doubt as to the rancid character of Whitey, no Robin Hood of South Boston here, but a traitorous drug-dealer to the youths of Southie, a vicious hood and a thoroughly violent and repellant criminal.

For those who don't know; James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger ran Bostons Irish mafia for almost 20 years. He also was a Top Echelon Informant for the FBI. As such, they let him get away with all types of crimes, including murder. Making matters worse, his younger brother Billy was the Senate president of the Mass. state Senate. Another brother, Jackie, was a juvenile court judge. This family took corruption to new heights. Eventually they fell. Whitey is now one of the top 10 fugitives. This book by two Boston Globe reporters, details the Bulger brothers, their history, Boston politics, and how they all came together. This is a good book. The only problems are because it was written in 1998-1999, some things have changed ( For example, Bulgers partner in crime, Steven Flemi, has pleaded guilty to several murders, and is doing life without parole ). Also, there wasn't enough written about the Top Echelon Informant program and all the problems with it. I'd recomend getting 2 other books along with this to get a complete picture. 1 is Dangerous Alliances by Ralph Ranelli; the other is The Brothers Bulger by Howie Carr.

This should send chills up anyone's spine and it is disturbing that no one seems bothered by this. The govt has made a reasonable argument he might be a flight risk but how can it justify holding the man in solitary confinement for so long and in prison for years awaiting trial? Isn't this sort of hedging where the govt gets the prison time up front even though a conviction has not been had? Others in this case went through the same thing and finally plea bargained and are doing time. Some of the tactics being used in this case may very well support the defendant's assertions.These points are not about exonerating Bulger,Flemmi and Connolly this is about basic justice for anyone,Say a mistake was made and you were arrested on serious charges and you were held in prison for years without a trial-- how would you feel?Also some of the individuals brought in during the hearings testified about the probability of corruption in the FBI going back 2-3 decades but these individuals were speaking about it sometimes years after leaving the FBI or Justice Dept and might suggest these people knew what was going on at the time it was going on.Does this add legitimacy to Connolly and Flemmi's arguments?Only a very few know for certain whether Flemmi,Connolly and Bulger are guilty of all alleged. A question that emerges in this is will ALL the facts come out and is the justice dept and fbi committed to the truth? The truth might be all that is alleged but as recent presidential election and supreme court concerns have developed, faith and trust in the integrity of our govt institutions is as much on trial as these guys are.As american citizens we want to trust our govt but so many times in the past the govt has let us down. The responsibility of people in the FBI,Justice Dept and any such agency is awesome and those employed are held to a higher standard. It must not be easy but the cost is so very high if they do not."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Black Mass is basically a story about allegations of abuse of law enforcement authority. This is as ancient as law itself. In Eusebius' 'History of the Church', he details how Roman soldiers would go disguised as a member of the crowd to hear early Christians preach.Once at the rally, these soldiers fomented a riot then brutally beat and imprisoned supporters. many people were killed in brutal ways simply because they wanted to embrace this new religion. Law enforcement is necessary but where do we draw the line? Even someone such as Jesus could not escape the laws of the day and we know what happened there.There are monsters out in the world but not everyone is one. Governments around the world create agencies and bodies designed to protect their own and destroy the 'enemy'but once creating these agencies how can they prevent them from running rampant against their own? Governments around the world throw people in prison to punish and then wonder why they are not 'better' when they get out. It seems that much of the crime that happens might well be preventable if we look at root socioeconomic causes that often can be traced back to policy and legislation changes. Perhaps if we worked at taking care of people using private and public resources aimed at developing self-sufficiency and job skills and provision of basic needs(food,shelter,safety) the percentage of crime might go way down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book discusses the Bulger case as if the alleged activities within are new. They are not new..in fact, it seems that the government and the mafia are direct competitors for the same markets with former govt employees joining ranks with organized crime to help protect these ventures. Former Agent Yacobucci was listed in the Boston Herald as helping finance strip joints up and down the east coast. If one could go into state records and see the demographics of kids in state care, this might also point to a system in place which promotes some of these ventures by creating a captive population to exploit by the sex and sex fantasy trades and much more. If former govt agents are permitted to delve into such businesses, knowing that many of the individuals who get into these activities are victims of dysfunctional families,broken homes and a variety of abuse, then this shows a tacit approval on the part of govt officials to perpetuate a system which preys on the innocent. The difference here in the US is how much window dressing conceals the harsh reality. There are many things going on which suggest that one must enter into govt in some form to have broad freedoms unavailable to the ordinary working man. Former President George Bush was Director of the CIA before his presidency, Yacobucci was a former FBI agent before entering the strip club business, Flemmi and Bulger had military backgrounds. Could it perhaps be that there is a tier system in America based on security clearances and once one has attained a certain level one becomes immune to normal laws and standards? By reaching a certain clearance this puts one into a pool where all sorts of things, legal and illegal, become possible? Is this system outside the scope of the law,even the US Supreme Court?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"No one should be shocked by this book. There is a certain gritty reality in this story which many of us know intuitively but feel powerless to address. Can crime and morality be controlled fully by any one body? Prohibition did not work and it seems the real answer lies in a spiritual,ethical and moral evolution that contradicts the social darwinism we see rising each day around the world. Prostitution is a global issue masked by innocuous business names,SIC codes and discreet financial arrangements that serve needs that may originate from dysfunctional relationship formation. Drugs are seen as pain avoidance mechanisms no less legitimate than caffeine or tobacco or nutritional supplements but are no cure and perhaps the real issue that needs addressing is how much people will resort to this temporary fix to escape a perceived unhappy life. Why are so many people seeking escape from their environment? Can we honestly deal with that? Extortion is a simple extension of social darwinism and survival of the fittest. Murder for hire is said to originate with the concept of retribution and the reduction of human life to whatever dollar value such markets bear.Some may see it as the concept of 'eye for an eye' carried to its most extreme conclusion. So perhaps knowing Prohibition didnt work,the govt has been left having to manage such things to an acceptable level of risk.It might be akin to a company stating it has zero tolerance for product defects but knowing that such a goal is not practically attainable over the long haul and there will always be some statistically unacceptable output."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"From a management point of view we all know that government has an extraordinarily difficult time with the process of &quot;Control&quot;.

Somehow word of the witness got to the boys, and in the wee hours one morning he was taken from his home to an abandoned lot, where they did a mock execution and told him that if he testified they'd do him for real.The witness was a lot tougher than the boys thought (and didn't know that some of the FBI were on the boys' payroll). He called the FBI as soon as he got home. The feds picked up the chump who made the threat almost immediately -- the witness knew him, and his idea of trying to be hard to find was going to his mom's place on the cape.But it was a puzzle how word of the proposed grand jury testimony had gotten out.This book may explain why.

Len was released to his mother whom he did not recognize as such and no father was known or present. At 'home', Len was sexually and physically abused, tortured, had the home essentially burn down, and witnessed his mother attempt suicide or her husband attempt to murder her several times. Sometimes Len had to go to a local fire station, still a crippled boy, to get help for his mother overdosed on drugs and booze.Len was taken into state care where he was further beaten, ridiculed,humiliated, bounced around,and repeatedly separated from newly made friends. Education was choppy but adequate and some 'caring' individuals came into his life on public or nonprofit payrolls. Many of these individuals later were found to have connections to this case and to change their attitude towards Len to a hostile tone.Eventually Len ran away from a hard labor camp breaking granite boulders simply because he had no home.At this time, it was a state sponsored program at the height of Bulger and Flemmi's power.As Bill Weld left the Justice Dept to become Governor of Massachusetts, Len was hit and run and left. He was later approached by alleged government officials attached to a Woburn company and intimidated while his home was broken into successive times and 'strange' phone calls became a regular occurrence no matter how much he change the number.Before Bulger vanished Len had asked who his father is and this seemed to bring the wrath not only of close friends who became increasingly incensed by this case, but the government too. Len was repeatedly audited by the IRS, levied, had trouble with bank accounts,and found that previous coworkers were blackballing him on references. At each change in the Bulger case, something happened to Len. When it was published in the papers that H Paul Rico and others were being sued by victim's families,Len got threatening calls. When Eric Schneiderhan was indicted, Len was followed then hit from behind in his car by a man asking a lot of questions. A former guardian for Len in state care with ties to Spec Agent Connelly and Governor Cellucci and George Bush, Sr. appeared to make sure Len was fully unemployable in Massachusetts and New Hampshire through his considerable clout in employment agencies and HR departments throughout the region.Len contacted state and federal law enforcement and everyone ignored him. Correspondence on a federal level was leaked back to the state and things got even worse for Len.No one, not a Raytheon, nor a Barnes and Noble, an AT&amp;T or a Borders books had an opening for Len. Len submitted thousands upon thousands of resumes, attending coaching sessions, networking groups, and consulted with multiple pastors at area churches and no one will hire Len.Some acquaintances suggested that NSA, the Army, CIA, FBI or any combination or others of these had effectively blanketed the area with negatives about Len to destroy any chances for work in the area."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"If Congress investigates thoroughly they may find that many gangsters have been tipped off and that it goes way beyond these guys.One thing no one has addressed is how much of Justice Department practices might have been compromised by Bulger and Flemmi? Has there been a major breach of security?

How easy would it be for an informant to fabricate information which the FBI then acts on?

Why is the Justice Department so aggressive now, 3 decades later?

Will these hearings be about as effective as the IRS hearings were? In the end analysis, Congress has little authority of oversight.Former trooper Schneiderhan asserts that the whole investigation is a joke, and one might question this when one considers that this case spilled open in 1995 and it has been nearly 6.5 years. If one assumes say $200,000 spent each year, then $1.3 million has been spent so far just on investigating Whitey, not including costs of a state investigation. From a third party perspective it seems there are investigators all over, some of whom are blocking the efforts of others. The primary focus seems to be that Flemmi and Bulger were rogue,but this might be simply diverting from a harsher truth.The money for sex business has its own SIC codes,porno movies come with a compliance statement right at the opening of the movie showing that the producers have followed federal guidelines in their production. The 'war' on drugs is no war, so the government manages drugs,assuring neither too many drugs get in nor that there is too much clamping down,the premise being that it is a problem that really cannot be solved without fascist tactics. One can argue whether it is a supply-side or demand-side issue. There is a fine line between morality and legality.One area not investigated much here is the use of psychological warfare to cast doubt on credibility of witnesses or in the Bulger case to fuel existing paranoia that is not completely unfounded given the parties and reputations involved. Bulger is credited with being a serial liar but consider this: if you were being monitored by multiple agents of multiple agencies who are gathering information on you and comparing it without your knowledge or ability to refute or defend and for whom you are supposed to be working, what would you do? And because these agents can operate in anonymity you can only guess who they are, so this puts the person in the position of incriminating themselves without being apprised of the consequences."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"A prosecutor is supposed to seek justice, not just prove guilt. One thing to be concerned with here is whether leads in the investigation are fully considered, even if the leads do not support the prosecutor's assertions. If the investigators in the Bulger case received tips contrary to allegations put forth against Bulger and Flemmi and Connolly would those tips be followed up? How do we know that tip sources such as the media or television crime shows generate leads that investigators will follow up?There is a case of one person who went to the Justice Department when this case broke and who had come under heavy fire for reasons unknown. The Justice Department redacted some of the correspondence and never provided feedback while the harassers showed evidence of in depth knowledge of this correspondence. Later the individual requested a copy of any records they had and met with stonewalling by the department. The individual did not know if they were being held under some form of investigation, as the attackers seemed quite anxious about the unfolding of the Bulger investigation.This scenario might be a warning to any who might consider becoming an informant. For nearly 3 decades Flemmi and Bulger served law enforcement and now they and their families and friends are being destroyed systematically as former associates crumble under pressure and cut deals. There are a lot of allegations about these guys and incriminating testimony and evidence but the full story is not told. As Salemme, Weeks, Nee,Martorano and perhaps others now become informants, they might one day end up like Flemmi and Bulger, once praised and now condemned."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"That is a key question in this scenario.The recent release from prison after 30 years of Peter Limone is a case FOR the use of informants such as used in this case. If not for a report from an unidentified informant exonerating him from murder, Limone would still be in prison. On the flip side, we do not know how credible this unnamed informant was. If the integrity of the informant is high, Limone truly got screwed and some recompense is surely in order.Another disturbing tactic is how the DEA allegedly entered the vehicles of Bulger and Flemmi and planted various bugs in their vehicles. It is alleged that the FBI planted a fake bomb on a car of one man to make him think the Mafia was trying to kill him in order to make him an informant. So we have 2 agencies that will not hesitate to tamper with someone's car.. how far will they go?Held wholly unaccountable in this case is the CIA,which is alleged to have contributed to Bulger's maturing use as a government asset. Some time ago there was a newspaper release that the CIA approached the Mafia about subcontracting an assassination. Prior to the public release, anyone who promulgated that view may have been labeled &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.What should terrify any ordinary citizen is the prospect of these all-powerful agencies running amok and without external oversight. It is unlikely that low level employees are ultimately responsible for straying from the noble mandate but the mangement of these agencies ,which decides the use of resources,targets, and long term agenda for the agency.It is unlikely that Flemmi will be able to offer insightful testimony as he is progressively being worn down and broken down by seclusion, fear, and being a 'patsy'.

Consider the plight of a man who was a small child when Flemmi first appeared in the Top Echelon program:The child was treated out of state and lived in a hospital bed for over 2 years straight with no visitors,no known family and no definitive diagnosis until just before release. One of the procedures performed was the same as a bone marrow transplant and other tests performed also pointed to leukemia. Of government sponsored studies, only 3 children matched this child with diagnosis of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head and also wore the Patten brace and orthotics. This child had no social security number during the treatment nor was a number knowingly assigned to the child as that switched guardianship hands for the next 5 years following years after release from the hospital. In the early 1970s, a former army official attached to the Pentagon during Vietnam (Flemmi was army)arranged for the boy to have a social security number. Prior to meeting this official the boy had a large number of state foster families with a particular Italian family in Burlington,Mass among the most abusive.In 1993-94, the boy had a news article published detailing his quest for his father and the expense and ultimate disappointment in learning the man he was told was the father was not. About 2 years or so after the article a large article appeared in the Boston Globe detailing how Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) could be used to determine leukemia by the existence of minimal residual leukemia cells.On further investigation, the boy(now a man) learned this technique was used in his test. Additionally, consultation with the first expert witness in DNA fingerprinting in the U.S. revealed that the only thing that can throw this test is a bone marrow transplant, which was done in the early 1960s and the procedure for doing so is consistent with procedures performed on the boy.In 1995 this man worked for WR Grace in a capacity to prevent the kind of pollution that tragically occurred in Woburn 4-5 decades ago. On release of Harr's book \\"A Civil Action\\" he was summoned to an Executive's office and told he was part of a \\"layoff\\" for \\"cost reductions\\". The layoff ultimately consisted of 1 person. The man knew little of the Woburn case and had a largely concealed family history in state records that even the likes of Ted Kennedy,Nick Paleologos, and many more could not reveal. For the next few years the man had a succession of job interviews in which he was grilled by the interviewers about the role Grace played in the Woburn case and the interviewers claimed to know parties in the case. In each interview case the man never got the job. While this went on, the man's medical records began disappearing, and an EPA official the man had been introduced to told him\\" good luck finding work\\". Several years before, the man had been called into a Grace managers office with ties to Woburn and informed that if he didn't take a specific job his future was dead with Grace or anywhere else. The man also found himself maneuvered into certain jobs where he suddenly became the target for much harassment because it was thought he had something to do with Harr's book, of which he didn't.Grace has been historically a very Republican company, and the man suddenly began having problems at Fleet Bank, a supporter of gubernatorial candidate Paul Cellucci who has been linked to George Cashman who has been linked to John Connolly in the Bulger case. Most recently the man was told he had 7 days to leave where he was staying by a relative of a Grace executive. Additionally, an associate who had been introduced to the man as a child had ties to a key political supporter of Cellucci with enormous ties to the employment market in the area which became closed off to the man. And when Cellucci moved to Canada, a mysterious phone call from Ottawa came the same day. Before this ,roommates of the man described workmen doing something at the telephone pole outside the apartment that the telephone company later had no work orders for. Pen registers courtesy of the FBI?From 1995 on there was a succession of people remerging from the man's past whom had been introduced by different names when he was a boy than they now carry. In at least one case one such individual suggested that they had made 'mistakes' but ' know how to cover them up'. Since this book came out associates known to the man for decades in some cases suddenly switched demeanor and it became apparent that when the man contacted those \\"friends\\" that the phone conversations were being steered to elicit specific responses perhaps for legal purposes and perhaps recorded without the mans knowledge or permission.It appeared as a significant number of individuals knew something about this man he had never been told so as to protect themselves.That man,because of a withheld family history, has had to suffer long term homelessness,joblessness( on a scale way beyond explanation for the general economic trends of the past 6-7 years), the loss of old 'friends' and nearly every personal possession over and over again while growing up as a child bounced place to place.The man's whole life has been essentially taking one beating after another for events that preceded him and of which he was not a cognizant participant.The man has been referred to in prior reviews."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read.

I think that fact made it even more chilling to me as I wasn't aware of some of the details surrounding different events. I am glad I read it, but I don't need to revisit it anytime soon."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One thing to consider in this whole case is the business implications of justice. Use of informants may reduce labor costs and insurance liability for law enforcement or other agencies. Informants are routinely used even though the public is criticizing the informants in this case. For example, govt agencies and companies frequently hire undercover investigators from such firms as Pinkerton security, Wackenhut, Allied Security and so on to spy on employees for a variety of reasons, including theft, embezzlement and so on. Mass. Atty General Tom O'Reilly has retained Decision Strategies to help his office independently investigate the Big Dig. Also, informants in law enforcement can serve to utilize methods which may be in conflict with agency regulations. For example, an informant can procure personal information on someone where legal work must be done to secure authorization and so leave an auditable trail and the informant allows ongoing informational updates that are largely invisible to ouside parties. But this also has a scary side, in that large amounts of data are being gathered with an ambiguous motivation. Informants are a key source of data and data is power,as the legal profession knows all too well. Another aspect is that as bad as organized crime can be, in the 'big picture' organized crime may be much less dangerous in the eyes of the government than say a whistleblower, for organized crime skirts the laws while whistleblowers challenge the system and its integrity. Organized crime allows the system to basically persist as is but whistleblowers can cause systemic change. And a third concern is the relationship between law enforcement as a prosecutorial power and the vested business interests in providing a steady flow of prisoners. For example, the Justice Dept possesses enormous power to prosecute and convict, essentially unlimited resources drawn from taxpayer dollars but it also runs Unicor, or federal prison industries which makes viable consumer products and is a business conglomerate with a captive workforce and subsequent low labor costs. Additionally, every prisoner brings so many dollars into the system to provide jobs for corrections personnel and law enforcement support personnel and allied personnel up the chain. These are some factors to take into account in a comprehensive analysis of what happened here and what goes on in general."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"O'Neill &amp; Lehr have a history with the Bulger brothers as does Jeremiah O'Sullivan. O'Neill &amp; Lehr interviewed William Bulger about misconstrued dealings with 75 State Street. Whitey had an advocate in former Speaker of the House John McCormack, who believed Whitey could do quite well if given half a chance. Whitey also worked for a short time as a custodian at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. William Bulger is heavily connected, having ties to Jackie Birmingham, Thomas Birmingham's father, Senator John Kerry who has indirect ties to the extended Kennedy clan and many other notables. In his book William Bulger details how thorough FBI scrutiny can be and it is likely the FBI has extensively monitored the entire family. What might have happened in this case is that drastic measures were taken to mediate the escalating violence of the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars which claimed many more lives than what Bulger and Flemmi have been accused of taking. It is unlikely that action against Connolly, Flemmi and Bulger will effect any long term solution, as the system their organization perpetuated has strong buy in at the highest levels of government. Going after these 3 is like a company firing an executive to quench the public thirst for vengeance, but the organization itself perpetuates with new players. There are many many more individuals such as Flemmi and Bulger in the area and which have not gotten anywhere near the heat these guys have. They have been listed in local newspapers.And there has been a much stronger link between organized crime and law enforcement than one might suspect. Organized crime may actually help law enforcement by breaking down geographical regions into empires of control and holding those organized crime groups accountable, thus minimizing random crime."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"An individual with an ambiguous family history at best was thrown into upheaval when this came to light.

The probing of these 'friends' appeared centered on establishing veracity(asking questions they already new answers to without any obvious explanation for having the information- to see if that individual's responses were truthful, and specific facts, such as if they were out for lunch, what the PRECISE bill was and PRECISE tip was(as if conducting an accounting investigation or using information to complete an expense form)4) If these \\"friends\\" happened to be over that person's home or vice-versa, the friends would leave lights on in strange patterns (signaling someone outside and nearby), or need consistently minimum periods of time prior to the individual's arrival, as if preparing recording equipment or other related activities5) Strong evidence of a network of individuals separately introduced but commonly linked to the individual and handing off as handlers among them of the individual while relaying info received from the individual among themselves for corresponding adverse activity6) Many of the \\"friends\\" having geographical links to the Boston FBI office and satellite RAs in Mass. and New Hampshire and in close proximity to spheres of influence of William Bulger7) A whole host of former acquaintances disappearing and re-appearing in the individual's life using names other than they had been introduced with before, as if having access to readily available means to change their identities8)Indicators of long term roving surveillance and interference with communications of the individual, progressively cutting the individual off from being able to contact others by phone or computer ie making that person 'disappear'9) The individual having no criminal history or apparent reason to be under massive long term government scrutiny10) The individual went for medical treatment for one condition and the appointed doctor began treating for mental illness without explanation.

I love learning stuff like this. To me, Boston is just a city, but this book gives it history and shows that places I've walked by a million times really have a dark side to them. Boston is a historical town, sure, but this book shines a light on the evil that is here, that the common man like myself never sees or thinks about! I'm not done yet, but I like it very much so far.-The writing is a bit heavy - sometimes I have to read a passage several times in order to get who is doing what to whom, and how they fit into the big picture. It can be a bit much at times, but overall you get the idea: good guy, bad guy, good guy becoming bad. That sums it up!-I've finished the book. It's a bit much. There's a LOT to take in that I ended up forgetting quite a bit. The author(s) were a bit confusing. The book isn't told in chronological order, rather it jumps around with different stories in an attempt to give the book some cohesiveness. It can be confusing at times, but overall I get the jist of it. Not the easiest read, but certainly interesting."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There is much contradiction in the newspaper accounts in this case. In addition, Charles Prouty wrote a letter to the editor suggesting that publishing newspaper articles with information that may be relevant to the case could be construed as obstruction of justice. Recently former state trooper Schneiderhan, who retired with an excellent reputation as n investigator and who also worked for the Attorney General's office, was arrested for allegedly leaking wiretap information to Bulger.In this case, several individuals have taken the fall defending Bulger or their joint activities. O'Neill pledged his home for bail and Flemmi has not had access to his financial resources to mount a complete defense. The degree of heat that Connolly, O'Neill ,Flemmi and now Schneiderhan are willing to accept is commendable and makes you wonder if there is a lot more going here than meets the eye. If these guys were Bulger's associates and friends, how is Bulger coping knowing that they are taking this much heat? Before anyone can cast judgement it might be wise to hold back until,if ever, we hear Whitey's point of view. Recently the Mass. state police and DEA have expressed strong interest in being included in the FBI's investigation of Bulger at every step.

Take this case of a young man sucked up in this mess and see if it meshes with this book,which is a good read and very informative...The man was employed professionally and around the time Whitey split town was suddenly fired. Just before this an attractive woman had befriended him at Northeastern University, linked also to R Robert Popeo and Agent John Morris. When the man was fired the woman started suddenly taking mysterious trips and acting in a manner suggestive of infidelity while alleging marriage intentions. Before each mystery trip the man was treated with special kindness, as if to assuage guilt over the emotional betrayal soon to follow. This man had as a socil worker a woman who went by the name of a female FBI agent mentioned in Lehr's work on this topic. After Whitey fled, his prior employers blackballed him on job references and his car was tampered with a la Eddie Moiano. IRS audits and levies soon followed as well as sudden bank deposit discrepancies at Fleet Bank, which also harbored IRS accounts at the time. In addition the man's phone line indicated third party interception and screening. As part of this process, the man was called on job interviews which appeared to be nothing more than pretense interviews to gather information or desired evidence on the man. For example, the man was called to a software company offering real-time monitoring and messaging capability such as for chats.When he got there no one knew him or why he was there; but a waist level camera pointed down at him seated in the reception area garnered his photo. Prior to the interview, the man had received overlaid spiteful messages during online chats visible only to him- an alleged capability of this software.At other companies videos were made of him or handwriting samples obtained. Following the alleged fiancee, several other women with similar behavior patterns emerged while new male friends appeared on the scene indicating later after a befriending period that they had kept notebooks on the man or had watched him go to the health club,do banking etc. The man had no criminal history and did not know any principles in the Bulger case but was later informed by these suspicious new friends that he was to blame for the Bulger fiasco. Dan Burton was unavilable for comment on the man during the congressional hearings.The man received threatening and harassing calls but local police were unable to help. Why all of this? Prior to all this, the man had been featured in a local newspaper story detailing his search for who his father was and all the obstacles stemming from that."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Is this case the intersection of several government agencies?

In the same year that Whitey disappeared, this person lost their job and was leveraged into a position by a person with alleged ties to Gov Cellucci and George Bush. While at this position, the individual became subject to many many attacks by the small group of 'coworkers', several that suggested ties to the State police and to federal agencies. As the person experienced a wide array of telephone problems, tens of thousands of resumes sent out over a course of 5-6 years resulted in rejection after rejection.

And if these guys phones were tapped, any agencies monitoring knew their every move as discussed on phone.This book and the case in general treats Bulger and Flemmi as very willing participants but until Flemmi and Bulger can speak freely we don't know if this is true. We also don't know if a third party committed much of the violence in this case and blamed it on Flemmi and Bulger.If you also hypothesize that no one acquires any position of power or wealth in this country without the approval of the govt, then those so in power become potential tools to use against detractors or fall guys.How free could these guys have been if the IRS, FBI,Justice Dept,Customs,CIA,NSA,DIS,DEA,US Marshalls,Secret Service,etc were mobilized against them?Or the possibility that organized crime had this control over them?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There are many many negatives to this case but one of the positives is perhaps some overhauling and reflection on the structure of the Top Echelon program is in order. This program offered financial incentives and opportunities for career advancement within the FBI and there may be similar incentives in the other branches as well. Rewarding performance is one thing but does this program by design encourage self-serving injustices?One might ask if agencies such as the FBI fit an individual to a crime as opposed to the crime to the individual. Is the FBI often pressured for results no matter what despite ambiguities? Part of the negative publicity in this case is due to the FBI's hard-nosed,bullying persona. Often times this is accompanies law enforcement in general.Another dimension to this case is how informants and witnesses seem to be viewed in general by the govt. The fact that individuals went to the FBI seeking help and wound up dead, regardless of who did it, points to serious security flaws in the handling of these people.The number of people who opt out of witness protection might also reflect on how witnesses are treated and it must not be so great if people would rather risk death than stay in the program.We are raised not to tattle-tale but also to do the right thing. In matters where serious crime is involved, if we turn the other cheek we are viewed as tacitly approving the activity yet if we try to stop it we are 'rats'. There is a dilemma here.A big question we might ask is why our agencies keep letting us down? They protection us a lot but they hurt us a lot as well. One only has to look at the Hoover FBI, recent revelations of advanced technologies that suggest our computers might be weapons against us, Cointelpro, and this case to be concerned. Do these agencies set their own agendas or does it come from the top? Or how much input and discretion does a field agent really have? Aren't they only as empowered as upper management allows?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I don't know what to believe in this case. I have had correspondence with the Justice Dept in which they kept much of it,redacted some of it, and just kept collecting it and never doing anything about it. Later i found out the hard way that some of my pleas for help with the Justice Dept had been leaked to some of the people harassing me. This is perhaps similar to the experience of McIntyre and others in the Bulger case.After contacting the Justice Dept, i suddenly became unemployable and had episodes of harassment here and there. One day i went to the car dealership to have my car serviced. Before I got there, an older man wearing his US marshalls cap was at the service desk and made a point of approaching me with some light banter. I had had much positive experience with this dealer. After he left, the dealer told me my car would cost 3x higher to fix than it later did at another garage when i refused.In this case some individuals approached the FBI and it was leaked out,later getting them killed. People at the Justice Dept and FBI have top secret security clearances and they are supposed to be trustworthy. Just before he fled, it was leaked to the paper that Bulger was an informant-- was this designed to make him a target and to avoid the controversy that has now erupted?And with all the heat coming down on Connolly and his family, does this go to show what all the extensive background info that goes into a high level clearance and govt work is compiled for-- future retaliation?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Believe it or not, John Connolly's admiration of Whitey has been no surprise to South Boston - it was so open and brazen that everyone knew - why it took so long for him to be indicted is beyond me.The FBI, through John Connolly, allowed gangsters to murder, extort and run drugs through my community.

Itsall those characters and more, but instead of being New Jersey ItalianAmericans, they're Boston Irish. Whitey Bulger and his sidekick, Stevie &quot;The Rifleman&quot; are some very wicked characters, and this book has some graphic and violent scenes. But at its heart is agent John Connolly, an FBI star who turns out to be incredibly corrupt and unable to resist the charms of Bulger, whom he idolized as a kid when they both grew up in the same housing project in South Boston. The evidence presented in this book against Connolly and some of his fellow, crooked FBI agents is devastating. Some others have claimed that there are two sides of the story, that Connolly was a good guy. Think again. He was as rotten as year-old fish. And the law thinks so too: at the end of the book the authors point out that in December Connolly was indicted for multiple crimes related to his sick friendship with Bulger.

The two men both lived in the general area of Agent Morris and the real one is said to have worked for one of the companies involved in the Woburn water case written about by Jonathan Harr."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Written by two veteran Boston reporters, &quot;Black Mass&quot; is a story of crime and corruption that turns into a gripping tale of good intentions gone awry. Taking place on the mean streets of South Boston, a mere twenty miles or so from where I've lived my whole life, this book tells of a violent intersection of cultures: the tribal culture of Irish America, the often-closed culture of the Federal Bureau of investigation, and the violent culture of organized crime. And unfortunately, it's all true. At bottom, &quot;Black Mass&quot; presents a haze of divided allegiances and moral ambiguity, that may well shake your faith in our government-appointed protectors.Looming large over the whole story is the imposing figure of James J. Bulger Jr., or &quot;Whitey Buljah&quot; as he is more commonly known around these parts. Long before the Bloods and Crips were household names, Bulger emerged from a culture where street gangs were omnipresent and career options for adults were mostly restricted to the Armed services, politics, factory and police work, or crime. Unfortunately, Whitey Bulger never quite outgrew the gang culture of his youth, and he proved exceedingly skilled at the crime profession. As intelligent as he was soulless, Bulger graduated from street enforcer to bank robber (with a stint in Alactraz along the way) to organized crime kingpin with his hand in all things illegal as the head of the vicious Winter Hill Gang. Along for the ride was the aptly nicknamed Stevie &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi, a barbaric killer whose Mafia connections made him a perfect stoolie in the Boston FBI's war against the Mafia.It was in 1975 against the backdrop of the FBI's battle with La Cosa Nostra that FBI agent John Connolly, who emerged from the same projects as Bulger, crafted a plan to bring Whitey and Flemmi into the Bureau's fold as informants. It sounded like a sweet deal for all those concerned: Bulger and Flemmi got to take out the Winter Hill Gang's competition, and the FBI got a well-placed ally in its effort to bring down Boston's ruling Angiulo family. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way. The FBI did manage to bring down the Angiulos, due largely to its now-legendary wiretapping operation at Gennaro Angiulo's headquarters, but Bulger and Flemmi remained connected to the FBI long after they had outlived their usefulness. In fact, as this book makes clear, the two gangsters greatly enlarged their stature in Boston's underworld during the 1980's, and they did it with the full knowledge and even collaboration of the FBI.As O'Neill and Lehr explain, the shared South Boston origins of Bulger and Connolly, which seemed like such an asset back in 1975 when Connolly was recruiting Whitey, ultimately became a liability. Coming from a tight-knit, tribal culture like Southie, Connolly couldn't exactly be counted on to maintain his objectivity in dealing with Bulger, whom he even came to refer to as a &quot;good bad guy.&quot; An even deeper problem, though, was John Connolly himself: a smooth-talking lady's man who liked the high life a bit too much, Connolly eventually became virtually indistinguishable from his prized informants. Hanging out with Bulger and Flemmi and accepting their gifts, Connolly didn't just look the other way while Bulger, Flemmi &amp; Co. enlarged their empire and the bodies piled up; he was an active assistant in their operation. Although they were frequently pursued by the Massachusetts State Police, local detectives, and even the DEA, the two gangsters were virtually untouchable.Perhaps even worse, O'Neill and Lehr make it clear that the FBI's mishandling of its two prized informants went beyond John Connolly's corruption to encompass a massive institutional failure. With Connolly corrupted and a series of supervisors compromised, the Bureau's guidelines for oversight of informants became essentially null and void. Falsified reports that exaggerated Bulger and Flemmi's usefulness while understating their criminal activities became the norm, and even those in other law enforcement agencies who suspected something amiss had their efforts blocked. One painful lesson to be drawn from this book is that the law is only as strong as those who enforce it. When those charged with stopping crime drift to the other side, where do we turn then?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"No one seems to be investigating whether Bulger and Flemmi were coerced into service against their wishes. Examine for a second the plausibility of Bulger and Flemmi going 'legit'..There might have been a very good chance their phone calls were intercepted or monitored. Say Bulger was looking for serious work- if the line was monitored or calls intercepted, the calls could either not be received or those parties calling to offer work could be approached without Bulger's knowledge, keeping him from finding work. All any agency would need to do is mention either national security or an ongoing investigation and neither could get work.A year or two ago the FBI busted some people for operating an illegal software ring and the leader was a NEC employee from Chelmsford, Mass. Following the bust, local media reported that the ringleader wanted to be 'allowed to find work', suggesting that even without a trial, the government could keep the person from legitimate work. Why could this not have been done to Bulger and Flemmi?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book puts all the pieces together from every news report on Boston's organized crime problem. It proves that neighborhood ties and fantasy are stronger than the oaths that some of our law enforcement people make. Growing up in Boston, Whitey was an elusive figure that the Irish looked up to as a protector. He was legendary and people were star struck if they saw him. He took advantage of the strong loyalty ties the people of South Boston have to eachother. Nowhere else could he have been more successful. If you know some of the players and have followed the stories over the years you will love this book."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"&quot;Black Mass&quot; is the story of a big time Irish gangster, James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, and how he turned informant for the FBI. Unlike other instances where this has occurred, however, Bulger managed to corrupt his FBI handlers as they aided and abetted his twenty year crime spree. Authors Lehr and O'Neill know this story well, having covered it for many years with the local Boston newspapers. It is a good lesson in what can happen to anyone, especially a law enforcement officer, when little indescretions lead to major breaches in ethics. What the book does not have enough of, unfortunately, are first hand descriptions of the mobsters plying their trade. There is some of it in the book, but most of the stories are second hand. Unlike other notable recent mob stories, like &quot;Wise Guy&quot; and &quot;Underboss,&quot; the focus is not on mob life itself. Overall, I found the book to be about a hundred pages or so too long, though still an interesting read for anyone who like real life crime stories."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I read this book with great expectations, but it didn't fully deliver. Despite the fascinating subject matter, and some gripping passages, it reads like a &quot;rush job&quot; and collage of old newspaper stories. Still, fans of the &quot;true crime&quot; genre should find it worth their while. Also take a look at George V Higgins's last novel, &quot;At End of Day&quot;, which treats the same topic."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"When most think of the mafia or organized crime they think La Cosa Nostra.The Italian mafia families.But there are other mobs working with or trying to take over the traditional role of Cosa Nostra.One being the Irish mobs.And one of the big players from Boston James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, Jr.In this book you will see that not even the &quot;good guys&quot; are always good.And what the meaning of true friendship is."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"The bulk of the information available for this book and the case in general comes from newspaper accounts, but sometimes false information is released to conceal the investigation. Is this the case here? If so we may not want to rush to judgement.A civil case involving a number of agents and the informants is in the works with Judge Wolf allegedly presiding.Agent Rico is unable to be charged due to insufficient evidence. Connolly, trained by Rico, continues to be a major target. Frank Salemme, for years targeted to be an informant and allegedly harassed as such, is said to be cooperating now. Caught in the middle are the families and friends of the agents and informants involved.There seem to be few avenues of getting potentially relevant information to the FBI. Likewise, we don't know how objectively any leads are treated."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"It may be possible that leaks in many govt agencies are commonplace and not linked to a given political administration but more linked to the structure of this country as a mosaic of conflicting groups all striving for ascendancy and with the scales in one direction then another as the power keeps shifting.I have seen leaks in many agencies of which i have some experience, including agencies listed in this book and more.If you look at these competing groups as carving territories for themselves, then an individual outside of the group most dominant in the agency might be pushed away, as perhaps the victims were who approached the FBI as alleged.Also, when you have an agency and employees in it dealing with classified information, that information is usually heavily controlled and individuals only given bits &amp; pieces with precious few having the big picture. Where they may be many security ramifications involving Bulger and Flemmi and their activities, it may be safe to say that the full truth cannot be disclosed because of security considerations which may be held over their heads."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"When reading a book like this it is easy to judge. Ordinary people become suspicious of government institutions because carefully concealed practices sometimes slip through that erode the public trust,leaving us frightened of our own government. But one must also consider organized crime in general and not just the Mafia- how many people have been hurt as opposed to helped by the Mafia? Is the Mafia known for benevolence or cruelty? The role of organized crime seems to be in the dealings of activities which are not legal but may pose greater issues of morality that cannot be universally agreed upon.And it seems that a clear line is drawn between legal and illegal that also creates 2 clear sides of authority-- if it is legal, the govt gets a cut;if not, organized crime prevails. But it seems that the govt and organized crime can be competing for control of the same things.But when it comes to obtaining justice, the govt has clear superiority.The govt can bring to bear unlimited time and resources to bring someone down,oftentimes empowered with techniques that non-govt parties could go to jail for,like surreptitious eavesdropping and entry into homes and vehicles and the like.The govt has been known to tap phones and conduct electronic surveillance of individuals for YEARS! Should there be a limit to how long this sort of activity can go on? Another interesting element is the career paths of govt employees; how often does it occur that justice is not done because of future promises of employment in the private sector? This holds not just for law enforcement but from all branches of govt from public to private sectors. One of the most disturbing of allegations in this case is that for nearly 3 decades the players in this book operated but the oversight mechanisms of the FBI or Justice Dept did not kick in. Is it possible that other agencies with higher authority than the agents in this case had were involved in some way? And must informants have clearances allied with the levels their handlers have,thus falling into monitoring for compliance thereof? And anyone who has ever seen an employment application for FBI service knows that admission into the FBI is not easy or quick process.These individuals are extensively investigated and scrutinized and voluminous files created detailing their backgrounds and assorted connections. This case calls into question the character of the agents, but they obviously had what it takes to get into the FBI as well as to eventually retire with successful careers. Bulger and Flemmi are portrayed as serial killers, but don't lose sight of the fact that the FBI has extensive resources in profiling at their disposal and virtually unlimited technical expertise to draw from that should have prompted any flags relating to the mental stability of Flemmi and Bulger."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"When this book came out, many people became casualties of this clash of forces that are not mentioned in this book. I began having all sorts of sudden problems, like interference with federal aid for college, problems with my schooling at a major Boston college, being blackballed by employers and being ignored or belittled by leading politicians in Massachusetts. This is a complex tapestry of clashing forces that i wonder if it is connected to the major clashes in economic concerns in Massachusetts in the 1960s between forces loyal to the space program and those loyal to the military during JFK's presidency. The heat and harassment has been continuous on me since this case really exploded in 1995. I have also had many suspicious job interviews with individuals who seem more interested in gleaning personal information out of me or discrediting me than giving me an opportunity. At times it seems like it could be mafia -related and at others like parties trying to make it look like someone else is trying to 'get' me. I don't know what the link is between myself and this case but the conduct all around has been reprehensible. I can only speculate if i am the only one experiencing this."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I don't believe the FBI is looking for Whitey at all because the truth Whitey may possess is far worse than dealing with the murders alleged in the case. I know someone who has provided info that could shed a lot of light in this case and the FBI nor anyone else has acted on it. Instead, the person who provided it became the target of their harassment. The information could shed some light in either direction on the case."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Plenty has been said about Flemmi,Bulger,Connolly.

This info has been in the papers. And a recent column that the FBI/Justice Dept is tapping all sorts of telephones and cell phones to find out whop is leaking info?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I think the book was great! I commend the authors for their bravery. You just never really know what is truth and what is fiction. Knowing some of the players, I believe most of what I read. I think Jim Bulger is a master at his game and we will never see him pay for all he has done. I do think Boston Edison should dump this Connolly from the payroll! He should not be allowed to live life as if he had no part in this extreme corruption of Justice."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book provides an excellent summation of the relationship that developed between ambitious FBI agents and the ever manipulative Bulger. It shows how the FBI in it's obsession with taking down the LCN, at first rationalized Bulgers criminal behavior and later became a accomplise to it by informing Bulger of investigations by other agencies and telling him who was informing on him. At times early in the book the authors jump ahead in their chronological telling of this tale, to show the outlandish behavior of the FBI agents and their inappropriate closeness with him and Flemmi, this caused some confusion as to what events happened when especially when the authors returned to the specific time period they were discussing. However this doesn't take away from the over all picture they were painting and in the end they make an excellent case."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Unfortunately the legend of Whitey will be the Bonnie and Clyde story for generations to come. Sure what he did was reprehensable and sinister. Bulger was a crime boss that employed tactics taught in some of our finer business schools. He gained trust and incorporated deceit to attain his capital goals. His alignment with Flemmi was a business move, he got closer to the enemy. His shrewdness cannot be overlooked, his manipulation of Morris and Connoly's FBI status worked in his favor. Competing corporations surly would find such business acumen enlightening. The book reveals how just important &quot;politics&quot; is to make it in life. So true as the saying goes &quot;its not what you know, it's who you know.&quot; The book is a great read. Growing up in Boston I often wondered how come they were untouchable. Read it and you will have an understanding how they were able tos tay in control. Connolly is culpable in all of this and knew it's consequences. However he should not be the scapegoat of the FBI's informants policy. With ego's involved this was bound to backfire and the mere mention of William Bulger sent everyone into a tizzy, James Bulger saw a business opportunity. Connolly loved the action of the whole charade and justified his behavior by srewing the LCN. The mandate from Washington was the LCN was evil at it's best and therefore should be brought down at all cost. Even the U.S. Attorney looked the other way. Connolly did his job and organized crime got theirs. Innocent people payed the price and that is unfortunate. The life of crime depicted here portrays a profession that is dog eat dog and only the shrewd can survive."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is a gripping story of just how corrupt a law enforcement agency can become - in this case, the Boston office of the FBI. For over a decade they provided protective cover for a couple of the worst, most prolific criminals in Boston history. All this in name of protecting &quot;valuable informants.&quot; I've not read a better tale of criminal activity, political influence, and white collar corruption set in one of the most interesting of all American cities, Boston. If these subjects interest you, you won't find a better tale."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"When Whitey Bulger and friends needed money or excitement, they would choose a likely victim, confront him with the story that they had been hired to kill him, but he could buy the contract for $50,000 and stay alive. These heroes were protected by the Boston FBI and that story is told in this fascinating expansion of the story originally reported in the Boston Globe. This tale has resonance all over the US, anywhere the government uses informants to further its goals, these are the dangers that await. Good men gone astray, bad men made heroes and the rest of us pay the price."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"a must...this book is incredible..a page turner...the alliance between two (2) mobsters, one a serial killer, is compelling...the loyalty of the agents is challenged and the bad guys profer..what is great is that none of the names are changed..its all there...some may hide..but this cosiness between two killers and fbi agents will raise some eyebrows...a must!"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book was a real interesting one but what i wonder is how a child of Bulger's might have been treated..Would such a child or children be monitored all their lives by government officials without their knowledge, perhaps having taps or their communications monitored for long periods without their knowledge under some national security directive or secret court order?Are plants put in the lives of informants to control them subtly without their knowledge or consent? If sodo the American people want this?Is there a classified operation still ongoing involving Bulger et al? Should Dan Burton explore this?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One of the reviews has mentioned someone being harassed since this case blossomed in 1995-96. One thing to note is that attempts may be being made even now to make it look like that person for example is not really looking for work as opposed to being blackballed. This can be done easy by calling on a recorded line and carefully wording the conversation such that it appears the target is saying what you want them to say when in fact it is wrong. Or by making such terrible offers that person is unlikely to take a position then using spin to make it sound like they simply didn't give the job consideration. It sounds like someone might want that person out of work and financially broken and is covering themselves in the process."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"The Justice Dept has just unveiled new criteria for dealing with informants. But some serious questions remain.If one views informants as a partnership between an agency,its agents and the informant, long term close work can forge a camaraderie as informant and official teamup to fight crime. If the informant is not committing crimes, then what is wrong with socializing with agents or even exchanging gifts? Are the informants not de facto independent contractors of the agency? The way informants seem portrayed in the media is in an inferior position with respect to the agent but isn't it more of a partnering? Where the potential danger comes in is if either agent or informant commits crimes with the aid of the other. Because Bulger and Flemmi are not available for comment, we don't have the full picture.The bond that can be formed between agent and informant is increased because of the inherent dangers to each involved in pursuing crimes. The informant needs the protection offered by the agent and agents in the field surely need protection offered by informants.In this case we don't know if gifts were exchanged between agents and informants as bribes or as gestures of friendship and kinship developed over the years in a shared mission.It might be an issue of gratitude on both sides and not payback at all.What you've got in this case is a whole lot of angry,hurt people looking to pin responsibility. You have testimonials from parties who have cut deals with the Justice Dept who have in turn now earned the label 'informant', becoming that which they say they felt so betrayed by.These newly made informants might now have a glimpse of what could have caused Flemmi and Bulger to turn informant.So easy to judge?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"What so few commentators point out is that government has a collective psychology which can be exploited, as Hitler found out as well as J Edgar Hoover, and Slobodan Milosevich, a trained psychiatrist. If you consider govt as a collective capable of ultimate self-protection, then anything can become possible if it is threatened by real or perceived antigens. When you consider the degree of secrecy and confidentiality required by the alleged players in this case, one cannot rule out that forces might be out to destroy them using clever and insidious means. One such way is an active discrediting campaign aimed at making the defendants appear as psychologically unstable characters whose testimony in court can be attacked for its credibility based on carefully contrived proofs of instability. If these individuals were in such high risk activities it might be reasonable to suggest that they were heavily monitored because of potential fallout by other individuals who could be used to manipulate the lives of these guys and basically playmind games. If you have a group of people aimed at creating stress in your life, how long could you last before someone could construct a case that made you appear crazy? Especially if your communications are being monitored such that your innermost thoughts, problems and plans could be known? The nature of undercover work and such is to be able to maintain a persona not yours over sometimes a very prolonged period.Deception is perfectly acceptable and manipulating people and events becomes standard. These sorts of strategies are often developed in collusion with psychological and psychiatric professionals to permit an individual to do this sort of thing naturally. What we are taught in school,church,temple as wrong becomes perfectly acceptable. In the movie &quot;The Skulls' is a scene where an inductee becomes a threat and is thrown into a mental hospital and drugged up to protect the powerful elite who control the organization. Perhaps this is not so far-fetched.The threat the inductee posed was knowledge of the truth. This is a society which punishes honest mistakes,rewards cover-ups and discourages contrition. Someone or a group of people know what really happened here and are not talking. Is it fear? Guilt? Shame? Indifference?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"About the time Whitey disappeared, someone i know worked with a small group of individuals at a Fortune 500 company and began getting harassed severely. These individuals alternately claimed affiliation with Whitey and/or Connolly and wanted to know if this person was 'going to make money off of &quot; A Civil Action&quot; '. These same individuals alleged varying alliances to the Mass. state police, DEA, CIA. As this case heated up in local media, so too did the harassment.No one as far as we know has investigated former miltary service associates of Bulger and Flemmi to see if they have knowledge useful to the case. In Bulger's case that would be the Air Force and Flemmi's the army.Considering the sensitivity of the connections and activities in this case, one might wonder if Flemmi and Bulger were granted security clearances and if so might their personal and professional activities have been scrupulously monitored? No one has given serious consideration to the use of coercion in this case. The coercion need not have only come from the FBI but other state or federal agencies. If Whitey for example had children, wouldn't they be excellent insurance for future control of Whitey or could Whitey,Flemmi,Connolly or Rico have had some control over a government official's children?The timing of the Hanssen spy case comes at a propitious moment for the FBI, as this lends further credence to deniability of knowledge of Flemmi,Connolly, Bulger's activities."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I picked up this book used and found it to be really excellent. I think Whitey is still on the most wanted list. Given some of things the government has done in the past it won't suprise me if he was never caught and this gets into why often mentioning that he was very overrated as an informant on the Boston LCN. Probaly used the FBI to become the most powerful mob boss in Boston despite being Irish. He did a lot of hits for the Boston LCN as perhaps as many as any top enforcer in Boston and was overvalued as an informer. This book goes into why: his relationship from a certain FBI agent since the agent was a child. Embarrassing for the FBi despite having taken down the Angiulio's..mostly due to wire tap evidence, not Bulger."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"It has been asserted that when someone works for the govt their family and friends are paid off and that person 'dies', or assumes a new identity. What went into making Flemmi and Bulger informants? Were these guys surrounded in their personal lives by intelligence people and their lives constantly made miserable if they didn't toe the line? Were rumors and other character assassination techniques used to make Flemmi and Bulger ineligible for legitimate employment? It has also been said that when the govt wants to make you work for them., they will spread disinformation such that no employer would want to touch you.. maybe Flemmi and Bulger encountered this.

Gov. Cellucci, who may be an indirect supporter of John Connolly, assigned the current Commissioner of DSS, Jeffrey Locke. If Whitey had a child, was this child targeted as the child attended the alma mater of agent John Morris? Has the child been systematically harassed and had their reputation destroyed in Massachusetts by either the government or perhaps rival mobsters or both? If there was a child, was the child prevented from finding work by screening their calls? If there was a child could it have become imperative to make the child look like a failure or less than spectacular performance in school?

Look at what Hoover was able to do while the Justice Dept was powerless against him. The FBI and similar agencies are so dangerous because their mission is to gather dirt on people. By doing this and keeping the files 'confidential', one might ask why someone would gather huge amounts of information on people and keep them from seeing what has been compiled unless it is for future retaliatory purposes or for intimidation?These questions are unknowns but serious because how many people have been convicted on the word of an FBI agent? Because of this power agents need to be of the highest caliber and integrity. It must not be an easy job to be such an agent.Perhaps the empowerment of individual agents is grossly exaggerated in this case. It seems that FBI management is much more in control than the agent in the field.If FBI management has targeted someone and an investigating agent in the field finds extenuating circumstances or information that reflects positively on the target, does FBI management stifle those reports to get the target anyway? Does FBI management manage investigations just like a business does, in terms of profits and loss? This book focuses on the FBI but these same questions can apply across the board to other law enforcement and allied bodies as well."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"During the Hoover administration, FBI agents had their relationships, like a potential fiancee, screened by an FBI approved background check. I wonder if this is still done, and if so, the FBI knows way more about the various relationships in this case than it admits. Many negative things have been said about Connolly ,Flemmi,Bulger, but as an orphan in state care in Boston with a private state-funded program, my short time in Boston was among the best years of my life in a childhood of physical and emotional abuse and abandonment. I don't know if these individuals had a role in the generosity we as disposable kids experienced by the business and nonprofit community in Boston and Brookline, having opportunities to see movies,swim in a public pool, and go to museums.These were not a cure, but they brought civility into our lives. Billy Bulger was a big advocate of child abuse prevention and i don't know if i was a beneficiary of that but my short experience in Boston, outside of witnessing some of the horrors of forced busing in Bromley,Heath and Mission Hill was positive. Much negative stuff in this book tries to portray the Irish as ruthless killers and organized crime as immoral but sympathetic victims. Throughout my tenure as a disposable kid, by and large the Irish community most warmly greeted me. I also met some kind Italian people, but far more Irish people who accepted me into their lives.I did not know my own ethnic background, looked Italian but was never really greeted in that community. As a young child i cried often wishing someday i would land with a family that would love me and i could have a normal life until one day there were no more tears to shed and no family that could make me feel at home. I cannot sterotype the Italian or Irish communities, but i am somewhat distressed by the protrayal of the Irish community as a band of ruthless gangsters as this book suggests.

You know you should stop reading but you can't pull your eyes away from the page, it's like a car accident, you know you shoudn't look but....After awhile though your mind regains its focus and your mind rebels. you just gotta go whaaattt? The thesis of the book is John Connolly, FBI agent, has a man crush on James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger because Bulger bought him ice cream as a child and later saved him from a beat down on a baseball field. Because of this and their common origin in South Boston, Connolly obstructs justice and single handedly blocks every and all investigations in Bulger and his cronies. In doing so he throws away a career and does hard time.This is pretty hard for anyone who ever had a job and a hard nosed boss to believe. Imagine the scene, the hurley burly of FBI head quarters in Boston, agents scurry about investigating UFO's, spies, and procuring the super strong coffee needed for those 25 hour days. The phone rings on agent Connolly desk:\\"Connolly FBI\\"\\"John this is Home Base, the Big House, the Central Power...\\"\\"Ma?\\"\\"No, no, not your mother, this Is FBI headqurters in Washington D.C. We want you to investigate Whitey Bolger\\"\\"Whitey?! Whitey Bolger, git on wif ye, surin ye knew he's a grand man. Why wood ya be pressin on 'im\\"\\"We have reason to believe he is a bad man\\"\\"Sure I can tell ya he's not, he's an upstandin fella. Bought me ice cream when I was a wee bairn\\"\\"What?!\\"\\"Well....it was vanella if ye want to know. He ulso pullled that fat day go kid off in me.....\\"\\"Connolly, this is agent Antonelli, investigate him anyway.\\"\\"OK\\"*Connolly Hangs up phone and ignores orders*Well, if you buy the premise of this book as absurd as the above conversation is you have to believe in something close to it (authors also pepper the work with the casual prejudice of the Boston Brahmans, the Irish of South Boston are portrayed as poorly educated reactionaries unaware of their own best interests). To buy the premise the authors proceed from you have to believe the FBI is so inept that a mid level functionary can shutdown the organization by basically holding his breath and saying, \\"No!\\" If true the national security of the United States is compromised as our national police force is inept. This is not believable, what is believable is massive corruption in the local office of which Connolly and Morris were a part of; this is established later in the book when authors reveal in a rather off hand and cavalier way that seventeen other agents are indicted for corruption! Kind of puts the sword to the proposition Connolly and Morris obstructed, it seems the whole office was in on it! Why then did the authors not re-think or re-postulate their story in light of these facts?I don't know. Perhaps laziness, maybe ineptitude.Regardless, what's even more unbelievable is the authors seeming obliviousness to the fact that Bolgers continued freedom (in spite of an alleged 15 year world wide manhunt by the FBI) belies their premise for the book. After all, after removing the obstruction to Bolgers arrest, Bolgers arrest would be sure to follow.Right?Why then has he remained free for 15 years? Is he so clever the FBI and all the other national police forces in the world can't find him? Hard to believe. Real hard. Maybe the truth is the FBI doesn't want him? I wonder, \\"Why would that be?\\" Perhaps important powerful people either in or out of the FBI would be compromised by his arrest? If so, Connolly doesn't know who they are, he would of given them up to save himself, therefore they're only safe as long as Bolger is free. This makes sense. The book doesn't.p.s. Well, they finally got Bulger, seems the bodybuilder was living in Venice Beach; who would of thought? *Rolls eyes* I can't wait to hear this guy talk.p.p.s. Well, it's been 6 months since Bolger was arrested, no news. You'ld think 16 years would of been plenty of time for the Feds to get their ducks in a line. I guess they're hoping Bolger slips on some wet tile or something.p.p.p.s. Over a year now since Bolgers arrest (06/11/2011) still dancing in court, Bolgers attorneys aver he had a deal with the Feds; sure would explain why he could hide in plain sight for 16 years."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This was a very interesting book, however I was disappointed that it came without the book jacket.

These approaches usually involve intimidation or extortion with the deliverers claiming FBI affiliation in the Merrimack Valley region of northern Massachusetts which includes a regional FBI office outside of the Boston office.Has the Defense Investigative Service and FBI teamed up to squeeze a child of Bulger or a close friend of Bulger's to keep Bulger away?Are Whitey Bulger and Flemmi's names being smeared to bringclosure to their roles in a covert operation?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book reads well and is interesting but the reader might want to have more info.The Government reform committee headed by Congress might want to investigate linkage between this case and Judge Sartorelli of Middlesex County, Massachusetts and also research agents Weafer and Driscoll and other Justice Dept personnel in Middlesex county of the 1960s/1970s, as many of the players here are located in Middlesex county."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Here is a fascinating topic of recent interest which the authors seem to have spent a lot of time researching. Unfortunately, one gets the feeling they did not spend much time writing it.It is always difficult for multiple authors to write a cohesive narrative. In this case, the reader sometimes feels (s)he is talking to a forgetful party guest who keeps telling the same joke or story. The same incident is brought up several times as though it were the first, probably a result of duplicated effort among the authors combined with poor editing. Likely the publisher was in a hurry to get the book out while the topic was still current.Some of the writing is just plain silly. &quot;Bulger was the head on Connolly's glass of beer.&quot; Even if that means something -- and I will never be convinced of that -- it does not contribute to my understanding of the case.The Bulger/Flemmi case could be the basis for a really great book, and I hope someday it will be.

It's main characters are men in positions of power who have neither conscience or compassion and the supposed good guys are, in many ways, worse than the bad. Obviously gangsters like Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi were violent, amoral criminals; but to find out that FBI agents like John Connolly were lurking in the shadows protecting them and manipulating everybody else will make even the most cynical reader feel outraged and frustrated. It is a courageous and, at times, disturbing story that will test your own conscience and force you to ask the question: who are we really supposed to trust? Great read!"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Early in this case, defendants brought up the fact that the Justice Dept had compiled files on them but would not release contents or summaries of those files to the defendants. Perhaps a strategy used by the govt is to target an individual, harass them to the degree that they seek law enforcement help or protection, then use the info they provide not only forlaw enforcement intelligence, but as leverage later when they can hold this information over the head of the persons seeking law enforcement help who then may be branded a 'rat'.Perhaps a similar thing happened in the case of Flemmi and Bulger.This case also raises questions when you consider that the Justice Dept with all of its prosecutorial powers also oversees the Bureau of Prisons. The FBI investigates itself and the Justice Dept, it's boss, via the Office of Professional Responsibility.The CIA and NSA also appear to police themselves. This case is so complex and the mandate given to Bulger and Flemmi so unclear that it is extremely difficult to determine who had authority for what. It does not seem possible that a small group comprised of Connolly,Bulger,Flemmi,Mercurio,Morris were able to perpetuate the organization alleged for nearly 3 decades with the Justice Dept powerless to stop them.It is also disturbing that fellow agents have distanced themselves and left this group holding the bag alone. It is not to exonerate the group but to say that the responsibility is shared and the executives up top should have the conviction to do what is right. Also, in the Puzzle Palace by James Bamford it discusses how NSA had prospective employees agree in writing that they would obey the law in their personal lives , but does not say that they must in their professional lives. Another interesting work is &quot;Underground Empire&quot; by James Mills, which discusses a highly secretive pseudo-organization known as Centac, which had a mandate of destroying criminal empires from the top. Also, we do not know much about the recruitment of Flemmi and Bulger.. once recruited whether as informants or govt agents say as Bulger (a former Air Force veteran) or Flemmi (Army paratrooper) these individuals become assets of the govt and are tracked accordingly by social security number,etc and their lives heavily monitored by security components of the agencies for which they work."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"One of the things Congressman Burton should investigate is how tips were handled by America's Most Wanted and whether any of them were withheld or leaked.

One of the people i had known for 2 decades and was rabidly anti-Bulger. I found myself surrounded by people who had some feeling one way or another about the Bulger case and it was mixed between pro-FBI and pro-Bulger forces. This schism was so pronounced i wonder if the Bulger case actually involves the 2 major political parties in the U.S.and this is why there is so much gridlock.One person affected by this whole mess was allegedly targeted by individuals claiming to have ties to the Nh department of justice and possibly other local FBI offices in the area. Were these real agents or agent provocateurs?Was the Defense Investigative Service,DIA or other agencies involved? Is Congress capable of doing anything if they are?Did the state or regional federal agencies within the state back Whitey? Have other branches of the Justice Department or other agencies protected Bulger from the FBI or has the FBI done it? Could Bulger be being protected on the possibility he really did NOT do all that is alleged and what is going on is a lynching?Is this a planned reorganization of the government itself taking shape as a series of scandalous triggers which will cause disbanding of the agency?

The authors' investigative reporting goes deep, uncovering the gang's criminal activities as well as their unholy pact with the FBI. This book lacks the personal notes found in others written by various gang members, but it more than makes up for it with solid reporting that shows the scope and outrageousness of the gang's operations. My only criticism is that it could use an update covering what's happened to the major players since its publication."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Black Mass is an unbelievable account of the illicit relationship between two Irish mobsters from South Boston (Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi) and their FBI handlers (John Connolly and John Morris).The book begins with background on South Boston and the \\"us against them\\" mentality of the residents. As a young boy, John Connolly looked up to and admired Whitey Bulger, a local gangster, and left an indelible impression on Connolly one day when Bulger rescued Connolly from a fight. Years later, when Connolly was assigned to the Boston FBI office, he sought out Bulger to turn him into an informant, hoping to make a name for himself. Bulger's younger brother was president of the state senate and Whitey by this time was head of the Irish mob in Boston, both highly regarded in their own circles.Though Connolly may have begun the relationship with good intentions, it very quickly turned corrupt, and the information Bulger supplied Connolly was self-serving, and Connolly, never having grown out of his idolization of Bulger, did all he could to keep Whitey's record clean. The Irish and Italian mafias had a tenuous relationship, so for Bulgur, informing on his competition got them out of his way, and as long as he worked with the FBI, he was untouchable. Bulger's partner in crime, Stevie Flemmi, as it turned out, had been an informant for several years before Bulger. Rather than the FBI handling them, Bulger and Flemmi cultivated a bond with Connolly and Morris to ensure that they could do anything without fear of punishment. Reports were made up, lost, or taken; phone calls from other law enforcement agencies were ignored; Bulger and Flemmi's importance was inflated; and they were always one step ahead of a sting. Under the protection of the FBI, Bulger and Flemmi were involved in racketeering, gun running, drugs, and over a dozen murders - and got away with it.What amazes me is that supposedly Connolly and Morris only benefited by $7000 during the two decades that Bulger and Flemmi were informants. Initially I believe that Connolly just wanted notoriety, but he is also flamboyant and likes living the high life, which it appears he did.Eventually Morris' conscience bothered him enough to start talking, but it still took several years before Bulger, Flemmi, Connolly and Morris were indicted. Connolly warned Bulger, enabling him to escape. Flemmi, on the other hand, still thought that Morris would tell the court that this was all a mistake, and get Flemmi off as he had done for so many years.As far as I know, Bulger is still a fugative and on the 10 Most Wanted List. I hope that regulations are now being followed to ensure FBI handlers are accountable for their action or inaction, and that the chain of command is aware of what the agents are doing. This was a well-written and engrossing story."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is a fantastic book. I knew nothing of the true story, so I found every twist and turn very entertaining. It is well written and doesn't get too bogged down in gritty detail. I read about 2-3 books a month and this ranks near the top of ones I've read in 2003.The story is very interesting, but the strength is in it's characters. Whitey, Flemmi, Connolly, etc. all have their moments. I found myself many times thinking to myself, I cannot believe this. But it's true, scary in fact. It has all the elements of a great movie, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been adapted already. It has Scorsese all over it.The authors give you a good taste of life in South Boston and of course expose a criminal decade or two that was aided by the FBI. This isn't conspiracy theory stuff, btw. Agents in the FBI protected their star informants, giving them tips, covering up information, that allowed them to stay on the street and supposedly bust others.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This is an excellent book on the Boston Irish mob figure whitey bulger.

Whitey became an informant for the FBI by Connnally's persausion, but he was overratted and used the FBI to strengthen his position while Steve Flemmi's information was more valuable. They informed on the the Italian mafia, but the Angulio's were taken down more due to wire tap evidence. Whitey and his gang became the benefactors of the fall of the Angulio's and pick up some of their business after their fall. Whitey was also a drug dealer, not protector of South Boston.

This shows that confidentiality cannot be maintained by government or law enforcement personnel nor so called &quot;confidential&quot; tip sources as tv law enforcement shows.

The kid was overseen by a former government official about the time that Bulger became an informant. Prior to this time the kid was placed in many abusive homes, one of which may have been linked to a well known escort service owner in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, many of the people associated with this child have indirect ties to major brothels and escort operators in the area.

Judge Wolf worked under Bill Weld at the Justice Dept and Gary Crossen was involved in the mafia induction taping. Around this time i knew an individual who became a target of increased threats and harassment against themselves and others around them. Their friends started acting nervous or afraid and backed off, as if being intimidated. The people doing the harassing alleged links to different individuals prolific in state politics. This person went to the authorities and was blown off by the FBI and told by the Justice Dept that they do not speak to ordinary citizens and to get a lawyer.Later the person requested copies of any files that either may have on them and was told either the agency was 'too busy' or claimed ignorance about any such contacts. The experience lends additional credence to claims by the Litif family, Barretts,Mcintyre families. The day after Schneiderhan was busted this person was approached by an angry, official looking person looking for incriminating information.

A serviceman is said to have testified before Congress that 20% of the backpressure relief valves were installed backwards in the Thresher and that the hull of the Thresher was crushed at a time when the Portsmouth and Boston navy yards may have been competing for funds.

The general public is not considering the possibility that perhaps he really did submit the lead from an informant on behalf of Salvati and Limone but it was mishandled higher up. Not withstanding the allegations against Rico, it is sad to see a former star FBI agent lacking ANY support from his peers. Current and future FBI agents at this very moment might be making decisions that will land them too in the position Rico and Connolly are in.A concern in this case is that much information has been lost,witnesses are dead and security restrictions in place that may bar Rico and others from fully disclosing the particulars.Another curious item is that the FBI has not established its own anonymous lead source.Former Governor Paul Cellucci is responsible for releasing Salvati."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I know someone who communicated with the Justice Management Division after attempts to get help from the Boston and Lowell/Lawrence Mass.

About a year later, some of the person's mail stopped coming at their apartment. A short time later, some military police came to arrest the individual claiming they were AWOL from the military.

When calling organizations from which the person (&quot;John Doe#1&quot;) had not gotten mail, those organizations had the second man's(&quot;John Doe #2&quot;) address. So John Doe #2 was using this person's address for military service and knew enough about the person to contact organizations that person did business with and have their mail forwarded to the second address. 5 yrs later, when William Weld is said to have headed the Justice Dept criminal investigation division (Mueller-FBI and Judge Mark Wolf as subordinates) and Mike Dukakis was governor.,John Doe#1 was working at a local company and received an incoming customer call for another coworker.

How many people were involved in the choice? Do informants go through normal security clearance oversight?It has become apparent that informants were used against each other and that many have gone to jail rather than reveal their informant status. This case might make one reconsider becoming an informant or working for the FBI or Justice Dept.During the Vietnam protests, it has been said that some police officers dressed up in riot gear using the badge of an officer who called in sick and then proceeded to dole out harsh punishments for protesters.This is the sort of thing we dread and must be vigilant in monitoring.Perhaps this case was a reaction to escalating violence that precipitated harsher and harsher responses from law enforcement. Is it possible many people were in danger and these guys were called in as the heavies?Where did Bulger and Flemmi learn such alleged brutality? Have their families been punished simply for being their family? Were Flemmi and Bulger and Mercurio preselected from early on in their lives?

What does the handling of informants in the case tell us about how the Justice Dept and the general public view them?It seems that the roles Flemmi and Bulger and Mercurio played were extremely risky and without the backup of normal law enforcement support. It may also be that these guys were processed in security clearances areas and that once this happened their prospects of legitimate work in industry were jeopardized.

Weeks later the man was seen driving a phone company truck and moved out immediately afterwards.But not before being seen laying cables from his apartment to the one across the hall.Barry Mawn, formerly of a Tennessee FBI office,was newly assigned Boston SAC. 'X',attending Northeastern University,suddenly began having problems with some instructors who appeared to have an unknown hostility to 'X'.Northeastern is where Agent Morris and R.Robert Popeo had affiliation. In addition to having many.many problems with his phones,'X' began courting malice from a group of 10(10 is the number of alleged secret witnesses against Whitey)who used threats and intimidation and coercion to keep the man constantly in fear and blamed him for \\"what is going on..\\" in the Bulger case. Since all of this,the man has been destroyed completely financially and careerwise and questions have been raised if FBI personnel have been monitoring the man and interfering with employment and communications as well as assuring financial destruction(like a state trooper was by Bulger).The man went to the Justice Department to seek help and was blown off by the Justice Management division while taps and traces by local police were ineffective against the hostile calls.Additionally, the man repeatedly got daily blank phone messages from a phone linked to MBNA offices in Florida, where Paul Rico lived and which corporation Louis Freeh later became a senior Vice President of.Since ,Trooper Foley, the champion in this case, has retired, the Government Reform hearings are closed, and there seems to be no one who can hold the FBI accountable."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"No one has brought up the possibility that Bulger or some other principles in this case might have had children and perhaps an arrangement was made between Bulger or the affected parties and the government but Bulger or others learned that the children had been given a life of misery and contempt,perhaps abused abandoned or neglected and that the whole plan for their roles as informants may have been based on a lie. What if children were held hostage or deliberately placed in harm's way to control players in this case?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"I enjoyed this and learned a lot. Perhaps the only thing more interesting than the case itself might be what the life of a child of Whitey Bulger might have been like. While Flemmi and Bulger were considered gangsters only, if it was known Bulger had children, then those reating the child well might be said to be sympathetic to the Bulger gangster persona. Then when it was revealed Bulger and Flemmi worked for the FBI,those who had treated Bulger's children badly would realize their mistake and the gangster-friendly people might suddenly hate the children. If Burton wants to understand this case fully in his committee he should locate if Bulger had children, offer them protection and interview them. It might just be that additional victims in the form of children used as bait can be found."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In 1995, when Bulger fled, there was a man who was old enough to be Bulger's son who suddenly seemed to become a target. The man's medical records became unavailable right back to birth, and longtime associates the man knew for decades with strong ties back to the Boston area began getting hostile to this person as well as anxious about the Bulger case fallout in sync.It was as if this person had ties to the Bulger case unknown to them but which was known by these older individuals with roots to Boston prior to the ascent of these guys.The key to this whole case might be if Bulger had children and how those children have been dealt with. If Dan Burton can locate and interview exhaustively this man,then Bulger might be more understandable.Could a child of Bulger's have been put under witness protection or the US Marshall's service and not even know it?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book --which I am in the process of reading-- takes on a classic problem involving police informants. Sometimes, the &quot;snitch&quot; gains the upper hand in his or her relationship with the law enforcement agency involved. This is precisely what happened in the Bulger case. Except it wasn't just a situation with one policeman crossing the line but a group of them. And the misconduct went beyond the ordinary to the point where the tail was quite literally wagging the dog.So far, my impression of &quot;Black Mass&quot; is very favorable. It appears meticulously researched and is written in an easy to read style. My one complaint is that the biographical details on Bulger are a little sketchy in places. Specifically, the authors only briefly mention what Bulger did before he got out of prison. I would have found it useful to know more about what he was doing while &quot;in the can&quot; and before.Yet I'd rather have less biographical details from that period than too many (which is a mistake some authors make --overwhelming their readers with a crushing amount of trivia)."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Interesting journalistic account of the Bulger Mob and its connections to the government.

The authors are more than qualified to write on the topic, as they have followed the story as it happened in the Boston Globe.

My love for Martin Scorsese's classic is what made me purchase this book though. I had originally read that The Departed was a remake of a Chinese film about a criminal police infiltrator and a police informer. No other references were made at the time (at least with the reviews I read). Black Mass is the true story of South Boston and the way in which two criminals--Bulger and Steve Flemmi--corrupted completely two members of the FBI along with several other fellow travelling agents. The book is riveting and when I finished it I was left wishing there were another 100 pages to get through."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There have been many books on the subject of James J. \\"Whitey\\" Bulger and his relationship with the FBI. However, this is the best. I read this book many years ago when the scandal was first breaking, and my only complaint after reading it once again recently is that it was written too soon."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"A well written, researched, and tragically true tale of police corruption that looked the other way or even worse, probably helped in murders of over 20 people. At all levels of government, local, state, and federal, sworn law enforcement concealed, tipped off, and covered up as Bulger savagely tortured and murdered numerous people, including young girls who wanted to break away from sexual abusers. FBI agents partied with Bulger, scared off witnesses, and falsified the record going so far as let innocent people rot for crimes. Bulger was promoted as a 'hero' who kept drugs and crime out of his neighborhood - ignoring the fact Bulger was terrorizing, extorting, and sexually assaulting almost directly in front of law enforcement. At the end, the reader wonders why extremely few of these enablers came to trial, where the others are now and if the FBI is really looking for Whitey Bulger. Great read, I think it's enhanced by reading the Howie Carr book,The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century. The Black Mass authors seem to imply some good in law enforcement at the start while Carr takes a much harsher view. As an example, when the Rakes family built up a liquor market from scratch, Bulger and his thugs simultaneously assaulted husband and wife at different locations, threatened them in front of their children and threatened their children in front of them. Bulger forced them to give him the market. The Rakes went to an uncle who was a local cop and there Black Mass and Howie Carr split. Black Mass says the uncle cop went to the FBI and was waved off while Carr implies the uncle immediately informed Whitey. In both tales, the Rakes immediately found out that the law wasn't their friend as Whitey became even more abusive and violent toward them. Carr adds that the uncle was convicted and sent to prison for other corruption just a few months later. Black Mass seems to cover these details much less. It'd be a five but for issues like that.Good book, great read, highly reccommend it, will make you both sick and angry."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"This book was written by the same New England journalist team that wrote The Underboss and is a supplement to that book.After reading it you'll see why Whitey Bulger is right at the top of the FBI's most wanted list.The more appalling theme of the book however is the complete criminal corruption of a number of FBI agents by the Irish mob.Two FBI agents in particular John Connally and John Morris,who were the FBI heroes in the book The Underboss are the archvillains in Black Mass.The book is highly readable and well researched.Apparently the Irish mob had a criminal \\"cakewalk\\" for over 30 years in Boston. The reason:the FBI monomaniacally focused its attention on bringing down the Italian Mafia and used the Irish mob to do it. Unfortunately the Irish Mob was as dangerous as the Italian Mob.Connally and Morris continually overlooked,promoted,and refused to even acknowledge the criminal activity of the Irish mob under Jim Bulger.According to the book,the information gained on the Italian Mafia by Jim Bulger was not even that significant.The FBI even provided the Irish mob with info that resulted in the murder of a few state witnesses by the Bulger murder crew.The last part of the book has Bulgers' criminal associate Steve Flemmi,turning states evidence to save his hide.The FBI plainly let this investigation \\"snowball\\" out of control accompanied with \\"all the trimmins\\",entrapment,murder,etc. I was reading in another book about the same subject that there are still victim lawsuits in the works from this mess."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"The scene is Boston, starting in the 1970s. The FBI has made it a top priority to clamp down on organized crime (in this case, the Mafia, populated by the Italians of North Boston). John Connolly, a very young FBI agent, is called to the Boston office to work in the Organized Crime unit. The idea was that if he could find someone to rat out the Italians, the FBI's job would be made much easier. Connolly begins to cultivate James (Whitey) Bulger, a former acquaintance from Connolly's old neighborhood in South Boston. Bulger was a career criminal, beginning his future occupation as a young boy, and he and one of his associates, Steve Flemmi, had ties to the Italian mob in Boston. Whitey was also part of a gang in Southie. He became an informant for the FBI, and in return, he was given protection by the FBI. His information was very helpful and did help to put away some of the Mafia guys, but in the meantime, he also gave info on anyone in South Boston that he considered might be standing in his own way as he rose up through the ranks of the criminal underworld. The authors, Lehr and O'Neill, used a variety of first-hand sources to not only write this book, but to break the entire story in the Boston Globe. What they examine here is basically the true cost of the information provided by Bulger. While he's giving them good information, he's also being allowed to literally get away with murder. I won't go further into this book, but I picked it up the other night and could hardly put it down once I started. I guarantee you that if you have an interest in organized crime, this is a no-miss story. I would like to say that I was appalled by the sheer abuse of power from members of an institution created to protect the American public, but frankly, it's getting harder and harder to be surprised any more. Very well written and very taut; I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in organized crime, the FBI, in the so-called Irish Mob in the United States or in true crime in general."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Just could't put it down.

Being Irish and growing up in the same neighbourhood built a stronger bond that what side on the law they were working for. The FBI detective John Connolly and the people around him managed to include the fearsome leader as an informant to get information on the Italian mob, and in return keep him informed and sheltered from the police/authorities. The authors (Boston Globe reporters) managed to uncover this unbelievable and compelling story. The book is well written and keeps up the excitment from start to finish."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In the 2-3 years following Whitey's disappearance, a man became subject to harassment of all sorts. In addition to car tampering, phone surveillance and tampering,pretense bogus job interviews (interviews staged to gather information where the subject does not know they are being investigated nor why) and the like,here are some other things which happened:1) At 3 separate video stores, whenever the man used the drop box to return movies or DVDs,the movies mysteriously disappeared, causing a liability against the account and casting a pallor on the man. The first time it happened the store was owned by a supporter of Governor Paul Cellucci. During this time the man was being followed everywhere by a man who claimed to know what banking transactions he had made, where he ate and exactly what movies were rented. Eventually, when confronted as to whether this man was with the FBI and if he had been under investigation, the man neither confirmed nor denied it.The man had befriended this man as a congenial coworker from the same town,setting the stage for the pretense. At the first video store a clerk working there denied revealing rnetal records. Two years later the man rented from another store, dropped them in the box and this same clerk from the OTHER store was receiving them. Later the man found out the movies disappeared and his account was never credited. The man had no criminal history nor known ties to the Bulger case but a great deal of harassment blaming him for the Bulger case came down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"There is a man referred to obliquely in the prior reviews who has been seriously affected by all of this and essentially left for dead if you will. The man was bounced around as a child overseen by state authorities contracting to nonprofit firms employing former federal officials. One of the state officials charged with guardianship of the boy went by the same name as a female FBI agent listed in Black Mass by O'Neill and Lehr. Another woman charged with guardianship of the boy ran a hard labor camp for juveniles in trouble with the law, where breaking granite boulders with sledgehammers was the norm as was poor food,inadequate rest and mandatory employment where this woman demanding oversight of the teen's paychecks.At the hard labor camp, which was tacitly approved by state social workers and caretakers,local police and allegedly state police, the boy was forced to work 12-15 hour days, often 7-14 days without showers, little sleep and poor quality meals in addition to constant threats of violence, being locked up by state officials or state police and having all of his personal belongings confiscated-- the boy had been sent to this program simply because he had no family or other supports and had NO trouble with the law prior to being put there. The woman in charge of the program possessed the same name as a major manufacturing firm located in southern New Hampshire. This placement was overseen by the state official bearing the same name as the female FBI agent. Some 15-20 years later, this woman re-emerged in the man's life as a girlfriend of a coworker.This same man was befriended as a boy by a couple with indirect alleged links to George Cashman and former Governor Cellucci. When this case broke, the couple disavowed the man.Susan Kelly in her book also discussed the possibility that the early stages of the Boston Strangler murders may have been linked to gangland violence in the wars around which Flemmi emerged. A woman is said to have survived the Strangler but was never interviewed. Is it possible the Boston Strangler in turn is linked to this case ,got a woman pregnant, and the child was used as some sort of collateral for cooperation of the real Strangler?At the same time, Jonathan Harr released his book 'A Civil Action' just after Whitey fled town. When the book came out, the man worked for Grace Co.,unaware of his past as a very young,sick and handicapped boy growing up in the chaos of an environmental tragedy in Woburn,Mass. The fervor surrounding Harr's work appeared in sync with the tepid waters of the Bulger case, and during the early phases of the hearings, Robert Redford and Sylvester Stallone appeared in a Somerville court for ambiguous reasons regarding the Bulger case. Prior to Harr's work, the man had written an autobiographical work of his own which touched upon memories of a sick child in Woburn during the emergence of the cancer epidemic.As the Bulger case broiled, Barry Mawn, native of Woburn, was assigned to the Boston FBI office in pursuit of Bulger- Mawn, Teddy Roosevelt to Cuba, Mawn to Woburn. Many of the Bulger case principals had indirect ties to Woburn and surrounding communities.In addition to all of this, the man's medical records began disappearing, and employment became all but impossible as he was destroyed financially, just as the state trooper who stopped Whitey at Logan airport.Evidence of phone tampering emerged possibly using off premise extensions linked to major companies the man worked for which also did business with the federal government. The man's bank records and video rentals have been scrupulously monitored and broad evidence of a long term evidence gathering investigation of an individual with no history of criminal activity or breaking the law. It seems feasible the man is linked to the Bulger case and has been watched by various agencies who feel threatened by his father, a man unknown to the boy growing up or as an adult.One thing a government oversight or other committee might investigate is the possibility that one of the principals in the Bulger case on either side had a son who was immediately flagged and watched all of his life and used as surety without his knowledge by the government or perhaps even organized crime. The committee might offer protection and encourage that individual to come forward and disclose all they know."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"In this case you have a number of political considerations in the context in which this case mushroomed.Governor Paul Cellucci, a supporter of George Bush,Jr., received widespread state police support and support from Fleet Bank. Joe Malone received support from Fidelity, Scott Harshbarger the investment sector. The state police and DEA in this book are noted as being hampered in their investigations of Bulger while in the recent past state police leaks have been detected to Bulger. State Senator James Jajuga,a Democrat and former state trooper, pledged support to Paul Cellucci, a Republican, garnering local Democrat party dissent.FBI agents have been alleged to receive appliances (perhaps appliance repair services also) and numerous other perks courtesy of Connolly and Bulger. John McIntyre,an Army veteran was killed..was the Defense Investigative Service brought in? Bulger had a relationship with the CIA but it is unclear if that relationship ever ended.While Bulger remains at large, his brother has had his phone tapped, his sister faces an upward battle for lottery winnings, Kevin Weeks has implicated Bulger in a number of murders and is able to retain lottery winnings, Flemmi has been sequestered for years with no trial, Salemme and others pleaded out to break the gridlock and limbo in jail, some of the murder victim families are filing multimillion dollar lawsuits with upwards of half a dozen former FBI agents and the informant's families brought into the mix. Angiulo is said to have ordered a hit on Deegan which Salvati and Limone served 3.5 decades of prison time for where agent Rico, who trained Connolly, had allegedly forwarded knowledge of the hit on to Hoover where it was ignored.

You judge for yourself...1) Not long before this case became a media event, the man ('ManX' we'll call him) had a lengthy news story printewd about his search for his unknown father. Whitey disappeared and all hell broke loose in this man's life.2) The man had a brother born by a different name who then changed his name to this ManX's last name.Around this time another man appeared bearing the same name as ManX and who seemd to be living a parallel life intertwined with ManX,as if creating an alter ego for ManX.Over the next 20 years, this alter ego would cross paths with ManX from time to time,with the imposter using ManX as a fallguy.At one point the imposter went AWOL claiming he was ManX from the army.ManX was not in the military.Could any of this have involved friends of Flemmi in the military?3) ManX was in the custody of the courts when Bulger was officially signed on to Top Echelon.At this point new individuals were introduced to the boy as positive influences. Things went well although these new influences kept a distance and frequently filed reports on their interaction with the boy. When Bulger fled in 1995 these same individuals suddenly turned their backs on ManX and even used false names when contact was attempted.It was later revealed that some of these individuals might be tied to influential parties linked to George Cashman of the Teamsters.ManX knew none of this. All ManX knew was that these people had shown him kindness.4) ManX became a target for numerous individuals claiming affiliation with the Justice Dept. or FBI without being asked about this. The result was that ManX became all but totally unemployable.It was as if ManX was either being targeted by individuals with the FBI/DOJ, supporters of such employees or individuals with another agenda trying to make out a link with the FBI/DOJ.5) There was increased evidence of possible documentary sanitation with respect to ManX's upbringing at an accelerated pace when this case bubbled up in the media.ManX wrote an autobiography and this appeared to stir up serious concern.6) Since the case emerged in 1995,ManX has been almost completely without health insurance,kept in poverty and been maneuvered into bankruptcy,homelessness and much more. It is as if an attempt to destroy the man financially,spiritually and emotionally has been underway ever since Bulger fled, just like what happened to the state trooper at Logan airport who crossed Bulger once.7) The man had as caretakers of various kinds at least 2-3 people with the same names as FBI personnel in this case.8) Could ManX be the child of a principal in this case with the plan of turning ManX into an informant to replace Flemmi and Bulger and something went wrong,so incurring the wrath of the DOJ?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal","review":"Bulger has been affiliated with former Governor Mike Dukakis of Northeastern University and Amtrak.

It is remarkable that a transmission in a translated text over a thousand years old can be so profound.

Start here and come back to it again and again until you can't miss it."},{"Title":"The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind","review":"Huang-po, teacher of Lin-chi and possibly a student of Ma-tsu, was one of the seminal figures in Zen. He was exceptionally tall for his day, and one day he visited Master Nan-ch'&uuml;an wearing a large hat. Nan-ch'&uuml;an said: \\"You're so tall already, how come you have to wear such a big hat?\\"Huang-po relied, \\"Well, it contains so many galaxies\\".What makes this book so special is that Huang-po doesn't use the dazzling shock-tactics of later Zen Masters, those \\"strange words and extraordinary actions\\" perfected by Chao-chou, which form such a large part of our image of Zen. He teaches explicitly and directly. Contrary to the often repeated claim that Zen has no doctrines, no philosophy, his teachings are identical to those of earlier Mind-Only schools of Buddhism.Nothing exists but boundless Nondual Mind, in which there is no subject or object, no self or other, no part or whole, no inside or outside, no before or after, no far or near. What makes this Zen is Huang-po's insistence that if we accept this idea intellectually and add it to our stock of concepts, it becomes an obstacle. We should have no thought of true or false, being or non-being; we should take a single leap, abandoning everything but the sole reality of Mind. If we can't manage that, we should spend every moment shedding attachments, ending the concept-forming habits of our (limited) mind.This book was first published in 1958 by John Blofeld, a pioneering Western Buddhist who left a memoir of his colourful and not always strictly Buddhist life, \\"City of Lingering Splendour.\\" He writes graceful old-fashioned English which is miles away from the stylised colloquial of somebody like Thomas Cleary. Wordings can differ. Instead of \\"See your Original Face before your parents were born\\", we read, \\"Return to what you were before your parents were born\\". Tatht, often translated Suchness, here becomes Thusness.Fifty years old, this is one of a handful of indispensable Zen classics."},{"Title":"The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind","review":"The introduction to this book is a good overview and introduction to Zen for beginners.The notes provided by the translator are very erudite and helpful.This is an awsome text from a very enlightened Master.

Avoiding dualism and concentrating on immediacy, the Master says, reveals the path to follow the Way. This approach to \\"Reality\\" will be very foreign to the uninitiated Western mind. The book deserves to be read several times to allow its meaning to unfold."},{"Title":"The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind","review":"This little book has a lot of wisdom.

I practiced Zen for years, and have read all the \\"classics\\"--Zen Mind, Beginners Mind, The Three Pillars of Zen, The Diamond Sutra and the Sutra of Hui Neng, et al--and dozens of other texts on the subject by authors such as Alan Watts, D.T Suzuki, and Thomas Cleary. But none of these authors/ books provides the non-stop barrage of brilliant, pithy wisdom that Zen master Huang Po does.I still retain many of Huang Po's classic statements in my mind. My favorite is: \\"There's never been a single thing; then where's defiling dust to cling? If you can understand the gist of this, why talk of transcendental bliss?\\" And when people ask me, \\"What's happening?\\" I typically respond with Huang Po's \\"only the spontaneously arising Absolute.\\"Although I'm now a spiritual teacher, and emphasize Hindu Kashmir Shaivism, Christian Hermeticism, and Tibetan Dzogchen more than I do Zen, I still strongly recommend The Zen Teaching of Huang Po to my students.

Huang Po's discourses (and the Wan Ling record) remain some the most lucid expositions of Zen. They were delivered when the Zen tradition was still fresh. Huang po's 'sermons' were addressed to practising Buddhists. They presuppose that you are 'looking' into the meaning hinted at - the 'MIND' - which is neither 'yours' nor 'mine' - and in that sense 'VOID' - yetembraces everything in the phenomenal universe.Zen is sometimes regarded as an 'obscure' doctrine, but Huang P'o sermons have a refreshing sense of focus. Skirting the boundaries of what is virtually indescribable, he necessarily ends up uttering paradoxes - sometimes paradox -within-paradox, within paradox - and yet, in such a way that it actually brings focus, 'jiggling' the mind out of its habitual tendency to cling to dualities and contraries. In short, it resumes its inherent condition. We don't 'do' it - 'IT' does itself. All we have to do - is to get out of the way.Thus, Huang P'o's 'direct pointing to the Mind.'This is Zen as it was originally taught, before all the wrangling about 'fixed koans' and answers - or getting stuck with 'just sitting.'Huang P'o speaks with unshakeable conviction that we can AWAKEN RIGHT NOW - if we look into what he is saying. He doesn't want to tie anyone up. It has to be 'your own thing' - nobody else can do it for you. This is squeaky clean Dharma!P.S Besides the Huang-Po material, Blofeld also translatedHui-hai's 'Treatise on Entering the Gate to SuddenEnlightenment.' Between them, these two Zen 'sermons'represent some of most lucid expositions of Zen - everset down in writing. They posess astonishing focus andcompression, without a wasted word."},{"Title":"The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind","review":"Huang Po (d. 850) is perhaps one of Zen Buddhism's most brilliant Zen masters.

However, upon reading Red Pine's Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma I immediately returned it and bought another copy of Huang Po as a backup. I did not have a problem with Bodhidharma's teachings as much as I simply felt that Huang Po explained the One Mind in a way that resonated clearer with me. Both Bodhidharma and Huang Po taught naught but the One Mind, so neither will lead you astray. I gave away all of my other Zen books when I read Huang Po.

On the Map of Consciousness he devised, he calibrated Huang Po in the 900's which is extremely high on a scale ranging from 1-1000. Only the World Teachers like Buddha, Christ, Krishna, Zoroaster etc. calibrated higher. Although Zen has much in common with the nondualistic teachings of Advaita, the Teachings are, well, Zen! I can not begin to recommend this book highly enough for students ready to pierce the unadulterated Truth beyond words that comes with the tacit Understanding of One Mind or Universal Mind. Lying beyond the concepts of intellect, the wordless Transmission of Mind to Mind comes through the text of this book and teachings.

Overall however, Knutsen's book is well written and even though it does address a serious topic in the realm of political science and international relations, he does make it so that the average person can read it and understand it.

Gilson in the manner of detective and psychologist, as well as historian, attempts to deal out justice as well as look inside people's hearts, and discover their true intents (which he admits in the end, God only knows). The true story of Heloise's love for Abelard is one of the most endearing ever told and something that many medievalists tinker around with (including Heiko Oberman) Abelard was on superstar status, in his day, as a professor of theology and philosophy in age where students had much more leeway to choose their teachers and professors were paid by the number of students they had; Abelard was so popular he had to hold classes outside. Part history, part philosophy (or history of philosophy), and Gilson takes some liberties at psychologizing a bit. If you like Umberto Eco you might like this book as well, but read about them on the internet or in an encyclopedia before you start, if you know nothing about them, as Gilson gets right into the detectiving with little background details. There are all kinds of devious and/or devoted monks that Abelard must contend with, like the monks in Umberto Eco's stories.Favorite quotes, from the book:\\"Their appeal (Heloise and Abelard's) is to a system of ethics which separates the order of acts from the order of intensions(65).\\"\\"They both played the comedy of sanctity(53).\\"\\"What is a husband but a domesticated beast of burden\\"(31, Gilson quoting Theophratus).Some interesting words on marriage, death, love, loyalty, wisdom, sorrow, and providence are also expounded on. Gilson (despite Heiko Oberman in his book \\"Dawn of the Reformation\\" placed Gilson, with the name of Arnold Toynbee, as an arbitrary period in history making sophist) clearly states, in the last chapter, that separating the medieval times with the Renaissance -- especially given what huge a word renaissance entails and the disparaging implications for the time previous -- points out the silliness of such a word as Abelard and, especially, Heloise have many \\"Renaissance\\" charatoristics despite belonging to the Medieval age.Some of the writing is superfluous, as Gilson repeats himself longwindedly. Also Gilson seems to be inconsistent in the final pronouncement upon whether Abelard submitted his soul's salvation to Heloise's prayers or the joy of sacrifice to God."},{"Title":"The Wonders of Life a Complete Program in Life Science 12 Folios","review":"These books are magnificient!

This computer game however differs far from Noah's Ark by Nintendo, and other such games. The storyline is this: Several Christians have been captured by the roman guard, and it is up to you to save them. The twist? some doors are locked, and there are several foes to fight, including possessed Roman Centurions, and demons. But, you have an arsenal to help you, as a friendly angel visits you from time to time, giving you your weapon, and your weapon upgrades. Each one of course, grows more powerful. Here my list of the good, the bad, and the weird.Good: Your sword actually makes some really cool laser-type beams when you shoot it at something. Also, the fighting effects are actually pretty good. The graphics are pretty good too. It keeps things looking more real.Bad (for some, not all.): Even though your sword, or relic, whatever you are carrying at the time, makes a great spiritual weapon, if your into blood and gore, you wont find it here. Also, converted centurions can get in the way of movements, and the worlds are actually a bit small. Making it less confusing, but at the same time, if your a seasoned pro, you'll be done with this game rather quickly. However, it is fun just to play over and over to see how fast you can convert.Weird: This isnt necessarily bad or good, but the demons have a sort of \\"muppet\\" quality, putting them on a strange border between stuffed animal and gruesome gargoyle. Actually, the more powerful demons first encountered on level 3 have a sort of riverdance quality that makes it funny to watch.This is actually a very good game, and parents, this is very clean, and the rejuvinating health powerups are bible verses. However, I would not recommend this game for any one who is not a Christian, and would find all of this a bit preachy.Hint: When battling the lion after the third level, switch to the gold sword and dont stop shooting!1 Corinthians 13"},{"Title":"Catechumen Game Cdrom","review":"Catechumen is a great game. But it could be better. You shouldn't freeze when you are attacked and once you hit a guard they should repent instead of hitting them multiple times. All around it is a good game for Christians or people who would like to learn more about Christianity. It is suspenseful. A good game for horror lovers."},{"Title":"Knopf Guide: Egypt (Knopf Guides)","review":"I am always happy when the next trip I am planning is a destination that has a Knopf Guide associated with it.So, I was thrilled that it was time to add \\"Egypt\\" to my growing collection, which now includes nine of these guides.They are wonderful while planning the trip, a perfect size to take along and lovely to have as reference after the voyage.

I was able to travel all over the country and this was virtually the only printed guide I used. (One exception--I bought the specific guide for the Egyptian Museum from their gift shop.) As some users have noted, this doesn't necessarily provide the broadest coverage of hotels and restaurants, but as a one volume resource on travel, history, art, religion, language, literature, cuisine and many other interesting facts, this can't be beat. It's easy to carry in a small bag, purse or just stuffed in a large pocket. Think of it as a nice supplement to the travel maps and hotel brochures that travel nicely without the heft of some of the other travel guides. Even though I returned over two years ago, I still pull out my Knopf Egypt guide and just thumb through it at home. It's lavishly illustrated, very thoughtfully laid out and has thorough indices and cross references to help you find anything. I always get a Knopf guide for whatever country I happen to be in (the guides for The Holy Land, Morocco, and Ireland just to name a few).

I was hooked by the sample offered by Kindle. Maier is really telling his life story in the character of Rudi Mauser, a B-52 pilot. The story is more told than spoken by the characters. Maier has a great writer's voice and this tale is indeed in the telling. As Rudi's life is followed from upstate New York, to the National Guard during the Korean War, to Aviation Cadet training, B-47s and then B-52s, he has terrific adventures and does very well with the ladies. Maier puts all of this against a telling of what the Air Force and the Strategic Air Command were like back then, and why. He has found just the right touch in this regard. B*U*F*F is not a text book or a history lesson, but it is all there along with some very cool stories of flying incidents that must be true. You'll never again wonder what it was like to fly an endless nuclear mission in a B-52, to spend in a week in a molehole, or to fly in a B-52 against the enemy in Vietnam from Guam, Okinawa or Thailand. I think the book is self-published. Congratulations to the author for great job."},{"Title":"B*U*F*F (Big Ugly Fat F*****)","review":"This is one thoroughly enjoyable read. Although non-fiction, it is pretty darn close to the real life events of your B-52 bomber crew as they make their way out of crew training through ARC Light missions in Vietnam. The author is a former BUF driver and it is pretty evident that he takes his reading audience down his own memory lane. In fact, this book is probably non-fiction, with certain parts embellished to make it look like fiction (the womanizing, drinking, and the crew's shootdown at the end). However, the embellished parts really were full of humor and had a sense of sobriety to them when viewed from the strains of flying that affected this crew. Levity in the face of adversity! The author has managed to write 400 pages without any speedbumps in the book; each chapter was as energetic as its previous one. In other words...this was an enjoyable read and hard to put down.I was attracted to this book to learn about my Dad's service in the B-47 and B-52. He also did the same stuff as the author (flew B-47's at Castle, transitioned to B-52's at Castle, and flew Arc Light from Kadena). This book exceeded my expectations. The humor, emotion, and technical aspects of the daily life of a crew are all laid out here although some activities are tongue-in-cheek. The author is a great wordsmith and writes in a very active style that makes for an enjoyable read. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in SAC and the Vietnam War, and the B-52!"},{"Title":"B*U*F*F (Big Ugly Fat F*****)","review":"This book really brought back some memories having flown B-52s 1966-86, including 221 ArcLight missions.

Still, this book might lead to some checking out his work. Who knows, maybe one day I'll join that group. There are quite a lot of big names mentioned. Others may not be familar to most people. But Mr. Berman shares the human side of sports. Players, managers, and journalists get praised and criticized. There are many photos. Scattered through these pages are various not-so great moments. Many were featured on his Spanning The World segment. His day as commish of sports would involve a lot of changes.At times he gets serious. How do you talk about sports scores after a President resigns? What about games cancelled after 9/11? Don't forget the issue of race. I wanted to give this book 4 1/2 stars. There are some occasional bad words. I caught one definite goof. Mr. Berman got criticized when he suggested having America The Beautiful at sporting events.

Tom is trying to cope with the possible break-up of his marriage when he is visited by a figure from his past, Danny Miller. More than a decade earlier, Tom testified in court that Danny understood the difference between right and wrong and therefore was fit to stand trial as an adult. In the electrifying opening chapter, Tom meets the adult Danny, and is subsequently forced to consider the extent to which he may have contributed to Danny's problems.The book explores themes including trust, betrayal, what we owe to other human beings, and the consequences of our actions. The title has multiple layers of meaning, but clearly one of the borders that fascinates Barker here, as it did in the _Regeneration_ trilogy, is the border between psychologist and patient. How much of a barrier should Tom draw between himself and Danny? What are the consequences if Danny crosses that border? Is there a danger in being too close to someone like Danny, even if one has the best of intentions? Finally, how different is Tom from Danny? Is there a little bit of cruelty in all children, all people?Although this novel touches on a hot button issue--children and punishment--it steadfastly resists plot cliches. Danny Miller is a complex, enigmatic, intelligent, untrustworthy, yet at times movingly vulnerable character. The novel is all the stronger for refusing to reduce him to the role of either victim or monster."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Ms. Pat Barker has written some wonderful books. Many consider her, \\"Regeneration Trilogy\\", her best work, and it was the most enjoyable work of hers for me as well. Her newest work, \\"Border Crossing\\", was frustrating as it appeared weak only to become very intriguing, however in the end it did not rise to the level of her other works.The book opens with an event that is so unlikely as to seem absurd. Ms. Barker then does a wonderful job of providing the justification for this act and uses it to stage the continuation of a relationship ended 13 years previously. She develops great tension as to the ethical choices a doctor must make, and reconstructs the years of incarceration of a juvenile murderer that is unnerving and populated with some of the best characters she has created.As she has done in the past, she creates and resolves a great many issues in the relatively brief span of 215 pages. When the read is complete the story and some of its elements are not. Critical issues that are seemingly the justification for revaluating the past are brought to the very edge of revelation and then dropped. There is no resolution of the story just a repetition of the original placement of an individual in new circumstances. The story could easily be continued and perhaps that is what she has in mind. I certainly hope this is the case as she has created at least 2 characters that are excellent, one of whom could be the darkest creation of her writing to date."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"This is an easy, compelling read from start to finish. Engaging characters, take you through the story of a boy murder ( or is he) and that of his psychologist. At the time the author makes one thinks about wider issues, of capacity, morality, and moral responsility. When someone serves time in prison, what is a good outcome, what should we expect from them and from those around them. If these themes sound a little heavy - worry not, Barkers fluent style and ability to keep us guessing, mean that you wont want to put this book down."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Danny Miller commits murder at age 10 and was convicted by the help of the man that saves his life 13 years later. Therapist Tomy Seymour, who testified at Miller's trial, saves Miller from drowning in the opening scenes and spends the rest of the novel figuring out what exactly happened so many years ago.Barker paints a stunning portrait inside the mind of a child murderer, who manipulates every person who tries to help him, especially Seymour. The shirnk re-interviews those close to Miller immediately after he is sent to prison, and the tension builds in a series of therapy sessions he has with Miller.While the climax and the ending were deflating and seem to make the whole exercise a sham and setup by Miller, Barker's writing carries the day and makes this a sensational read."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"A man who committed a murder when only a young boy (Danny) is released from prison and encounters the child psychologist (Tom) whose testimony was crucial in having him convicted. Their ongoing relationship and the events taking place in the child psychologists life form the basis for this novel. What is fascinating about it is the thought processes we hear running through Tom's head as he questions his own previous judgement, not just with Danny but also with Lauren (Tom's wife). Barker has very cleverly not tried to put us inside Danny's head (an altogether difficult exercise, surely?) but allowed us to experience Tom's confusion over the limited information that Danny allows himself to reveal. I was in doubt about how things would end right up to the final page. The author doesn't try to answer all the questions (which obviously proves frustrating for some reviewers), keeping the novel at a managable length, but raises enough to keep me thinking about the issues for a long time. Once I started reading I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Criminal psychologist Tom is out for a walk with his wife, Lauren, when he happens upon a young man attempting suicide. Tom saves his life, and later recognizes who is,improbably the boy he was once called upon to evaluate after the child committed an act of murder some years ago. Tom begins meeting with Danny, who has been released on parole and finds himself at loose ends. In exploring the events leading up to the murder, Tom finds himself reevaluating his previous testimony and grappling with the question of nature or nurture. At the same time, he must come to terms with his own crumbling marriage. \\"Border Crossing\\" examines the makeup of a criminal and explores the possibility of redemption."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"To be haunted by the ghost of someone dead is a disconcerting enough experience, but the ramifications of a haunting by the living are far more immediate and potentially devastating. Tom Seymour, the protaganist of Pat Barker's nuanced novel &quot;Border Crossing&quot; is a renowned psychologist with a failing marriage whose past comes back to him when he rescues a former patient from a possible suicide attempt. But even as he drags the young man half-dead from the ocean, the questions bubble to the surface. Was this a chance meeting? Or had the patient, whom Tom had treated a decade before as part of the legal team prosecuting a young boy for a brutal murder, come back into his life with some kind of sinister purpose?Answers are elusive as the Tom relives his past, and examines his own culpability in the unravelling of the boy's life. His search for the truth about Danny, a boy who grew to manhood with the shadow of a murder conviction over his head, plays out over the backdrop of Tom's divorce and the questioning of many of the fundamental beliefs of his life. The facts he uncovers, and those he doesn't, give him insight into his own life that seems more necessary than welcome.If mysteries are the most compelling stories, and people the most complex mysteries, than Pat Barker has created a small masterpiece here. The author puts forward Tom's frustration and obsession with subtle skill, as the puzzle of Danny's persona eludes a solution like a Rubik's cube. Each approach to the truth thwarted starts Tom down a different road, one with new, and possibly more dangerous, consequences.For such a small book there's much substance here. The writing is gentle and accessible, evenly paced, graced with subtle and thoughtful innuendo. Barker gives us just enough about Danny in the end, not to think we've answered every question, but to imagine we're asking the right ones."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Border Crossing is the latest in a long line of psychological thrillers to have hit the high-street bookshelves recently and addsfurther weight to the opinion that British writers are in the prime of their literary careers. Having already produced 9 books, Pat Barker demonstrates the rich variety of narratives available with this dangerously realistic tale of a child psychologist and his encounters with one of his former patients.Tom Seymour is the psychologist, recently separated from his wife, who rescues Danny Miller, a notorious child-killer, after he tries to commit suicide by jumping into a river. As their relationship begins to develop and Danny takes Tom further into his confidence, it is apparent that there is something dangerous at work within Miller's mind. When Seymour gave evidence atDanny's trial he declared him highly disturbed but years later he begins to question this decision, realising there is a fine linebetween calculating genius and outright madness.As Tom becomes further entwined into the 'confessional' Danny is determined to give him the local news agencies are informedthat a child-murderer is living in the local area. With the media creating an intense witch-hunt and vigilantes prowling the streets,Miller must flee but Seymour is left with a decision that could affect far more than his professional status.A simply sensational novel, Border Crossing captures the scenes of fear, anger and bewilderment immaculately, maintaining abreath-taking tempo and capturing the reader's attention, refusing to release it before the final page is turned."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"When child psychologist Tom Seymour pulls a would-be suicide from a river, he recognises the young man as Danny Miller, the child whom Tom's assessment had helped imprison for the brutal murder of an old woman thirteen years ago. Now out of prison and supposedly starting a new life, Danny has hunted Tom down in the hope that he might be able to help him understand the killing. With his own life troubled and his marriage collapsing, Tom succumbs to the temptation to travel into Danny's past.The problem is that what he finds there is not particularly riveting, and certainly not unusual enough to account for an act which society regards with horror as completely beyond the boundaries of \\"normality\\". Unlike, say, Peter Shaffer's \\"Equus\\", when Danny finally remembers the murder there is little depth, no sense of climax, no sense of a mystery unravelled, not even much horror. The novel sets up the idea of a journey into the mind of an outcast, the child who kills, but never lives up to what it promises.The second problem is the characterisation. Danny Miller is a pale reworking of Billy Prior, Barker's brilliant creation in \\"Regeneration\\", complete with Prior's unpleasant father, manipulative charm and \\"wintry smile\\", but nowhere near as interesting (especially once you recognise him as Prior). Tom isn't even a shadow of \\"Regeneration\\"'s Dr Rivers, and there is even less substance to the supporting cast, his wife, his colleagues, and the people whose lives Danny has passed through. Although there are hints that there will be trouble between Tom and Danny, since Danny seems to blame Tom for his imprisonment and is renowned for getting people who deal with him to \\"cross the invisible line\\", the relationship barely develops, again being a lack-lustre echo of the intense but still professional relationship between Rivers and Prior.Barker is capable of extraordinary writing, as evidenced in her superb \\"Regeneration\\" trilogy, a remarkable exploration of people who kill and what it does to their psyches. It's a pity that she seems to have been rewriting it ever since."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Tom, a psychologists, is out on a walk with his wife when a man jumps into the near by river in an attempted suicide. Tom dives in after the man and saves his life. Tom finds out after saving the man's life that he was a former patient of his years ago. The former patient, Danny, had committed a murder when he was only a young boy under the age of 10 years olds. Tom then begins counseling Danny again and unraveling what actually happened during the murder. Though while unraveling the mysteries of the past, his own life is also unraveling making everything quit complicated.This is another great novel by Pat Barker. Barker's in depth knowledge of the human mind is very prominent in her writing as always. This book explores a more modern problems which besiege the mind opposed to her other books like her Regeneration series. Barker's writing style is unique and easy to follow along. Yet it offers a more in depth option for those looking for more of a challenge. Her characters are very tangible and likeable or distasted depending on what she wants you feeling about the characters. Though personally I believe her characters are a little to under developed for the most part, but that's just personal taste.The book, Border Crossing, itself is very good. It is not a fast paced or slow methodical book. It was difficult to put down at points while at other points left a great stopping place. It also introduces some difficult to grasp ideas which left my head hurting, especially reading it late at night. The book did not have many sexual scenes which is a nice break from most of our more modern novels which will depict those scenes in great detail. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will probably read it again some time within the next year or so. Border Crossing is a must own for all Pat Barker groupies, fanatics, or those who just plain like her writing. It is also a great novel for those who want to start reading Barker's books. It is good even for those who are looking for something to read, whether it is on the beach, late at night after work, or just for fun. It is one of the better books I have read in my life time."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"I read the synopsis for this book in a &quot;Best of..&quot; book list for 2001. It's described as a psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who saves a man from drowning. The catch is the man he saves was once a client of his who he inadvertently helped send away to a correctional institute because of damaging testimony.Sounds good right? I missed it. I didn't find the book tense at all. Every time it started to work towards something I thought was going to be remotely suspenseful, it petered out. I was really disappointed. In fact about the highest praise I can give it is that at just over two hundred pages it reads like a halfway decent short story. A not terribly exciting short story, but a short story never the less."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Although I have not yet read the much praised Regeneration trilogy, I was knocked out by her early, feminist work exploring the lives of working class women, Union Street and Blow Your House Down.This book just failed to deliver impact or reality, although it attempted to explore interesting issues about child criminals, morality, and the illusive nature of truth and memory. She just didn't seem to put much effort into it. The book seems a mere sketch, and doesn't nearly do justice to the fascinating themes raised. For example, the main character, protagonist, the psychologist, is a completely generic character, so is his wife. It's like maybe because these people were upper middle class, they didn't come to life for the author, so she didn't know how to write them fully. The husband and wife are going through a divorce, but we get no sense of what's at stake, what attracted them to each other, etc, so the whole thing reads like a run of the mill T.V. drama, not a novel. It would have been much more effective if she'd just left this poorly executed material out, and limited the entire work to the tense discussions between Danny, the child criminal, and the shrink, because only these scenes are fully engaging.Well, it just goes to show, you can get away with an awful lot once you've won a couple of major prizes. Shame on her editors, for not urging her to do better. This book could have had a major emotional impact, like so many of her others. As it was, too much of it read like notes for scenes that the author never bothered to write up at all."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"To what extent can a child can be held responsible for their actions?

However whilst wanting to help, Tom's concerned that Danny may be manipulating him as he may have manipulated others in his life.The events that make Danny feel hunted were conveyed well, showing how almost impossible it is to make a new start in our society. I also felt Tom's empathy with Danny was very realistic and honest. He recalls an event from his own childhood that he feels would have ended differently if it weren't for the intervention of an adult. Sometimes we're quick to condemn and forget what being a child was like, how sometimes children can get into situations they don't know how to get out of.Rather than giving us all the answers in neat little story we're encouraged to come to our own conclusions which made for a more interesting read."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Pat Barker has won many awards for her fiction &amp; here it's easy to see why.

Meanwhile, the therapist's personal life is falling to pieces. American bestsellers in the genre of your choice are fun reads.

I have a real problem with four or five pages in the middle of the book when the reader is suddenly in the head of a different character. How come? Was this an editing mistake?

Like Muriel Spark, her prose is always crisp, lucid, eloquent and smooth and for these qualities alone, it is always a pleasure to read anything by her. \\"Border Crossing (BC)\\", her latest novel, serves up cat and mouse styled mind games played between two protagonists with a shared past whose unlikely connection with each other is revealed after a shocking incident that will alter the course of their lives forever. Barker doesn't waste time setting the scene or building up tension. A distracted Tom Seymour, out on a jog with his wife one evening, witnesses a suicide attempt on the river. It takes him seconds to decide to dive after the man to prevent it. Why did Tom risk his life for a stranger ? Was he responding to the dangers of the moment or the pressures of a crumbling marriage ? This is the sort of question we ask ourselves as the story unfolds. Barker proves she's no novice at writing pyschological thrillers. She skillfully keeps us in a state of anxiety and suspense throughout. There's also a palpable smell of danger in the air and a threat of violence that never quite breaks out. As a thriller, BC works because it's highly absorbing and gripping. Pity the novel never quite develops beyond establishing whether or not Danny committed the murder he was convicted for. Or whether Danny is the master of deception those who comes into contact with him say he is. We do get definitive answers to these questions. We even get to observe and make our own judgements about the horror of society's response to juvenile crime and its aftermath. That Barker never used Danny to hold the mirror to his nemesis' soul and allowed us readers to truly get under Tom's skin is something of a disappointment. BC is a wonderfully accomplished novel. It could have been great one had Barker mined its premise for its full potential. I would give this four and a half stars rating if I could. If not, it's closer to five than four stars. One of the best novels to have been published in 2001."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"While psychologist Tom Seymour and his wife were walking alongside the river, trying to find a way to save their marriage, they came across a young man who swallowed a bottle of pills before throwing himself in the water. Barely thinking, Tom dived in to save the man. He later realises that he knows the man he saved as Danny Miller. In fact, it was his expert testimony that helped to convict Danny, who was 10 years old at the time, of murder.So, was it fate or coincidence that their paths should cross again in such dramatic circumstances?It turns out that Danny is very keen to talk to Tom about the crime he was charged and convicted for. He blames Tom for convincing the jury of his guilt. The rest of the book then deals with the circumstances leading up to the murder, what Danny was like as a child and how he dealt with his childhood incarceration.Ultimately, the truth about the murder is revealed. However, the journey towards this destination is not a particularly eventful one. Apart from Danny's admissions towards the end of the book, there was not a lot that grabbed my attention."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"The only other Pat Barker novels I've read were those of the Regeneration trilogy, and it's easy to recognize her style in \\"Border Crossing\\", once again the reader is taken into the intimate relationship between a psychologist and his patient. This one does not have the same scope as the trilogy, really just a novella or extra long short story with only 216 pages, a page turning psychological thriller that's easy to read in a night..One day while walking by a river Tom witnesses an accident and rescues a man from drowning. Coincidentally this man turns out to be Danny, a child murderer now released who once was evaluated by Tom to judge if he was fit to stand trial in an adult court. Tom decides to begin therapy sessions with Danny to help him understand his past, and more questions are raised than answered. Readers that like nice clear cut endings might be disappointed with this, what is good and what is evil are very ambiguous in this story; and certainly will give pause for thought about child criminals, especially children who kill.I gave this a 4 star rating because of the plot line involving his wife - while interesting this was somewhat disconnected from the story. The ending has been left wide open for a sequel and I wouldn't mind hearing what becomes of Danny Miller."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Pat Barker is my kind of writer.She shows great empathy among her characters. The Regeneration trilogy is my favorite . Her works can be a little dark, but she has a gift of raising them with grace."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Admittedly, I chose this book in a rush - I had read about Barker's WWI novels and chose the one set in present day. It sounded intriguing in the description, but I found the premise to be ridiculous and the writing shallow. Additionally, my Kindle copy had all sorts of formatting problems - I don't know how much of the book was missing (I read it in about 5 evenings). There were a lot of sentences cut off in the middle, and paragraphs cut off without punctuation (I don't think the writer was trying to be avant-garde). I never experienced this before with any Kindle book. Overall, not worth the money - too short, too uninteresting, too unbelieveable - plus the formatting problems."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"I have loved this engrossing novel ever since reading the book one year ago (hurrah for Pat Barker). The audiobook format offers new possibilities of enjoying it when hands are busy but brains are not. And, of course James Wilby's voice adds a lot of pleasure. I was going to give it 5 stars, but the only thing spoiling the picture is the audiocassette format - a CD would have been easier to use."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"I'm amazed there are not more reader reviews on Amazon about this superb work. It's very much about the tension between reality and illusion, about manipultaing power. Barker is one of the great storytellers of our age, and she does her job beautifully here, winding the spring of anxiety tighter and tighter until we think everyone might explode. Just read it."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"This book reads like an awesome psychological journey! It brings you through so many emotions, and even after you finish reading it...The charcters stick with you."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"I will admit that I listened to this Audio Book on drive to and from Las Angeles to Los Vegas. I thought it a good chance to be introduced to Pat Barker who seems to get such rave reviews. This is basically a two person character study in the guise of a psychological thriller that is not all that thrilling. I found the store interesting enough and the writing crisp, but thesecondary plot of Tom Seymour and his wife seems lost as she walks out of his life just when he is consumed with this former child patient who returns to extract his revenge. Or does he? I will give this a marginal thumbs up because the two main characters are well written and vivid, with Danny Miller the tormented child murderer an excellent character. But in the end I did not find this very satisfying to listen to and doubt I would have finished it if I had picked it up as a book."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"Pat Barker's portrait of young murderer Danny Miller is nearly flawless. This is a disciplined, tight, wonderfully controlled novel in which Barker's skills include her ability to conjure up powerful images in very few words, flawless dialog &amp; excellent character portraits. A good story is told in a very short space, making it a quick (&amp; difficult to put down) read. There's a cultural issue that might make the novel a bit less credible to U.S. readers: it's true that in Britain young murderers can be released quite quickly &amp; when they are, they are given new identities. So far as I know, this never happens in the U.S. &amp; the prevailing social sentiment would seem to be against it. Actually, though, it's of course a very humane if risky &amp; experimental approach. Barker's novel couldn't be more relevant in Britain at present: two boys (Robert Thompson &amp; Jon Venables) are being released under new identities after being held in custody for the 1993 murder of 2-year-old James Bulger. The issues surrounding their release (threats of violent vengeance, questions of reform, an out-of-control media frenzy) are identical to those surrounding Danny Miller. ... I've spent more than two years working on a non-fiction book about a group of young killers &amp; this included lengthy interviews with several members of the group, including the ringleader, &amp; based on this, Barker's depiction of Danny is brilliant. She must've done considerable &amp; thorough research to have some of the nuances down. ... My only quibble is the idea Danny doesn't remember two key events in the book (I won't spoil it by saying too much) is silly. People can be shocked after committing a serious crime, but I don't personally believe that they are unaware of what they're doing at the time &amp;, more to the point, it isn't convincingly done in the novel. It just comes across as silly the two times Danny zones out. ... Despite that, this is brilliant &amp; a must-read for true crime enthusiasts, those interested in juvenile crime &amp; people pondering issues of punishment, reform, rehabilitation and the ability (or not) to change."},{"Title":"Border Crossing : A Novel","review":"This was a good psychology lesson, but nothing else.

It was alright, but I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite books."},{"Title":"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management (International Computer Science Series)","review":"The book is very wordy, but vague. It should not take 1200 or so pages to explain it's contents. The book does not readily get to the point. The chapters on SQL were very poorly written. The syntax for commands were not adequately explained and were horribly intertwined in the examples, such that it was difficult to derive the real syntax for individual clauses and commands. Chapters on modeling the database via ER and EER were also vague and written very poorly. Examples throughout the book used coincidental values and scenarios that mask out the true nature of the concepts being proposed. The author should have taken the time to put in \\"meaningful\\" examples. The exercises at the end of each chapter do not define the scope of questions being asked. They are too open ended.

The writers pretend that such realities as deadlines and budget do not exist. The text is filled with Entity Relationship diagrams that must add 200% to the cost of their designs.

I agree with the other \\"bad\\" reviews.

I had to use this book for a class, and if it wasn't for my experienced database friend to explain what they mean, I would have definately failed this class. I love one of the previous reviews who used the word \\"horrid\\" - this is a perfect term for the book. This book lacks in explaining a term in a way that makes sense. It would just show the term and several examples, but you have no idea why they have extra terms in the example or why is the example written in that way, which defers from the original explanation.

The book clearly explains what are usually the most frustrating, yet critical, concepts for those new to database design and implementation - entity-relationship modeling, normalization, and transaction management - through the use of illustrated examples, diagrams, and comprehensible text. Of course, the book also thoroughly covers the essential concepts of SQL, ODBC, security, and data integrity.Database Systems also offers some treatment of more advanced database topics like Web connectivity (JDBC, ASP, XML), OLAP, data warehousing, object-oriented databases, and object-relational databases.The book is well organized and logical in sequence, and thus makes a good reference book as well.Notes: This is NOT A \\"COMPLETE REFERENCE\\" for all database systems. The book does not offer \\"complete\\" coverage of specialized database concepts/issues like database performance tuning, OLAP, or data warehousing, though these subjects are examined in the book to some extent. These subjects are complex enough to warrant separate texts. Also, the book does not exclusively embrace any relational database software title (Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, etc.) Since any one of these products is extremely complex, do not buy this book in expectation of becoming a vendor-specific DBA.

I thought it gave the best presentation of typical database topics that I have ever seen. I believe that data modeling is the essence of database and this book has more chapters on database design than any other five database books combined. The chapter on normalization was at just the right level. At the same time, the book is one of the few to acknowledge the need for denormalization.These authors have clearly been practitioners. It shows throughout the book."},{"Title":"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management (International Computer Science Series)","review":"Comprehensive - that is the first word that comes to my mind after reading the book Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management. If you are in search of a book that will help you in mastering the subject of Database Management Systems this is it. The coverage is exhaustive and in-depth. While reading the table of contents and preface, I thought that the authors were very ambitious in the scope and are promising too much. But after reading the book, I am glad to say that I was mistaken - the authors have very successfully delivered whatever they have promised and more.The book is ideal for a student of database management systems. It is also a valuable book for the practicing professional. In fact the people, who are in the database profession, who uses databases or develop applications involving database management systems, will find this book invaluable and will be able to appreciate it much more than a beginner. It is a connoisseur's delight.The authors assume nothing. Each and every concept is built from scratch. The level of detail is so impressive that one can think this book as a collection of books of various database-related topics. For example, the section on SQL is so comprehensive that, it can stand on its own as a separate book. Such detailed coverage is found for all the topics in the book and is one of its best features. The case studies, worked examples and the presentation style, the concepts in boxes, excellent illustration, review questions, etc. will go a long way in improving the usefulness of the book.Another feature that makes this book stand out form other books on database management, is its coverage of the latest technologies. The chapters of Distributed Database Management, Object-Oriented and Object-Relational Database Management Systems, Web based database applications, Data Warehousing, OLAP and Data Mining, etc. will prove invaluable to the students as well as the practitioners, novices as well as experts.When dealing with theoretical concepts like data modeling, normalization, it is the usual practice of most authors either to go too mathematical or to gloss over the subject. This book is by far the best in this respect as it takes an optimum approach. The explanations are not too mathematical, but the topics are explained in sufficient detail, so that the reader will have a very good understanding of the concepts like normalization, functional dependency, etc.Four most useful features of this book are the logical organization chart (suggesting the various paths that one can follow), the references, the suggested readings and the index. When reading or studying a book of this size - 1093 pages - these features are quite invaluable.The usefulness of the book could have been improved if an electronic version was provided. It would have made references easy. Also the Deductive database model is not covered. An appendix on the database related sites on the Internet would have been nice. Also a description of the major database systems and vendors could have been included.So in the final analysis, this is a must read and must have book for every database professional. For students it is a valuable course material. For professionals it is a very good self-study guide. For practitioners it an excellent refresher and a good way to keep track of the latest developments in the database field. An excellent buy!Copyright 1998, Pegasus Book Club"},{"Title":"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management (International Computer Science Series)","review":"This book opened the doors of relational database management systems to me. Prior to reading it I had some general experience with MySQL but an incomplete understanding of the subject. Much to my surprise I found I really liked working with a RDBMS's so I began searching for a book that would give me a solid introdcution to the theory and practice. I think this book fit the bill. After reading it I was ready to tackle a data migration project from Unify to Informix. Now I work as a database programmer. I have since purchased and read other RDBMS books about Informix (the RDBMS I have worked most with) but I find that I still refer to this text from time to time to clear up some minor points of confusion. This book will not make you an expert with RDBMS's but it will give you the background necessary to build up your confidence so you can tackle other tasks. At times the prose can be a bit drawn out but those sections are few and far between. Be advised though that this book uses conceptual/practical approach to database design. While it provide some examples using MS Access and Oracle I find the conceptual discussions more interesting and indeed more useful. With this foundation I was able to begin working with Informix Dynamic Server-an RDBMS that is clearly not the focus of this book."},{"Title":"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management (International Computer Science Series)","review":"I looked at a number of books on database theory, and found this to be the best.

The didactical approach is well organized during the exposition and fulfilled with many examples.

Might I add that that point in itself, his observation of others hustles, is what saved this book from being an autobiography (that wouldnt be a bad thing anyways).Normaly I dont like too many stories in success books but Kevin is definitly the exception. From lessons learned playing Guts with Lebron James to that reasoning behind his reaction to Dame Dash barking on him on the infamous scene of The HardKnock Life Tour.The one thing I like about this book also is that it wasnt all about getting money. It wasnt materialistic as most success books.

That said, I was proven wrong, (which goes to show, you CAN'T judge a book by it's cover). I wish that I had a book like this when I was younger, one that illustrated exactly how one should embrace their career.Mr. Liles was definitely a go-getter who made his own destiny happen. Throughout his journey, Kevin illustrates his determination to learn the business; he lived and breathed hip-hop, it is something he has to be a part of. You get to see and understand his success as well as what he considers his blunders (which are minimal)and the lessons he learned in making them. All while climbing to the top of Def Jam Records.I suggest that if you are looking for a gift for that up and coming graduate (High Schooler, College Grad), especially one who seems to be heading toward the creative path, I would purchase this book for them.

It's a role that he is personally and professionally qualified to flourish in. Using lessons learned during his mischevious, but disciplined teen years as a budding entrepreneur in Baltimore, and conflict encountered while at the helm of Def Jam and Warner, he demonstrates how to overcome adversity; face unexpected challenges; deal with difficult people; stand out from your co-workers; advance in your position; be true to who you are; find your real passion; build your own brand; and use your money wisely.While the majority of this book emphasizes personal development and achieving corporate results with a hip-hop attitude, it's important to note that this is NOT a book on how to succeed in the music business (though it will certainly be of tremendous benefit to any aspiring music industry professional), this is a book on how to \\"make it happen\\" in any industry. It just happens to contain valuable insight on how to get your hustle on in the music biz. Most importantly it offers something of much greater value to the young hip-hop generation: tools for introspection and a mental and moral compass that can be used to navigate their way through life and business. It's an admirable accomplishment that will undoubtedly establish Kevin Liles as the Les Brown of hip-hop.

He's makes a real point of playing the business politics game.I do think that Kevin is slightly misrepresenting his roots to appear more \\"down\\" with hip hop. The areas (Woodlawn and Pikesville) which Kevin mention in the book are really upwardly mobile, middle class white collar and blue collar types. However, Kevin is portraying them as rough neighborhoods.He talks a bit too much about the group he was in, \\"Numarx\\". I've never even heard of the group before and I'm from Baltimore. It's definately Kevin Lile's book, not so much a book on Def Jam. It would've probably have been more interesting to hear a little more about the actual artists and albums. Yet, it's a very good read for all ages."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD. IT'S PACT FULL OF PRINCIPLES WE MUST FOLLOW TO BECOME A SUCCESS. THOUGH THE AUTHOR IS A SUCCESS AT HIS JOB, HE SHOWS THAT HE IS A WORKAHOLIC AND NOT TOO SUCCESSFUL AT THE HOME FRONT.

I enjoyed this and you will too."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"Great book. I give it out to my clients. Excellent for young adults trying to find appropriate direction and alternatives for their lives and future. Liles makes one realize that with hard work, one can make a difference for themselves. The only complaint is that I wish he would write a book of guidance for teens with more simplistic language so that it can be read by various grade levels."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"This is a Great book. Easy read, and Great Tips for the Music business."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"I attended high school with Mr. Liles. Although I did not really know him personally, I remember that he was always ambitious and level-headed. It is refreshing to see him give back to our community and offset some of the negative press that our area of West Baltimore has received. I am glad that he is an excellent role model for today's young people."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"Kevin Liles rose from intern to president of Def Jam Records in record time. Kevin now works as Executive Vice-President of Warner Music Group. Kevin Liles, a Baltimore native, is sharing some of his knowledge with people who may want to pursue careers in the music business or business in general. The advice in the book can be applied to other careers besides music, but people who want to work in the music industry will find this book especially beneficial.The advice is very basic, \\"Find Your Will,\\" \\"Play Your Position,\\" \\"Get Connected,\\" but it is the stories that Kevin tells that make the book an enjoyable read rather than a getting started in the world of business book. If you are familiar with the music industry you will enjoy the stories related to the names dropped in the book. People mentioned in the book include Tina Davis (who is the manager of singer Chris Brown), Irv Gotti, Dame Dash, LL Cool J, and Lyor Cohen among others. He also mentions vacationing in Capri with Jay-Z and girlfriend Beyonce.Liles devotes much of the chapter \\"Create A Blueprint\\" to discussing the circumstances that led to his departure from Def Jam after 15 years. He would resign from his Def Jam position and according to Kevin he was a very sought after individual. He eventually settled into a position with Warner Music Group although he could have wrote his ticket in the industry.Make It Happen is part autobiography and part self-help book. There were a few things that I personally had a problem with. In the music business working as an unpaid intern for an extended period of time is not an unheard of thing. There is one story in the book about a young man who dropped out of college to become an intern at Def Jam. He left Florida for New York without even having a place to stay. The young man, according to Kevin's account, had such little food he developed stomach ulcers--yet he was one of Kevin's hardest working interns. After years and years of working long days at Def Jam for free when Kevin moved to Warner he took this young man with him and offered him a paying position. This story is supposed to prove perseverance but in my eyes it seemed like not the greatest message. While Kevin mentions lavish his home in Warren, New Jersey (that has a pool), he lets his hardest working intern nearly starve and not have a place to live. He couldn't throw the guy a couple hundred of dollars? Could this young man not have transferred to a New York university, found a place to live and then interned at Def Jam? In another story Kevin tells about how he told this one prospective intern to call him every Saturday early in the AM well knowing that he wasn't going to speak to her, he would just check his Caller ID to see if she called when she told him too. If getting a job in the music business is anything like the stories mentioned this book will be beneficial to those pursuing careers in the music industry.It's a really interesting book with solid real life advice."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"In part, this book is one man's rags to riches story. And his rags were indeed pretty bad. The west side of Baltimore is not where you would expect a senior business exectutime to begin his career. Indeed, growing up there you would expect a lifetime of drugs, jail and quite likely getting shot.Instead, Mr. Liles began working as a song writer and won a grammy for song writing. Then he decided that he would prefer working in the business side rather than the creative and went to work as an unpaid intern. Riches followed as he got promoted higher in the music business.He was clearly a focused individual. Over time he has developed a credo that should serve as a good set of 'Rules for Success,' or as he puts it 'Making It Happen.' Nothing really outstanding here, other people have done a similar set of rules. But most of them didn't come from the wrong side of the tracks and show the success he has.Another part of the book, perhaps not intended, is to show that the Hip-Hop generation is a market, a viable market by itself. Whether you are selling records, sneakers or iPods other product, here is a market that cannot be ignored. ==An enjoyable book with some key germs of truth -- only one of which applied to your business or career is wrll worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Make It Happen: The Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success","review":"The wave of current changes within hip hop, have since reflected upon a great movement, that continues to transpire believe in the greatness of a young generation of mainly disposessed radicals.

It isn't always a glamorous story, and much of Red's life couldn't be considered wholesome, but he undeniably earned his place in the history of pool.Henning traces Burge's life from the small Kentucky town in which he started playing pool, to a few road trips in which he honed his game, to his tenure as carnival worker in which learned to read and \\"work\\" people, and on to one of the hottest gambling spots in the US. Whether it was in a small pool room behind a barber shop, or under the lights of Las Vegas, Red was there giving people a run for their money.Although Red knew how to control the table, the heat of the gamble or the looseness of the gamblers' fraternity sometimes got the better of him. At a few points in the book, I cringed as Red allowed tens of thousands of dollars in recent winnings slip between his fingers. But Red's world isn't the one we live in, where such a loss would put us on the streets; Red had a talent for setting up matches and a support network that kept him on his feet. As Henning makes clear, these talents aren't to be underestimated. Red made his living and distinguished himself in a world that most of us have neither the skill nor the guts to enter.This book could've easily been written as a condemnation of gambling. Red made some bad decisions along the way, as would anybody who lived in a world where people bet thousands of dollars on anything from one-handed pool games to cigarette tossing contests. Henning chooses, however, to focus on the grit that typified Red's experience. In fact, honest grit is what this book is about. It doesn't have the excitement, panache, and detail of \\"Playing Off the Rail\\" or \\"Willie's Game,\\" but it paints a vivid picture of the everyday money player's experience."},{"Title":"Cornbread Red: Pool's Greatest Money Player","review":"After reading Robert Byrne's McGoorty I could barely read this book. If you're a casual pool player then this book is for you. But anyone who has played pool on a serious level will tell you that the stories in this book are so incredibly far-fetched and unbelievable that they are almost impossible (and by serious I mean played on the road or has followed professional or underground pool very closely for sometime, NOT \\"I play APA\\" serious). You can tell by the title that the author is blowin' smoke up everyone's arse. \\"Pool's Greatest Money Player\\"? That's a bold statement sir. But he doesn't become modest at all throughout the book, he literally carries on this \\"I'm the greatest\\" attitude in all of his chapters. It's obnoxious and very obviously untrue.I think we all have that one friend, you know, the one that tells you new stories every month that are so over the top and exaggerated that the friend has lost all credibility when he speaks and you begin to wonder if he/she is just a compulsive liar...that's Cornbread Red. If you want a book full of those stories, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Cornbread Red: Pool's Greatest Money Player","review":"This book is an easy read, but a difficult review. If you want to read about Cornbread Red's association with unknown gamblers playing for huge (unnamed, split-seven-ways) stakes, this is the book for you. If you want anecdotes about other greats he encountered, forget it. Danny Jones and Fats get brief mentions. The rest is mostly about Rubie, Bones, Al, and a host of other household names. Not really a bad book, but it could have been much better."},{"Title":"Cornbread Red: Pool's Greatest Money Player","review":"In 1974 I meet Cornbread Red in a bar in Kannapolis, NC. I had the table when he came in the package store, he looked a little disheveled but most everyone in the room knew who he was but I had never heard of \\"Cornbread Red\\". He had just got through with some heavy money matches in Charlotte and was just trying to unwind with some beer and pool before calling it a day/night. I got 1 shot during our game; I broke and ran 7 balls off the table, before he shot. He ran the table out.This book gave me a good insight on this man's life and was a very enjoyable read. If you have every played pool in a pool hall or bar room you can related to this man's life. He used simple tools to make himself into a legend."},{"Title":"Cornbread Red: Pool's Greatest Money Player","review":"Take a journey into a different time with this mini-biography of sorts about the famous pool hustler.

Both the highs and lows of this pool hustler's life are told in an intersting way.This book is a good pool story that's well written by a pool player for pool players.

The stories are very fascinating and grab your concentration. I am not a book worm, nor am I a person who likes reading books. But the first story itself creates a kind of inquisitiveness in the reader. Well you could not ask for a better book to atleast look like a book worm."},{"Title":"Worlds Most Infamous Killers","review":"This collection of more than 150 tales of the most prolific and shocking murderers to have made the world's headlines over the years is not a treatise on the psychology of serial killers. As noted on the introduction page, the book \\"does not discuss how to build up a profile of a killer to fit a particular crime\\".Yet you can gain an insight into the modus operandi of men and women who kill for various reasons. The book groups the perpetrators into several categories like thrill killers, unlikely killers, partners in crime, etc., although the classification appears rather ambiguous at times.Some of these killers, such as Elizabeth Bathory, sound like they had committed genocide rather than serial killing. And the reason for such mass extermination? \\"We have the right to do what we wish to those beneath us,\\" she [Bathory] said. \\"We are of royal blood.\\"If the number of killings is the yardstick for inclusion, surely Adolf Hitler should have made the grade? He didn't. Instead, another military leader, Cesare Borgia, was an unlikely candidate for the execution of his political opponents and personal enemies. As for the case of Al Capone, it could be argued that, while the mob was responsible for many killings, Capone's direct involvement pales in comparison to some of those listed in the book. Furthermore, if indirect involvement counted in his or her favour, no one could have rivalled the Nazi leader.Fortunately, this is just a minor selection contradiction in \\"The World's Most Infamous Killers\\".Although murder is too horrifying a topic to make light of, the book is peppered with wry humour. Some examples:In \\"Murder Inc.\\", Abe Reles, who was due to give evidence against members of the mob, \\"fell\\" out of a hotel window even though he was guarded by six policemen. Twenty years later, [Lucky] Luciano, head honcho of Murder Inc., revealed that it had cost his henchman a bill of $50,000 to the police department to check whether the singing canary [referring to Reles] could also fly.In \\"Neville Heath\\", there is a distinct irony in the statement that the meeting of Margery Gardner (a masochist) and Neville Heath (a sadist) \\"provided both of them with some satisfaction\\".In \\"Frederick Deeming\\", the story left plenty to imagination with the following statement: Soon the family disappeared and the room had an excellent new cement floor.In \\"Burke and Hare\\", it was noted that another double killing was scored \\"when the daughter of an old prostitute, already in the tea chest, came searching for her, and was reunited with her mother for ever\\". Curiously, the beginning of this chapter also highlighted that to \\"burke\\", according to the dictionary, is to murder by suffocation so as to leave no mark. Next time you go to Burke's Coffee, be careful.Of course, not all the elements of humour are provided by the description. Sometimes, the characters themselves got involved. Al Capone, for instance, commented on his income tax evasion charge by saying, \\"I didn't know you paid tax on illegal earnings.\\"The last laugh also befell George Smith, a man who had a surefire way of making money - killing his wives and collecting the insurance. Whether that backfired because he bumped off one wife the day after the wedding is another issue. According to the narration, Smith was hanged on 13 August 1915 - a Friday. His only legal wife - the one who had emigrated to Canada - had turned up to give evidence at his trial and joyfully remarried the day after he died. Poetic justice, perhaps?\\"The World's Most Infamous Killers\\" also highlights many examples of police inefficiency in investigations.Javed Iqbal, who set himself a target of killing 100 young boys, sent a detailed confession to both a local newspaper and the police upon meeting his quota. Amazingly, due to the inefficient bureaucracy of the police, the confession ended up in a waste basket!The tale of Fritz Haarmann is equally shocking. Haarmann, whose butcher's trade meant he had a good way to dispose of his victims' bodies, expertly filleted them and chop them into choice cuts. When one woman who noticed the peculiar flavour of the meat brought it to the authorities, where it was analysed by the police expert, she was told that it was as good a piece of pork as could be obtained in the city!Reading this book will also make you realise that there is indeed a thin line between sanity and madness. Oftentimes, it takes only an incident to tip the balance in the latter's favour. But don't be mistaken. It's not just imbalanced people who will go on a killing spree. Perfectly normal people, as history has shown, have the same tendency to slaughter their own kind with no apparent reason.Conclusion: If you have no appetite for gory details, avoid this book at all cost."},{"Title":"Royal flush,: The story of Minette","review":"In this novel Irwin recounts the life of Henrietta Anne (Minette) daughter of Charles I of England, and begins when a young Minette and her mother are in exile in France during England's Civil War. Eventually Charles Stuart regains the crown and Minette marries the younger brother of Louis XIV, Philippe Duke of Orl&eacute;ans - but Philippe's temper, vanity and penchant for *pretty* young men are not conducive to wedded bliss and Minette soon find herself growing closer to Louis. Much beyond this I don't want to say - if you're familiar with Minette's history you know what happens and I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you.This is the first book by Irwin I've read and while I enjoyed her writing, but be warned it is dated (first published in 1932) and best taken in small daily doses and not in one lump read. I found myself a bit lost at times with several of the secondary characters and their multiple names/titles and would have appreciated a who's who reference guide, although you don't find those often in older novels. If you've never read anything on Minette and/or the court of Louis XIV I don't recommend this as a starting point - you'll be tossing it by page 100. However, if you are familiar with the period this is a good novel to give you a closer look at Minette's tale."},{"Title":"Royal flush,: The story of Minette","review":"I first read this book when I was a young woman.

In the second essay he for scientific freedom and experimentation, state sovereignty, and freedom in education. In the third essay he argues for \\"free enerprise in ideas\\" and no censorship. In the fourth he argues against \\"guilt by association\\" or the punishment of ostracism for belonging to a suppesedly subversive group.

But, what information should our personal health records contain?

Initially, parents are responsible for entering the information on their children. This task is then passed on as children move into adulthood. This book is truly the gift of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Lifetime Health Journal","review":"I'm sure this book would be good for some, but it was too in-depth for me. The adult section doesn't even start until page 57. I wanted to use this for myself, but I'm not going to record everything from my childhood, so the first half of the book would be wasted. Then it asks for so much detailed information about all sorts of tests. Maybe if you have a history of health problems, you'd want to record all of this. But for a healthy adult, it doesn't seem necessary. In fact, when I go to the doctor, they don't even tell me what my blood pressure was, etc. - because it's not an issue. So if you're simply looking for a book to record basic things like immunizations & notes from appointments, this will probably be too much for you. It is a very nice hard back book though.

It was published in 1866, when the war was still fresh in the mind of the writer. I wrote about General Sam McGowan and his mulatto son, Sam Lee, who served as his aide all during the war.

The novel portrays how the African American race was treated unjust. Jefferson a black man is accused for murder, a crime I think he did not commit. But because he was black he was sentenced to the electric chair. Even thought Jefferson was not an immoral man. His aunt Nannan want Jefferson to die with pride and a believer in God. This is where Grant comes into play. Grant despises where he lives but he cannot leave because he needs the community he grew up in. Grant is faced with a task; he has to transform Jefferson into a dignified man before his death. I particularly liked this book very much. The only faulty part of the novel was the predictable ending it had. After reading the first couple of pages you can depict what is going to happen. The novel is a run on of one idea, making the novel dry and not enjoyable to read. Although I have conflicting thoughts and comments about the book I would highly recommend this novel to anyone. The novel touches on a fair amount of feelings as you continue reading. As Jefferson and Grant grow as friends, each one grows more mature and wiser. If I had to rate this book I would give it an eight. This is only because the novel was to predictable and slow.

I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing.

One of them, Jefferson, has been convicted of a murder in which he was merely an innocent bystander. The other, Grant Wiggin, is the teacher in the town of Bayonne, La, where the story is set. During Jefferson's trial the attorney compares him to a hog, which hurts Jefferson's godmother-Mrs. Emma-tremendously. Mrs. Emma then asks Grant to help teach Jefferson to be a man before he dies.The whole story is based around one thing that an attorney says in the very beginning of the book. Nothing like this would ever happen in the real world. It does not seem plausible. One single sentence cannot have such an astounding effect on all of the characters. Gaines definitely blows this one sentence completely out of proportion, and there are visible repercussions during the story. At times the storyline becomes very thin and uninteresting because of the fact that it all centers around one thing that has been said.Gaines does a good job of portraying the struggle that Grant is having in his own life at the same time as Jefferson is going to jail. Grant oftentimes feels out of place in Bayonne and it becomes clear to the reader that Grant is struggling to find out who he really is and where he belongs.During some parts of the story it seems like Gaines goes out of his way to show the reader how black people were mistreated by white people. There is one whole chapter in the book that is about the superintendent's visit to Grant's school. This chapter has no effect on the outcome of the story and the only reason Gaines wrote it was to point out that the superintendent resembles a slave master in the way that he inspects the children.At one point during the story Jefferson undergoes a total transformation, for no apparent reason! There is no gradual progression in this. At one point he is angry and won't speak to anyone and then the next time he appears he is friendly and alone and in need of a companion. Although it helps to move the story along and show the transformation of the relationship between Jefferson and Grant it is not very realistic and poorly done on Gaines' part.Early on in their meetings, Grant buys Jefferson a little diary he can write his thoughts in and then Grant will read it to see what he has been thinking about. One of the chapters in this book contains all the entries that Jefferson made in his diary. Some parts of the diary are nice and heartwarming but some other parts are not very believable. As the diary progresses Jefferson's spelling and grammar improves. While this helps to portray the transformation from \\"animal\\" to man, it is not very believable.Although the book has its ups and downs it is not, overall, a bad book. Some parts of the story are very moving and emotionally touching while other parts are drab, dull and quite boring. Once the reader makes it past the boring dullness that is the first fifteen to seventeen chapters the book becomes very interesting and is quite worth the time it takes to read the whole thing."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This book was painfully boring.

Gaines, is a non fiction book that has many themes addressing stereotypes. As the book starts Jefferson, the main character, is convicted of a murder that he did not commit. He is a very poor and uneducated man, so all he can do is beg for his life in front of a grand jury who finds him guilty of murder. Jefferson's Aunt, Ms. Emma convinces Grant Wiggins, an educated black teacher to help Jefferson die a proud man instead of a coward little \\"hog.\\" They use \\"hog\\" in the book many times to describe Mr. Jefferson's life. As you read deeper into this book your emotions will change, from sadness to happiness, as Jefferson dies a proud man instead of a hog.I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about African American History. Also this would be a great book for high school or middle school students. There are many themes and emotions about this book that could be analyzed in different ways. This book doesn't really stagger along and you will always enjoy it. Personally, I liked the first couple of chapters about Mr. Jefferson and his crime that he was accused of committing. One aspect of the book that I did not enjoy was when Grant talks to Mr. Jefferson in his cell. It was very unenthusiastic and didn't excite me. If you are familiar with Ernest J.

A Lesson Before Dying is about this young man named Jefferson who was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. However, the defense attorney called him a hog by insulting his intelligence, and i know what it is like to be insulted based on my intelligence. furthermore, there is a another main character who was telling the story Grant Wiggins, an angry yet apathetic, and mostly a mercenary teacher who was forced by his aunt Tante Lou to make jefferson a man before he dies. This book is mostly a what would you do, if you want to prove someone wrong about you or somebody type of story. It makes me sad and angry because think of the life Jefferson could've had before he was taken into custody and indicted for a crime he so-called commited. Furthermore, the situation is so sad the same chaos that happend to Jefferson is still going on today in the United States,for example, the white girl who accused a black high school student of rape was sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit, she came on to him first, so he was released and i hope she do some hard time for perjury and slander.

This is the reason why I would reccomend people to read this because of the message it sends: to become a man and do the right thing no matter what the situation is. However, I do have a reason why certain people should not read this book. Because if you have a short attention span, you may not be able to make it through.

The main part of the story was the struggles of understanding life and the relationship between the two main characters, Grant and Jefferson. A good book consists of change, twists, and dynamic story lines. But their relationship mostly consisted of Jefferson; a black man wrongly accused of murder, acting like an animal and not wanting any help from Grant, a schoolteacher sent out by Jefferson's aunt, Miss Emma, to teach him how to be a man before he is executed. \\" They called my boy a hog, Mr. Henri,\\" Miss Emma said. \\"I didn't raise no hog, and I don't want no hog to go set in that chair. I want a man to go set in that chair, Mr. Henri.\\" The visits to Jefferson to make him a man became boring, repetitive, and progress was rarely shown. So here is the whole book leading up to the end, Jefferson's execution, and the ending was predictable and with no excitement. Although the novel had a well thought out lesson and explained the character of certain people, it had nothing to draw me into the book in order to make me appreciate these lessons.

At first, Grant thinks it's not a good idea but as the book progresses, Jefferson and Grant forge a bond so strong that not even the stronghold of racism can break.

Hence the title A Lesson Before Dying. The book was good because of the character devolopment that Gaines used for his characters. For Grant he goes through a rite of passage that will change him forever. The rite of passage is a good and efective way to develop a character and Gaines does a good job of doing just that. the rite of passage has everything from the mentors the symbols to the most important part the ritual.

In this compelling novel, Gaines incorporates his own background and experiences in a similar setting into making the characters and events come alive. This book addresses many themes such as injustice, discrimination, and the death penalty. However, the single theme that most stood out to me was the concept of pride and dignity. Jefferson's pride has completely been torn apart by the unfair accusation for a crime he didn't commit and by being called a &quot;hog&quot; by his defense lawyer. Grant's mission, as he visits Jefferson in prison, is to teach him to regain a sense of pride, so that he can die with dignity and face his death courageously. He also teaches that heroism can be achieved by simply having the courage to defy and stand up to those in authority. This book really got me thinking, especially concerning the death penalty. When you think about it, it really can sound unethical for one person to be able to determine the date and time to take away life from another person, especially if they didn't even deserve to die in the first place, as in Jefferson's case. Overall, &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; was an outstanding, realistic, and moving book with lessons that can educate any reader. I highly recommend it for anyone who would like to learn something about any aspect of the human soul."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines is an excellent story about duty and heroism. It takes place on a small Southern plantation outside of Bayonne, Louisianna in the 1940's. At this time in America when society is still torn by racial segregation, an innocent black man named Jefferson is found guilty of robbery and murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. The majority of white men in town share the sentiment that Jefferson's life has no more worth than that of a hog's. This is where the narrator, Grant Wiggins comes in. Grant, a professor at a very primitive grade school for black children, is the only educated black man on the plantation. He is asked by Jefferson's godmother, Miss Emma, and ordered by his own aunt, Tante Lou, to visit Jefferson in jail and teach him, before he goes to the electric chair, that he is not a hog but a precious human being. Grant is already unhappy and despaired with what he thinks is a futile life, teaching black children who, despite his efforts, will turn out just like Jefferson anyway. All he wants to do is run away with his girlfriend Vivian, but he is tied down by the obligation he has to his fellow black man. Although Grant is reluctant to begin visits with Jefferson, and Jefferson is just as reluctant to receive these visits, the two eventually form a very close bond. This story centers around their relationship and the lesson they teach each other about fulfilling responsibility and dying with dignity.It is no wonder why this novel is a classic. It is eloquently written, emotionally powerful, easy to follow, and very profound in its subjects and themes. The characters are well-developed and difficult not to empathize with. Grant is an especially dynamic character, but everyone in Gaines' novel contributes to an understanding of the overall plot and its purpose. Vivian, for instance, acts as the voice of reason and the support Grant needs to continue his lessons with Jefferson. Henri Pichot and Sheriff Guidry represent the fear and ignorance that keep racial segregation so prevalent in American society. A Lesson Before Dying is deep on many levels, and there is no one that I would not recommend it to."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is a lesson about life. Jefferson is a young black man that is accused wrongfully of a murder he did not commit. His crime? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But because he is black, and there are no other survivors to this crime, he is locked up in prison and sentenced to die in the electric chair.Another black man, Grant Higgins, is asked to talk to Jefferson in his jail cell. Grant is to help Jefferson become a dignified person before he is put to death. Jefferson refers to himself as a hog, because that is what the white men call him when they sentence him to death. So, Grant's aunt who is a friend of Jefferson's godmother, known as Nannan, asks him to intervene. Nannan wants to know that Jefferson dies with dignity,as a man.Through Grant's eyes we see what Jefferson goes through as he prepares himself to die. We also witness what life is like for the black man in a segregated world. Jefferson had no chance of proving himself innocent. In this world of Loiusiana, circa 1940, the black man was guilty because of his color. No one fought this verdict. It was accepted. Even Grant Wiggins, who was educated (rare for a black man in his day) and taught in school, did not try to prove Jefferson innocent.I found myself reading the book with acceptance, knowing that it was Jefferson's fate to die in that chair. But when I came to that last chapter, the idea hit me hard and as other reviewers have noted, it is a 3 hanky chapter.A Lesson Before Dying, in my opinion, is destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Gaines writes with force and sensitivity about heroism and faith. The burden of expectations on black men in 1949 Louisiana, the impossiblity of meeting those expectations, the self-loathing that comes as a result, and the possiblity nonetheless of redemption are skillfully and compellingly developed.The setting is a young black man's dubious conviction of murder, which the white defense lawyer rebuts with the observation that the defendant was no more capable of premeditation than a hog. The protagonist is a young black teacher who reluctantly works with the defendant to touch his soul and to help him face death with great courage.Given the daily horrors and humiliations suffered during the segregation era, it's not entirely convincing to me that this one \\"hog\\" remark would be so devastating to the defendant and the community. Of course, it's a great symbol for all of the nastiness of racism -- which points to a serious problem with the book. The obvious symbolism and didactic nature of the book do lessen its force.Another problem is the protagonist, Grant Wiggins. He's whiny and betrays a real mean streak in how he treats his pupils. His dialogue with his girl friend is very unconvincing, and for the life of me I don't understand what she sees in him. Of course, self-doubt is a critical theme of the book, and the weaknesses of its main protagonist is in some ways a real strength of the book. But there is a balance here, and the reader will sometimes find the protagonist irritating.On the whole, this is an absorbing and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Those who read A LESSON BEFORE DYING hail it as a classic of how one condemned black inmate stands up to racial prejudice before he is executed for a crime of which he is innocent. Indeed it is surely that but it is also the intertwined tale of how this inmate, named Jefferson, reaches out for the help of a black teacher, Grant Wiggins, who learns that for him to help Jefferson accept his fate, he himself must first learn that those who preach the value of courage must possess that same courage.Grant Wiggins is a young black teacher who seems to have it all. He has a responsible teaching post in a grammar school, a loving girlfriend, and the external trappings that mark him as one who has successfully lifted himself from a deep South ghetto. It is too easy for him to overlook that his tenure as an educated black teacher in a white-dominant school system is a flimsy thing, one that is totally dependent on the whims of his white school superintendent. It comes as a shock both for him and the reader to realize that when he left the slums of his childhood for the cleaned orderliness of the classroom he is merely exchanging one ghetto for another. He might have spent his entire teaching career oblivious to this had it not been for the great bad luck of a foolish young Jefferson to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was a store robbery gone sour, with the result that both the robbers and the store owner were killed, and there was Jefferson right there with the store's cheap liquor in his hand. During Jefferson's trial, his defense lawyer called him a 'hog,' one who was so incompetent and lowborn that he could not possibly have had the mental competence to participate in a robbery. The jury, of course, does not buy this appalling rationale and sentences Jefferson to death. Enter Grant Wiggins, who is sent by his elderly aunt to speak to Jefferson and make his last days on earth dignified.What Wiggins learns during his several visits to Jefferson's jail is that the sullenness that Jefferson reveals is not the mark of the grunting, squealing 'hog' that his lawyer had crudely drawn, but is really the only sane approach that one could have if that man had been treated as a metaphorical hog all his life. As Wiggins probes into Jefferson's past, he learns that his present refusal to communicate hides a desperate need to communicate. Slowly, Jefferson's rationale for living, then for dying, becomes evident. The climax of the book is not the death day, but Wiggins' reading of Jefferson's diary that reveals that the abuse that Jefferson heaped on both Wiggins and those who loved him was not abuse at all, but the only way that a man in Jefferson's state could leave his mark on the world. It is Earnest Gaines' writing talent that lets him express one of the supreme ironies of the human condition: that the man who was supposed to heal the agony of another found that the healer was not the one wearing the business suit but the one in the bright orange prison suit. A LESSON BEFORE DYING is an unforgetable reminder that some lessons need to be learned even as they are being taught."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"The tighly-constructed book holds a central argument that death cannot be restricted to the body. (However, I must comment that the book takes place in a part of Louisiana that is not Cajun--but more New Orleans Creole, and the culture is not Catholic French Cajun, but that of the old South with antebellum plantation houses, African-American religion, and slave quarters.) The setting with the house and quarters serves as visual metaphor for the continued social enslavement of the African Americans into the 1940's. I teach the book in a classroom with Black and White students, and Mr. Gaines presents the stupidity of racism more via this tighly woven novel with its many messages about justice and goodness, than any preachy multicultural jargon could accomplish. His characters, no matter what race, are very human (with both flaws and strengths) and the writing, with visual detail and psychological insight, admits us all into Jefferson's world. A great book and a great read. Like the teacher, the community, and Jefferson we learn too, through this journey into a Black forties community, that nothing can kill the human spirit. Mr. Gaines's book will be talking to people long after we are able to speak.

It was an Oprah book and one of my goals in life is to read all the books on her list. However, when I read the excerpt of this book, I have to admit, I was a little disconcerted. I didn't want to read another depressing book.But this book is more than just depressing. It is a thought-provoking book based on the African-American lifestyle down in Mississippi. Jefferson was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was falsely accused of murder and sentenced to death. Grant, a teacher at the plantation near Bayonne, was asked to talk to Jefferson during his last days. Because the prosecuting attorney said that Jefferson was a hog, Jefferson took it in mind that he is nothing more than a hog and should die like one. And Grant was sent to persuade him otherwise. Grant didn't go willing. Jefferson's godmother and Grant's aunt pleaded with Grant to help Jefferson die with dignity ~~ to walk &quot;like a man&quot; to his deathbed.This is such an insightful look into African-American relations with one another and with the whites and the rest of the world. As Jefferson nears his death, Grant spends his time soul-searching for the meaning of life, and asking those deep questions of why it was ok for a jury of 12 white men say it was ok for one black man to die. It goes on with other questions and statements. It is a book that will make you stop and think just about what the author is trying to prevail to you, the reader.This is one of the most interesting books I have read this year. I did have a problem getting into the story line, but once I got into it, the story itself grabbed me by the eyes and soul ~~ and I couldn't let go. It is still haunting me as I write this review. There is so much I want to discuss ~~ but one needs to read the book in order to know what I am talking about. And I can't give away the story either. So grab this book and learn a lesson that may change your whole perspective on things.

Here's why. Students today are drawn to nonfiction, and A Lesson Before Dying, although it is a novel, is set in a time and place that will be familiar to students who are also studying American history. The courtroom chapter, for example, can be paired with a viewing of the PBS documentary on the Emmett Till case, particularly the trial. The descriptions of the schoolhouse parallel Maya Angelou's autobiographical account in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Most interesting is the way Gaines shows the pervasiveness of forms of racism that go far beyond the reality of separate water fountains and toilets, which students learn about in history classes. Gaines shows how Grant Wiggins is made to feel inferior through smaller things, like being mocked for pronouncing \\"batteries\\" correctly or being made to wait to speak to Henri Pichot for over two hours, while Pichot finishes his dinner. There are dozens of demeaning gestures and suble humiliations of speech that help students see how racism, for Wiggins, was inescapable."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"I don't think I've every cried so hard while reading a novel. So moving, so sad, but not a bit melodramatic, overwrought, or sentimental. The emotional power is simply the result of Mr. Gaines letting the power of the realities of the story, which are the realities of our damaged nation, speak for themselves. His writing is spare and wonderful. Many writers would either oversimplify or overamplify the book's themes; Mr. Gaines has the talent and confidence not to do that.I have had the great good fortune of having read many wonderful books. This is among the best."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"This is one of the best novels a person can read. This book has more than one meaning. Ernest J. Gaines brings this novel to life. As you read, you will feel as though you are portraying one of the characters in the book. When you hear the thoughts of the characters, you will become attach, and will not but the book down.Jefferson, a man sentenced to death after being the ony survivor in a liquior store shootout. He is convicted of murder. Jefferson's Godmother and her good friend convince Grant Wiggins to visit Jefferson in his cell. Although Grant is unsure wether to stay on the plantation or escape to another state with his girlfriend. Even with this internal conflict, he develops a strong bond with Jefferson. With the bond that him and Jefferson have, it pleases his aunt and Jefferson's Godmother. But after all this a one of a kind story that everyone should read. I gave this book a 5 star rating because it was recommended for me to read and I found it to be one of the best books I ever read."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"The thought process and inspiration behind A Lesson Before Dying were brilliant; however, the story just fell flat. I felt that the characters were one-dimensional and disengaged one from the story; Grant was a bore, for example, he repeated the same lines and the same ideas, most of the time in the same words. I kept waiting for spectacular and inspiring events to occur and to make me feel proud of Grant's work to reach Jefferson, but I was severely disappointed. This story moved water-drop slow, trickling from one important event through insignificant episodes to another important event. While I do feel that stories need time to develop the characters; however, in this story, I didn't see much character development. At the end of the book, Grant was the same man, same selfish mannerisms, yet in life, people change all the time. I would think that witnessing an execution and the injustice of the death penalty would be enough to change most people for better or worse. Then the story became absurd when Jefferson, an ignorant teenager who was brainwashed by a racist society, transformed into a man overnight because Grant made an inspiring speech to him. Why should Jefferson listen to Grant, who happens to be a selfish, cowardly and \\"educated\\" black? This book disappointed due to the fact that exaggerations are laced throughout, and it only delved into skin-deep into the death penalty issues. The story contains few descriptions of the execution (the climax), and so many descriptions of tedious events such as Grant's brawl with two bricklayers. Jefferson's execution was brief at best; it just didn't achieve the heart-wrenching ending that it was supposed to accomplish. Save your money and buy a book like Rain of Gold that can achieve true engagement between reader, characters and story; nevertheless, guaranteeing a first person perspective of the book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"How can one thank an author for painting a picture so wonderfully that you enter into their world?

Jefferson was sentenced to the death penalty and a former schoolteacher Grant Wiggins is sentenced to teach him. This book was one of the best. I really enjoyed reading it because it gave me a clear description of what really happened in the late 1940's to other races. The book gave me a description of what people went through in that time period and how people were treated. This book gives you a second thought on how to appreciate what others do for you and how things like this have helped African Americans become more involved in and accepted by society."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"If a reader like yourself wants to read about a man looking for himself, read this book! Maybe you will have something in common with this man. His name is Grant Wiggins. He's in love with someone, but that's not even working out for him! I felt sorry for the guy sometimes. This man is the main character of the story. He doesn't know what he is, what he wants to do. He is very confused. Maybe it can be that his aunt treats him like a child or a lot of people depend on him. Maybe he can't handle the pressure of getting depended on. He's caught in a sitution he can't get out of (of course because of hi aunt). His aunt practically forces him to visit a man on death row to make a \\"man\\" out of him. This man is innocent, and everyone know's except the people that want to believe he's guilty. Grant, himself, is not yet a man. Yes, he's a teacher and very educated, but he's like a confused child. The boy has no intention of listening to Grant. He's just waiting to die. How is Grant going to get through this and his other problems? You'll just have to read the book to find out."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"When I first started to read this book, I was a little aprehensive. Being an African-American, sometimes when I know that books deal with the oppression of my race, I frankly get upset and don't want to read it. This was not the case with &quot;A Lesson Before Dying.&quot; Set during the 1940's in a segregated cajun community, this story is about overcoming barriers with others, but most importantly overcomming barriers within yourself. As Grant the protaganist of the story is faced with the task of educating Jefferson, a black male who is faced with the death penilty, due to a crime that he didn't commit. Grant does more than teach Jefferson to &quot;be a man&quot; in his last days,he teaches himself as well. Grant and Jefferson change their lives, and well as others, with the greatest lesson in life. &quot;A Lesson Before Dying&quot; is an excellent book to read for anyone, it causes you to look at yourself, discover the barriers you have with others, but mostly you discover the barriers within yourself, and soar to become a better person."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Ernest Gaines' novel A LESSON BEFORE DYING is a fast paced, powerful novel that can reach readers on many levels. The book takes place in the segregated south of the 1940's. Grant Wiggins, a local educator, is too qualified to be teaching at the local school, but his possibilities are limited due to his race. He has big dreams, but is trapped due to the social conventions of his time. Since he is an educated person, the community expects a great deal from him, especially his grandmother and her friends. He is expected to try and help a young man named Jefferson, an African American who has been sentenced to death, die with the dignity he never had in life and much of the plot revolves around the decisions he has to make regarding Jefferson.The book could easily turn into a moralistic tale where a basically good person does the right thing simply because it is the right thing to do. Gaines avoids this route. Grant struggles with the expectations of others, his own religious beliefs, what he reasonably owes the community, as well as the normal struggles of any young person trying to find joy, happiness, love, and satisfaction in the world. We see in Grant a character who deserves our respect and admiration, not because he is superior, but rather because of the way in which he uses his strengths and wrestles with his own demons.When the book was first published, I purchased quite a few copies for friends. It sat on their shelves until the book was part of Oprah's book club. Then it became a must read. Oprah had great taste in choosing this book."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"The book A Lesson Before dying takes place in a small cajun community. The story takes little time to let the reader know from the very get go what the story is to be about. This is one of the parts I found dissapointing. There was little left to surprise the reader. Jefferson a black man in the racist community is accused and convicted of a murder that he didn't commit. The Sentence Jefferson recieves is death. The rest of the book brings the reader along the emotional roller coaster of trying to teach Jefferson about being a man. This task is given to Grant Wiggins the community teacher. Althought doubtful about his given duty Mr. Wiggins not only turns Jefferson into a respectful man, but also learns about himself . In the end the inevitable happen and Jefferson is put to death but when the execution is looked back upon the jail guard who Mr. Wiggins became friends with during his many visits to the jail informed Mr. Wiggins that Jefferson was the bravest man in that room. This is the touching part of the book to see the transformation of Jefferson from someone who thought he was only a hog to being described as the bravest man in the room at his own execution. But this was not the only transformation througout the book, Mr. Wiggins also made a break through with his many visits learned much about himself and being himself and doing what makes him happy is the most important, rather than things or money. This book overall was very good I thought, it had a very good ending message and I enjoyed watching the changes in the characters the Gaines deleloped for the reader. I would reccomend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Gaines carefully analyzes and develops the problem of being a minority person in a biased society. He projects the frustrations inherent in living a life where there is no level playing field, with little chance that this will change. He does not hit you with a mallet, but grabs your heart and your mind; as you read you feel the sorrow and the rage. And for a moment, you have a dim understanding of this &quot; us and them &quot; quandary.I believe this to be a classic; not to be accepted lightly or forgotten easily."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A human's life, woven from the threads colored by the decisions we make, has the potential to create works of art that impact the lives of those around us. Ernest Gaines creates such a masterpiece in his portrayal of 1940's racial struggle, in his novel, A Lesson Before Dying. This portrait of life,captured with the stinging reality of an inborn racial injustice, portrays the limitations of the social cage Americans have crafted over the years. Grant, one of the few educated black citizens in his community, is faced with the challenge of teaching a convict, already destined for execution, and devoid of hope. Driven only by his aunt, he faces Jefferson, the inmate, and the imbedded message, voiced by society, of the man's worthlessness and inequality.Grant is slowly able to open his eyes to the potential Jefferson's education holds as a beacon of resistance to the white man's restrictive role of ignorance for the black community, begins to fill the Jefferson's void of ignorance with the knowledge of his own capability.Gaines incorporates many of his own experience as an African American growing up I a repressive society. Such social setbacks, he says, \\"have spurred (him) repeatedly to look for the truths and lessons of life....in the depths and mysteries of the human heart\\", because, \\"that's where each of us discovers who we really are.\\"Jefferson's own heart, frozen by his own self- doubt, was warmed and made fertile for growth, aided by Grant, who arguably benefited equally from the whole experience. Although Jefferson's mortality was predetermined by suppression , his community was better able to live their lives as true people.Aware of the fact that much of his audience will never be able to fully appreciate the horror of American racial subjugation, Gaines crafted the book in such a manner that a very thorough level of understanding can be reached. Touching upon one of his themes, Gaines utilizes the power of genuine empathy between the readers to his characters, to drive his message of awareness. As one of his final words captured in the novel, Grant says, \\"(you) must believe, if only to free the mind...(because) only when the mind is free has the body a chance to be free.\\"Though to foresee a complete freedom from such binding ideas, like racism, is irrational, a beginning to the process is needed. Gaines ignites the possibility within each of his readers and helps to create the belief in personal capability, despite the setbacks one can face. In short, Gaines eloquently bestows upon every one of his pupils an invaluable message. One that will hopefully serve to brighten the tapestry we each weave and impart to those who live in our footsteps; our own lesson before dying."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"A lesson Before Dying by Ernest Gaines is a heartwarming book of a man who surmounts obstacles in which aren't in his favor. The setting of the novel is in the late 1900's in a small town in Bayonne, Louisiana. Even though it is a long way from slavery and diversity is still big in this community.The narrator of this story is a young teacher named grant who feels like his own town is run down and depressed. Soon enough in the novel you are introduced to another young man named Jefferson. The only difference about this young man is that he is black. Jefferson is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is in a liquor store when two men come in with pistols and start shooting the owner. When the alarm goes off and the police arrive, Jefferson is the only one left in the store. Grant did not go to that trial but he states, \\"I was not there, yet I was there.\\" He could predict that Jefferson would not be able to defend his innocence. Jefferson's grandma asks Grant to turn her godson into a mature adult. \\"I want you to show them the difference between what they think you are and what you can be,\\" says grant.This is one of my all time favorite books I have ever read, and it teaches you about the struggles that African Americans went threw in the 1900's. This novel is high quality from the beginning to end, but the ending is amazing. The ending is one where after you have finished you want to read it again and again. You want there to be a sequel so you can once again revisit the characters you know. I also found this novel very suspenseful and can sometimes play tricks on you. I do think that the book took up to many pages about the two men's relationship though. Unfortunately I can't tell you what is my favorite part in the book or else it would completely give the book away. In some ways this book is like To Kill a Mockingbird, because it really illustrates the bonds between two men and how life isn't going to go as planned. \\"I'm the teacher ... and I teach what the white folks around here tell me to teach--reading, writing, and \`arithmetic.

I LOVED IT!Which is worse, knowing you're going to be killed for something you didn't even do, loving the condemned man like a son, or being an aquaintance who can't do a damned thing about the injustice?This poignant story is set in 1948 Louisiana. Grant Wiggins is forced by his aunt and her best friend, Miss Emma, to help a young man condemned to death, and he is no more eager to help than Jefferson is to be helped. Jefferson was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he took a ride to town that ended up in a robbery turned shootout; since he was the only survivor, the all white jury found him guilty. With his day in the electric chair drawing near, Miss Emma wants Grant to teach her godson 'to be a man', to understand the injustice, and face the end with dignity so she and the community can be proud of him.Mr. Gaines shows the social injustice of that time and how impossibly hard it is to deal with a wrong we can not change. I got choked up reading this, especially the journal entry, and know these character will always haunt me. Gaines puts the reader in Grant and Jefferson's heads, then we feel our hearts being shredded by the circumstances.This is an excellent piece of literature that everyone should read, regardless of race, age, or anything else. It's important for people to understand how bad things were before Civil Rights, how horribly people of color were treated, and that is expertly shown in this novel."},{"Title":"A Lesson Before Dying (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)","review":"Mr. Gaines lives across lake from me.

Ernest Gaines' depiction of a young man's journey into self as he approaches a wrongful but inevitable death is heartwrenching and powerful. The &quot;Lessons&quot; of courage, strength and unrelenting faith in the face of cruelty is something that not only Jefferson acquires but the reader is compelled to find as well. As the characters of this book learn several lessons of life and death, the reader is moved to find compassion and understanding for a man who, despite the unfair and demeaning name he is given by the townspeople (hog), is very much a human being. This is a very poignant look into the dynamics of capital punishment, racism, our judicial system as well as humanity and compassion for our fellow man.

When I first decided to read this book I thought it may be a little depressing, but before I even finished Chapter 1 I knew I wouldn't be able to put this book down. It was very simple and very easy to get into. I think it was something that everyone could relate to in some way or another.Grant Wiggins really brought tears to my eyes at the end of this story. I think the reason he cried when he heard that Jefferson had died like a man was because (1) he didn't understand why he was even helping him because he was going to die anyway and (2) I think he cried because he finally received salvation. Anytime someone receives a spiritual revelation it always brings joy even in the midst of a bad situation. Although Jefferson was executed, there were three events that brought me joy: Jefferson's belief in God, Grant's determination to really help Jefferson in the end, and Grant's own belief and acceptance of God. I think he really believed in himself for the first time.I am looking forward in reading more books by Mr. Gaines. I recommend anyone with any type of spiritual appetite to read this book, it will definitely fill you up.This book makes dying not seem so bad. The irony of it all, was that Jefferson was the person to be executed and when his day came, he ws the only &quot;man&quot; in the room. The deputies and the sheriff didn't really look like &quot;men&quot; themselves because of what they were about to do. The sheriff seemed so macho in this book and kind of tough, but according to the deputy, Jefferson was the only &quot;man&quot; in that room during the electrocution.

By the time I finished reading the chapter representing Jefferson's Diary, I was glad I had a NEW box of tissues.Jefferson is a young, black man in 1940s Louisiana who is facing the death sentence as a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. His companions killed a white man and ended up dead themselves in the bargain. Jefferson got caught, tried, and convicted to death. But that's not really the story, just the backdrop.You see, in his summation, his own attorney compares Jefferson to a hog, and his godmother is determined that, while he may die, Jefferson is going to walk to that electric chair as a man, not a hog.The duty of teaching Jefferson to be a man falls to Grant Wiggins, the local teacher whose aunt, along with Jefferson's godmother, lay the task at his feet.What follows is a story that paints a vivid picture of the hopes, loves, frustrations, and small victories of a black man in a white world. And, while I like to think that the world Mr. Gaines has painted in his book existed only in the 1940s, I know that some of the same frustrations Mr. Wiggins expresses on page 166 are still felt today.Read this book.

I was a little confused in the beginning. I thought the narrator's voice was that of a child since he was referring to coming home from school and passing his mother and Jefferson's nannan at the table and wanting to avoid them on the way upstairs. But it was a school teacher's voice. And what a wonderful voice it turned out to be! The teacher does not sugarcoat his own mixed feelings when faced with the task of meeting again and again with Jefferson, a young black man who has been condemned for a murder he did not commit, a young man whose attorney had argued for mercy on the grounds that sending Jefferson to the electric chair would be no different than electrocuting a hog. Jefferson's nannan wants the teacher to give him lessons on going through his terrible fate with dignity. The dignity of many lives, such as the children now growing up where Jefferson did, hangs on the outcome.
