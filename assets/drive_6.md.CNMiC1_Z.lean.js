Today there are more ways to publish than ever, and more challenges to traditional publishing. This ever-evolving landscape brings more confusion for authors trying to understand their options. The third edition of Getting It Published offers the clear, practicable guidance on choosing the best path to publication that has made it a trusted resource, now updated to include discussions of current best practices for submitting a proposal, of the advantages and drawbacks of digital publishing, and tips for authors publishing textbooks and in open-access environments. Germano argues that it s not enough for authors to write well they also need to write with an audience in mind. He provides valuable guidance on developing a compelling book proposal, finding the right publisher, evaluating a contract, negotiating the production process, and, finally, emerging as a published author.  This endlessly useful and expansive guide is every academic s pocket Wikipedia: a timely, relevant, and ready resource on scholarly publishing, from the traditional monograph to the digital e-book.

She didn't follow basic security protocol, which should have been second nature for her. And now Samantha's life hangs in the balance. Assertive and authoritative, Luke Patrick is the best the FBI has to offer. Nothing about Ara's story is adding up, and when Ara attempts to take control of the investigation, Luke is convinced she knows far more than she's saying.

Johnston and William T. Sherman as army field commanders.The two-day battle of Resaca proved to be an experience that would cause Sherman to alter the patterns of strategy and tactics in the campaign that followed. Disappointed by McPherson's lack of aggressiveness on two occasions, and Hooker's bungled attack on Hood's Corps on May 15, Sherman abandoned General Grant's injunction to go after Johnston's army and break it up. Instead, he reversed the original sequence of the plan by turning to the strategy of maneuver. Sherman's resulting famous flanking maneuvers eventually led to his capturing Atlanta in September.The first book-length treatment of this important battle, The Battle of Resaca is a necessary addition for civil war historians and libraries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S66C-WPz1SIC&dq=The+Battle+of+Resaca+(Civil+War+Georgia)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of Firearms Assembly/Disassembly, Pt.

Within the burning building a Dutchman going by the name of Marinus van der Lubbe was arrested for the arson. The Nazi-party, at that time the biggest party in the German Parliament, claimed that the communists were behind the fire and were trying to topple the government. At the same time the Communist Party claimed that the Nazi s had staged the fire in order to create a pretext for them to crack down hard on their (political) enemies. Marinus van der Lubbe was executed after stating in court that he worked alone. The consensus in Europe was that the Nazi s had staged the fire for their own political gain. After the Second World War a lively debate sprung up on whether or not Marinus van der Lubbe had received help from the Nazi s or had he worked alone. Up to the present day this debate is ongoing. Paul Kuijpers links the different predominant views on the Reichstag fire to the specific circumstances of the time in which they were predominant in an attempt to deconstruct the myths surrounding the Reichstag fire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1a0kkgAACAAJ&dq=The+Reichstag+fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Learning Paradigm College","description":"In The Learning Paradigm College, John Tagg builds on the ground-breaking Change magazine article he coauthored with Robert Barr in 1995,  From Teaching to Learning; A New Paradigm for Undergraduate Education.  That piece defined a paradigm shift happening in American higher education, placing more importance on learning outcomes and less on the quantity of instruction. As Tagg defines it,  Where the Instruction Paradigm highlights formal processes, the Learning Paradigm emphasizes results or outcomes. Where the Instruction Paradigm attends to classes, the Learning Paradigm attends to students.  The Learning Paradigm College presents a new lens through which faculty and administrators can see their own institutions and their own work. The book examines existing functional frameworks and offers a way to reenvision and recast many familiar aspects of college work and college life, so that readers may better understand their learners and move toward a framework that focuses on learning outcomes. Divided into five parts, the book introduces the Learning Paradigm, concentrates on understanding our learners, provides a framework for producing learning, discusses the six essential features of the Learning Paradigm college, and focuses on how to become a Learning Paradigm college. Eminently clear and accessible descriptions of the features of the Learning Paradigm are paired with examples of how institutions of higher education around the country are transforming themselves into Learning Paradigm colleges. The Learning Paradigm College is both hopeful and realistic about what all those involved in higher education can achieve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GnudAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Learning+Paradigm+College&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncertainty","description":"Praise for the First Edition \\"...a reference for everyone who is interested in knowing and handling uncertainty.\\"  Journal of Applied Statistics The critically acclaimed First Edition of Understanding Uncertainty provided a study of uncertainty addressed to scholars in all fields, showing that uncertainty could be measured by probability, and that probability obeyed three basic rules that enabled uncertainty to be handled sensibly in everyday life. These ideas were extended to embrace the scientific method and to show how decisions, containing an uncertain element, could be rationally made. Featuring new material, the Revised Edition remains the go-to guide for uncertainty and decision making, providing further applications at an accessible level including: A critical study of transitivity, a basic concept in probability A discussion of how the failure of the financial sector to use the proper approach to uncertainty may have contributed to the recent recession A consideration of betting, showing that a bookmaker's odds are not expressions of probability Applications of the book s thesis to statistics A demonstration that some techniques currently popular in statistics, like significance tests, may be unsound, even seriously misleading, because they violate the rules of probability Understanding Uncertainty, Revised Edition is ideal for students studying probability or statistics and for anyone interested in one of the most fascinating and vibrant fields of study in contemporary science and mathematics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RhgfAgAAQBAJ&dq=Uncertainty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duplicate Bridge Direction : A Complete Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IgOltgEACAAJ&dq=Duplicate+Bridge+Direction+:+A+Complete+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","description":"Discusses the different capacities of the right and left sides of the brain, shedding new light on the way the brain constructs a coherent life","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0VTuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Right+Mind:+Making+Sense+of+the+Hemispheres&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Gardening (101 Essential Tips)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_4IxReJm0dUC&dq=Basic+Gardening+(101+Essential+Tips)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronologies in Old World Archaeology, Vols. 1& 2","description":"Provides the chronological framework and reference materials necessary to investigate and interpret origins, relationships, and processes such as diffusion, migration, local evolution, change or survival, and the like covering the period from the earliest settlements down to a natural breaking point","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lmp5xAEACAAJ&dq=Chronologies+in+Old+World+Archaeology,+Vols.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Safe Return Doubtful","description":"Farthest north, farthest south - in the heroic age of polar exploration at the beginning of the twentieth century, the race was ferociously contested. British, American, Swedish and Norwegian expeditions all vied for the greatest prize of all - the poles - knowing that they might forfeit their lives in the attempt. On the way they faced horrific conditions, frostbite and starvation rations, exhaustion and too often also the bitter clashes of personality that beset men under extreme stress. In these days of modern technology, it is almost impossible for us to imagine the hardship these explorers endured. Sledgers camped overnight in subzero agony, their sweat-soaked furs frozen into icy suits of armour as soon as they stopped moving. With no vitamins and no easily preserved food they faced scurvy and worse. This hair-raising account covers every aspect of the polar great game, the renowned names such as Robert Peary, Roald Amundsen, Salomon Andree, Fridtjof Nansen, Ernest Shackleton, and Robert Scott are all here, their ponies, dogs and sledges, their daily experiences, and always, the addictive quest for polar immortality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CtuAAAAAMAAJ&dq=Safe+Return+Doubtful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a Dark Time: The Apocalyptic Temper in the American Novel of the Nuclear Age","description":"\\"What was gunpowder?\\" Trivial. What was electricity? Meaningless. This atomic bomb is the Second Coming in wrath.\\" - Winston Churchill, July 1945 Commencing earnestly in the1960s, the American novel began its exploration into how mankind could adjustto life in the shadow of the mushroom cloud, how we could begin to think aboutthe Unthinkable. American writers faced squarely the age birthed by nuclearphysics and found in its very darkness difficult avenues to hope byrediscovering that most potent, traditional response to a history in crisis:the apocalyptic temper. Dewey focuses on seven novelsthat touch the variety of generic experiments and postures of the post-WorldWar II American novel. These novels by Vonnegut, Coover, Percy, Pynchon,Gaddis, and DeLillo represent a significant argument concerning the Americanliterary response to living within the oppressive technologies of the NuclearAge. Departing from other studies that veer toward speculative fiction ortoward the more narrowly defined religious angles, In a Dark Time defines the apocalyptic temper as a most traditionalliterary genre that articulates the anxieties of a community in crisis, a wayfor that community to respond to the perception of a history gone critical byturning squarely to that history and to find, in that gesture, the way toward agenuine hope. Dewey's new approach consistsof applying the theory of apocalyptic literature to a body of essentiallysecular writings. Dewey resists the traditional approach - studying worksdealing with nuclear devastation - to focus on how a generation of literaryresponses have dealt with the larger questions about how to live with therecognition of End times. Dewey convincingly demonstrates that this literaturereminds its moments in history that only in a dark time will the eye begin tosee.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7L0NjKxWFWIC&dq=In+a+Dark+Time:+The+Apocalyptic+Temper+in+the+American+Novel+of+the+Nuclear+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Top Open Source Programs - A list and review of the best open source applications","description":"The pervasiveness of and universal access to modern Information and Communication Technologies has enabled a popular new paradigm in the dissemination of information, art, and ideas.

Each year billions of animals are poisoned, dissected, displaced, killed for consumption, or held in captivity to be discarded as soon as their utility to humans has waned. The animal world has never been under greater peril. A broad-ranging collection of essays, Animal Geographies contributes to a much-needed, fundamental rethinking about our relation to animals. Animal Geographies explores the diverse ways in which animals shape the formation of human identity, looking, for example, at the racialization and gendering of animal images. From questions of identity and subjectivity, it moves to consideration of the places where people and animals confront the realities of coexistence on an everyday basis. It then examines the ways in which animals figure in the ongoing globalization of production and mass consumption, and finally, takes up legal and ethical approaches to human-animal relations. Animal Geographies compels a profound rethinking of the history of our relations with animals and offers a series of proposals for reconstituting this relationship on a progressive basis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-AWag5IvaHkC&dq=The+Soul+of+the+Wolf:+A+Meditation+on+Wolves+and+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Messiah of Laguardia, The","description":"In the \\"Messiah of LaGuardia,\\" author Elisha Porat collects six stories of modern Israeli life.

Wohlgelernter defines the author's \\"excited imagination\\" by thoroughgoing analysis of the work's constituent parts. He gives particular emphasis to the author's own words and expressions, those verbal inventions that linger in the mind long after the act of reading or criticism. He finds a passionate love of words and language forging a powerful link between Jewish and Irish literature, rooted as they are in similar historical experience. Both literatures engage the human struggle with life and death, virtue and weakness, success and failure, dreams and nightmares, all under the constant surveillance of tradition. Wohlgelernter divides his book into four general categories: the Holocaust, Jewish-American writers, Irish writers, and memoirs and autobiography. His chapters on Holocaust literature engage a range of literary perspectives that combine memoir, journalism, fiction, and philosophical reflection in the writings of Ladislas Fuks, Lucy Dawidowicz, Sabine Reichel, and Primo Levi. Chapters on postwar Jewish writers including Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, and Philip Roth explore the ambivalences of assimilation with its encroachments of a provincial past and dissatisfactions with mainstream culture. Wohlgelernter notes how all yoke street raciness and high cultural mandarin in a distinctive contribution to American prose style. A similar richness of language and preoccupation with the political and cultural claims of the past characterize the chapters on the great short story writer Frank O'Connor, the playwright Brendan Behan, and the Irish-American journalist and novelist Pete Hamill. The last decades of the twentieth century have seen a prolific outpouring of autobiographical writing, and in the concluding section of the book the author treats representative examples that amplify or reflect on the personal and historical themes encountered in Jewish and Irish fiction: assimilation, personal ambition, intermarriage, and political allegiance. Among the writers treated here are Norman Podhoretz, Calvin Trillin, James McBride, Ari Goldman, and Howard Shack. Wohlgelernter's emphasis on the timeless, recurring themes of literature is matched by a lucidity of style and soundness of method that yield what is central to all criticism, namely insight. Jewish Writers/Irish Writers will be of interest to literary scholars, Jewish studies specialists, and cultural historians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4Wn7swEACAAJ&dq=Jewish+Writers/Irish+Writers:+Selected+Essays+on+the+Love+of+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maggie Craig","description":"Fans of Katie Flynn, Rosie Harris and Catherine Cookson will love this compelling and captivating saga by bestselling and prizewinning author Marie Joseph.

In Battling Pornography, Carolyn Bronstein locates the origins of anti-pornography sentiment in the turbulent social and cultural history of the late 1960s and 1970s. Based on extensive original archival research, the book reveals that the seeds of the movement were planted by groups who protested the proliferation of advertisements, Hollywood films and other mainstream media that glorified sexual violence. Over time, feminist leaders redirected the emphasis from violence to pornography to leverage rhetorical power. Battling Pornography presents a fascinating account of the rise and fall of this significant American social movement and documents the contributions of influential activists on both sides of the pornography debate, including some of the best-known American feminists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anthology of World Poetry, An","description":"This long-awaited, indispensable volume contains more than 1600 poems drawn from dozens of languages and cultures, and spans a period of more than 4000 years from ancient Sumer and Egypt to the late twentieth century. World Poetry encompasses the many realms of poetry -- poetry of all styles, of all eras, of all tongues: from the ancient epic of Gilgamesh and the Pharaoh Akhenaten's \\"Hymn to the Sun\\" to the haiku of Basho and the dazzling imagery of Li Po; from Vedic hymns to Icelandic sagas to the \\"Carmina Burana\\"; from the magnificence of Homer and Dante to the lyricism of Goethe and Verlaine; from the piercing insights of Rilke and Yeats to the revelatory verse of Emily Dickinson, Garcia Lorca, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, and so many more. While World Poetry includes a generous selection of the best English-language verse from Chaucer to the present, it is designed to lay before the reader the best that all the world's cultures have to offer -- more than eighty percent of the book is poetry originally written in languages other than English and translated by some of the finest talents working today, many of them brilliant poets in their own right.

Recognizing the psychological problem involved, he takes young St. Helier in hand and becomes his friend and mentor. With unflagging interest the reader follows the steps by which, through many trials and adventures, Michael is brought face to face with his own problems and is able, in the end, to confront his future with courage.

The very notion of a private sphere, as divorced from the immoral excesses of chattel slavery as from the amoral logic of market laws, functioned to conceal from public scrutiny the day-to-day struggles between enslaved women and their mistresses, subsumed within a logic of patriarchy. One of emancipation's unsung consequences was precisely the exposure to public view of the unbridgeable social distance between the women on whose labor the plantation household relied and the women who employed them. This is a story of race and gender, nation and citizenship, freedom and bondage in the nineteenth century South; a big abstract story that is composed of equally big personal stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oMunAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","description":"Psychologist Alex Delaware and his friend, homicide detective Milo Sturgis, investigate the disappearance of a gravely ill child and the murder of his parents, a search that leads to a reclusive religious cult and the discovery of hidden family secrets","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uaesHljTTacC&dq=Blood+Test+(Signet)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Return of the Eagle","description":"This is the story of how a nation reversed a  silent spring  and saved the bald eagle from extinction. This bird of prey was declared the national symbol in 1782 but, by the 1960s, pollution and development had wiped out all but a few dozen. Grassroots movements started, the American consciousness was raised to all environmental threats, and federal laws were passed to keep the eagle population alive. This stunning book of full-color photographs and touching stories chronicles this inspiring success story with awe-inspiring shots of eagles in flight. There is also a one-of-a-kind directory to more than 150 areas in the nation where eagles are likely to be seen in the wild, soaring once again against the blue skies of freedom. This book is a monument to the efforts that combined animal instinct for survival with the power of the human spirit to change the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V-jcCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","description":"Gateways to Understanding Music explores music in all the categories that constitute contemporary musical experience: European classical music, popular music, jazz, and world music. Covering the oldest forms of human music making to the newest, the chronological narrative considers music from a global rather than a Eurocentric perspective. Each of sixty modular \\"gateways\\" covers a particular genre, style, or period of music. Every gateway opens with a guided listening example that unlocks a world of music through careful study of its structural elements. Based on their listening experience, students are asked to consider how the piece came to be composed or performed, how the piece or performance responded to the social and cultural issues at the time and place of its creation, and what that music means today. Students learn to listen to, explain, understand, and ultimately value all the music they may encounter in their world. FEATURES Global scope Presents all music as worthy of study, including classical, world, popular, and jazz. Historical narrative Begins with small-scale forager societies up to the present, with a shifting focus from global to European to American influences. Modular framework 60 gateways in 14 chapters allow flexibility to organize chronologically or by the seven recurring themes: aesthetics, emotion, social life, links to culture, politics, economics, and technology. Listening-guided learning Leads to understanding the emotion, meaning, significance, and history of music. Introduction of musical concepts Defined as needed and compiled into a Glossary for reference. Consistent structure With the same step-by-step format, students learn through repeated practice how to listen and how to think about music.

William Dalrymple It was a scandal thatrocked the highest echelons of the British Raj. In 1891, a notorious jewellerand curio dealer from Simla offered to sell the world's largest brilliant-cutdiamond to the fabulously wealthy Nizam of Hyderabad. If the audacious dealsucceeded it would set the merchant up for life. But the transaction wenthorribly wrong. The Nizam accused him of fraud, triggering a sensational trialin the Calcutta High Court that made headlines around the world. The dealer was AlexanderMalcolm Jacob, a man of mysterious origins. After arriving penniless in Bombayin 1865, he became the most famous purveyor of precious stones in princelyIndia, and a confidante of Viceroys and Maharajas. Jacob also excelled in themagical arts.

Combative atheists have denounced faiths of every stripe, resulting in a crude intellectual polarization in which religious convictions and heritage must be rejected or accepted wholesale. In the long unavailable Atheism in Christianity, Ernst Bloch provides a way out from this either/or debate. He examines the origins of Christianity in an attempt to find its social roots, pursuing a detailed study of the Bible and its fascination for  ordinary and unimportant  people. In the biblical promise of utopia and the scriptures  antagonism to authority, Bloch locates Christianity s appeal to the oppressed. Through a lyrical yet close and nuanced analysis, he explores the tensions within the Bible that promote atheism as a counter to the authoritarian metaphysical theism imposed by clerical exegesis. At the Bible s heart he finds a heretical core and the concealed message that, paradoxically, a good Christian must necessarily be a good atheist.This new edition includes an introduction by Peter Thompson, the Director of the Centre for Enrst Bloch Studies at the University of Sheffield.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AupOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Atheism+in+Christianity%3B:+The+religion+of+the+Exodus+and+the+Kingdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jem, secret star","description":"When Jem and the Holograms are asked to make a movie, Jerrica Benton relies on the special computer Synergy to keep her identity as Jem a secret.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wSboXgLhBBwC&dq=Jem,+secret+star&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Emily Dickinson","description":"In this tribute to Emily Dickinson, Barnet presents 24 charcoal drawings along with 46 of Dickinson's poems.

Here, a young man's life is about poking at the pretensions of the city's elders with American music, bad poetry, and slightly better journalism. And then, his life in Chicago: watching from afar as war breaks out in Sarajevo and the city comes under siege, no way to return home; his parents and sister fleeing Sarajevo with the family dog, leaving behind all else they had ever known; and Hemon himself starting a new life, his own family, in this new city. And yet this is not really a memoir. The Book of My Lives, Hemon's first book of nonfiction, defies convention and expectation. It is a love song to two different cities; it is a heartbreaking paean to the bonds of family; it is a stirring exhortation to go out and play soccer and not for the exercise. It is a book driven by passions but built on fierce intelligence, devastating experience, and sharp insight. And like the best narratives, it is a book that will leave you a different reader a different person, with a new way of looking at the world when you've finished. For fans of Hemon's fiction, The Book of My Lives is simply indispensable; for the uninitiated, it is the perfect introduction to one of the great writers of our time.A Kirkus Reviews Best Nonfiction Book of 2013","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GTjQD9lNJqMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prose Merlin (TEAMS Middle English Texts)","description":"With its contextualizing introduction, notes, and gloss, this edition makes the Prose Merlin available to any student of Arthurian legend, no matter their level of proficiency in Middle English.

Written with Dora Black (who became Russell's second wife) on a trip to China in 1920, it is revealing both as a period piece and as a book for our times. Russell criticises his own age, and demonstrates how humanity perpetually struggles against the centralising forces of industrialism and nationalism.He views industrialism as a threat to human freedom, as it creates large populations which have to be subject to controls and he likens Bolshevik Russia to Cromwell's England, asserting that both were dictatorships designed to force an essentially feudal society to adopt industrialism. He sees industrialism and nationalism as fundamentally linked and proposes one government for the whole world as a solution.Russell is not blind to the positive side of industrialism; without machines an economy of subsistence would be the best for which society could hope, but argues that the global village and prevailing political democracy should be its eventual results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Cb0DvdV9nz4C&dq=The+prospects+of+industrial+civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","description":"In her first adventure for British Intelligence Modesty Blaise with her loyal lieutenant, Willie Garvin, must foil a multi-million pound diamond heist.

Perfect for fans of Lee Child and John Sandford. 'Lescroart plays out clues with the patience and cunning of a master fly fisherman' - Orlando Sentinel To the outside world, it looks like Dismas Hardy is finally on top. A managing partner at his thriving law firm but beneath the surface bravado, Hardy has lost his faith in the law. Now he has a high-profile and challenging case: a seventeen-year-old arrested for the double slaying of his girlfriend and his English teacher. As the case moves swiftly to trial, Hardy can't even turn to his old friend Abe Glitsky for help. San Francisco has been seized by a wave of violence and an embattled Glitsky must somehow stop the criminal upsurge while being hounded by a hostile media. With the city on the verge of panic, Hardy's search for the truth takes him down a perilous path.

Pech promises Lucas all the luck in the world in return for a few criminal favors: the seduction of a local married woman with the intent of making her commit suicide, a massacre of stray cats, and the poisoning of some of the township s homeless. Lucas agrees, hoping to gain the woman of his dreams as his mistress and become filthy rich through the unique enchantments of Gato Pech. He does, but his gains are short-lived.

A gifted writer . . . explores the bonds of sisterhood while powerfully evoking the often nightmarish American immigrant experience.

In 1937, Shanghai is the Paris of Asia, a city of great wealth and glamour, the home of millionaires and beggars, gangsters and gamblers, patriots and revolutionaries, artists and warlords. Thanks to the financial security and material comforts provided by their father s prosperous rickshaw business, twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Though both sisters wave off authority and tradition, they couldn t be more different: Pearl is a Dragon sign, strong and stubborn, while May is a true Sheep, adorable and placid. Both are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth and that in order to repay his debts he must sell the girls as wives to suitors who have traveled from California to find Chinese brides. As Japanese bombs fall on their beloved city, Pearl and May set out on the journey of a lifetime, one that will take them through the Chinese countryside, in and out of the clutch of brutal soldiers, and across the Pacific to the shores of America. In Los Angeles they begin a fresh chapter, trying to find love with the strangers they have married, brushing against the seduction of Hollywood, and striving to embrace American life even as they fight against discrimination, brave Communist witch hunts, and find themselves hemmed in by Chinatown s old ways and rules. At its heart, Shanghai Girls is a story of sisters: Pearl and May are inseparable best friends who share hopes, dreams, and a deep connection, but like sisters everywhere they also harbor petty jealousies and rivalries. They love each other, but each knows exactly where to drive the knife to hurt the other the most. Along the way they face terrible sacrifices, make impossible choices, and confront a devastating, life-changing secret, but through it all the two heroines of this astounding new novel hold fast to who they are: Shanghai girls.

The only people left in the shattered, bombed-out city are the lost, abandoned children whose only goal is to survive another day. None could imagine that they would become fearless fighters and the unlikeliest heroes of World War II. They are the warriors immortalized in Street Boys, Lorenzo Carcaterra s exhilarating new novel, a book that exceeds even his bestselling Sleepers as a riveting reading experience. It s late September. The war in Europe is almost won. Italy is leaderless, Mussolini already arrested by anti-Fascists. The German army has evacuated the city of Naples. Adults, even entire families, have been marched off to work camps or simply sent off to their deaths. Now, the German army is moving toward Naples to finish the job. Their chilling instructions are: If the city can t belong to Hitler, it will belong to no one. No one but children. Children who have been orphaned or hidden by parents in a last, defiant gesture against the Nazis. Children, some as young as ten years old, armed with just a handful of guns, unexploded bombs, and their own ingenuity. Children who are determined to take on the advancing enemy and save the city or die trying. There is Vincenzo Soldari, a sixteen-year-old history buff who is determined to make history by leading others with courage and self-confidence; Carlo Maldini, a middle-aged drunkard desperate to redeem himself by adding his experience to the raw exuberance of the young fighters; Nunzia Maldini, his nineteen-year-old daughter, who helps her father regain his self-respect  and loses her heart to an American G.I.; Corporal Steve Connors, a soldier sent out on reconnaissance, then cut off from his comrades with no choice but to aid the street boys; Colonel Rudolph Van Klaus, the proud Nazi commander shamed by his own sadistic mission; and, of course, the dozens of young boys who use their few skills and great heart to try to save their city, their country, and themselves. In its compassionate portrait of the rootless young, and its pitiless portrayal of the violence that is at once their world and their way out, Street Boys continues and deepens Lorenzo Carcaterra s trademark themes. In its awesome scope and pure page-turning excitement, it stands as a stirring tribute to the underdog in us all and as a singular addition to the novels about World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cyvtcZO103oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","description":"Biography of the English physicist","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c02WiSX_dT4C&dq=The+Life+of+Isaac+Newton+(Canto+original+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theology of the Shorter Pauline Letters (New Testament Theology)","description":"This book breaks new ground in offering an exposition of the theological message of the Shorter Pauline Letters.

She focuses particularly on the influence of Scottish notions of progress, tracing the extent to which planters in South Carolina, Georgia, and British East Florida perceived themselves as a modern, improving people. She reads developments in agricultural practice as indices of planters' desire for progress, and she demonstrates the central role played by slavery in their pursuit of modern life. By linking behavior and ideas, Chaplin has produced a work of cultural history that unites intellectual, social, and economic history. Using public records as well as planters' and farmers' private papers, Chaplin examines innovations in rice, indigo, and cotton cultivation as a window through which to see planters' pursuit of a modern future. She demonstrates that planters actively sought to improve their society and economy even as they suffered a pervasive anxiety about the corrupting impact of progress and commerce. The basis for their accomplishments and the root of their anxieties, according the Chaplin, were the same: race-based chattel slavery. Slaves provied the labor necessary to attain planters' vision of the modern, but the institution ultimately limited the Lower South's ability to compete in the contemporary world. Indeed, whites continued to wonder whether their innovations, some of them defied by slaves, truly improved the region. Chaplin argues that these apprehensions prefigured the antimodern stance of the antebellum period, but she contends that they were as much a reflection of the doubt inherent in theories of progress as an outright rejection of those ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xS3qCQAAQBAJ&dq=An+Anxious+Pursuit:+Agricultural+Innovation+and+Modernity+in+the+Lower+South,+1730-1815&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Are Somebody","description":"This book is has poems and poetry as well as short stories about people who over came their circumstances and achieved their goals through the power of God and their holding on to their belief.This book inspires believers as well as nonbelievers that God is alive.

From the author of the Golden Globe winner and Academy Award winner Argo... Moscow, 1988. The twilight of the Cold War. The KGB is at its most ruthless, and has now indisputably gained the upper hand over the CIA in the intelligence war. But no one knows how. Ten CIA agents and double-agents have gone missing in the last three years. They have either been executed or they are unaccounted for. At Langley, several theories circulate as to how the KGB seems suddenly to have become telepathic, predicting the CIA's every move. Some blame the defection of Edward Lee Howard three years before, and suspect that there are more high-placed moles to be unearthed. Others speculate that the KGB's surveillance successes have been heightened by the invention of an invisible electromagnetic powder that allows them to keep tabs on anyone who touches it: spy dust. CIA officers Tony Mendez and Jonna Goeser come together to head up a team of technical wizards and operational specialists, determined to solve the mystery that threatens to overshadow the Cold War's final act. Working against known and unknown hostile forces, as well as some unfriendly elements within the CIA, they devise controversial new operational methods and techniques to foil the KGB, and show the extraordinary lengths that US intelligence is willing to go to protect a source, then rescue him when his world starts to collapse. At the same time, Tony and Jonna find themselves falling deeply in love. During a fascinating odyssey that began in Indochina fifteen years before and ends in a breathtakingly daring operation in the heart of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, Spy Dust catapults the reader from the Hindu Kush to Hollywood, from Havana to Moscow, but cannot truly conclude until its protagonists are safely wedded in rural Maryland.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U0eEd6Jc3koC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimating Device Reliability:: Assessment of Credibility (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","description":"Estimating Device Reliability: Assessment of Credibility is concerned with the plausibility of reliability estimates obtained from statistical models. Statistical predictions are necessary because technology is always pushing into unexplored areas faster than devices can be made long-lived by design. Flawed reliability methodologies can produce disastrous results, an outstanding example of which is the catastrophic failure of the manned space shuttle CHALLENGER in January 1986. This issue is not whether, but which, statistical models should be used. The issue is not making reliability estimates, but is instead their credibility. The credibility questions explored in the context of practical applications include: What does the confidence level associated with the use of statistical model mean? Is the numerical result associated with a high confidence level beyond dispute? When is it appropriate to use the exponential (constant hazard rate) model? Does this model always provide the most conservative reliability estimate? Are the results of traditional \`random' failure hazard rate calculations tenable? Are there persuasive alternatives? What model should be used to describe the useful life of a device when wearout is absent? When Weibull and lognormal failure plots containing a large number of failure times appear similar, how should the correct wearout model be selected? Is it important to distinguish between a conservative upper bound on a probability of failure and a realistic estimate of the same probability? Estimating Device Reliability: Assessment of Credibility is for those who are obliged to make reliability calculations with a paucity of somewhat corrupt data, by using inexact models, and by making physical assumptions which are impractical to verify. Illustrative examples deal with a variety of electronic devices, ICs and lasers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ITsAnastaz4C&dq=Estimating+Device+Reliability::+Assessment+of+Credibility+(The+Springer+International+Series+in+Engineering+and+Computer+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samurai Fighting Arts: The Spirit and the Practice","description":"This book introduces the world of traditional Japanese martial arts and will provide readers with a deeper understanding of Bushido and Japan. Also known as Kobudo, these traditional martial arts can be seen as a continuation of samurai culture and comprise a number of styles formulated in the samurai era that are still being taught today. Aiming to develop Bujutsu (martial arts) and Heiho (strategy) to the highest possible degree, the samurai devised a code consisting of over eighteen arts. A samurai should have impeccable manners and be an expert in martial arts, but he should never be a killer. His swords contained his soul, which he cultivated by learning poetry and art, and by practicing Zen meditation. The author is the world-famous Kobudo grandmaster. He knows all the Kobudo styles, and his teaching of arts such as Iaijutsu and Jujitsu fascinates many students around the world. This is his first book in English, and it offers readers the opportunity to learn the lesser known arts of Kobudo,particularly the way of Nito Ryu-the two-swords method created by the famous samurai Miyamoto Musashi, and to understand the spirit behind it. Lavishly illustrated with around 700 photographs, Samurai Fighting Arts reveals many secret skills of Kobudo. It is divided into five chapters: Kobudo and its history; Kumiuchi Hyoho; Nito Ryu - the two-sword method; Iai and Kenpo; and Classical Kenjutsu and its application.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sBWasQSsb-UC&dq=Samurai+Fighting+Arts:+The+Spirit+and+the+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Machine Vision","description":"In the last 40 years, machine vision has evolved into a mature field embracing a wide range of applications including surveillance, automated inspection, robot assembly, vehicle guidance, traffic monitoring and control, signature verification, biometric measurement, and analysis of remotely sensed images. While researchers and industry specialists continue to document their work in this area, it has become increasingly difficult for professionals and graduate students to understand the essential theory and practicalities well enough to design their own algorithms and systems. This book directly addresses this need. As in earlier editions, E.R. Davies clearly and systematically presents the basic concepts of the field in highly accessible prose and images, covering essential elements of the theory while emphasizing algorithmic and practical design constraints. In this thoroughly updated edition, he divides the material into horizontal levels of a complete machine vision system. Application case studies demonstrate specific techniques and illustrate key constraints for designing real-world machine vision systems.   Includes solid, accessible coverage of 2-D and 3-D scene analysis.   Offers thorough treatment of the Hough Transform a key technique for inspection and surveillance.

As such, Ostrogorski's two-volume study of the party system in Britain and the United States exerted profound influence on the subsequent writings of Max Weber and Robert Michels. A descriptive analyst of the party system in these two countries, Ostrogorski developed concepts and methods that an-ticipated by nearly half a century those later used by American and British political scientists. The core of Ostrogorski's analysis is a detailed history of the rise of and changes within the party system in Britain and the United States, the first nations to introduce mass suffrage. While the emphasis of Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties is on the similar trends in the political parties of both countries, Ostrogorski also showed concern with the sources of differences between them. Seeking to explain these variations, he suggested a number of fundamental hypotheses about these two societies that con-tinue to be of relevance today. Lipset's substantial introduction places Os-trogorski's work within its historical context and assesses Ostrogorski's im-pact and influence on both his contemporaries and on later political scien-tists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dPdKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We'Moon 2006 Calendar: Gaia Rhythms for Womyn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6CEsAQAAIAAJ&dq=We%27Moon+2006+Calendar:+Gaia+Rhythms+for+Womyn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English wayfaring life in the middle ages: (XIVth century)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Z0zAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rene Magritte (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RegyAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rene+Magritte+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romeo & Juliet & West Side Story","description":"Overal in haar lijf kriebelde het.

You've heard all the football clich s: \\"Their offense is too predictable,\\" or \\"They've got to win the turnover battle,\\" or \\"They didn't make any halftime adjustments.\\" Perhaps you've heard them so often that you've come to see them as obvious truths. Phil Simms, after an illustrious career as a Super Bowlwinning quarterback and a broadcaster, is here to tell you that these -- and many other blanket statements taken as gospel -- are all myths, and whoever says them has no idea of what they're talking about. Drilling deep into the core of football, Simms also shows the hidden signs that players look for that can determine the outcome of a game. Whether it's discovering how a linebacker positions his feet before he blitzes or how to react if the safety is eight or nine yards from the line of scrimmage, knowing these \\"dirty little secrets\\" gives players and their coaches a tremendous advantage. In addition, Simms shares his insights into the enormous challenges coaches face in today's game, evaluating the top coaches and what makes them successful. He takes a look at some of the greatest players he's played with and against, and what he misses most about the game -- waking up Monday mornings feeling beat up and sore. He looks at the next generation of football players -- his son, Tampa Bay's Chris Simms, among them. Through it all, Simms shares stories from his playing days with Bill Parcells and the New York Giants, and the inside access he's had as an announcer for one of the top NFL broadcasting teams in football. Fun and lively, Sunday Morning Quarterback should be required reading for anyone who loves football.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kzvu6Cr48sgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keeping Fit","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOoA_HYKMMEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","description":"Four completely different students at Plumstead Middle School have one thing in common.

And in this day and age, more wedding theology is supplied by Modern Bride magazine or reality television than by any of the Christian treatises on holy matrimony. Indeed, church weddings have strayed long and far from distinctly Christian aspirations. The costumes and gestures might still be right, but the intentions are hardly religious. Why then, asks noted gay commentator Mark D. Jordan, are so many churches vehemently opposed to blessing same-sex unions? In this incisive work, Jordan shows how carefully selected ideals of Christian marriage have come to dominate recent debates over same-sex unions. Opponents of gay marriage, he reveals, too often confuse simplified ideals of matrimony with historical facts. They suppose, for instance, that there has been a stable Christian tradition of marriage across millennia, when in reality Christians have quarreled among themselves for centuries about even the most basic elements of marital theology, authorizing experiments like polygamy and divorce. Jordan also argues that no matter what the courts do, Christian churches will have to decide for themselves whether to bless same-sex unions. No civil compromise can settle the religious questions surrounding gay marriage. And queer Christians, he contends, will have to discover for themselves what they really want out of marriage. If they are not just after legal recognition as a couple or a place at the social table, do they really seek the blessing of God? Or just the garish melodrama of a white wedding? Posing trenchant questions such as these, Blessing Same-Sex Unions will be a must-read for both sides of the debate over gay marriage in America today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qeWZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","description":"In the 1910s and 1920s, when circus was the most popular form of entertainment in North America, Mabel Stark made her name in a man s world as the greatest female tiger trainer in history, the centre-ring finale act for the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Emerging out of informal conversations among three senior therapists, it examines the essential aspects of sandplay therapy as well as the depth and breadth of the human psyche. The book is organized into eight sections covering eight of the most important topics in sandplay - Therapist, Silence, Child, Mother, Self, Shadow, Chaos, and Numinous. Each section begins with a trialogue discussing theory, history and practice of sandplay in that area. The trialogues allow the reader to witness three senior therapists addressing and attempting to understand the many layers of each topic, and reflect their agreements and disagreements as they reveal their individual thoughts on, and personal experiences of, the themes they discuss. Each trialogue is followed by a set of solo presentations in which each author focuses on her contribution, and on the role of each topic in sandplay. Illustrated by original clinical examples, this unique approach addresses issues of concern to analysts and other psychotherapists. Its basic orientation makes it of particular value in the study, practice and teaching of sandplay therapy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aPWOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BstotgAACAAJ&dq=All+the+Finest+Girls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyewitness: Medieval Life (Eyewitness Books)","description":"DK Eyewitness Medieval Life is a unique and compelling introduction to the people and culture of the Middle Ages.

The Knights Templar also have a legendary, enigmatic aspect. Despite the immense volume of historical research available, plausible explanations to the  mystery  at the core of their practices have yet to be revealed. By studying these two themes side-by-side and showing their inner relationship, Veltman reveals valuable new perspectives. On the one hand he demonstrates that the  poetic imagination  of the Grail mystery has its origin in concrete historical events; and on the other hand, that the true history of the Knights Templar is, essentially, esoteric. Combining historical research with insights gained from the work of Rudolf Steiner, Veltman presents an impressive survey of the subject, beginning with the pre-Christian Mysteries and ending with a vision of Michaelic Christianity. He analyses the significance of the holy city of Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, the Temple Legend, the Grail Temple, the Rosicrucians, the Templars  gold, and the fraught question of evil. In addition, he sketches the continuation or metamorpho-sis of the Grail and Temple impulses into the future, including the critical  balancing  role of Europe between East and West. To become effective, this important European task  which, he says, is continually being thwarted  must be properly understood within the realm of human consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bM0nEAAAQBAJ&dq=Temple+of+The+Grail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Muir: My Life With Nature (Sharing Nature)","description":"A biography of the man known as \\"father of America's national parks\\" and an influential conservationist, told in the first person, using Muir's own words.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JHEAPwAACAAJ&dq=John+Muir:+My+Life+With+Nature+(Sharing+Nature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reproduction of Mothering Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender","description":"\\"The Reproduction of Mothering was that rare book that had a major impact on two different constituencies: feminists and psychoanalysts.

Of course they testify to all sorts of other things as well: godliness, faithfulness, the progress and regress of God's people, sinful?ness, judgment, and so on. But Jesus, along with the apostles and the other authors of the New Testament, emphasized that the Old Testament, above all, is about Him. Why then is the first question we often ask about a passage in the Old Testament, \\"What does this tell us about ourselves?\\" Surely, the first and main question we should ask is, \\"How does this passage testify to Christ?\\" In this book, Mark Dever has undertaken a difficult and important task. He has set out to crystallize the message of each Old Testament book, and he has endeavored to show something of the Christian value of each book. These sermons should not be regarded as models for routine preaching from the Old Testament, for rarely would the preacher try to cover a whole book in one sermon. But they do provide broad perspectives on the way the books point to Christ and are fulfilled by him. The preacher will need to extrapolate the principles of preaching Christ from the Old Testament and apply them to the textual units that are more appropriate for expository sermons. - Introduction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6sHdwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Message+of+the+Old+Testament:+Promises+Made&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Thomas Aquinas Daly: The Painting Season","description":"Second copy located in the general reference collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ggLAPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Thomas+Aquinas+Daly:+The+Painting+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide To the Gulf War","description":"Discusses the causes, military tactics, battles, and effects of the Persian Gulf War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tF9q3N90bWUC&dq=The+Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+To+the+Gulf+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse Games (Saddle Club, No.16)","description":"Stevie is excited about a great new sport  polocrosse.

Yet, biomedical and digital signal processing researchers rarely have expertise in practical medical applications, and medical instrumentation designers usually are unfamiliar with system theory. System Theory and Practical Applications for Biomedical Signals bridges those gaps in a practical manner, showing how various aspects of system theory are put into practice by industry. The chapters are intentionally organized in groups of two chapters, with the first chapter describing a system theory technology, and the second chapter describing an industrial application of this technology. Each theory chapter contains a general overview of a system theory technology, which is intended as background material for the application chapter. Each application chapter contains a history of a highlighted medical instrument, summary of appropriate physiology, discussion of the problem of interest and previous empirical solutions, and review of a solution that utilizes the theory in the previous chapter. Biomedical and DSP academic researchers pursuing grants and industry funding will find its real-world approach extremely valuable. Its in-depth discussion of the theoretical issues will clarify for medical instrumentation managers how system theory can compensate for less-than-ideal sensors. With application MATLAB?? exercises and suggestions for system theory course work included, the text also fills the need for detailed information for students or practicing engineers interested in instrument design.

You know something!  I would say if it could hear me.  Now tell it to us in language we can understand!  Since its publication in 2005, From Dissertation to Book has helped thousands of young academic authors get their books beyond the thesis committee and into the hands of interested publishers and general readers. Now revised and updated to reflect the evolution of scholarly publishing, this edition includes a new chapter arguing that the future of academic writing is in the hands of young scholars who must create work that meets the broader expectations of readers rather than the narrow requirements of academic committees. At the heart of From Dissertation to Book is the idea that revising the dissertation is fundamentally a process of shifting its focus from the concerns of a narrow audience a committee or advisors to those of a broader scholarly audience that wants writing to be both informative and engaging. William Germano offers clear guidance on how to do this, with advice on such topics as rethinking the table of contents, taming runaway footnotes, shaping chapter length, and confronting the limitations of jargon, alongside helpful timetables for light or heavy revision. Germano draws on his years of experience in both academia and publishing to show writers how to turn a dissertation into a book that an audience will actually enjoy, whether reading on a page or a screen. Germano also acknowledges that not all dissertations can or even should become books and explores other, often overlooked, options, such as turning them into journal articles or chapters in an edited work. With clear directions, engaging examples, and an eye for the idiosyncrasies of academic writing, From Dissertation to Book reveals to recent PhDs the secrets of careful and thoughtful revision a skill that will be truly invaluable as they add  author  to their curriculum vitae.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ro7zAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Be an Internet Pornographer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b4-AAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Be+an+Internet+Pornographer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring Newgrange","description":"Older that the Egyptian pyramids, older than Stonehenge, the tomb at Newgrange in County Meath, Ireland, is one of the oldest structures in the world.

It is Wedge Antilles' boldest creation: a covert-action unit of X-wing fighters, its pilots drawn from the dregs of other units, castoffs and rejects given one last chance. But before the new pilots can complete their training, the squadron's base is attacked by former Imperial admiral Trigit, and Wraith Squadron is forced to swing into action--taking over an Imperial warship and impersonating its crew. The mission: to gain vital intelligence about Trigit's secret weapons, to sabotage the admiral's plans, and to lure him into an Alliance trap. But the high-stakes gamble pits Wraith Squadron's ragtag renegades against the Empire's most brilliant master of guile and deception. Are they up to the challenge?

In this extraordinary book, the pioneer of research in collective learning systems (an adaptive learning paradigm for artificial intelligence) describes the processes of cognition, postulates a fundamental adaptive building block for assembling very large scale collective learning systems (the learning cell), and proposes a design for the ultimate machine: a hierarchical network of 100 million learning cells that could exhibit the full range of cognitive capabilities of the human mind. The author predicts that using the classical \\"expert system\\" approach to create such a vast knowledge base would require thousands of years to program all the rules. As a feasible alternative, he explains how a massive collective learning system could achieve this goal in about 20 years, much as humans do. Based on natural biological precedents, a collective learning system acquires its knowledge through trial-and-error interaction with the real world. To put it all in proper perspective, the author introduces a theory of games for modeling the various processes of the universe, presents a futuristic glimpse of the creation of the first artificially cognitive being, and discusses the philosophical issues raised by the prospect of creating machines that exhibit human-like cognition. Two chapters are devoted to the design and evaluation of collective learning systems. The final chapter presents the remarkable results of an on-going international research project directed by the author, a parallel-processing collective learning system that simulates the sub-symbolic adaptive vision functions of the brain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=n6gSFWNwh8EC&dq=The+Emergence+of+Artificial+Cognition:+An+Introduction+to+Collective+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love's Witness: Five Centuries of Love Poetry by Women","description":"The work of women poets is often overlooked in anthologies, and collections of love poetry are no exception.

Nor was he famous for being an artist, comic book superhero, television personality, or movie star. He wasn't exactly an athlete either. Granted, he wore a few of these hats at various points throughout his career, but his fame primarily emanated from an obscure occupation which he made entirely his own.Arguably, no other figure in popular culture outside these realms had an impact which resulted in global notoriety, generated millions of dollars in merchandise, inspired widespread imitation, and yet was a constant source of controversy. He was a genuine celebrity, and at the height of his career, he was one of the most talked-about men in America.In Evel Incarnate, Steve Mandich vividly recounts the life and the legend of Evel Knievel -a relentless self-mythologizer, abetted by an international community of fans.

An Ox of One s Own will be of interest to Assyriologists, particularly those interested in Early Mesopotamia, and scholars working on women in religion. An Ox of One s Own centers on the archive of a woman who died about 2050 B.C., one of King Shulgi s many wives. Her birth name is unknown, but when she married, she became Shulgi-simti,  Suitable for Shulgi.  Attested for only about 15 years, she existed among a court filled with other wives, who probably outranked her. A religious foundation was run on her behalf whereby courtiers, male and female, donated livestock for sacrifices to an unusual mix of goddesses and gods. Previous scholarship has declared this a rare example of a queen conducting women s religion, perhaps unusual because they say she came from abroad. The conclusions of this book are quite different. An Ox of One s Own lays out the evidence that another woman was queen at this time in Nippur while Shulgi-simti lived in Ur and was a third-ranking concubine at best, with few economic resources. Shulgi-simti s religious exercises concentrated on a quartet of north Babylonian goddesses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-Y3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capture a Shadow","description":"Lighting and shadows are used within a range of art forms to create aesthetic effects. Piotr Sadowski's study of light and shadow in Weimar cinema and contemporaneous visual arts is underpinned by the evolutionary semiotic theories of indexicality and iconicity. These theories explain the unique communicative and emotive power of light and shadow when used in contemporary indexical media including the shadow theatre, silhouette portraits, camera obscura, photography and film. In particular, Sadowski highlights the aesthetic and emotional significance of shadows. The 'cast shadow', as an indexical sign, maintains a physical connection with its near-present referent, such as a hidden person, stimulating a viewer's imagination and provoking responses including anxiety or curiosity. The 'cinematic shadow' plays a stylistic role, by enhancing image texture, depth of field, and tonal contrast of cinematic moments. Such enhancements are especially important in monochromatic films, and Sadowski interweaves the book with accounts of seminal Weimar cinema moments. Sadowski's book is distinctive for combining historical materials and theoretical approaches to develop a deeper understanding of Weimar cinema and other contemporary art forms. The Semiotics of Light and Shadows is an ideal resource for both scholars and students working in linguistics, semiotics, film, media, and visual arts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n5g8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Companion to North Dakota State Historic Sites","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-b0xIfv5uTgC&dq=A+Traveler%27s+Companion+to+North+Dakota+State+Historic+Sites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mister, You Got Yourself a Horse","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6wxFzwEACAAJ&dq=Mister,+You+Got+Yourself+a+Horse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Lace, Yellow Lace","description":"Rhyming text teaches young children how to tie a shoe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tANGPQAACAAJ&dq=Red+Lace,+Yellow+Lace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xOkDAAAACAAJ&dq=Mmurtl+V1.0&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jubilee","description":"To mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the throne, Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy brings together a dazzling array of contemporary poets (sixty in fact) to write about each of the of the sixty years of Her Majesty's reign.

Nonna's South Philadelphia neighborhood was a slice of Italy, and her house, crowded with aunts, uncles and cousins, was a little village.

Managers who are also parents struggle to succeed-and be there for their families-in companies that don't offer flextime. Women and people of color want to make their organizations better for others like themselves-without limiting their own career paths. Environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values and climb the executive ladder at firms more concerned with profits than pollution. While many who don't \\"fit in\\" with the corporate culture choose to assimilate or leave, Tempered Radicals offers an inspiring alternative. In this provocative book, Debra Meyerson argues that this tension-between expressing our \\"whole selves\\" and building careers in companies that leave little room for differences-can pave the way for learning, leadership, and positive change in organizations. Based on fifteen years of research and observation, Tempered Radicals reveals that adaptive, diverse, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces are built not by revolutionaries but by those she calls \\"tempered radicals\\"-people who successfully walk the tightrope between conformity and rebellion. Whereas \\"untempered\\" radicals use drama and heroics to effect change, these individuals work toward transformational ends with incremental means; whereas radicals lead episodically, tempered radicals lead every day-with conviction, patience, and courage. Through stories of tempered radicals from doctors to teachers to CEOs to entrepreneurs, Meyerson illustrates how these \\"everyday leaders\\" stick to their values, assert their agendas, and provoke learning and change without jeopardizing hard-won careers. Whether one's difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspectives, the book presents a spectrum of effective responses to the pressure to conform that range from resisting quietly to leveraging \\"small wins\\" to mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways. Putting self-realization and change within everyone's reach, this book shows how to turn threats to our identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in our companies and in the world. Debra E. Meyerson is visiting Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, and at the Center for Work, Technology, and Organization within Stanford's School of Engineering. She is also affiliated faculty at the Center for Gender in Organizations at the Simmons Graduate School of Management.

Others indulge in aggressive spiritual warfare at the least sign of sin, temptation, or doubt. Offering a more balanced approach, Disarming the Darkness brings a sound scriptural basis to understanding the dynamics of spiritual warfare. Respected author and teacher Calvin Miller recounts his own experiences with spiritual warfare and shows how we can overcome the influence of evil in our personal circumstances. He keeps us from two extremes: either burying our heads in the sand to the activity of demonic forces or becoming overly preoccupied with them. Miller shows who the devil is and what he is doing - and outlines Christ's victory over Satan and his angels. The author confronts the deepest and most subtle sources of temptation: money, sex, and power. He also demonstrates ways our own pride can be a stumbling block. He shows how a subtle lust for personal power can blind us even as we combat with formulas that smack more of magic and incantation than scriptural faith. And Miller offers guidelines for discerning the true source of the evil we encounter in ourselves and in others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kDhdlVltEYIC&dq=Disarming+the+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Willing Hostage (Mystery Scene Book)","description":"Just when her life seems complicated by an unsatisfactory career and personal tragedy, model Leah Harper is taken hostage by a mysterious stranger and begins a dangerous trek across the Colorado Rockies","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MNVjHQAACAAJ&dq=Willing+Hostage+(Mystery+Scene+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible","description":"This groundbreaking reference tool introduces key names, theories, and concepts for interpreting Scripture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I8UWJohMGUIC&dq=Dictionary+for+Theological+Interpretation+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","description":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology is a multi-authored exploration of systematic theology from a Trinitarian perspective. Its aim is to show how the doctrine of the Trinity sheds light on other key doctrines-from prolegomena to eschatology and theological ethics. To borrow a phrase from Robert Jenson, the doctrine of the Trinity 'is not a separate puzzle to be solved but the framework within which all theology's puzzles are to be solved'. Given the scarcity of systematic theologies done 'trinitarianly', this collective project suggests a path to follow in the formulation of each particular doctrine represented in the volume. Trinitarian Soundings promises to become an important work given its unique presentation of major themes of systematic theology in their classical order, yet from a Trinitarian point of view. Its contributors include veteran theologians as well as younger scholars who are energetically employing this Trinitarian focus. The contributors represent various theological traditions and geographical locations, which surely bring richness to the theological inquiry. Dedicated to the memory of a pioneer in the resurgence of Trinitarian theology, the late Prof. Colin Gunton, this collection represents a distinctive treatment of systematics, intent on showing the vitality of approaching all aspects of the faith from a self-consciously Trinitarian perspective.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eEWvAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - The Offer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZLffAAAAMAAJ&dq=Five+Star+First+Edition+Mystery+-+The+Offer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Questions and Answers Open Forum: Freed-Hardeman College Lectures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JMDQOAAACAAJ&dq=Questions+and+Answers+Open+Forum:+Freed-Hardeman+College+Lectures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Invite a Shark to Dinner (Finding Nemo Stepping Stone)","description":"Marlin the clownfish tells how to survive in the great blue ocean.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DB7BFT3jjBoC&dq=Don%27t+Invite+a+Shark+to+Dinner+(Finding+Nemo+Stepping+Stone)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return of the Jedi Sketchbook","description":"A selection of production sketches depicting the sets, hardware, and creatures appearing in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" reflects the evolution of new vehicles, landscapes, and characters","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U6gsAAAACAAJ&dq=Return+of+the+Jedi+Sketchbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bonny's Boy","description":"When the sunny and affectionate cocker spaniel Bonny dies while Nat is in the Navy, his younger brother Davy Edwards felt he had to bring up Bonny's one living puppy to make his brother proud.

In een virtuoze stijl die varieert van rauw tot gevoelig, van humoristisch tot passioneel, vertelt Davide Enia het genadeloze verhaal van de straatjongen Davidu tegen de achtergrond van de veelbewogen Siciliaanse geschiedenis vanaf de Tweede Wereldoorlog tot nu.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kbR0AAAAQBAJ&dq=Comanche+Eagle+(Lovegram+Romance+S)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las llanuras del transito","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pmoxvAEACAAJ&dq=Las+llanuras+del+transito&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dreams of Hummingbirds: Poems from Nature","description":"Eighteen poems of nature and ecology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFPRPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Dreams+of+Hummingbirds:+Poems+from+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","description":"In de restaurantkeukens in de onderbuik van New York zwoegt Zou Lei, een illegale immigrante uit de woestijn van China. De constante angst voor de immigratiedienst overschaduwt haar bestaan. Voor Zou Lei is hard werken geen keuze, geen stap op weg naar de Amerikaanse droom maar een constante strijd om te overleven, om de honderd dollar per week bijeen te sprokkelen die ze betaalt voor haar hoekje in het piepkleine appartement dat ze deelt met vele andere illegalen. Tijdens een van haar schaarse pauzes loopt Zou Lei drievoudig veteraan Skinner tegen het lijf. Skinners traumatische ervaringen in Irak hebben diepe psychische wonden achtergelaten, en de enige manieren waarop hij zijn demonen weet te bedwingen zijn alcohol en zijn lichaam tot het uiterste drijven in de sportschool. Ondanks de taalbarri re herkennen de twee iets in de ander, en er ontstaat een relatie die een glimp hoop biedt in hun beider harde bestaan. Maar de realiteit in dit New York is allesbehalve een sprookje, en de omstandigheden zijn allesbehalve ideaal. Met Ter voorbereiding op een volgend leven heeft Atticus Lish een verpletterend debuut afgeleverd; zowel een j'accuse als een liefdesbrief aan New York City, een indringend portret van de onderkant van New York, waar de Amerikaanse Droom voor immigranten en oorlogsveteranen onbereikbaar lijkt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IZ4dBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Photographic Guide to Trees of Britain and Europe (Photographic Guides)","description":"With easy-to-use thumbnail outlines of each family group, an authoritive text describing key identification features and full-colour photographs illustrating every species, this guide is designed for anyone interested in trees in Britain and Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JFgIAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Photographic+Guide+to+Trees+of+Britain+and+Europe+(Photographic+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategic MRO: A Roadmap for Transforming Assets into Competitive Advantage","description":"Strategic MRO: A Roadmap for Transforming Assets into Competitive Advantage combines the concepts of enterprise asset management and the associated maintenance, repair, and operating/overhaul (MRO) materials supply chain.

So wrote Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in his epitaph for Francis Mercury van Helmont. With his friend Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, van Helmont edited the Kabbala Denudata (1677-1684), the largest collection of Lurianic Kabbalistic texts available to Christians up to that time. Because the subject matter of this work appears so difficult and arcane, it has never been appreciated as a significant text for understanding the emergence of modern thought.

He practiced for nearly thirty years, treating serious physical and mental illnesses among the people of the Rosebud Reservation and elsewhere. In 1990 he began collaborating on his memoir with Gerald Mohatt, a close friend and cross-cultural psychologist. Eagle Elk?s story of his life, practice, and beliefs provides a uniquely introspective, demystified, and informative look at the career of a traditional Native American healer. We learn how a persistent vision and recurring visits by thunder spirits led Eagle Elk long ago to become a healer. On a more general level, we gain valuable insights into how Lakota healers practice today. Eagle Elk?s story and teachings also demonstrate the importance of community support and consensus in the development of traditional healers. Gerald Mohatt?s perspective as a cross-cultural psychologist enables him to highlight the psychological dimensions and efficacy of Eagle Elk?s healings and place them within a cross-cultural context. Eagle Elk?s life and career are presented in a way that brings together formative episodes from his life, selected teachings that emerged from those experiences, and case studies in healing. This arrangement allows readers to grasp the close relationship between the personal and cultural dimensions of traditional healing and to understand how and why this practice continues to affect and help others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TAutE7oDtkcC&dq=The+Price+of+a+Gift:+A+Lakota+Healer%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","description":"\\"A concise, penetrating account....This stirring book inspires an admiration for British courage.\\" New York Times Book Review","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Va8T1B6xg_0C&dq=The+Battle+of+Britain:+The+Myth+and+the+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystic Art of Written Forms: An Illustrated Handbook for Lettering","description":"A manual on lettering from ancient Rome to the present with copious illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aFisJQAACAAJ&dq=The+Mystic+Art+of+Written+Forms:+An+Illustrated+Handbook+for+Lettering&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bondi Classic","description":"A tasteful collection of b/w photographs,celebrating the male nude.,.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BW-0QgAACAAJ&dq=Bondi+Classic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RAGGEDY ANDY STORIES: Introducing the Little Rag Brother of Raggedy Ann","description":"Since Raggedy Andy first appeared in print in 1920, he has delighted millions of readers with his adventurous spirit and compassionate nature.

If agencies are to survive, Jaffe says, they must become idea-focused again and, instead of just making ads, master the art of devising the kind of non-advertising-type promotions that more quickly move a brand into the culture. Based on his long experience in the advertising industry, Jaffe offers practical advice and important lessons for agency heads who want their businesses to stand the test of time.

The author Zane Grey is her great-grandnephew. \\"Spirit of the Border\\" is a historical novel based on events occurring in the Ohio River Valley in the late eighteenth century. It features the exploits of Lewis Wetzel, a historical personage who had dedicated his life to the destruction of Native Americans and to the protection of nascent white settlements in that region. The story deals with the attempt by Moravian Church missionaries to Christianize Indians and how two brothers' lives take different paths upon their arrival on the border. A highly romanticized account, the novel is the second in a trilogy, the first of which is Betty Zane, Grey's first published work, and \\"The Last Trail\\", which focuses on the life of Jonathan Zane, Grey's ancestor. Zane Grey (1872-1939) was an American author best known for his popular adventure novels and stories that were a basis for the Western genre in literature and the arts. With his veracity and emotional intensity, he connected with millions of readers worldwide, during peacetime and war, and inspired many Western writers who followed him. Grey was a major force in shaping the myths of the Old West; his books and stories were adapted into other media, such as film and TV productions. He was the author of more than 90 books, some published posthumously and/or based on serials originally published in magazines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XnRODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shah Nameh Or The Persian Poet Firdausi","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYiuMyTC1tUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cusp: Poems","description":"Entre chien et loup -- between dog and wolf. This French colloquialism for twilight informs Jennifer Grotzs debut poetry collection, Cusp. A winner of this years Bakeless Prize for poetry, Grotz explores the peculiar territory of middleness -- neither dark nor light, not quite familiar but not fully unknown. It is a place with its own dangers, its own knowledge: road signs in a French tunnel remind drivers of their headlights in the temporary darkness; a scratchy recording of the last castrato highlights arts uneasy coupling of inspiration and artifice. Personal, thoughtful, inquisitive, and introspective, these poems reveal Grotzs varied influences, from the quilted fields of west Texas to a jazz club in Paris, from a sexy rodeo rider to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It is the dizziness of the foreign and the strangeness of whats all around that gives Cusp its energy, its vitality, signaling the arrival of a distinctive new voice in American verse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9m1oPgAACAAJ&dq=Cusp:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The laws of scientific hand reading: A practical treatise on the art commonly called palmistry,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=55bIbwAACAAJ&dq=The+laws+of+scientific+hand+reading:+A+practical+treatise+on+the+art+commonly+called+palmistry,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maximum Performance: Mopar Super Stock Drag Racing 1962-1969","description":"With an unparalleled, intimate knowledge of these cars--from the assembly line to the track--the author gives a profile of Mopar cars like no other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hykVogEACAAJ&dq=Maximum+Performance:+Mopar+Super+Stock+Drag+Racing+1962-1969&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Tea","description":"The Book of Tea describes all aspects of the Japanese tea ceremony and explains how its rituals blend seamlessly with traditional Japanese life.

In the late 1920s, Eric Blair resigned his post as a colonial policeman in Burma, immersed himself in the slums of Paris and London, and reinvented himself as George Orwell, one of the most revered prose stylists in the English language. Orwell decided to write about the lives of the poor - the dishwashers of Paris, the tramps of London - not by imagining poverty, but by experiencing poverty. The result is a book which is as provocative and incisive about class inequalities, homelessness, and social prejudices today as it was when it was first published in 1933. Down and Out in Paris and London was George Orwell's first book, and it remains a masterpiece of prose writing. This edition is accompanied by an introduction which examines Orwell's book for its literary, social, and political significance.

A Bridge Too Far is Cornelius Ryan's masterly chronicle of the Battle of Arnhem, which marshalled the greatest armada of troop-carrying aircraft ever assembled and cost the Allies nearly twice as many casualties as D-Day. In this compelling work of history, Ryan narrates the Allied effort to end the war in Europe in 1944 by dropping the combined airborne forces of the American and British armies behind German lines to capture the crucial bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem. Focusing on a vast cast of characters from Dutch civilians to British and American strategists to common soldiers and commanders Ryan brings to life one of the most daring and ill-fated operations of the war. A Bridge Too Far superbly recreates the terror and suspense, the heroism and tragedy of this epic operation, which ended in bitter defeat for the Allies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8m4HNeMBWqwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East of Eden","description":"This sprawling and often brutal novel, set in the rich farmlands of California's Salinas Valley, follows the intertwined destinies of two families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons--whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XYEaAQAAMAAJ&dq=East+of+Eden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doors into Chaos (Star Trek The Next Generation: Gateways, Book 3)","description":"More than 200,000 years ago, the ancient Iconians created a network of interdimensional Gateways providing instantaneous transportation across unimaginable distances.

But this durable association of motherhood with femininity exists in tension with the highest incidence of abortion and one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe. In this setting, how do women think of themselves as proper individuals, mothers, and Greek citizens? In this anthropological study of reproductive politics and ethics in Athens, Greece, Heather Paxson tracks the effects of increasing consumerism and imported biomedical family planning methods, showing how women's \\"nature\\" is being transformed to meet crosscutting claims of the contemporary world. Locating profound ambivalence in people's ethical evaluations of gender and fertility control, Paxson offers a far-reaching analysis of conflicting assumptions about what it takes to be a good mother and a good woman in modern Greece, where assertions of cultural tradition unfold against a backdrop of European Union integration, economic struggle, and national demographic anxiety over a falling birth rate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TNoIKlwdC_MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up from Methodism","description":"In 1926, while a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, Herbert Asbury, great-great-nephew of Francis Asbury, the first American Bishop of the Methodist Church, submitted a chapter of his profane work-in-progress, an almost spiteful memoir of his boyhood in the Ozark town of Farmington, Missouri, to H.L Mencken's American Mercury magazine. Mencken published \\"Hatrack,\\" the story of the town's prostitute, in the April issue. The Mercury was then banned in Boston at the incitement of J. Frank Chase, the head of the New England Watch and Ward Society, who called the story \\"bad, vile, raw stuff.\\" Mencken was arrested selling the magazine to Chase on Boston Common in a stunt designed to provoke the free-speech trials that followed. In its restrained, but unrelenting attack on religious bigotry, irrationality, and hypocrisy, the book that was published soon thereafter retains its transgressive power today. Its taunting title, playing on Booker T. Washington's early-century bestseller Up from Slavery, gives an idea of what Asbury thought he had escaped. In his mocking humor and plain-spun language, used to evoke a bygone South suffocating in its fear of pleasure and damnation, Asbury reveals his debt to another son of Missouri, Mark Twain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FgtJswEACAAJ&dq=Up+from+Methodism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spider's Test (Birthright)","description":"Ambition and destiny drive one man to confront the insane lord of the Spiderfell.

Beginners find an inviting introduction to the elements of topology, emphasizing the tools needed for understanding knots, the fundamental group and van Kampen's theorem, for example, which are then applied to concrete problems, such as computing knot groups. For experts, Rolfsen explains advanced topics, such as the connections between knot theory and surgery and how they are useful to understanding three-manifolds. Besides providing a guide to understanding knot theory, the book offers 'practical' training. After reading it, you will be able to do many things: compute presentations of knot groups, Alexander polynomials, and other invariants; perform surgery on three-manifolds; and visualize knots and their complements.It is characterized by its hands-on approach and emphasis on a visual, geometric understanding. Rolfsen offers invaluable insight and strikes a perfect balance between giving technical details and offering informal explanations. The illustrations are superb, and a wealth of examples are included. Now back in print by the AMS, the book is still a standard reference in knot theory. It is written in a remarkable style that makes it useful for both beginners and researchers. Particularly noteworthy is the table of knots and links at the end. This volume is an excellent introduction to the topic and is suitable as a textbook for a course in knot theory or 3-manifolds.

In an attempt to understand the current malaise of American law and the depressed condition of American intellectual life in general, Pierre Schlag diagnoses what he believes is an epidemic of pathological reliance on the principle of reason. Contending that legal thinkers continually fail to recognize the aesthetic and ethical prejudices of rationalism, Schlag creates a genealogy that shows how the call to reason has become a manipulative vehicle of power, faith, and prejudice. In examining the fierce resistance to questioning reason s primacy, this renowned critic and professor of American law demonstrates how those who use and study the law perpetuate their own methodological blind spots. Claiming that reason has been endowed with a virtually mystical power to organize social life, Schlag unravels the seemingly rational world of judicial opinions, statutes, doctrines, and legal principles. In the process, he paints a shocking and sure to be controversial picture of the chaos and, indeed, violence of the American legal tradition. This bold commentary on the irrationality of reason in American law and legal studies will interest not only legal scholars and philosophers but also serious thinkers across a broad disciplinary spectrum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G_82IxXyKtgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Blooms Appear: Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAPVeko7fkcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvels And Mysteries The World Around Us","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jjmtjgEACAAJ&dq=Marvels+And+Mysteries+The+World+Around+Us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","description":"In The Birth of the Republic, 176389, Edmund S. Morgan shows how the challenge of British taxation started Americans on a search for constitutional principles to protect their freedom, and eventually led to the Revolution. By demonstrating that the founding fathers  political philosophy was not grounded in theory, but rather grew out of their own immediate needs, Morgan paints a vivid portrait of how the founders  own experiences shaped their passionate convictions, and these in turn were incorporated into the Constitution and other governmental documents. The Birth of the Republic is the classic account of the beginnings of the American government, and in this fourth edition the original text is supplemented with a new foreword by Joseph J.

It can rise from the altars of great cathedrals and from the dark hovels of those who eat their bread with tears. It can be prayed at weddings and on the gallows. All seven colours of our life are contained in it, and so there is never a time when we are left alone.' In these sermons delivered in the shattered city of Stuttgart during the last days of the war, Helmut Thielicke examined the Lord's Prayer phrase by phrase, drawing from it both immediate comfort and inspiration for the future. As he expounded upon the inner meaning of the familiar phrases, he enabled his despairing congregation to share in this promise of hope - to see the world in a new way, through prayer. Today, for those who are prepared to listen, his words still carry the same power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EtXYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wanton Women","description":"In Wanton Women in Late-Imperial Chinese Literature, the essay contributors explore how from the late Ming onward images of sexually transgressive women developed across a range of genres as women and men addressed tensions between past ideals and lived worlds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EUC9DgAAQBAJ&dq=Wanton+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fantasy in F Minor, Barcarolle, Berceuse and Other Works for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","description":"Features 15 works, including one of the greatest of the Romantic period, the Fantasy in F Minor, Op. 49, reprinted from the authoritative German edition prepared by Chopin's student, Carl Mikuli.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gIOVBap6eS4C&dq=Fantasy+in+F+Minor,+Barcarolle,+Berceuse+and+Other+Works+for+Solo+Piano+(Dover+Music+for+Piano)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now You See It","description":"This study of films by and about lesbians and gay men has been revised for a second edition and features an introduction outlining developments in lesbian and gay cinema since 1990.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oFLXoD3Tb1oC&dq=Now+You+See+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ethics of psychoanalysis;: The theory and method of autonomous psychotherapy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X2sqVmqNLWUC&dq=The+ethics+of+psychoanalysis%3B:+The+theory+and+method+of+autonomous+psychotherapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macaulay's essays on Milton and Addison (Longmans' English classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nXQQtXBAq1UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malchus","description":"Wat als een radicale katholieke beweging zou dreigen met terreuraanslagen om de traditionele christelijke waarden in ere te herstellen?

Just after the turn of the 20th century, there were 20 different railroads servicing Toledo with four different main stations, providing employment for the town and shaping its commerce and architecture. Today, many of the railroads have been lost to evolution of the city and mergers of the railroad.

Analyzing the tremendous changes in the history of America s racial dynamics, Kennedy takes us from the injustices of the slave era up to present-day battles over race matching adoption policies, which seek to pair children with adults of the same race. He tackles such subjects as the presence of sex in racial politics, the historic role of legal institutions in policing racial boundaries, and the real and imagined pleasures that have attended interracial intimacy. A bracing, much-needed look at the way we have lived in the past, Interracial Intimacies is also a hopeful book, offering a potent vision of our future as a multiracial democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dy5pJ26JIvUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The prince of the house of David: Or, Three years in the Holy City","description":"A wonderfully detailed historical novel -- the story of Christ's three years of ministry on earth told by a young Hebrew girl in the form of letters to her father.

Instead of variational techniques, the author uses a unique approach, emphasising distance functions and special co-ordinate systems. He also uses standard calculus with some techniques from differential equations to provide a more elementary route. Many chapters contain material typically found in specialised texts, never before published in a single source. This is one of the few works to combine both the geometric parts of Riemannian geometry and the analytic aspects of the theory, while also presenting the most up-to-date research - including sections on convergence and compactness of families of manifolds. Thus, this book will appeal to readers with a knowledge of standard manifold theory, including such topics as tensors and Stokes theorem. Various exercises are scattered throughout the text, helping motivate readers to deepen their understanding of the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QSnlBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European 12 Language Phrasebook, 3rd (Aa Phrase Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aCxdAAAAIAAJ&dq=European+12+Language+Phrasebook,+3rd+(Aa+Phrase+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Them Off Right!

While cultural historians have seen this period as one of failed reform focusing on the failure of activists to win significant changes for commercial radio Kathy M. Newman argues that the 1930s witnessed the emergence of a symbiotic relationship between advertising and activism. Advertising helped to kindle the consumer activism of union members affiliated with the CIO, middle-class club women, and working-class housewives. Once provoked, these activists became determined to influence and in some cases eliminate radio advertising. As one example of how radio consumption was an active rather than a passive process, Newman cites The Hucksters, Frederick Wakeman's 1946 radio spoof that skewered eccentric sponsors, neurotic account executives, and grating radio jingles. The book sold over 700,000 copies in its first six months and convinced broadcast executives that Americans were unhappy with radio advertising. The Hucksters left its mark on the radio age, showing that radio could inspire collective action and not just passive conformity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LzgaoIIkwKEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rig Veda (Sacred Writings: Hinduism, Vol. 5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2s1DzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Rig+Veda+(Sacred+Writings:+Hinduism,+Vol.+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Giant Book of Sudoku Presented by Will Shortz: 300 Wordless Crossword Puzzles","description":"The hottest craze in puzzles!

Imagine what you could do if you knew the future! No doubt each of you has plans for the future, plans for what you will do when you get on the outside. What does the future hold? We go to considerable lengths to find out what the future holds. For instance, we pay people to be meteorologists, so that we can know what the weather will be like in the future. They have limited success  they might get tomorrow s weather right but things get very inaccurate past 2 or 3 days. What they do is look at the past conditions, track the trend and extrapolate it into the future. But it only works if things continue on as they are doing  no one predicted an earthquake was going to hit. It was a one off, an unexpected event. Things don t always continue on the way they always have. Sudden, unexpected, out of the ordinary things take place. It is a fallacy to think that the past is the key to the future. The Bible speaks of those who mock the predictions of the Bible of a coming day of judgement: [2 Peter 3:3-4 First of all, you must understand that in these last days some people will appear whose lives are controlled by their own lusts. They will mock you and will ask,  He promised to come, didn t He? Where is He? Our ancestors have already died, but everything is still the same as it was since the creation of the world! ] Everything carries on the same as it always does  but this is not case. It is impossible to plan unless you know the future. The one who knows the future is at a distinct advantage  in the past rulers and leaders spent considerable resources trying to gain the advantage of knowing the future  they employed astrologers, men who could read omens, examine livers etc. Even today you find the government spends considerable sums getting people to provide fiscal and economic forecasts  they want to know the future. But predicting the future is an inexact science  no one knows! Well not quite. God claims to know the future! [Isaiah 46:9-10 Remember what happened long ago; acknowledge that I alone am God and that there is no one else like Me. From the beginning, I predicted the outcome; long ago I foretold what would happen. I said that my plans would never fail, that I would do everything I intended to do.] Isaiah 45:21 Who predicted long ago what would happen? Was it not I, the Lord, the God who saves his people? There is no other god.] In fact, the Bible has 100% accuracy record in its predictions of the future. That is pretty impressive! It predicted that the Messiah would come, and minute details of Jesus  life were written about hundreds of years before hand  they were fulfilled exactly. [Joshua 21:45 Not one of the good promises which the Lord had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.] Everything God promised would happen, took place. [Joshua 23:14  Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the Lord your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed.] What does the Bible say about the future? Not only did it predict the coming of Jesus, it speaks far more frequently about His coming again, His return. One of the big things we know for certain about the future that Jesus is coming again! [John 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also.] The Bible describes Jesus going back to heaven: [Acts 1:9-11 After saying this, He was taken up to heaven as they watched Him, and a cloud hid Him from their sight.

This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you saw Him go to heaven. ] We don t need to be in the dark about the future, the Bible gives us insight. God has given the body of Christ gifts for equipping and edifying of the body for work of ministry as written In scripture - And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. D EPHESIANS 4:11-12 2 Chronicles 20:20 The Message (MSG) 20 They were up early in the morning, ready to march into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they were leaving, Jehoshaphat stood up and said,  Listen Judah and Jerusalem! Listen to what I have to say! Believe firmly in God, your God, and your lives will be firm! Believe in your prophets and you ll come out on top!  Yes., believe His prophets and you shall prosper. In 2020 prophetic Breaking News, we have pulled together for you prophecies from prophetic gifts in the body of Christ to equip you and edify you for the work of ministry for 2020 and beyond. The prediction will also help you in economic decisions, political decision, on how to pray for your nation and also where to work on in the spiritual life. We cannot determine if all prophetic messages are accurate as some can serve as warning which we can pray to avert while others are determined already and cannot be averted. We will encourage you to test the spirit before you take action based on prophecies provided here. We will continue to update you with new prophesies throughout the year and their fulfilment so stay tuned, stay blessed and stay connected to Him through His body in Jesus name..","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jE5zEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiss & Run (Harlequin Temptation, No. 1018)(24 Hours: The Wedding)","description":"Kiss or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Climber is raw, unfiltered Twight who makes it clear that climbing is only distantly about the summit.

Germany's defeat and the subsequent demobilization of her armies had enormous economic, social, and psychological consequences for the nation, and it is these which Richard Bessel sets out to explore. Dr Bessel examines the changes brought by the War to Germany, by the return of the soldiers to civilian life and by the demobilization of the economy. He demonstrates how the postwar transition was viewed as a moral crusade by Germans desperately concerned about challenges to traditional authority; and he assesses the ways in which the experiences and memories of the War affected the politics of the Weimar Republic. This original and scholarly book offers important insights into the sense of dislocation, both personal and national, experienced by Germany and Germans after the First World War, and the damaging legacy of the War for German democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xSQSDAAAQBAJ&dq=Germany+after+the+First+World+War+(Clarendon+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","description":"Fantasy roman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GzYEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Dragons+(Dragonlance+Lost+Histories,+Vol.+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ in the Tabernacle","description":"WHEN God told Moses to build the tabernacle in the wilderness, according to the pattern which He showed him in the mount, He said:  Speak unto the children of Israel . . . And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them  (Exodus 25:2, 25:8). When the inspired apostle explained the spiritual significance of this, God's dwelling place among His people, Israel, He said to the Hebrew Christians:  We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man  (Hebrews 8:1-2). These words from the New Testament not only give us the Holy Spirit's commentary on the meaning of the tabernacle in the wilderness; but they are the key that unlocks a vast treasure of spiritual truth regarding the  earthly sanctuary  which Moses built, in order that God might dwell among His people. If we would understand the New Testament teaching concerning this Jewish tabernacle, which was  a shadow of good things to come  (Hebrews 10:1), we should compare the Exodus record with the Epistle to the Hebrews, especially chapters eight and nine, which deal with the tabernacle in particular, though primarily with the ministry of Christ, our Great High Priest, in  the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.  This comparison of the Old Testament with the New will unfold to us  The Glories of Christ As Foreshadowed in the Jewish Tabernacle.  Yea, it will reveal to us the wonders of the prophetic Scriptures, wherein the Holy Spirit  testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow  (1Peter 1:11). In connection with the typical significance of the Jewish tabernacle, we have one of the many clear proofs that the Old Testament is the New Testament concealed; whereas the New Testament is the Old Testament revealed. Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New. And the Triune God gave to Israel the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings, in order that sinful man might recognize the promised Saviour, and understand the significance of His mission and death.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KBDbCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a_fzHAAACAAJ&dq=A+Night+in+the+Netherhells&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scheherazade's Sisters: Trickster Heroines and Their Stories in World Literature (Contributions in Women's Studies)","description":"\\"Scheherazade's sisters\\" are those female protagonists in folktales who use trickery to save themselves and others, to find new directions for their lives, and to declare their individual autonomies, especially in societies that diminish and oppress women.

Investing in Miracles offers an in-depth look at this unique indigenous movement, characterized by its effective use of mass media and its huge, emotion-filled outdoor rallies. The book investigates the sociocultural, political, and economic contexts of El Shaddai's popularity among the Filipino urban poor and aspiring middle classes and explores its significance for its followers, which reaches well beyond promises of appliances, salary raises, jobs abroad, and healing. Katharine Wiegele argues that Shaddai's theology directly engages and affirms desires for the material signs of modernity in ways that the mainstream Philippine Roman Catholic Church and Filipino leftist movements do not. At stake for its many adherents are their place and identity within the broader society; the meaning of their experiences of poverty, suffering, and oppression; and the relevance of their very notions of God, Christian community, and Christian life. Wiegele evocatively captures the religious and everyday experiences of her informants' lives in poor squatter neighborhoods of Manila. She is particularly sensitive to El Shaddai's delicate and often contorted relationship with the Catholic Church, which accepts the movement reluctantly, fearful of losing the loyalty of millions of faithful Catholics. While anchored in the local realities of the Philippines, Investing in Miracles will be of great interest to readers elsewhere for its exploration of religious seduction and interpretation, the interface between religion and politics, and the relevance of religion for the urban disenfranchised.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QbE5bRqW0CwC&dq=Investing+in+Miracles:+El+Shaddai+and+the+Transformation+of+Popular+Catholicism+in+the+Philippines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hello, Eeyore!

Personality judgments are important in assessing job candidates, choosing friends, and determining who we can trust and rely on in our personal lives. Thus, the accuracy of those judgments is important to both individuals and organizations. In examining personality judgment, Personality Judgment takes a sweeping look at the field's history, assumptions, and current research findings. The book explores the construct of traits within the person-situation debate, defends the human judge in the face of the fundamental attribution error, and discusses research on four categories of moderators in judgment: the good judge, the judgeable target, the trait being judged, and the information on which the judgment is based. Spanning two decades of accuracy research, this book makes clear not only how personality judgment has come to its current standing but also where it may move in the future. Covers 20 years worth of historical, current and future trends in personality judgment Includes discussions of debatable issues related to accuracy and error.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution In a masterwork that both deepens and enlarges the world of her previous novels, acclaimed author Louise Erdrich captures the essence of a time and the spirit of a woman who felt compelled by her beliefs to serve her people as a priest. The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse deals with miracles, crises of faith, struggles with good and evil, temptation, and the corrosive and redemptive power of secrecy. For more than a half century, Father Damien Modeste has served his beloved Native American tribe, the Ojibwe, on the remote reservation of Little No Horse. Now, nearing the end of his life, Father Damien dreads the discovery of his physical identity, for he is a woman who has lived as a man. To further complicate his quiet existence, a troubled colleague comes to the reservation to investigate the life of the perplexing, possibly false saint Sister Leopolda. Father Damien alone knows the strange truth of Leopolda's piety, but these facts are bound up in his own secret. He is faced with the most difficult decision: Should he tell all and risk everything . . . or manufacture a protective history for Leopolda, though he believes her wonder-working is motivated solely by evil?

While the highest performance in measured in frames per second is theultimate criteria for judging these chips, the focus is now starting to shift towards new features and different rendering techniques and pipelines. This dissertation introduces new hardware architectures for more realistic surface rendering of three dimensional objects and the rendering of volumetric datasets. Surface rendering is dealt with in the first part of the dissertation where the architectures for displacement map rendering in hardware are proposed. This work represents the first to appear in scientific literature on displacement map hardware rendering. Where possible these architectures propose components that integrate into currently available pipelines and make use of existing units in those pipelines. Displacement map rendering in hardware is a desired feature currently under development by most graphics hardware vendors. The first architecture is scan-line based and works just before rasterization and the second adaptively retessellates a triangle mesh using additional hardware on either side of the geometry transformation stage in the graphics pipeline. The VIZARDII architecture and several hardware based performance improvements for any ray casting architecture are presented in the second part titled Volume Rendering. VIZARDII is an interactve programmable hardware acelerator for Volume Rendering implemented on a PCI Card. The main pipeline is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA allowing new features to be added relatively quickly. A memory interface is presented and discussed with its final implementation appearing in the VIZARDII system. Novel architectures for ray queuing and sorting, sub-cube based space leaping are also presented which improve the performance of ray casting based hardware architectures. Antialiasing that occurs when ray casting volume data is also discussed and possible solutions are presented using multiresolutionvolume datasets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2aA45ekwtWkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","description":"In the early 1990s, Charles de Lint wrote and published three dark fantasy novels under the pen name \\"Samuel M.

While her husband is consumed with his job, Asa is left to explore her surroundings on her own: she makes trips to the supermarket, halfheartedly looks for work, and tries to find interesting ways of killing time. One day, while running an errand for her mother-in-law, she comes across a strange creature, follows it to the embankment of a river, and ends up falling into a hole--a hole that seems to have been made specifically for her.

Stories of imagined futures abound in Western writing. Writer and editor Nalo Hopkinson notes that the science fiction/fantasy genre  speaks so much about the experience of being alienated but contains so little writing by alienated people themselves.  It s an oversight that Hopkinson and Mehan aim to correct with this anthology. The book depicts imagined futures from the perspectives of writers associated with what might loosely be termed the  third world.  It includes stories that are bold, imaginative, edgy; stories that are centered in the worlds of the  developing  nations; stories that dare to dream what we might develop into. The wealth of postcolonial literature has included many who have written insightfully about their pasts and presents. With So Long Been Dreaming they creatively address their futures. Contributors include: Opal Palmer Adisa, Tobias Buckell, Wayde Compton, Hiromi Goto, Andrea Hairston, Tamai Kobayashi, Karin Lowachee, devorah major, Carole McDonnell, Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu, Eden Robinson, Nisi Shawl, Vandana Singh, Sheree Renee Thomas and Greg Van Eekhout. Nalo Hopkinson is the internationally-acclaimed author of Brown Girl in the Ring, Skin Folk, and Salt Roads. Her books have been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula, Tiptree, and Philip K. Dick Awards; Skin Folk won a World Fantasy Award and the Sunburst Award. Born in Jamaica, Nalo moved to Canada when she was sixteen. She lives in Toronto.

When Mao s Cultural Revolution took hold in China in June 1966, Ange Zhang was thirteen years old. His father was a famous writer. Shortly after the revolution began, many of Ange s classmates joined the Red Guard, Mao s youth movement, and they drove their teachers out of the classrooms. But in the weeks that followed, Ange discovered that his father s fame as a writer now meant that he was a target of the new regime. When his father was arrested, he began to question everything that was happening in his country. Finally, Ange was forced to join many other young urban Chinese students in the countryside for re-education where he found the emotional space to develop his own artistic talent and to find that he, like his father, was an artist   except that Ange s talent lay in painting and drawing. This dramatic, painful autobiographical story is complemented by photographs, many drawn from Ange s personal collection, as well as a non-fiction section that explains the historical period and is also illustrated with archival images.

This volume contains 18 sermons that were published in the Arminian Magazine from 1789 to 1792. It also contains 19 sermons that were taken from Wesley's manuscripts. Of all the genres in Wesley's prodigious output, his sermons most clearly focus and expound his understanding of Christian existence. Outler's introduction in the first volume concentrates two decades of painstaking research and thought on Wesley. From this he ably sets the stage for a fuller understanding and appreciation of a major Christian heritage, a heritage which can at last be seen as a whole against the background of its sources. The four volumes contain 151 sermons, including a number recovered from Wesley's manuscripts. These constitute the core of Wesley's doctrinal teachings upon which his own evangelical movement was founded. Following Wesley's own ordering, Dr. Outler begins with the familiar Sermons on Several Occasions, which present Wesley's basic teachings on salvation and form the bulk of the first two volumes in the series. Outler masterfully demonstrates the significance of all the subsequent sermons since they exhibit Wesley's entire approach to the Christian life. Each volume is rich with footnotes that include the identification of quotations, elucidation of references, the tracing of key themes, and vital background information on each sermon. Representing the culmination of twenty years of exhaustive research, it is the purpose of these conclusive volumes to keep alive the growing interest in Wesleyan studies for the entire Christian church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qatPAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+works+of+John+Wesley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"APPLIED SATELLITE NAVIGATION USING GPS, GALILEO, AND AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS","description":"This authoritative work brings you a timely, unified analysis of the various satellite navigation technologies, applications, and services in operation or development, and of the challenges that lie ahead in this rapidly evolving field.

In a memoir that is at turns magical, troubling, humorous, and totally out of the ordinary, Diana takes us into her intimate life with one of the most influential and dynamic Buddhist teachers of our time. Diana led an extraordinary and unusual life as the \\"first lady\\" of a burgeoning Buddhist community in the American 1970s and '80s.

The devastated earth is coated by vast sheets of gray plastic, while humans vie to replace more and more of their own  soft parts  with steel. What need is there for nature when trees and flowers can be pushed up through holes in the plastic? Who requires human companionship when new-metal mistresses are waiting?

It has brought the entire planet closer together and changed almost every aspect of how we live today. Along the way, the airplane has inspired writers in every decade of the twentieth century to celebrate this world-changing creation. From the wild first years of aviation when daredevil men challenged each other to set altitude records to the terrible three-dimensional landscape of combat in the air through all the wars of this century, authors from around the world have written of the airplanes and the men and women who fly them. Now, bestselling author Stephen Coonts has collected some of the finest fiction about flying in one volume. On Glorious Wings contains stories and excerpts from world-renowned authors, including Dale Brown, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Louis L'Amour, James Michener, Joseph Heller, Len Deighton, Frederick Forsyth, William Faulkner, Ralph Peters and Stephen Coonts himself. From the rickety wire-and-wood contraptions of the 1920s to the possible future of warfare in 2020, this collection invites you to take to the skies with some of today's most acclaimed authors, including: \\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\\" by Jules Verne: Take a fanciful trip through the air as imagined by one of the great authors of the nineteenth century. \\"All of the Dead Pilots\\" by William Faulkner: One of America's greatest storytellers looks at Britain in World War II, where a brash American pilot and an unflappable British officer clash over the same woman. \\"Wings over Khabarovsk\\" by Louis L'Amour: The great Western writer also penned many tales for the pulp magazines of the 1930s and '40s, including this classic of the genre about an American pilot framed for spying on the far side of the world. \\"An Hour to San Francisco,\\" from The High and the Mighty, by Ernest K. Gann: When a four-engine plane loses an engine over the Pacific Ocean, what had been an uneventful trip becomes a white-knuckle race for survival. \\"Corey Ford Buys the Farm,\\" from Flight of the Intruder, by Stephen Coonts: During the Vietnam Conflict, pilots took lightly armed A-6 Intruders on harrowing near-suicide missions against the North Vietnamese army. Here, the master of the military thriller takes you along for the ride inside the cockpit as three Intruders head out to destroy some Russian MiG fighters grounded in Laos. \\"Power River MOA,\\" from The Sky Masters, by Dale Brown: At the Powder River weapons-testing site, the jet fighters may fire blanks, but the air combat simulations are as real as can be. Strap yourself in for a ride in the latest in bomber technology-the EB-52 Megafortress. \\"Retaliation,\\" from The War in 2020, by Ralph Peters: In the near future, America is threatened by a joint Iran-Japan military force that threatens the Middle East and Europe. Saddle up with the high-tech, hard-hitting cavalry soldiers of the future and their armored, fire-breathing future flying machines as they take to the air to raid on an enemy base.

Most films have soundtracks. And many include a few musical numbers, but how much musical content does a film need before it is officially a musical? Since there are no clear-cut rules, I based this book on a few simple guidelines. First, I excluded all silent films, for obvious reasons. Second, I excluded movies where the musical numbers were not performed by the stars of the film, or movies that are basically comedies or dramas, but include a little music. Third, I excluded concert films or any films that did not have a plot. Finally, since this is a book of images, I tried to always give preference to posters that depict people singing or dancing.

He goes on to present a way to accurately recover all components of cross-sectional strain and stress before providing a natural one-dimensional (1-D) theory of beams. Sample results for both cross-sectional and 1-D analysis are presented as is a parallel treatment for thin-walled beams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FEFKAQAAIAAJ&dq=Nonlinear+Composite+Beam+Theory+for+Engineers+(Progress+in+Astronautics+and+Aeronautics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prisoners and Pawns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3JUgQAAACAAJ&dq=Prisoners+and+Pawns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Mexique Bay (A Vintage book V-104)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BN14AAAAIAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Mexique+Bay+(A+Vintage+book+V-104)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Currents from the Dancing River: Contemporary Latino Fiction, Nonfiction, and Poetry","description":"Gathers one hundred thirty-five poems, stories, and essays by Latino writers","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yh5vAAAAMAAJ&dq=Currents+from+the+Dancing+River:+Contemporary+Latino+Fiction,+Nonfiction,+and+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Hunters (Diadem)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0qCJAAAACAAJ&dq=Star+Hunters+(Diadem)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","description":"The first in a series of books by Zingerman's co-founding partner Ari Weinzweig examines the basic building blocks of the culture and structure we know now as Zingerman's.

In a country where taxi drivers earn more than doctors, understanding Cuba is a compelling but never-ending task. In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Cuba was plunged into crisis. Having been subsidized by the Soviet Union to the tune of $3 million a day, the country's economy entered freefall. The ban on the US dollar was lifted, the floodgates of tourism opened and the salaries of Cubans in contact with foreigners went into orbit. Into Castro's fortress of dollar-fuelled hedonism and communist austerity came the American wife of a European energy consultant posted to Havana, and their two small children. Isadora Tattlin befriended Cubans from all walks of life, gave dozens of parties - even Fidel Castro came to dinner! - and kept a daily diary. The result is a remarkable testimony to a unique period in Cuba's history when el triunfo de la revolucion was beginning to clash with the powerful lure of multinational consumerism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoWGVwuh_NYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Living Single","description":"Filled with fascinating personal accounts of single women living in the U.S., this exploration of a growing trend finds many unmarried women over the age of thirty-five living fulfilled, happy lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GgKNHTisJEYC&dq=Women+Living+Single&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MUSIC FOR SIGHT SINGING","description":"The most engaging and musical Sight-Singing text on the market.

Our brain-mind, as he calls it, is not a fixed identity but a dynamic balancing act between the chemical systems that regulate waking and dreaming. With a new foreword by the author. In this book, J. Allan Hobson sets out a compelling and controversial theory of consciousness. Our brain-mind, as he calls it, is not a fixed identity but a dynamic balancing act between the chemical systems that regulate waking and dreaming. Drawing on his work both as a sleep researcher and as a psychiatrist, Hobson looks in particular at the strikingly similar chemical characteristics of the states of dreaming and psychosis. His underlying theme is that the form of our thoughts, emotions, dreams, and memories derive from specific nerve cells and electrochemical impulses described by neuroscientists. Among the questions Hobson explores are: What are dreams? Do they have any hidden meaning, or are they simply emotionally salient images whose peculiar narrative structure refects the unique neurophysiology of sleep? And what is the relationship between the delirium of our dream life and psychosis? Originally published by Little, Brown under the title The Chemistry of Conscious States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HwlzA3KVBv4C&dq=Dreaming+as+Delirium:+How+the+Brain+Goes+Out+of+Its+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tycoon's Lady (The Baby Bank) (Silhouette Desire)","description":"Greek hotel magnate Chrysander Anetakis's former mistress was pregnant?

The Depression ended abruptly the year I graduated from high school when WW II was declared and I was drafted into military service where I spent 3-1/2 years.

Because of my disabilities, I could never be a farmer and had to go somewhere else and develop new skills so I would be able to support my family. Jobs were hard to get because at the end of the war in Europe, 12 million healthy veterans had just been discharged and the economy was in limbo while industry was converting from wartime to peacetime economy. The story deals with how I started out as an apprentice electronic technician, became an engineer through home study, worked and lived on all continents and finally became Chief of the Navigation Engineering Branch at the Federal Aviation Administration Headquarters in Washington DC.

The Greek word &\\"techne,&\\" typically translated as &\\"art,&\\" but also as &\\"craft,&\\" &\\"skill,&\\" &\\"expertise,&\\" &\\"technical knowledge,&\\" and even &\\"science,&\\" has been decisive in shaping our &\\"technological&\\" culture. Here David Roochnik comprehensively analyzes Plato's treatment of this crucial word. Roochnik maintains that Plato's understanding of both the goodness of techne, as well as its severe limitations and consequent need to be supplemented by &\\"nontechnical&\\" wisdom, can speak directly to our own concerns about the troubling impact technology has had on contemporary life. For most commentators, techne functions as a positive, theoretical model through which Plato attempts to articulate the nature of moral knowledge. Scholars such as Terence Irwin and Martha Nussbaum argue that Plato& s version of moral knowledge is structurally similar to techne. In arguing thus, they attribute to Plato what Nietzsche called &\\"theoretical optimism,&\\" the view that technical knowledge can become an efficient panacea for the dilemmas and painful contingencies of human life. Conventional wisdom has it, in short, that for Plato technical, moral knowledge can solve life's problems. By systematically analyzing Socrates&  analogical arguments, Roochnik shows the weakness of the conventional view. The basic pattern of these arguments is this: if moral knowledge is analogous to techne, then insurmountable difficulties arise, and moral knowledge becomes impossible. Since moral knowledge is not impossible, it cannot be analogous to techne. In other words, the purpose of Socrates' analogical arguments is to reveal the limitations of techne as a model for the wisdom Socrates so ardently seeks. For all the reasons Plato is so careful to present in his dialogues, wisdom cannot be rendered technical; it cannot become techne. Thus, Roochnik concludes, Plato wrote dialogues instead of technical treatises, as they are the appropriate vehicle for his expression of nontechnical wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ykRLjgEACAAJ&dq=Of+Art+and+Wisdom:+Plato%27s+Understanding+of+Techne&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden Gospel of Matthew (SkyLight Illuminations)","description":"\\"The Hidden Gospel of Matthew: Annotated and Explained takes you into the text to discover the words and events that have the strongest connection to the historical Jesus.

Less than two years thereafter when Mugabe rose to power in the new Zimbabwe, it signaled the begining of brutal civil unrest that would last nearly a half decade more. With The Stone Virgins Yvonne Vera examines the dissident movement from the perspective of two sisters living in a small township outside of Bulawayo. In a portrait painted in successive impressions of life before and after the liberation, Vera explores the quest for dignity and a centered existence against a backdrop of unimaginable violence; the twin instincts of survival and love; the rival pulls of township and city life; and mankind's capacity for terror, beauty, and sacrifice. One sister will find a reason for hope. One will not make it through alive.

Its goal is to to help man realize the divinity within him. In that it claims, not without reason, to be the most practical of religious philosophies. And that practicality is what Swami Prabhavananda successfully conveys in his remarkably fine and lucid interpretation of \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\". Beautiful as this interpretation is in itself, it is presented by Swami Prabhavananda not as a far-off, scarcely attainable ideal, which is the way most occidentals read the Sermon, but as a practical program of daily living and conduct. So clear is the Swami's reading of this great scripture, that many a Christian by means of it will discover a simpler approach to the teaching of his Master, more direct than any he had found.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ebk5CgAAQBAJ&dq=The+sermon+on+the+Mount+according+to+Vedanta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Village in the Vaucluse (Harper colophon books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gwCDPwAACAAJ&dq=Village+in+the+Vaucluse+(Harper+colophon+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)","description":"As the first comprehensive reference to the vital world of medieval Spain, this unique volume focuses on the Iberian kingdoms from the fall of the Roman Empire to the aftermath of the Reconquista.

In this rich collection of writings by artists, scholars, and revolutionaries, the transgressions of the past are recaptured and transvalued for the benefit of the struggles of today and tomorrow. Along the way, new light is shed on the radical sensibilities of Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, and Friedrich Schlegel while the poetics of Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, and William Blake are revealed to be profoundly oppositional to the reigning culture. The social romanticism of Jules Michelet, the nineteenth-century historian of the French Revolution, is acclaimed for its visionary, quasi-religious breadth. The Paris Commune is figured by the arch-Romantics Karl Marx, Jules Valles, and Arthur Rimbaud. The all-but-forgotten Bavarian Council Republic of 1919 is recalled, a milieu steeped in Expressionism and anarchism, the matrix out of which B. Traven, author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, emerged-by the skin of his teeth. The romantic outlook of Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse, both strongly influenced by Surrealism (\\"the prehensile tail of Romanticism\\") is relocated in their absolute negation of the social order. And, at the end of the twentieth century, there's Guy Debord and the Situationist International, the passionate detournement of the Romantic project. Max Blechman writes, \\"When today aesthetic life is increasingly defined by advertising and corporate culture, and democracy has more to do with the power of private interests than the power of the public imagination, the romantic insistence on the liberatory dimension of aesthetics and on radical democracy may yet prove crucial to contemporary efforts to envision a new political freedom.\\" Revolutionary Romanticism includes Blechman's investigation of the German idealist roots of European Romanticism, Annie Le Brun on the possibility of \\"romantic women,\\" Peter Marshall on William Blake, Maurice Hindle on the political language of the early English Romantics, Arthur Mitzman on Jules Michelet, Christopher Winks on the Paris Commune, Miguel Abensour on William Morris, Peter Lamborn Wilson on the 1919 Bavarian Workers Council, Michael Lowy on Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse, Marie-Dominque Massoni on Surrealism, and Daniel Blanchard on his youthful friendship with Guy Debord.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=A8-cVSC90bQC&dq=Revolutionary+Romanticism:+A+Drunken+Boat+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internet Security: A Jumpstart for Systems Administrators and IT Managers","description":"Internet Security incorporates not only the technology needed to support a solid security strategy but also those policies and processes that must be incorporated in order for that strategy to work.

An analysis follows of the apostle Paul's attitude toward women, which shows how he agreed with and differed from the ideas of his contemporaries. The concluding chapters discuss the evangelists, whose selection and presentation of material with respect to women casts much light on the early Church's understanding of women and their roles. This comprehensive survey, which avoids slanting its material to serve a modern patriarchal or feminist bias, comes to the exciting conclusion that we can see in the New Testament an attempt to reform the patriarchal orientation of the day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ayYrSmJI9m0C&dq=Women+and+the+Genesis+of+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardening Indoors with H.I.D.

If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design. Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels. The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics: Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.

A man can never be hindered from thinking whatever he chooses so long as he conceals what he thinks. The working of his mind is limited only by the bounds of his experience and the power of his imagination. But this natural liberty of private thinking is of little value. It is unsatisfactory and even painful to the thinker himself, if he is not permitted to communicate his thoughts to others, and it is obviously of no value to his neighbours. Moreover it is extremely difficult to hide thoughts that have any power over the mind. If a man's thinking leads him to call in question ideas and customs which regulate the behaviour of those about him, to reject beliefs which they hold, to see better ways of life than those they follow, it is almost impossible for him, if he is convinced of the truth of his own reasoning, not to betray by silence, chance words, or general attitude that he is different from them and does not share their opinions. Some have preferred, like Socr ates, some would prefer to-day, to face death rather than conceal their thoughts. Thus freedom of thought, in any valuable sense, includes freedom of speech....","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FI_OygEACAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Freedom+of+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 10 Smartest Decisions a WOMAN Can Make Before 40","description":"\\"One of the best books for women that I have read.

As the couple hitch their way around the near empty highways, they encounter as wide a cross-section of Aussie society as you could ever hope to meet. In cattle stations, Aboriginal communities, remote waterholes, caravan parks, hippy communes and roadhouses, they see a country that remains as extraordinary today as it was for the first nineteenth century settlers.

Set against a backdrop of the real Australia - not 'as seen on TV'- \\"Thumbs Up Australia\\" is full of wonderful anecdotes and endearing tales of some of the country's most idiosyncratic characters, from the grizzled Aboriginal elder with his tales of dreamtime, to an amphetamine-swallowing road train driver.

This book presents a comprehensive behavioral theory of market interactions and proposes an approach to policy management based on the use of microanalytic computer simulation. The author describes how simulation-based computer systems can provide realistic artificial environments in which managers evaluate historical strategies and examine the implications of proposed future marketing programs under various assumed competitive conditions. Management use of microanalytic simulations to assess the appropriateness of alternative solutions for a wide range of consumer and industrial marketing problems is also discussed. While other books have presented simulations of limited aspects of the marketing environment, Computer Simulation of Competitive Market Response presents complete models of consumer, distributor, retailer, and salesman behavior. Validated representations of key action and response processes including purchase decisions, response to media and word-of-mouth communication, brand image formation, and trade acceptance of new products are described. While adopting a managerial perspective, the author develops an interdisciplinary approach to problem formulation, synthetic and analytic procedures, and hypotheses regarding human behavior and interactions. His carefully structured approach to the fundamental problem of developing, testing, and validating complex models of human actions and responses makes this volume both comprehensible and valuable to researchers and practitioners from a variety of disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P4kBHQAACAAJ&dq=Computer+Simulation+of+Competitive+Market+Response+(MIT+Press+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saint Jack and Toad: Third Angel of the Apocalypse","description":"Horror in the mental institutions is based on a true story.

February 13, 2082, First Contact. Sixty-two thousand objects of unknown origin plunge into Earth's atmosphere  a perfect grid of falling stars screaming across the radio spectrum as they burn. Not even ashes reach the ground. Three hundred and sixty degrees of global surveillance: something just took a snapshot. And then... nothing. But from deep space, whispers. Something out there talks  but not to us. Two ships, Theseus and the Crown of Thorns, are launched to discover the origin of Earth's visitation, one bound for the outer dark of the Kuiper Belt, the other for the heart of the Solar System. Their crews can barely be called human, what they will face certainly can't. 'A tour de force, redefining the First Contact story for good.' Charles Stross. 'If you only read one science fiction novel this year, make it this one!... It puts the whole of the rest of the genre in the shade...

Morris then turns his attention to the kamikaze pilots of World War II, who gave their lives in defense of their nation in the full realization that their deaths would have little effect on the course of the war.

The characters are the soldiers who fought it, the thieves and opportunists who profited from it, and the ordinary people whose lives were shattered by it and from whose ranks emerged the heroes and healers who created peace. Combining contemporary theory and innovative methodology, Nordstrom explores the nature and culture of terror warfare and raises thought-provoking questions about state power, civilian resistance, and the politics of identity. She compares the conflict in Mozambique with similar conflicts and offers a new way of looking at political violence, showing that just as violence is learned, it can be unlearned.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ufx0XfI9Zi4C&dq=War+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Isrli Conflict since 1967, Revised Edition","description":"A Brookings Institution Press and the University of California Press publication Updated through the first term of President George W. Bush, the latest edition of this classic work analyzes how each U.S. president since Lyndon Johnson has dealt with the complex challenge of Arab-Israeli peacemaking. There have been remarkable successes such as the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty frustrating failures, and dangerous wars along the way. This book helps to situate the current Middle East crisis in historical context and point to some possible ways out of the impasse between Israelis and Palestinians. Quandt suggests a clear U.S. commitment to a two-state solution one that would assure Israel of security and peace within the 1967 treaty-established borders, offer the Palestinians an early end to Israeli occupation of Gaza and most of the West Bank, and establish both a Jewish and Arab Jerusalem.

An ingeniously structured novel (about writing a novel) that fascinates like a verbal game of chess, Tristram Shandy is the most protean and playful English novel of the eighteenth century and a celebration of the art of fiction; its inventiveness anticipates the work of Joyce, Rushdie, and Fuentes in our own century.

So far, there have been four clearly discernible phases in their development, based upon the types of images processed and how that processing is performed: (1) Binary (two level) images, processing in software (2) Grey-scale images, processing in software (3) Binary or grey-scale images processed in fast, special-purpose hardware (4) Coloured/multi-spectral images Third-generation vision systems are now commonplace, although a large number of binary and software-based grey-scale processing systems are still being sold. At the moment, colour image processing is commercially much less significant than the other three and this situation may well remain for some time, since many industrial artifacts are nearly monochrome and the use of colour increases the cost of the equipment significantly. A great deal of colour image processing is a straightforward extension of standard grey-scale methods. Industrial applications of machine vision systems can also be sub divided, this time into two main areas, which have largely retained distinct identities: (i) Automated Visual Inspection (A VI) (ii) Robot Vision (RV) This book is about a fifth generation of industrial vision systems, in which this distinction, based on applications, is blurred and the processing is marked by being much smarter (i. e. more \\"intelligent\\") than in the other four generations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=un7TBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straight A's in Maternal-Neonatal Nursing","description":"This easy-to-read outline review follows the unique two-column Straight A's format that lets students choose how they study to improve test scores and final grades.

Eliade abundantly demonstrates universal religious experience and shows how humanity s effort to live within a sacred sphere has manifested itself in myriad cultures from ancient to modern times; how certain beliefs, rituals, symbols, and myths have, with interesting variations, persisted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KxliotWdzXIC&dq=Patterns+in+comparative+religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EDUCATION","description":"This book provides the reader with an introduction to the world of educational research.

The Doll Factory is a sweeping tale of curiosity, love, and possession set among all the sordidness and soaring ambition of 1850s London. The greatest spectacle London has ever seen is being erected in Hyde Park and, among the crowd watching, two people meet. For Iris, an aspiring artist of unique beauty, it is the encounter of a moment forgotten seconds later but for Silas, a curiosity collector enchanted by the strange and beautiful, the meeting marks a new beginning. When Iris is asked to model for Pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint, and suddenly her world expands beyond anything she ever dreamed of. But she has no idea that evil stalks her. Silas, it seems, has thought of only one thing since that chance meeting, and his obsession is darkening by the day...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H-uiDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Doll&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide To Moab, UT Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o7wGvgAACAAJ&dq=Guide+To+Moab,+UT+Backroads&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lyman Shotshell Handbook (Third Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZpPgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lyman+Shotshell+Handbook+(Third+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North Dakota","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_s1PAQAAMAAJ&dq=North+Dakota&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=01GN4Tjnif8C&dq=life+is+a+Banquet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portland Laugher (Thomas Black Mysteries)","description":"Hired to protect brooding ex-con Billy Battle, Seattle private eye Thomas Black suspects that the man responsible for Battle's conviction wants to put him away for good, and Black finds himself targeted by a maniacal killer.

Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Atlanta have their advocates. Gettysburg certainly maintains its hold on the popular imagination. More recently has come the suggestion that no single campaign or battle decided the war or even appreciably altered its direction. If any one battle was a dividing line, Antietam is a solid contender. In no other campaign were the political, diplomatic, and military elements aligned so favorably for the Confederacy. Yet Lee's retreat after the terrible battle in September 1862 changed everything. Great Britain had second thoughts about intervention; Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; and Lee's army, while victorious on other fields, proved not to be unbeatable. Across the years, Antietam remains the worst one-day slaughter in American history. The ghastly losses in the Cornfield, the West Woods, and the Sunken Road still appall the reader. Lee's gamble against disaster and George McClellan's inexplicable refusal to press his advantage remain puzzlements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lebjzP649JUC&dq=Antietam:+Essays+on+the+1862+Maryland+Campaign&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Caso De LA Heredera Solitaria/the Case of the Lonely Heiress (Spanish Edition)","description":"Enkele Spaanse vrienden die in de jaren zeventig samen revolutie bedreven komen na jaren voor een etentje bij elkaar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Pk0gAAtUfDMC&dq=El+Caso+De+LA+Heredera+Solitaria/the+Case+of+the+Lonely+Heiress+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses","description":"This definitive work on computer viruses discusses the techniques modern viruses use to propagate, evade anti-virus software, cause damage, & compromise system security.

Thus we are able to hear from the writer herself, with the thoughts that inspired each line of this traditional favorite. Kept for the Master's use is more than just a wonderful piece of classic literature. It is a personal testament to what is means to live a life fully submitted and devoted to Jesus Christ. Even if that life is filled with chronic pain in which the author Francis Havergal was. She loved her Master and found real life (in spite of suffering) in a life lived in consecration.

How do you manage the creative people you depend on in your team? A 33-year-old entrepreneur who has made over $580 million offers his wise and witty answer in this guide to building a successful business. Lucky or Smart? is the first truly authentic guide to an entrepreneurial life, written by someone who lives it everyday. Bo Peabody started an Internet company as a 19-year-old student. It helped change the way we communicate by providing the average person with the means to create their own home page. Peabody sold his business to Lycos for nearly $60 million. At the first possible moment, he sold - right before the Internet crash. Thus, the question at the heart of this book: is Bo Peabody lucky or smart? Peabody says he was smart enough to realize he was being lucky, but along the way he discovered what is essential to entrepreneurial success: you have to know if you are an entrepreneur or a manager; you have to know how to manage the creative and often difficult people in your business; and you need to make your business fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X-oIPwAACAAJ&dq=Lucky+or+Smart%3F:+Secrets+to+an+Entrepreneurial+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","description":"Det Byzantinske riges historie fra 284 til 1461","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&dq=History+of+the+Byzantine+State&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dictionary of synonyms and antonyms: An indispensable aid to anyone who writes or speaks the English language","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WZHgAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+dictionary+of+synonyms+and+antonyms:+An+indispensable+aid+to+anyone+who+writes+or+speaks+the+English+language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","description":"This is the true story of a trip to the beach that never ends. It's about a husband and wife who escape civilization to build a small restaurant on an island paradise -- and discover that even paradise has its pitfalls. It's a story filled with calamities and comedy, culinary disasters and triumphs, and indelible portraits of people who live and work on a sliver of beauty set in the Caribbean Sea. It's about the maddening, exhausting, outlandish complications of trying to live the simple life -- and the joy that comes when you somehow pull it off. The story begins when Bob and Melinda Blanchard sell their successful Vermont food business and decide, perhaps impulsively, to get away from it all. Why not open a beach bar and grill on Anguilla, their favorite Caribbean island? One thing leads to another and the little grill turns into an enchanting restaurant that quickly draws four-star reviews and a celebrity-studded clientele eager for Melinda's delectable cooking. Amid the frenetic pace of the Christmas \\"high season,\\" the Blanchards and their kitchen staff -- Clinton and Ozzie, the dancing sous-chefs; Shabby, the master lobster-wrangler; Bug, the dish-washing comedian -- come together like a crack drill team. And even in the midst of hilarious pandemonium, there are moments of bliss. As the Blanchards learn to adapt to island time, they become ever more deeply attached to the quirky rhythms and customs of their new home. Until disaster strikes: Hurricane Luis, a category-4 storm with two-hundred-mile-an-hour gusts, devastates Anguilla. Bob and Melinda survey the wreckage of their beloved restaurant and wonder whether leaving Anguilla, with its innumerable challenges, would be any easier than walking out on each other. Affectionate, seductive, and very funny, A Trip to the Beach is a love letter to a place that becomes both home and escape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ERagyI-Dor4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Betts and Mr. Potts","description":"Mr. Betts is concerned when all of his pets develop spots, so he takes them to Mr. Potts, the vet, who gets rid of their spots, but then, to their surprise, they all come down with a case of stripes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BPwy_pn50XkC&dq=Mr.+Betts+and+Mr.+Potts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"England Under The Tudors","description":" Anyone who writes about the Tudor century puts his head into a number of untamed lions  mouths.

Spanning the commencement of Henry VII's reign to the death of Elizabeth I, Elton s magisterial account is populated by many colourful and influential characters, from Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas Cranmer, and Thomas Cromwell to Henry VIII and Mary Queen of Scots. Elton also examines aspects of the Tudor period that had been previously overlooked, such as empire and commonwealth, agriculture and industry, seapower, and the role of the arts and literature.

He was twenty-six, and for nearly six years past he had devoted himself, soul and body, to a single idea to the so far unsolved problem of a?rial navigation. This idea had haunted him ever since he had been able to think logically at all first dimly at school, and then more clearly at college, where he had carried everything before him in mathematics and natural science, until it had at last become a ruling passion that crowded everything else out of his life, and made him, commercially speaking, that most useless of social units a one-idea'd man, whose idea could not be put into working form. He was an orphan, with hardly a blood relation in the world. He had started with plenty of friends, mostly made at college, who thought he had a brilliant future before him, and therefore looked upon him as a man whom it might be useful to know. But as time went on, and no results came, these dropped off, and he got to be looked upon as an amiable lunatic, who was wasting his great talents and what money he had on impracticable fancies, when he might have been earning a handsome income if he had stuck to the beaten track, and gone in for practical work. The distinctions that he had won at college, and the reputation he had gained as a wonderfully clever chemist and mechanician, had led to several offers of excellent positions in great engineering firms; but to the surprise and disgust of his friends he had declined them all. No one knew why, for he had kept his secret with the almost passionate jealousy of the true enthusiast, and so his refusals were put down to sheer foolishness, and he became numbered with the geniuses who are failures because they are not practical. When he came of age he had inherited a couple of thousand pounds, which had been left in trust to him by his father. Had it not been for that two thousand pounds he would have been forced to employ his knowledge and his talents conventionally, and would probably have made a fortune. But it was just enough to relieve him from the necessity of earning his living for the time being, and to make it possible for him to devote himself entirely to the realisation of his life-dream at any rate until the money was gone. Of course he yielded to the temptation nay, he never gave the other course a moment's thought. Two thousand pounds would last him for years; and no one could have persuaded him that with complete leisure, freedom from all other concerns, and money for the necessary experiments, he would not have succeeded long before his capital was exhausted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KYJrivwbI3cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cutting Edge (American University Studies Series IX, History)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=apfiAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cutting+Edge+(American+University+Studies+Series+IX,+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Press Freedom and Global Politics","description":"Van Belle provides the first systematic analysis of the effects that press freedom has on the conduct of international politics.

As a slave youth, Frederick Douglass owned just one book, and read it frequently, referring to it as a \\"gem\\" and his \\"rich treasure.\\" The Columbian Orator presents 84 selections, most of which are notable examples of oratory on such subjects as nationalism, religious faith, individual liberty, freedom, and slavery, including pieces by Washington, Franklin, Milton, Socrates, and Cicero, as well as heroic poetry and dramatic dialogues.

Like rats in a maze, we search endlessly for liberation from proscribed standards of behavior and the experiences forced on us by others. We play the game without knowing we are playing it.In this book, Dr. Zinner demonstrates that freedom from circular behavior is possible, and that we can break the chains that bind us if we embrace a vision of spiritual freedom.This book offers a systematic method based on Dr. Zinner's construct known as rings, which can enable serious seekers to understand and work with the apparent chaos of the human condition. The swirling chaotic energies are what merge into a point called now, but within chaos is a still, tranquil place where we can see our choices, take creative action and uncover hidden truths. Seekers who are not afraid to look into a mirror at the place just behind their eyes will find answers in this definitive prescription for altering perception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W3QBAAAACAAJ&dq=Taking+the+Quantum+Leap+to+Happiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=feWLzQEACAAJ&dq=Practical+Standards+for+Microsoft+Visual+Basic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mending Cracks in the Soul: The Role of the Holy Spirit in Healing Wounds of the Past","description":"The truths contained in this book are simple and easy to understand.

From the definitive Latin text and notes, Italian commentary and introduction by Giuliano ... and Arthur W. Shippee (Value Inquiry Book)","description":"Gustavo Costa reviewing the Italian edition of Vico's Institutiones Oratoriae in New Vico Studies 9 (1991), has written that Rhetoric is the mainspring of an important trend of Vichian studies which initiated at the beginning of the twentieth century and had its manifestation in John D. Schaeffer's Sensus Communis: Vico, Rhetoric, and the Limits of Relativism (Durham: Duke University Press, 1990), where Schaeffer aptly noted, summing up a long exegetic tradition, Vico was imbued with rhetoric and convinced of its centrality to Western civilization. Unfortunately, the editions of Vico's works published in English have not yet included the Institutiones Oratoriae, which more or less reflects the lectures on rhetoric given by Vico at the University of Naples, starting with the academic year 1699-1700 and going through 1739-1741. The manual on rhetoric was used in Italy up to the end of the nineteenth century and established the common curriculum in rhetoric to be followed in all Universities. This English edition offers a text of the Institutiones complete on the base of the four known extant manuscripts. It offers the marginal glosses made by Vico's students, a collection of Vico's phrases and explanations of terms collected by some of the students, a glossary of Latin words and rhetorical terms from the Latin text, and a wealth of information in the commentary. The Art of Rhetoric is the manual for everyone who wants to know what rhetoric is, how it was employed in the forum or the courts, how it could be learned from the classic orators, and how it can be used whenever we speak for convincing, praising or motivating.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ymlvEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Rhetoric+(Institutiones+Oratoriae,+1711-1741).+From+the+definitive+Latin+text+and+notes,+Italian+commentary+and+introduction+by+Giuliano+...+and+Arthur+W.+Shippee+(Value+Inquiry+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogue Mapping: Building Shared Understanding of Wicked Problems","description":"In contrast to the use of agendas and restrictive structures, dialogue mapping is a facilitation technique that allows the intelligence and learning of the group to emerge naturally.

A firm believer in the inseparable relationship between history and literature, he has published more than fifty books that fully manifest his profound knowledge of Chinese history and his excellent mastery of the Chinese language. His works fall into three areas: fictions based on historical personalities; historical novels in late Qing settings; and studies on the Dream of the Red Chamber; thus making him at once an author, a historian, and a Redologist. An eminently successful author with a world-wide following, he is surely one of the very few outstanding Chinese writers whose works truly deserve to be introduced to the English-reading public. The two stories translated here are taken from his book entitled Purple Jade Hairpin. Rekindled Love is the story of Zheng Banqiao, one of the 'Eight Eccentrics' of the Qing dynasty, and his childhood lover Wang Yijie. Purple Jade Hairpin is an intriguing love story between the famous Tang poet Li Yi and a well-known courtesan Huo Xiaoyu.

Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ s Passion. This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other subject to fear, doubt, and pain. In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.

In this new study, based on a wealth of hitherto unpublished sources, as well as a fresh reading of Hearn's writings, Paul Murray reveals a multi-faceted character of considerable depth, intelligence and literary skill. This is a book, therefore, that will appeal on many levels. The story of Hearn's life makes fascinating reading; his fantastic journey took him from conception outside marriage on a Greek island to a protected upbringing in Dublin; from a Gothic education in England to Cincinnati in the United States where, as Paddy Hearn, he established himself as a journalist of the macabre par excellence. In New Orleans, in the 1860s, he transformed himself into Lafcadio Hearn, litterateur and a man of the South. Finally after two years in the West Indies, he spent the last fourteen years of his life in Japan - arriving in 'the land of the gods' in the spring of 1890. Although it was always to be an ambiguous relationship with his adopted country, Hearn gave to the world some of the most valuable and enduring insights into Japanese society and culture that continue to stand the test of time. For students of the Anglo-Irish tradition, a little explored strand of Hearn's heritage, this book is also essential reading, providing substantial insights into Hearn's mastery of the literary horror genre. Equally, students of Japan will want to understand, for the first time, the make-up and motivation of one of its greatest ever Western interpreters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bAYM_e5MiD0C&dq=Wonderful+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IZxiuwEACAAJ&dq=Under+Western+Eyes+(Malay+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","description":"Eloise Kelly longs for the romance of years gone by; for a dashing hero like The Scarlet Pimpernel to come and sweep her off her Jimmy Choo-clad feet...but instead she's sloshing around London in the rain and finally realising that romantic heroes are a thing of the past. To distract herself from such thoughts, Eloise concentrates on her History dissertation, and it's while rummaging through a pile of old letters and diaries that she discovers something amazing, something that historians have missed: the secret history of the most elusive spy of all time, The Pink Carnation.

For a reader in our more forgiving times, this extraordinary document offers not only a portrait of the early life of an intelligent, courageous, and infinitely intriguing Frenchwoman but also an exceedingly rare inside look at the world of the courtesans and prostitutes of nineteenth-century France. ? Writing to conciliate judges and creditors, Mogador (born C?leste Venard in 1824) explains how with tenacity, wit, and audacity, she managed to escape a difficult childhood and subsequent life of prostitution to become, successively, a darling of the dance halls, a circus rider, and an actress, all the while attracting wealthy young men who vied for her favor. Although her account gives readers a peek into the rakish demimonde made famous by Verdi's opera La Traviata, its greatest value lies in its candid picture of a spunky, self-educated woman who doggedly transformed herself into an esteemed and prolific novelist and playwright, who fell in love with a count and married him, and who made her name synonymous with the bohemian life of the 1840s and 1850s in Paris.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gxGHkYIatmoC&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Courtesan+in+Nineteenth-Century+Paris+(European+Women+Writers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself SuSE Linux in 24 Hours Starter Kit","description":"Sams Teach Yourself WordPerfect Office 2000 for Linux in 24 Hours provides a greater understanding of and appreciation for Linux, and a working knowledge of each application in the office suite.

English relies much more on word order. Latin grammar, like that of other ancient Indo-European languages, is highly inflected and so allows for a large degree of flexibility in choosing word order. For example, (omitting capitals and punctuation for simplicity), the sentence femina togam texuit meaning \\"the woman wove a toga\\", represents the preferred word order. However, the meaning could be, still correctly, as texuit togam femina or togam texuit femina. Each word's suffix (-a, -am and -uit) indicates the word's grammatical function as a subject, object and verb, respectively. The suffixes provide the sentence with its particular meaning. Charles Edwin Bennett (April 6, 1858  May 2, 1921) was an American classical scholar and the Goldwin Smith Professor of Latin at Cornell University.

The Red Atlantic, Jace Weaver's sweeping and highly readable survey of history and literature, synthesizes scholarship to place indigenous people of the Americas at the center of our understanding of the Atlantic world. Weaver illuminates their willing and unwilling travels through the region, revealing how they changed the course of world history. Indigenous Americans, Weaver shows, crossed the Atlantic as royal dignitaries, diplomats, slaves, laborers, soldiers, performers, and tourists. And they carried resources and knowledge that shaped world civilization--from chocolate, tobacco, and potatoes to terrace farming and suspension bridges. Weaver makes clear that indigenous travelers were cosmopolitan agents of international change whose engagement with other societies gave them the tools to advocate for their own sovereignty even as it was challenged by colonialism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=08IBAwAAQBAJ&dq=Cherokee+Chronicles:+From+1st+Contact+To+The+Trail+of+Tears&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chelsea The Story of a Signal Dog","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P4TmzQEACAAJ&dq=Chelsea+The+Story+of+a+Signal+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Armageddon Chronicles: A Mafia Epic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4-L5twEACAAJ&dq=The+Armageddon+Chronicles:+A+Mafia+Epic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Streamer Fly Tying & Fishing 1ST Edition","description":"Declared OSI effective 01/01/07","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XsLNwAEACAAJ&dq=Streamer+Fly+Tying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Business Kit For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","description":"Millions of Americans own their own businesses, and millions more dream of doing the same.

Conkin, one of America's most distinguished intellectual historians, offers his commentary on almost every aspect of the American past. Delivered to a wide variety of audiences over more than a quarter of a century, these essays are simultaneously informal, profound, graceful, and self-revealing. A common theme shared by all the essays is the ambiguous results of our nation's transition from relatively homogeneous communities, villages, and regions to a cosmopolitan culture with a centralized, regulatory welfare state, and an increasingly mobile and pluralistic population. The village's sense of local autonomy has all but disappeared in the face of these trends. With an almost melancholy sense of what has been lost, Conkin charts the strains and tensions that have marked this incredible transition. But Conkin is also acutely aware of the necessities that have fueled these changes, as well as the many benefits of the new order, ranging from an unprecedented level of affluence to the full citizenship gained by minorities. A reluctant Southerner, Conkin has not forgotten the exclusivity, intolerance, and repression that often mark provincial communities. Conkin reflects on the historians' craft and the influence of his own past on the subjects he studies. A Requiem for the American Village is infused with Conkin's razor sharp sense of historical memory and historical consciousness. From the foundations of American government to the tensions of contemporary cultural pluralism, Paul Conkin offers powerful insights not only about the tortured history of the South, but the promises and pitfalls of the American experiment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-OqwEnhG-J0C&dq=A+Requiem+for+the+American+Village&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straight A's in Nursing Pharmacology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iwvatwEACAAJ&dq=Straight+A%27s+in+Nursing+Pharmacology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiling and Mosaics in a Weekend (In A Weekend Series)","description":"A tiling and mosaics guide offers crafters a range of 14 original projects, with full-color, step-by-step instructions and inexpensive materials lists and pricing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fWZyzgEACAAJ&dq=Tiling+and+Mosaics+in+a+Weekend+(In+A+Weekend+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Questions: Volume I [The Book of Questions, The Book of Yukel, Return to the Book] (The Book of Questions , Vol 1)","description":"A meditative narrative of Jewish Experience and man's relation to the world.

This one is made of sturdy green glass, thirty-six centimeters tall, eighteen centimeters around at the widest point of its base. The top part of the vessel is narrow and fluted and turns sharply to the right; alembics are set over a still to collect and carry vapors to another vessel. The vessel's inside bears a crust of gray material that seems to be a mixture of lead, iron, and antimony, as well as some organic matter, canine and human bones. Scorch marks are visible on the outside bottom, extending five centimeters up. No discernible odor. Date of manufacture: unknown. Estimates range from 100 b.c. to a.d. 300 Place of origin: Hellenistic Egypt. \\"Alembic\\" comes from the Arabic \\"al-anbiq,\\" which comes from the Greek \\"ambix,\\" meaning cup or beaker Last known owner: Woldemar L??wendahl, Danish-Estonian governor general of Tallinn. The alembic was unearthed during the construction of Kassari chapel on Kassari Island in April 1723 and brought to L??wendahl's office that June. The governor general placed it on the top shelf of an unfilled bookcase in the back corner of his office and never noticed when it went missing two years, six months, and seventeen days later... When a twelfth-century Sicilian cat burglar snatches a sack of artifacts from the king's geographer's library, the tools and talismans of transmutation-and eternal life-are soon scattered all over the world. Nine hundred years later, a young Connecticut reporter finds evidence that someone is collecting them again. In the process of investigating the suspicious death of a local professor, Paul Tomm finds the dead man's heavily fortified office stuffed with books on alchemy. The Geographer's Library entwines his contemporary reporting with a chain of ancient stories-within-the-story, tracking the last time each of the geographer's tools changed hands-some bought, some stolen, some killed for. The Geographer's Library is an extraordinary debut, smart, stylishly written, and full of suspense. It tempts with the glitter of antiquities and hooks with a chilling plot. In this brilliant debut, competing visions of an obscure professor's life take a young reporter from a sleepy New England town to the heart of an international smuggling ring that may hold the secret to eternal life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H5ogAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Geographer%27s+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","description":"\\"This timely book sets the bar for Object Transaction Monitors (OTMs).

It remains a Holy Grail shining in the distance, always out of reach. For those who feel they have it, it seems to have come down to overcoming the guilt they feel as they sidle out at 5 pm while everybody else is still in the office. Small wonder that elusive balance preoccupies us all more and more. But what if it isn't really a 'balancing act' at all? What if we didn't have to choose between work and life.What if we all needed to start thinking and acting in a different way, and if we did it would be possible to do a great job AND go home on time?

In this brief period, whole neighborhoods of medieval and revolutionary Paris -- over-crowded, dangerous, and filthy -- were razed, and from the rubble a modern city of light and air emerged. This triumphant rebuilding was chiefly the work of one man, Baron Georges Haussmann, Napoleon III's Prefect of the Seine. It was Haussmann's task to assert, in stone, the power and permanence of Paris, to show the world that it was the seat of an empire of mythic proportions. To this end, he imposed grand visual perspectives, as when he transformed Napoleon I's Arc de Triomphe into a magnificent twelve-armed star from which radiated the broadest boulevards of Europe. Below ground, his modern sewer system became one of the wonders of the civilized world, eagerly toured by royalty and commoners alike. Haussmann's mandate was not only to create an impression of grandeur but to secure the city for better control by government. By creating formal spaces where there had previously been a maze of chaotic streets, Haussmann opened Paris to effective police control and thwarted the recurrent demonstration of its well-known revolutionary fervor. The determined and autocratic Haussmann imprinted rational order and bourgeois civility on the unruly city which had for so long simmered with riot and insurrection. Though he planted chestnut trees, installed gas lights, rebuilt the water supply, and improved transportation and housing, Haussmann's labors were (and remain) controversial. He forced tens of thousands of the poor from the center of the city, and destroyed significant parts of old Paris. But in this important new biography David Jordan reminds us that Haussmann was not immune to the charms of the old city. By leaving some areas intact, the Baron achieved the grand effect of implanting a modern city boldly within an ancient one. Here, at last, Haussmann's labors are given the aesthetic as well as the historical appreciation they deserve.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aMAjiTtGAQgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santa Go Home: A Case History for Parents","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=75xutAEACAAJ&dq=Santa+Go+Home:+A+Case+History+for+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sojourn in Savannah: An Official Guidebook and Map of Historic Savannah and the Surrounding Countryside","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GUFstgAACAAJ&dq=Sojourn+in+Savannah:+An+Official+Guidebook+and+Map+of+Historic+Savannah+and+the+Surrounding+Countryside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Office Wife","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qHSmtgAACAAJ&dq=The+Office+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE : The Core Exams in a Nutshell","description":"Overview, study guide, and practice exams for Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) core exams 70-270, 70-297, and 70-298.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZUFT9PRDifYC&dq=MCSE+:+The+Core+Exams+in+a+Nutshell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Final Battle (Dungeon, Vol 6)","description":"?Philip Jos  Farmer, the bestselling author of RIVERWORLD, introduces the climatic volume of fantastic adventure within the confines of THE DUNGEON Escape and victory?

In Battling Pornography, Carolyn Bronstein locates the origins of anti-pornography sentiment in the turbulent social and cultural history of the late 1960s and 1970s. Based on extensive original archival research, the book reveals that the seeds of the movement were planted by groups who protested the proliferation of advertisements, Hollywood films and other mainstream media that glorified sexual violence. Over time, feminist leaders redirected the emphasis from violence to pornography to leverage rhetorical power. Battling Pornography presents a fascinating account of the rise and fall of this significant American social movement and documents the contributions of influential activists on both sides of the pornography debate, including some of the best-known American feminists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series)","description":"This is an account of the discovery of the constituents of the atom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F1TCQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Discovery+Of+Subatomic+Particles+(Scientific+American+Library+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","description":"Tussen de bedrijven (1941) was de laatste roman die Virginia Woolf schreef, en hij was, volgens haar eigen woorden, essenti?ler dan alles wat ze daarvoor had geschreven.

Het verhaal speelt zich af op een zomerse dag in 1939, de dag waarop de jaarlijkse dorpsvoorstelling wordt opgevoerd op het landgoed van de familie Oliver. De gedachten en gesprekken van de intrigerende personages worden verweven met hun reactie op de aanstaande oorlog die de toekomst zal veranderen.

Often motivated to create profit-driven biotech start-up companies or to serve on their advisory boards, university researchers now commonly operate under serious conflicts of interest. These conflicts stand in the way of giving full consideration to the social and ethical consequences of the technologies they seek to develop. Too often, bioentrepreneurs have worked to obscure how these technologies could alter human evolution and to hide the social costs of keeping on this path. Tracing the rise and cultural politics of biotechnology from a critical perspective, Biotech Juggernaut aims to correct the informational imbalance between producers of biotechnologies on the one hand, and the intended consumers of these technologies and general society, on the other. It explains how the converging vectors of economic, political, social, and cultural elements driving biotechnology s swift advance constitutes a juggernaut. It concludes with a reflection on whether it is possible for an informed public to halt what appears to be a runaway force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8-GEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-DSL Architecture","description":"Construct end-to-end copper loop access architectures based on the underlying building blocks of xDSL technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_TvXKv_ORrwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","description":"In Jared Diamond s follow-up to the Pulitzer-Prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, the author explores how climate change, the population explosion and political discord create the conditions for the collapse of civilization. Diamond is also the author of Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis Environmental damage, climate change, globalization, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of societies around the world, but some found solutions and persisted. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe, and weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Collapse moves from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society s apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana. Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mYPXUHZCp3gC&dq=Collapse:+How+Societies+Choose+to+Fail+or+Succeed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conservation of Furniture","description":"Covers the developmental history of furniture, including a variety of materials and decorative surfaces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Nco-r78TNoC&dq=Conservation+of+Furniture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visio 2000 Visual Insight","description":"Targeted to a wide range of business professionals, this guide features screenshot-by-screenshot instructions with a 16-pp. Color Studio that illustrates color-related tasks and finished products from the book, exposing capabilities and versatility of Visio.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pVb_EZwH2fIC&dq=Visio+2000+Visual+Insight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pronti...Via!: Beginning Italian (Yale Language Series)","description":"Pronti...

When George Washington Hayduke III returns home from war in the jungles of Southeast Asia, he finds the unspoiled West he once knew has been transformed. The pristine lands and waterways are being strip mined, dammed up, and paved over by greedy government hacks and their corrupt corporate coconspirators. And the manic, beer-guzzling, rabidly antisocial ex-Green Beret isn t just getting mad. Hayduke plans to get even. Together with a radical feminist from the Bronx; a wealthy, billboard-torching libertarian MD; and a disgraced Mormon polygamist, Hayduke s ready to stick it to the Man in the most creative ways imaginable. By the time they re done, there won t be a bridge left standing, a dam unblown, or a bulldozer unmolested from Arizona to Utah. Edward Abbey s most popular novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang is an outrageous romp with ultra-serious undertones that is as relevant today as it was in the early days of the environmental movement. The author who Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove) once dubbed  The Thoreau of the American West  has written a true comedic classic with brains, heart, and soul that more than justifies the call from the Los Angeles Times Book Review that we should all  praise the earth for Edward Abbey!

It examines essays, dialogues, and performance texts from theater directors, performers, theorists, playwrights, and performance writers against social and cultural constructs and performance theories to produce a diverse and challenging portrait of lesbian live performance art. The book s penetrating scope covers drag queens, lesbian vampires, representations of lesbian sex, solo artists, the art of collaboration, lesbian aesthetics, and lesbian playwrights writing straight and illustrates why live performance is one of the most dynamic forums in which women can create, control, and produce their work without artistic constraint. Acts of Passion explodes binary definitions of gender and sexuality by destabilizing familiar notions of the  real and creating new production values and aesthetics in the process.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the practice of medicine in the United States underwent a most remarkable--and thoroughly controversial--transformation. The discretion that the profession once enjoyed has been increasingly circumscribed, and now an almost bewildering number of parties and procedures participate in medical decision making. Well into the post-World War II period, decisions at the bedside were the almost exclusive concern of the individual physician, even when they raised fundamental ethical and social issues. It was mainly doctors who wrote and read about the morality of withholding a course of antibiotics and letting pneumonia serve as the old man's best friend, of considering a newborn with grave birth defects a \\"stillbirth\\" thus sparing the parents the agony of choice and the burden of care, of experimenting on the institutionalized the retarded to learn more about hepatitis, or of giving one patient and not another access to the iron lung when the machine was in short supply. Moreover, it was usually the individual physician who decided these matters without formal discussions with patients, their families, or even with colleagues, and certainly without drawing the attention of journalists, judges, or professional philosophers. The impact of the invasion of outsiders into medical decision-making, most generally framed, was to make the invisible visible. Outsiders to medicine--that is, lawyers, judges, legislators, and academics--have penetrated its every nook and cranny, in the process giving medicine exceptional prominence on the public agenda and making it the subject of popular discourse. The glare of the spotlight transformed medical decision making, shaping not merely the external conditions under which medicine would be practiced (something that the state, through the regulation of licensure, had always done), but the very substance of medical pract","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mx0uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webmaster in a Nutshell (2nd Edition)","description":"Individuals, organizations, and businesses are relying on their web pages to provide and collect information, manage processes, and interact with communities and customers.

They suggest that the US-funded excavations on the Giza plateau - officially denied, but for which the authors produce documented evidence - now appear to be the result of directives allegedly received through communication with beings of higher intelligence, who are instructing the conspirators to lay the foundations for great global changes. Provocative & stimulating, STARGATE CONSPIRACY is a book of and for the new millennium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3QF8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alfred & Guinevere","description":"Alfred Nobel is het fascinerende verhaal van een man en zijn tijd. Gelauwerd biograaf Ingrid Carlberg beschrijft het indrukwekkende en onwaarschijnlijke leven van de man die zijn naam zou verbinden aan de belangrijkste prijs ter wereld. Tegelijkertijd is deze biografie een zinderende weergave van het Europa van de negentiende eeuw, met zijn politieke ontwikkelingen, literaire rijkdom en geniale wetenschappers. We volgen Nobel vanaf zijn armoedige peuterjaren in Stockholm, via zijn gang door Europa in het kielzog van zijn vader, en zien hoe hij als ondernemer alle kansen aangreep die hem werden geboden. Hij vond het dynamiet uit, met alle consequenties van dien, en predikte vervolgens juist de vrede. Hij ambieerde een literaire carri re, maar net als zijn liefdesleven kwam ook die niet van de grond. Nobel was, kortom, een gepijnigd mens in een wervelende tijd. Carlberg leverde een prestatie van formaat met deze biografie, die ze schreef met de ambitie van een wetenschapper en het lef van een verhalend journalist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7yn4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vBYlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Outlaw+of+Gor+(Strange+History+of+Counter-Earth,+Vol.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 2000(r) Active Directory Survival Guide: Planning and Implementation","description":"An excellent resource for learning how to take full advantage of Active Directory's flexibility, extensibility, and scalability Windows(r) 2000 Active Directory(TM) Survival Guide At the core of the Windows 2000 system lies one of the most welcome additions to the Windows NT product line-Active Directory.

The book vividly depicts the political forces that have pushed this country toward an abyss, threatening constitutional democracy at home and world peace abroad. Its central message can be understood as an urgent wake-up call to everyone concerned with the future of America.\\" Richard Falk, author of The Great Terror War \\"Peter Dale Scott is one of that tiny and select company of the most brilliantly creative and provocative political-historical writers of the last half century. The Road to 9/11 further secures his distinction as truth-teller and prophet. He shows us here with painful yet hopeful clarity the central issue of our time America's coming to terms with its behavior in the modern world. As in his past work, Scott's gift is not only recognition and wisdom but also redemption and rescue we simply cannot do without.\\" Roger Morris, former NSC staffer \\"The Road to 9/11 is vintage Peter Dale Scott. Scott does not undertake conventional political analysis; instead, he engages in a kind of poetics, crafting the dark poetry of the deep state, of parapolitics, and of shadow government. As with his earlier work Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, Scott has no theory of responsibility and does not name the guilty. Rather, he maps out an alien terrain, surveying the topography of a political shadow land, in which covert political deviancy emerges as the norm. After reading Scott, we can no longer continue with our consensus-driven belief that our so-called 'liberal' order renders impossible the triumph of the politically irrational.\\" Eric Wilson, Senior Lecturer of Public International Law, Monash University, and co-editor of Government of the Shadows \\"Peter Dale Scott exposes a shadow world of oil, terrorism, drug trade and arms deals, of covert financing and parallel security structures-from the Cold War to today. He shows how such parallel forces of the United States have been able to dominate the agenda of the George W. Bush Administration, and that statements and actions made by Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld before, during and after September 11, 2001, present evidence for an American 'deep state' and for the so-called 'Continuity of Government' in parallel to the regular 'public state' ruled by law. Scott's brilliant work not only reveals the overwhelming importance of these parallel forces but also presents elements of a strategy for restraining their influence to win back the 'public state', the American democracy.\\" Ola Tunander, International Peace Research Institute, Oslo \\"A powerful study of the historic origins of the terrorist strikes of September 11, this book offers an indispensable guide to the gluttonous cast of characters who, since Watergate and the fall of Nixon, fashioned an ever more reckless American empire. By exposing the corrupt U.S. 'deep state'-transfer of public authority to America's wealthy and to the nation's unaccountable secret intelligence agencies-Peter Dale Scott's The Road to 9/11 illuminates the path toward a more democratic and inclusive republic.\\" David MacGregor, King's University College at the University of Western Ontario \\"The Road to 9/11 provides an illuminating and disturbing history of the American government since World War II. Scott's account suggests that the 9/11 attacks were a culmination of long-term trends that threaten the very existence of American democracy, and also that there has been a massive cover-up of 9/11 itself. This book, which combines extensive research, perceptive analysis, and a fascinating narrative, will surely be considered Scott's magnum opus.\\" David Ray Griffin, author of Debunking 9/11 Debunking \\"'The America we knew and loved. Can it be saved?' That question opens this book, and getting to the answer called for the honed intellect of a scholar and the sensitivity of a poet. Peter Dale Scott has both, in spades, and here gives us much, much more than a book about 9/11. In a time of fear, he speaks for sanity and freedom.\\" Anthony Summers, author of The Arrogance of Power","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TMkkDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+9/11+Commission+Report+(Pocket+University)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NetWare 5 CNE: Core Technologies Study Guide","description":"Author Michael Moncur covers Networking Technologies and Service and Support in this study guide for candidates preparing for Novell's most important certification.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BY8JAAAACAAJ&dq=NetWare+5+CNE:+Core+Technologies+Study+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"Young, bright Taylor Greer leaves her poverty-stricken life in Kentucky and heads west, picking up an abandoned Native American baby girl whom she names Turtle and finds a new home in Tucson with Mattie, an old woman who takes in Central American refugees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9MWnPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Bean+Trees+(G+K+Hall+Large+Print+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light in the North: Seven Years with Aberdeen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CmPAOAAACAAJ&dq=Light+in+the+North:+Seven+Years+with+Aberdeen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are","description":"The Book On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are explores an unrecognised but mighty taboo - our tacit conspiracy to ignore who, or what, we really are. Alan Watts, key thinker of Western Zen Buddhism, explains how to reconsider our relationship with the world. We are in urgent need of a sense of our own existence, which is in accord with the physical facts and which overcomes our feeling of alienation from the universe. In The Book On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Alan Watts asks what causes the illusion of the self as a separate ego which confronts a universe of physical objects that are alien to it. Rather, a person's identity binds them to the physical universe, creating a relationship with their environment and other people. The separation of the self and the physical world leads to the misuse of technology and the attempt to violently subjugate man's natural environment, leading to its destruction. Watts urges against the idea that we are separate from the world. Nowhere is this idea more apparent than in the concept of cultural taboos. The biggest taboo of all is knowing who we really are behind the mask of our self as presented to the world. Through our focus on ourselves and the world as it affects us, we have developed narrowed perception. Alan Watts tells us how to open our eyes and see ourselves not as coming into the world but from it. In understanding the individual's real place in the universe, Watts presents a critique of Western culture and a healing alternative.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSqGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Administration Survival Guide","description":"\\"Sue Plumley has taken the full breadth of network administration and drilled down into the detail that's always left out of network operating system vendor manuals. .

He was one half of the highest paid dance team in show business, an expert cryptic crossword compiler, and a championship ping pong player. Yet he was able to make himself a millionaire several times over by his unique investment approach. Unlike other so-called systems, it worked regardless of whether the market rose or fell. When news of Darvas's fantastic profits and methods leaked out, he was featured in Time magazine. He then was persuaded to write a book which became an instant hit, selling nearly 200,000 copies in eight weeks. Many of the companies talked about in this book no longer exist.

Unlike similar works, these orders of battle are dynamic, and so account for the continuously changing character of Germany s ground forces at war. This massive new reference work by McCroden and Nutter, broken up in sections including Theater Commands, Army Groups, Armies, and Corps Commands, presents a detailed analysis of each corresponding order of battle for every German field formation above division. Additional new ground is broken by also describing the orders of battle of the myriad German and Axis satellite formations assigned to security commands throughout occupied Europe and the combat zones, as well as those attached to fortress commands and to the commanders of German occupation forces in Eastern and Western Europe. An accompanying narrative describes the career of each field formation and includes the background and experience of many of their most famous commanding officers. For the first time, readers can follow the career of every German division, corps, army, and army group as the German armed forces shifted units to and from theaters of war, from the period of triumphant successes to the years of grinding defensive warfare and eventual defeat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7E8IEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","description":"In this reexamination of what it means to have a tradition, Catholic and otherwise, Mark D.

The twentieth century has witnessed both radical alteration and tenacious durability in social organization, politics, economics, and art. To comprehend these changes as history and as guideposts to the future, Peter F. Drucker has, over a lifetime, pursued a discipline that he terms social ecology. The writings brought together in The Ecological Vision define the discipline as a sustained inquiry into the man-made environment and an active effort at maintaining equilibrium between change and conservation. The chapters in this volume range over a wide array of disciplines and subject matter. They are linked by a common concern with the interaction of the individual and society, and a common perspective that views economics, technology, politics, and art as dimensions of social experience and expressions of social value. Included here are profiles of such figures as Henry Ford, John C. Calhoun, Soren Kierkegaard, and Thomas Watson; analyses of the economics of Keynes and Schumpeter;and explorations of the social functions of business, management, information, and technology. Drucker's chapters on Japan examine the dynamics of cultural and economic change and afford striking comparisons with similar processes in the West. In the concluding chapter, \\"Reflections of a Social Ecologist,\\" Drucker traces the development of his discipline through such intellectual antecedents as Alexis de Tocqueville, Walter Bagehot, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. He illustrates the ecological vision, an active, practical, and moral approach to social questions. Peter Drucker summarizes a lifetime of work and exemplifies the communicative clarity that are requisites of all intellectual enterprises. His book will be of interest to economists, business people, foreign affairs specialists, and intellectual historians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Ko0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straight A's in Pediatric Nursing","description":"This easy-to-read outline review follows the unique two-column Straight A's format that lets students choose how they study to improve test scores and final grades.

Within a neo-institutional theoretical framework, it is argued that these attempts at systemic reform were generated from a highly legitimate mnetapolicy that established the theory of action from which all policies were developed and implemented. Interviews with over 20 key participants and examination of archival data reveal that even within institutions, governing boards and their staff act strategically by actively manipulating institutional elements in the environment and managing intraorganizational processes. It is concluded that the metapolicy consists of five core elements: system development, mission differentiation, student opportunity, concentration of talent, and managerialism. Each of these five elements was highly legitimate with policymakers and the public, and served to increase the profile and the credibility of the system, a great accomplishment in a state where public higher education has traditionally been treated with indifference and even hostility. This legitimacy, however, has obscured the degree to which some of these policies have negatively impacted student access for underrepresented groups.\\" \\"--Abstract.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9g9GPQAACAAJ&dq=Metapolicy+in+public+higher+education:+Activist+governing+boards+and+systemic+reform&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","description":"Are you keen to learn Python Programming?

Harney: Prince of Dragoons","description":"Between the War of 1812 and the Civil War, General William S. Harney became one of the best-known military figures in America. In a career aided by Andrew Jackson and the concept of an expansible army, Harney saw duty in virtually every part of the country and participated in most of the key military episodes of his time. He chased remnants of Lafitte pirates in Louisiana, campaigned with Abraham Lincoln and Zachary Taylor during the Black Hawk War, developed Vietnam-style riverine tactics that ended the Second Seminole War, and led Winfield Scott's cavalry in the Mexican War. In the 1850s Harney devised the army's largest and most successful pre?Civil War campaign against Plains Indians, commanded troops charged with upholding federal authority in Kansas and Utah, and almost provoked hostilities with Great Britain in the Pacific Northwest. Removed from command amid false charges of disloyalty during the Missouri secession crisis, he returned as a leading member of the Indian Peace Commission of 1867?68. ? Harney was bold, ambitious, and innovative, but also impulsive, vindictive, and violent. His career illustrates the nineteenth-century army's role in implementing federal policy, highlights its limited resources compared to its responsibilities, and illuminates key aspects of its organizational structure, the behavior of its officers, and its impact on personal lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PAI5TEtRuecC&dq=General+William+S.+Harney:+Prince+of+Dragoons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leopard in the Sun","description":"A deadly fight over a woman leads to two related families torn apart by blood, until one man is forced to turn his back on his heritage to keep the woman he loves, and two women risk everything to secure a future for their sons, in a story set against the backdrop of the rise of Colombia's drug cartels. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zgweAQAAIAAJ&dq=Leopard+in+the+Sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shamrock Green","description":"The marriage of Sylvie and Gowry McCulloch was not made in heaven and has gone through difficult times.

Like most other Shakespearean scholars he had accepted, Bradley's portrait as shown in The Rejection of Falstaff, until (as he writes) he 'began checking it with yet another portrait - that which I found in the pages of Shakespeare himself. As the result of much recent work on the two parts of Henry IV, a new Falstaff stands before me, as fascinating as Bradley's, certainly quite as human, but different; and beside him stands a still more unexpected Prince Hal. The discovery throws all my previous ideas out of focus.' As the reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement wrote, Falstaff 'is no hero, as the romantics have tried to make him out, nor is he merely a typical and traditional stage-butt. But he is Falstaff riding for a fall; and when he takes his toss he is up again in still unconquerable effrontery and humour ... The Prince as we watch him through Dr Dover Wilson's eyes growing in grace, first in chivalry and then in justice, we do more than observe the making of a hero-king. We get to know a very lovable, faulty, generous, noble-minded young man; and a character in the play whose scenes are so far from being mere padding between Falstaff's that the whole is seen as a masterpiece of construction.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yixQlAvkurEC&dq=The+fortunes+of+Falstaff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","description":"In the 1950s, science was rapidly advancing, and so were scientific opportunities for women. Modern science fiction films reflected these simultaneous social developments. This book proposes that the social ideology of the 1950s, which was partly concerned with gender issues, saturated the B science fiction films of that era and inspired a new appreciation for the role of women in scientific advancements and other social achievements. Drawing on feminist literary and cultural theory, the author argues that the emergence of the modern American science fiction film in 1950 and the situation of postWorld War II female scientists together created a film genre. That genre was explicitly amenable to exploring the tension between a woman's place in her home and her place in the work force, particularly in scientific fields. Early chapters provide a general introduction to the science fiction genre and specifically describe 1950s B science fiction films as they resonate with concerns proper to feminist theory. Subsequent chapters offer detailed, historically situated readings of 10 B science fiction films from the 1950s that feature women in science. The cinematic representations of female scientists are compared and contrasted with real female professionals of the time, illuminating the changing gender dynamics reflected in popular film in the 1950s. Films analyzed include Rocketship X-M, It Came from Beneath the Sea, Them!, Tarantula, The Deadly Mantis, Beginning of the End, Kronos, Cat-Women of the Moon, World Without End, and Queen of Outer Space.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wL_ABgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disney y Dali, dos hombres y un Destino.(Salvador Dali y Walt Disney)(su colaboracion en, realizacion del cortometraje Destino): An article from: Epoca","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=El6PAAAACAAJ&dq=Disney+y+Dali,+dos+hombres+y+un+Destino.(Salvador+Dali+y+Walt+Disney)(su+colaboracion+en,+realizacion+del+cortometraje+Destino):+An+article+from:+Epoca&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harper Atlas of the Bible","description":"Comprising more than four hundred illustrations and 134 maps, this volume conveys the sense of landscape, events, everyday life, people, and historical eras portrayed in both the Old and New Testaments","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f-ARAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Harper+Atlas+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Job Seeker Secrets: Making the Internet Work for You","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sC1wzgEACAAJ&dq=Job+Seeker+Secrets:+Making+the+Internet+Work+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","description":"Stephen Digges is the kind of angry adolescent a lot of parents would have given up on.

In Forever Free, Eric Foner overturns numerous assumptions growing out of the traditional understanding of the period, which is based almost exclusively on white sources and shaped by (often unconscious) racism. He presents the period as a time of determination, especially on the part of recently emancipated black Americans, to put into effect the principles of equal rights and citizenship for all. Drawing on a wide range of long-neglected documents, he places a new emphasis on the centrality of the black experience to an understanding of the era. We see African Americans as active agents in overthrowing slavery, in helping win the Civil War, andeven more activelyin shaping Reconstruction and creating a legacy long obscured and misunderstood. Foner makes clear how, by war s end, freed slaves in the South built on networks of church and family in order to exercise their right of suffrage as well as gain access to education, land, and employment. He shows us that the birth of the Ku Klux Klan and renewed acts of racial violence were retaliation for the progress made by blacks soon after the war. He refutes lingering misconceptions about Reconstruction, including the attribution of its ills to corrupt African American politicians and  carpetbaggers,  and connects it to the movements for civil rights and racial justice.

Dr Johnston begins with the use of the word 'spirit' in the Gospel of John and treats it as primarily 'impersonal'. It denotes divine power or energy. God acts by his spirit, both to create and to redeem. The Fourth Evangelist shows Jesus as the incarnate Word, a man uniquely inspired, whose absence after death is compensated for by an outburst of spiritual powers in his Church. The paraclete is representative of God or of Christ, and the Johannine teaching is that no angelmediator, no holy 'spirit' like the Archangel Michael, can take Christ's place. But truly inspired leaders - acting as teachers, exegetes, martyrs - and the inspired Church itself as a communion of love do embody the spirit-paraclete and do continue to represent Jesus. Special attention is paid to recent research on this subject, mainly in the area of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Dr Johnston argues that in insisting that the true spirit-paraclete must always exalt and interpret Jesus of Nazareth as the final revelation of God in man, John was in fact combating heretical views.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4QZvJ3FLlV0C&dq=Paraclete:+The+Spirit+of+Truth+in+the+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Astronomical Companion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Oo8pAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Astronomical+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network+ Exam Cram Audio Review","description":"Provides all of the curriculum objectives of the Implementing and Administering a Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure exam (70-216), and serves as a perfect complement to the MCSE Windows 2000 Network Exam Prep.

Discovering she had a talent for penning historical romance novels, Nancy found fame as a bestselling author. But Nancy's life was far from the happily-ever-after romances she wrote about... Nancy's friends alleged that behind the doors of the couple's home in one of Washington, D.C.'s most exclusive neighborhoods she suffered repeated abuse at the hands of her husband. They also said that Nancy had told them Jeremy was resentful of her success and growing independence, and his beatings soon escalated into death threats. Torn between being forced to give up her kids and risking her life by remaining with jeremy, Nancy moved into a one-bedroom basement apartment with a young male friend. After several pleas to visit the children, Nancy was finally allowed to take them on an outing. And just when she dared to hope that the worst was over, Jeremy shot her twice in the back of the head, killing her in front of their two youngest children. He then drove to the Vietnam War Memorial, where he killed himself with a shotgun. Fatal Romance is the shocking true story of the romance novelist who dreamed of the happiness she wrote of--only to die at the hands of the man she loved.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HKCwVUb8posC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Stand Together: The Letters of C.S.

Mona Rosendahl draws on eighteen months of fieldwork, in a municipality she calls by the fictional name Palmera, to present a vivid account of the lives and thoughts of residents, many of whom have lived inside the revolution for more than thirty-five years. In Palmera, support for the socialist program remains strong. Rosendahl attributes continuing loyalty to four conditions: improvements in the standard of living from 1959 to 1990, the uniformity and omnipresence of political communications from the government, a historical emphasis on local participation in the revolution, and the consistency of revolutionary ideals with traditional machista expectations and practices. Through an analysis of ideology and practice in contemporary Cuba, Rosendahl documents how its citizens support the present political system, and how reciprocal economics between households and ideas about gender both reinforce and challenge that system. Rosendahl also explains how those who oppose state socialism resist participation in society through inaction or withdrawal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0VdukP4n6ncC&dq=Inside+the+Revolution:+Everyday+Life+in+Socialist+Cuba+(The+Anthropology+of+Contemporary+Issues)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entering Fire","description":"This startling and brilliantly comic novel tells the stories of two men: a father and his estranged son.

Soldiers, movie stars, and politicians gathered at her home to socialize, to show their dedication to the Allied cause, and to express their affection for Dr. Margaret Chung (1889-1959). The first known American-born Chinese female physician, Chung established one of the first Western medical clinics in San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1920s. She also became a prominent celebrity and behind-the-scenes political broker during World War II. Chung gained national fame when she began \\"adopting\\" thousands of soldiers, sailors, and flyboys, including Ronald Reagan, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. A pioneer in both professional and political realms, Chung experimented in her personal life as well. She adopted masculine dress and had romantic relationships with other women, such as writer Elsa Gidlow and entertainer Sophie Tucker. This is the first biography to explore Margaret Chung's remarkable and complex life. It brings alive the bohemian and queer social milieus of Hollywood and San Francisco as well as the wartime celebrity community Chung cultivated. Her life affords a rare glimpse into the possibilities of traversing racial, gender, and sexual boundaries of American society from the late Victorian era through the early Cold War period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nxfB8E7BTOQC&dq=Doctor+Mom+Chung+of+the+Fair-Haired+Bastards:+The+Life+of+a+Wartime+Celebrity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I-Net+ Exam Notes (Exam Notes)","description":"Approach the new MCSE 2000 exam with added confidence by reviewing with MCSE Exam Notes: Windows 2000 Network Design.

Fluent in twenty-nine languages, he found it easy to pass himself off as a native, thereby gaining unique insight into societies otherwise closed to Western scrutiny. He followed service as an intelligence officer in India by a daring penetration of the sacred Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina disguised as a pilgrim. He was the first European to enter the forbidden African city of Harar, and discovered Lake Tanganyika in his search for the source of the Nile. His fascination with, and research into, the intimate customs of ethnic races (which would eventually culminate in his brilliant Kama Sutra) earned him a racy reputation in that age of sexual repression. Little surprise, then, that Isabel Arundell's aristocratic mother objected to her daughter's marriage to this most notorious of figures. Isabel, however, was a spirited, independent-minded woman and was also deeply, passionately in love with Richard. Against all expectations but their own, the Burtons enjoyed a remarkably successful marriage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xe_mKejCFuIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Functional Assessment: Strategies to Prevent and Remediate Challenging Behavior in School Settings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_1nljwEACAAJ&dq=Functional+Assessment:+Strategies+to+Prevent+and+Remediate+Challenging+Behavior+in+School+Settings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travel Sickness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2jkWMwEACAAJ&dq=Travel+Sickness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hair","description":"Reviews the chemical and physical properties, care and treatment of hair, including product development.

(Studien zur interkulturellen Philosophie 11) (Studies in Intercultural Philosophy)","description":"As academic subject African philosophy is predominantly concerned with epistemology. It aims at re-presenting a lost body of authentic African thought. This apparently austere a-historical concern is framed by a grand narrative of liberation that cannot but politicise the quest for epistemological autonomy. By  politicise  I mean that the desire to re-cover an authentic African epistemology in order to establish African philosophy as autonomous subject, ironically re-iterates Western, enlightenment notions of the autonomous subject. Here, in the pursuit of an autonomous subject the terms of historical oppression are necessarily duplicated in the terms of liberation. In this study I use the term disfigurement to refer to the double-bind - peculiar to post-coloniality - in which the African subject finds itself when it has to establish and affirm a sense of apartheid (in order to confirm the assumption of difference) by inventing its own autonomy in a way that ironically conflicts with an African conception of the autonomous subject. The transcendental concern with epistemological authenticity and autonomy - indicative of an oppressive desire for Western style autonomy - necessary as it may be in a post-colonial context, is placed in an ethical framework that seeks to remain faithful to the African dictum of identity and autonomy  I am because we are . Whereas the first three chapters are concerned with the transcendental question  what is African philosophy? , the fourth and last chapter situates the ethical framework within which this question arises in the context of the recently  completed  South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_0B0EAAAQBAJ&dq=African+Philosophy+And+The+Quest+For+Autonomy:+A+Philosophical+Investigation.+(Studien+zur+interkulturellen+Philosophie+11)+(Studies+in+Intercultural+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: Wwii Pacific Theater","description":"Poradnik do Combat Flight Simulator 2: Pacific Theater, zajmuje si? om wieniem przyrz?d w, zasadami lotu, opisem dost?pnych samolot w, podstawowymi manewrami, walk? ko?ow? i energetyczn?, misjami treningowymi oraz przyk?adow? misj? w kampanii.

In forty years, Earth's population will reach ten billion. Can our world support that? What kind of world will it be? Those answering these questions generally fall into two deeply divided groups--Wizards and Prophets, as Charles Mann calls them in this balanced, authoritative, nonpolemical new book. The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. Cut back! was his mantra. Otherwise everyone will lose! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. Innovate! was Borlaug's cry. Only in that way can everyone win! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future. With our civilization on the line, the author's insightful analysis is an essential addition to the urgent conversation about how our children will fare on an increasingly crowded Earth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-cCtDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Womankind: Faces of Change Around the World","description":"A stunning portrayal of courage in both photos and text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6B76LgEACAAJ&dq=Womankind:+Faces+of+Change+Around+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A framing guide and steel square;: A practical treatise giving shortest methods on roof framing and how to use the steel square.
