While the game was being appropriated in the process of constructing a new identity for the nation-state of Canada, it was also being used by Indigenous peoples to resist residential school experiences, initiate pan-Indigenous political mobilization, and articulate Indigenous sovereignty.

It is also a pitch-perfect piece of writing. . . . As with Shirley Jackson s work or Sarah Waters s masterpiece Affinity, in Stonex s hands the unspoken, unexamined, unseen world we can call the supernatural, a world fed by repression and lies, becomes terrifyingly tangible.  --The Guardian (London) Inspired by a haunting true story, a gorgeous and atmospheric novel about the mysterious disappearance of three lighthouse keepers from a remote tower miles from the Cornish coast--and about the wives who were left behind. What strange fate befell these doomed men? The heavy sea whispers their names. Black rocks roll beneath the surface, drowning ghosts. And out of the swell like a finger of light, the salt-scratched tower stands lonely and magnificent. It's New Year's Eve, 1972, when a boat pulls up to the Maiden Rock lighthouse with relief for the keepers. But no one greets them. When the entrance door, locked from the inside, is battered down, rescuers find an empty tower. A table is laid for a meal not eaten. The Principal Keeper's weather log describes a storm raging round the tower, but the skies have been clear. And the clocks have all stopped at 8:45. Two decades later, the keepers' wives are visited by a writer determined to find the truth about the men's disappearance. Moving between the women's stories and the men's last weeks together in the lighthouse, long-held secrets surface and truths twist into lies as we piece together what happened, why, and who to believe. In her riveting and suspenseful novel, Emma Stonex writes a story of isolation and obsession, of reality and illusion, and of what it takes to keep the light burning when all else is swallowed by dark.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FE32DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Postamble","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H5uTAAAACAAJ&dq=Postamble&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus Wants All of Me: Based on the Classic Devotional by Oswald Chambers: My Utmost for His Highest","description":"Grown-ups love Oswald Chambers s classic daily devotional, My Utmost for His Highest.

Later chapters defend a traditional realist view of universals and examine the objections to realism from various infinite regresses, the difficulties in stating identity conditions for properties, and problems with realist accounts of knowledge of abstract objects. The debate between Platonists and Aristotelians is examined in the context of the relationship between properties and an adequate theory of existence. The book's final chapter explores the problem of individuating particulars. Universals makes a difficult topic accessible while maintaining the sophistication of argument required by a more advanced readership, providing an authoritative treatment of the subject for both students and scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHnX2sTJZPsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classroom strategies for teaching about the Holocaust: 10 lessons for classroom use","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=METlpwAACAAJ&dq=Classroom+strategies+for+teaching+about+the+Holocaust:+10+lessons+for+classroom+use&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fool for Love","description":"THE STORY: The scene is a stark motel room at the edge of the Mojave Desert.

In addition, the philosophical interests of neo-Scholastic thinkers have curtailed attention to the role of the figure of Christ in the thought of Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and other Dominican thinkers. To redress this imbalance, editors Kent Emery, Jr. and Joseph P. Wawrykow present this collection of essays to address the long-neglected depictions of Christ in the writings and art of the medieval Dominicans. Christ among the Medieval Dominicans adopts a genuinely multidisciplinary approach to its topic, bringing together the research of experts in a wide variety of fields. The essays in this volume, written by an acclaimed group of international scholars and presented at the University of Notre Dame Conference in Medieval Studies, provide many perspectives (theology, philosophy, spirituality, institutional and social history, art history, Latin and vernacular literature, and manuscript studies) on the life and thought of the Order of Preachers. The essays focus on the role of Christ within the devotion and imagination of the Order and in effect expose the \\"state of the question\\" in studies of this important medieval institution. As a whole, the volume tests commonplace but often unexamined presuppositions of medieval historiography, especially in the history of spirituality and literary criticism. The essays are accompanied by ample visual evidence from paintings, manuscript illustrations and texts, woodcuts, and engravings, complete with generous indices of manuscripts and names.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5EgmAQAAMAAJ&dq=Christ+Among+Medieval+Dominicans:+Representations+of+Christ+in+the+Texts+and+Images+of+the+Order+of+Preachers+(Notre+Dame+Conferences+in+Medieval+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Answer Deck (Mega Mini Kits)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aryan, the Last Prussian","description":"This is the story of a Prussian family, and their values.

Sadly, it also is a subject that is fraught with erroneous theories and concepts. Most students today are taught that organic evolution is not a theory, but a \\"fact\\" that all \\"reputable scientists\\" accept. Disclaimers from the evolutionary community notwithstanding, such a claim is, quite simply, wrong. We believe it is time for someone to offer what renowned news commentator Paul Harvey would call \\"the rest of the story.\\" That is what The Truth About Human Origins does. It tells the rest of the story as it discusses the scientific facts about mankind's beginning. For example, it investigates the \\"record of the rocks\\" as that record relates to human evolution. It demonstrates how evolutionary theory is unable to explain things like the origin of gender and sexual reproduction, the origin of language and communication, the origin of the brain, the mind, and human consciousness, and the origin of skin colors and blood types. It also examines in an in-depth fashion the so-called \\"molecular evidence\\" of human evolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J9pON9yB8HkC&dq=The+Truth+About+Human+Origins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gates of Steel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Quest for Eternity: Manners and Morals in the Age of Chivalry.

The range of treatment options has recently expanded to include promising behavioral, psychopharmacological, and multi-modal approaches in addition to psychodynamic and family systems therapy.

Building on this foundation, Part two discusses current trends in the design both of buildings and types of food processing equipment, from heating and packaging equipment to valves, pipes and sensors. Key issues in effective hygiene management are then covered in part three, from risk analysis, good manufacturing practice and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to improving cleaning and decontamination techniques. The final part of the book reviews developments in ways of monitoring the effectiveness of hygiene operations, from testing surface cleanability to sampling techniques and hygiene auditing.

And, as David Conville, who used to stay at Parciau as a child, writes in his Afterword:  The Parciau inhabitants in The Priory were hardly disguised.  At the beginning of the book we see Saunby Priory: its  West Front, built in the thirteenth century for the service of God and the poor, towered above the house that had been raised alongside from its ruins, from its very stones. And because no light showed from any window here, the stranger, visiting Saunby at this hour, would have concluded that the house was empty. But he would have been wrong. There were many people within.  The sentence is typical of the opening of a Dorothy Whipple novel. Gently, deceptively gently, but straightforwardly, it sets the scene and draws the reader in. We are shown the two Marwood girls, who are nearly grown-up, their father, the widower Major Marwood, and their aunt. Then, as soon as their lives have been evoked, we see the Major proposing marriage to a woman much younger than himself; and we understand how much will have to change. It is a classic plot (albeit the stepmother is more disinterested than wicked) and the book has many classic qualities; yet there are no clich s either in situation or outlook, just an extraordinarily well-written and absorbing novel by the writer who has been called the twentieth-century Mrs Gaskell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F-icPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Priory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Third Crusade 1191: Richard the Lionheart, Saladin and the battle for Jerusalem (Campaign)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seashore Life (Golden Field Guide Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"NIGHT FIGHTER.

We all know the moon. We all have a relationship with it. The earliest people obeyed her orbit, timed their months and holidays and celebrations and agriculture to the moon; the echoes of that system are still visible today, though the connection to the moon is often forgotten. Sarah Faith Gottesdiener is the leader of a movement to remind us of that lineage, guiding our rhythms and our sleep, our energy and our emotions, reminding us of our humanity and our magic. In her self-published Many Moons Workbooks and Lunar Journals, as well as her sold-out classes, she has guided over 50,000 readers to a deeper relationship with the moon, and through it, with themselves. This evergreen book will be an informative and comprehensive guide to lunar living, incorporating radical, self-empowering, and magical tools and resources for the beginner and experienced lunar-follower alike. Depending on where we are in our lives, depending on what we are feeling or what is happening around us, the moon allows us a space to invite ritual into our daily lives. The Moon Book will provide a framework on how to utilize the entire lunar cycle holistically, while offering ways for the reader to develop a personal relationship with their own cycles energetic, personal, and emotional through the lens of the moon s phases.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=byvQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Longman Preparation Series For The Toeic Test: Advanced Course","description":"Longman preparation series for the new TOEIC test: listening and reading, intermediate course, give students the skills, strategies, practice, and confidence they need to increase their scores on the Listening and Reading sections of the TOEIC test.

In words that are as wise as they are comforting and as universal as they are specific, Rabbi Naomi Levy tells us how to survive, emotionally and spiritually, when we feel overwhelmed by grief, loss, or life itself. Her book provides a safe harbor where we can begin to reconstitute our lives. Where do we find the strength to rebuild our lives after difficult times? Is it possible to recapture our hope? Our innocence? Our faith? The answers, never simple but always inspiring, are indeed found in this wonderful book. Naomi Levy was a bright, cheerful fifteen-year-old girl who awoke to the devastating news that her father had been shot. His senseless murder shattered her belief in God and left her feeling helpless and full of rage. But, in time, she learned to fight her way through the darkness to conquer her heartbreaking pain. She describes, with humor and extraordinary honesty, how she managed to emerge victorious over sorrow. Later, in her years as the rabbi of a congregation in Venice, California, Levy quickly learned that her own painful experiences were not unique. Many of her congregants had also suffered--divorce, addiction, rape, loss, illness. They too had searched long and hard for ways to bring joy back into their lives. A natural and engaging storyteller, Levy weaves together her own story and the struggles of her congregants with the ancient lessons of great sages. She offers up exquisitely simple prayers, which--no matter what our religious beliefs--remind us that we are far, far stronger than we ever imagined. What emerges is a remarkable tapestry that teaches us how to mend our hearts and souls. To Begin Again is a book that will be passed to friends when tragedy strikes, a book that will rest at our bedside tables during troubling times. It is a testament to the human spirit--to the undying strength that enables us to make our way through whatever darkness we may face and begin living once again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y5uWMd7moNMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How I Lost 5 Pounds in 6 Years: An Autobiography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Muslim Kingship: Power and the Sacred Muslim, Christian and Pagan Polities","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The moon maid: A tale of Barsoom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Among the Dolls","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Driving Blind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Step Between (Carole Ann Gibson Mysteries)","description":"No matter how hard she tries to live the quiet life, trouble has a way of grabbing Carole Ann Gibson by the throat -- and this time all her famous intuition and raw courage might not be enough to save her. In the heartbreaking aftermath of her husband's death, Carole Ann, widely known as \\"the best damn trial lawyer in D.C.,\\" left her criminal-law practice for what she hoped was a safer, saner life as a partner in her friend Jake's security firm. But when the richest man in Washington, D.C., hires her to find his daughter, she is caught up in a tangle of family relationships in which the stakes are not only money but life itself. Add to that a routine surveillance job that turns up three corpses and the kidnapping of her partner's beloved wife, Grace, and Carole Anne is -- once again -- in over her head in the kind of trouble that launches an all-out attack on her survival skills. Showcasing her rare talent for mixing the subtlety and complexity of personal relationships with the excitement and suspense of a rapid-fire plot, Penny Mickelbury's third Carole Ann Gibson novel brings something altogether unique and refreshing to the mystery genre.

Mattes critically evaluates the role of justification in the theologies of five leading Protestant thinkers -- Eberhard Jungel, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jurgen Moltmann, Robert W. Jenson, and Oswald Bayer -- pointing out their respective strengths and weaknesses and showing how each matches up with Luther's own views. Offering both an excellent review of recent trends in Christian theology and a powerful analysis of these trends, Mattes points readers to the various ways in which the doctrine of justification has been applied today. Despite the greatness of their thought, Jungel, Pannenberg, and Moltmann each accommodate the doctrine of justification to goals aligned with secular modernity. Both Jenson and Bayer, on the other hand, construe the doctrine of justification in a nonaccommodating way, thus challenging the secularity of the modern academy. In the end, Mattes argues that Bayer's position is to be preferred as closest to Luther's own, and he shows why it offers the greatest potential for confronting current attempts at self-justification before God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LVFhDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Role+Of+Jusitifcation+In+Contemporary+Theology+(Lutheran+Quarterly+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Last Movie Star: A Novel of Hollywood","description":"The sudden disappearance of Hollywood movie star Allegra Coleman following an accident spawns a cultlike fascination and obsession with her life, as Clementine, Allegra's last-known contact, suddenly finds herself in the spotlight, a new minted celebrity thanks to her association with the missing star.

Based on a unique interpretation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, The Psychedelic Experience remains a vital testament to broadening spiritual consciousness through a combination of Tibetan meditation techniques and psychotropic substances.

Charting ten years of critical development, these challenging, witty essays shed new light on Renaissance studies. It also raises intriguing questions about how the culture and history of the past illuminates the key social and political issues of today. Lisa Jardine re-reads Renaissance drama in its historical and cultural context, from laws of defamation in Othello to the competing loyalties of companionate marriage and male friendship in The Changeling. In doing so she reveals a wealth of new insights, sometimes surprising but always original and engrossing. At the same time, these essays also provide a fascinating account of the rise of feminist scholarship since the 1980s and the diversifying of \`new historicist' approaches over the same period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OdTytQ2I7KYC&dq=Reading+Shakespeare+Historically&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AstroAnalysis 2000: Libra (AstroAnalysis Horoscopes)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Clones Lace: The Story and Patterns of an Irish Crochet","description":"Preface to second edition -- R amhr  - foreword --The story of clones lace -- How to make clones lace -- Twenty-one motifs -- Some edgings -- Working with linen -- Irish crochet -- Twelve projects -- Footnotes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGmwoAEACAAJ&dq=Clones+Lace:+The+Story+and+Patterns+of+an+Irish+Crochet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Market Power and Business Strategy: In Search of the Unified Organization","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Data Analysis and Classification for Bioinformatics","description":"With the explosion of sequence data in public and private databases and the coming explosion of gene expression data in a similar vein, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how to apply well-established data analysis and data classification methods that have been developed in other fields to this field---to try to make sense of the data, to glean biological insights from it, to categorize the data, and to put all of these to good use in industrial applications.

The Cotton Kingdom recounts his daily observations of the curse of slavery: the poverty it brought to both black and white people; the inadequacies of the plantation system; and the economic consequences and problems associated with America's most \\"peculiar institution\\". Disproving the opinion that \\"Cotton is king\\", Olmsted examined the huge differences between the economies of the northern and southern states, contrasting the more successful, wealthy and progressive north with the stubborn south, convinced of the necessity of slavery. Hailed as one of the most convincing and influential anti-slavery arguments, Olmsted's work was widely praised with London's Westminster Review declaring, \\"it is impossible to resist his accumulated evidence.\\" Frederick Law Olmsted was an American landscape architect, journalist, social critic, and public administrator. He is popularly considered to be the father of American landscape architecture. Through his work as a journalist for the New York Daily Times (New York Times), he became interested in the adverse economic effects of slavery and The Cotton Kingdom is a result of this.

Lenny McLean was one of the deadliest bareknuckle fighters Britain has ever seen. He had dear, powerful friends, but he also had terrible enemies. So much so that he had two bullet wounds in his back  each from a different attack. He was also stabbed repeatedly  always from behind. But Lenny was also a warm, big-hearted grizzly bear of a man, whose main weakness was an overwhelming desire to put the welfare of his mates ahead of his own well-being. In his extraordinary autobiography, he tells of how the mafia flew him to New York to take on their greatest bareknuckle boxer in a multi-million pound illicit bout. The Mafia s man lasted less than three minutes. When the IRA fronted up a London gang in a money-laundering scam, Lenny was brought in to intimidate the terrorists. The IRA, not surprisingly, backed off. . . His most serious trial came when he was accused of murder. Fighting to prove his innocence against a minimum sentence of twenty-five years, Lenny never gave up  and went on to be found not guilty. This is a tale of one man s triumph against almost insurmountable odds, in a battle that Len fought every day for himself, and to  put steam on the table  for his wife and kids.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CyGtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Songs of Cifar and the Sweet Sea: Selections from the \\"Songs of Cifar,\\" 1967-1977","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Catholic Vision","description":"How effective are you at making a positive impact on the people around you?

After his narrow escape from Scotland Yard, the killer would travel to the New York City area where four high-profile murders took place soon after his arrival. With Victorian era New York as his backdrop, Gordon recounts the gruesome scenes. He also details Klosowski's subsequent return to England where he would eventually be convicted and executed for another murder spree--with poison as his weapon of choice. Readers will learn about these unknown Ripper victims: Carrie Brown, an aging prostitute who was brutally slashed and mutilated; Hannah Robinson, a servant girl who was strangled to death; 73-year-old Elizabeth Senior, who struggled bravely against an intruder who stabbed her multiple times in her New Jersey home; and Herta Mary Anderson, a teenaged New Jersey hotel maid, found dead from a bullet wound and cut throat.

Carole agrees to accompany her hunky cousin to Miragenia to christen his baby niece. But it is really hard to even explain the situation to anyone; how the little Princess was stolen from her mother's side by Miragenians who demanded fifteen years of the first-born's life in exchange for a bit of help during wartime. Or how the baby was taken before magical christening gifts could be bestowed upon her for her protection and character development. The ladies surrounding Rupert (also known as Rowan the Romantic and Rowan the Rake) don't care about some baby and don't hear anything about the mission because they're too busy sighing over him. Crowd control is an obvious problem, as is extricating Rupert from more than one involuntary engagement. When at last the two, with the help of dubious questing companions including a love-stricken pink and purple dragon, arrive at the theocracy of Gorequartz where the baby had been fostered out to a queen, they find themselves in trouble of a completely different complexion. Their most deadly nemesis is none other than a giant crystal \\"god\\" seemingly created in Rupert's own image!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FI7Xv0tVwJwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Discipline of Teams: A Mindbook-Workbook for Delivering Small Group Performance","description":"An essential guide for any small group that must deliver team performance. With the demand for project-oriented work and faster, more nimble responses, successful small-group performance is more crucial than ever. Katzenbach and Smith, authors of the international bestseller The Wisdom of Teams, have again joined forces, revealing how to implement the disciplines, frameworks, tools, and techniques required for team- and small-group performance. Combining their insights and practical strategies, they offer concepts and pragmatic, doable exercises for team leaders and team members to deliver results. Hot topics covered include: why small-group performance demands expertise at two disciplines, team level and leader level, instead of one; virtual teams; and global teams. This book combines practical exercises with cutting-edge insights, and both authors are authorities on the subject.

His new book is a witty, provocative political mystery about power play and favor swapping at the highest levels of government, written with his own unique blend of political savvy and irreverent humor. Joshua Bennett has just been nominated by the president to be the new director of the CIA. He's the ideal candidate, and everyone agrees his confirmation hearing should be a mere formality. But this is Washington, where nothing as straightforward as choosing the most qualified person for a crucial job can be counted upon. Unfortunately for Bennett, someone's political agenda hinges on his confirmation being vetoed, but he's damned if he can find out whose. In need of good covert help he can trust, Bennett turns to a little known but highly efficient cadre of former CIA spies living in semiretirement in nearby West Virginia. This odd team of sixty-plus-year-old spooks, boasting a combined array of exceptional if eccentric and largely illegal talents, embarks upon a wildly unorthodox Washington power struggle that is no less earnest for being conducted in absolute secrecy. And most secret of all is the highly coveted purple dot--the ultimate national perk. Following the enormous breakout success of Lehrer's bestselling previous novel, White Widow, Purple Dots will fascinate and amuse even more readers, while confirming their worst fears about how our government really operates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ScIkxihxFMoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Said Cheese","description":"When a bombing wrecks a hotel, kills a housekeeper, and threatens to destroy the Great Food Expo, Qwilleran and his feline sleuths, Koko and Yum Yum, embark on a culinary quest to find a killer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z5vPIEM-wFEC&dq=The+Cat+Who+Said+Cheese&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THOUGHTS AND MEDITATIONS","description":"This collection of thoughts by Kahlil Gibran, author of \\"The Prophet,\\" \\"The Broken Wings,\\" \\"The Voice of the Master,\\" and other twentieth-century classics, demonstrates three major aspects of his genius.

And above all, here is the author of the remarkable poetic narratives in which Gibran's mystical, spiritual vision of the transmigration of souls is embodied in tales of lovers tragically parted in one existence and rapturously reunited, after centuries of separation, in a later incarnation.

She draws on the composite struggles of real people to show how the dilemma is rooted in unexamined assumptions about normalcy, fear of change and loss of control, and the not always audible voices of our own mothers. Dr. Tobin challenges mental health professionals to recognize that coming to terms with the motherhood question is an act of maturation proper to every woman, an opportunity for self-creation. She herself recognizes that, for women who find themselves infertile or uncoupled or unconventionally situated, the question is compounded and painfully revisited as reproductive technology fails, adoption is considered, time passes. Whichever option a woman ultimately selects, she loses something, Dr. Tobin acknowledges - yet she gains by weighing the fear of now against the fear of never and being the agent instead of the victim of her regrets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7mEinSwAR4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Season of Youth: The American Revolution & the Historical Imaginative","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chemical kinetics","description":"Chemical Kinetics bridges the gap between beginner and specialist with a path that leads the reader from the phenomenological approach to the rates of chemical reactions to the state-of-the-art calculation of the rate constants of the most prevalent reactions: atom transfers, catalysis, proton transfers, substitution reactions, energy transfers and electron transfers.

Technology and technological advances are always interesting. The intention of this book is not just to showcase new technologies and their specific values, but rather to examine the special values that emerge when some key technologies are intermixed, and primarily intermixed with many different (usuallyreal-time) sources of data. Data is all around us and it is growing at a furious pace from cellular-controlled ovens to video-controlled manufacturing to embedded chips in our bodies and we cannot help but wonder whether the new pervasive wireless technologies will allow for unforeseen power to come from all this gathered data. The Inescapable Data environment specifically looks for new streams of data to be combined and analyzed against other streams or historical data in an effort to drive higher personal or business value. For example, although it might be interesting to have your child's school record available electronically, it is perhaps more interesting to be able to correlate various achievements and progress against a wide population and even further interesting to correlate that data against a detailed analysis of his or her medical history. In a more business-oriented example, technology might enable us to track inventory levels better and in real time. However, inventory-level information might be the wrong question to ask? New levels of efficiency appear in the Inescapable Data world because business systems are tied so closely together, across company boundaries, that inventory level no longer becomes the question and is replaced by \\"are any manufacturing dependencies suggesting date-skew anywhere in our outside supply chain for product X?\\" In the Inescapable Data world, we allow our business systems to join together throughout a product's value chain and even perhaps to competitors for the sake of efficiency and flexibility. Similarly, our personal lives demand continuous connectivity to all the activities that comprise our days. Whether it is communication with customers in different time zones or e-sending to the team a better map to the soccer field, we discover time efficiencies that in turn give us more flexibility. The tools of our business lives have become the exact same tools used in our personal lives, allowing for a convenient blending of activities. Most of this, we believe, is for the good. Some of it brings new worries and exposures. But as notable Harvard sociologist Nicholas Christakis says, \\"There is a way in which technology is inexorable, so I doubt there is a way to stop any of this.\\" Intended Audience This book is designed to inform the modern business manager (as well as the techno-curious) about important developments and usage of data-everywhere devices and networks. Our mission is to help a wide range of decision makers learn to spot the emergence of Inescapable Data and capitalize on it appropriately. A wider audience for this book includes individuals from engineering through marketing in high-technology companies who want to be informed of trends outside of their more narrow industry segments. That said, the book is broad enough in scope and written with only a modest assumption of technical understanding so that most adults can understand, appreciate, and possibly value the information. The Interviews as a Foundation Although we consider ourselves knowledgeable regarding computing, networking, and data storage, we wanted to get out on the street and talk firsthand with key people from many different disciplines. We reached out to nearly 50 different executives and experts for one-on-one interviews (the vast majority conducted in person). We wanted to learn what these people are seeing, and then showcase their knowledge in a broader light, supplemented by heavy direct research. The inside front cover of this book identifies the various people whom we interviewed at length to gain a richer understanding of the technology and trends occurring in a variety of industries, thus supplementing our general research. Their thoughts and views assisted in formulating the notions presented throughout this book. ? Copyright Pearson Education.

He was a zealous missionary and writer of pamphlets and articles. For over forty years he brought a special message to Native Americans in Oklahoma and various reservations in New York, Arizona, North Carolina and Ontario. He made many friends among the Native Americans and was a close friend of the late Chief Clinton Rickard of the Tuscarora Nation.In this book, Timothy confidently delivers his message that a Native American Indian will rise up among his own people in the near future to deliver them from spiritual bondage and social oppression. As Moses delivered his people thousands of years ago, so will this Native American. Timothy combines Biblical and Ancient American history to draw astonishing spiritual and cultural parallels between the ancient Israelites and the present-day Native American Indians including their common ancestry and destiny.From the PrefaceIn 1975 a small but mighty book was published. There were only several hundred copies printed at that time. Those close to the author of the book held on tightly to their copies since it was out of print before it could gain the audience it deserved. The book I am referring too is \\"American Indian Moses.\\" We will backtrack for a moment to the late 1950's, would-be-author Timothy Dom Bucci is speaking to me of the great promises in God's plan for the Native Peoples of the America's. I distinctly remember him talking at great length concerning the divine origin of the Translated Ancient American Writings commonly known as the Book of Mormon. As I grew older his encouraging words and the example he set in his life as a disciple of Jesus Christ left a great impression on me. The culmination of his life dedicated to such a beautiful cause was brought forth in the initial printing of this book. But Timothy D. Bucci's calling as a messenger, to spread the news of the brilliant future of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, was brought to paper and ink in the form of \\"American Indian Moses.\\" Almost thirty years after the first printing a newly updated version is now available to all lovers of truth who desire to understand one of God's great unalterable truths. Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a greater need for a concise composition concerning the future events, which we will be swept up into. Never has there been a greater need for the light of Truth to dispel the spiritual heavy darkness that surrounds both the Native American and the citizens of this nation. I have waited with great enthusiasm for the opportunity to share the information in this book with those who I believe will not only find merit in it, but comfort and hope as it looks to the great events of the near future for both American Indians and Israel. And if not at first then maybe through the workings of the Great Spirit its truth will be confirmed.Read this book thoughtfully and prayerfully because its topic is timely and relevant to each and every one of us and most importantly to the Native Peoples of North, Central and South America.

Although named after the Egyptian goddess Isis - a figure widely associated with magic and nature - this book's scope ranges far beyond ancient Egypt. The author examines the ancient spiritual pantheons of the East, with chapters upon Buddhism and Hinduism. These ancient beliefs are strongly believed to hold much value by the author, who discusses the essential truths about the nature of reality, consciousness and the place of humanity on the Earth. At over 540,000 words, this lengthy and eclectic treatise is considered to be one of the greatest ever produced in the field of esotericism. Alluding to wisdom from cultures all around the world, Isis Unveiled is a deeply detailed book invigorated by the passion of its author to prove that truths were known by the ancients that humans remains ignorant of to the present day. The truths which Blavatsky seeks to demonstrate span a wide domain; provinces of the spiritual, scientific, occult, religious and theological are delved into for answers. With this book, Helena Blavatsky introduced what she termed the 'Wisdom-Religion' to the world; a creed in which ancient documents and knowledge are valued as the purest source of spiritual knowledge. Her own researches in the subject are vast and yielded results that are staggering for their breadth. Replete topics covered in this work include life after death, magical and psychic phenomena, sorcery, black magic, the origin of the Christian faith, and eastern figures such as Gautama Buddha. The work however has not been without its detractors; many have accused Isis Unveiled of plagiarism, noting the similarity of large tracts with writings of other occultists. The sheer length and eclecticism of the book, and subsequent changes in the ideas attached to certain ancient phenomena, led to confusion among interested followers of Blavatsky's writings: some contested that the original concepts had been contradicted. Helena Blavatsky was born to a wealthy family in Russia. Her education put her in contact with many ancient cultures and traditions, which fascinated her from an early age. Following the publication of this book she founded the Theosophical Society in New York, descendants and offshoots of which continue to research and seek after the essential truths underpinning existence to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oGSctAEACAAJ&dq=Isis+unveiled:+A+master-key+to+the+mysteries+of+ancient+and+modern+science+and+theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elk Dog Heritage","description":"Don Coldsmith, inducted into the Writer's Hall of Fame of America and voted one of the Greatest Western Writers of the Twentieth Century by the Western Writers of America, is one of our national treasures. He single-handedly revolutionized the Western novel with his acclaimed Spanish Bit Saga, which has more than six million copies in print. Set in the early sixteenth century, the Spanish Bit Saga re-creates a time, a place, and a people that have been nearly lost to history. In it we see history in the making through the proud eyes of those who lived it. In the recent past, the People lived in fear, constantly pursued by their ancient enemies, the Head Splitters. But that was before Spaniard Juan Garcia arrived, bringing horses-Elk-Dogs. He taught his adopted people to ride and fight, to defy death and be victorious. Slowly, at first, they learned the ways of the magnificent animals that Garcia brought them. Soon, none could stand against them, and the once cowering and timid People became lords of the American Great Plains. The Head Splitters were defeated and now the People live a life of peace and prosperity. But not all are satisfied with peace. Eager to prove their manhood, the youths of the tribe long for the days of war. Against the direct orders of their elders, the young bloods seek out the Head Splitters and, waging their own war, place the entire tribe in jeopardy.

The remainder are forgotten. The main objective of this compilation is to bring together a selection of speeches, sermons and addresses from some of Ireland s greatest statesmen and women over the last 1,000 years. They are arranged in chronological order, with an introduction giving the background to each one. Brief biographical notes are also given on each speaker at the back of the book. The orations chosen are always interesting in themselves and many of them prove enlightening views of historical events. For example, Ireland s stance, both North and South during World War Two can be readily seen by reading Eamon de Valera s, Lord Craigavon s and James Dillon s speeches at the time.

Jacques Derrida 1930-2004 As critics investigate the 'death of the author', they find Derrida's prints all over the murder weapon. No other recent philosopher has aroused so much suspicion - or been so badly misrepresented. His every idea a tug at the rug beneath us, questioning our sense of ourselves, our world and the language by which both are articulated, Derrida would make uncomfortable reading under any circumstances. Add to this an at time vertiginous abstruseness and a following whose 'deconstructive' readings appear to be doing away with writing as we know it, and the hostility is understandable. Yet as Christopher Johnson shows in this eloquent, exhilarating guide, 'deconstruction' doesn't mean 'destruction' - nor does it involve any 'con'. In what may seem mere convoluted cleverness, momentous consistencies can be found; in Derrida's apparently rarefied rhetoric can be read the most radical, relevant commentary we have on the world we inhabit today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sa44AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ugly Chinaman and the Crisis of Chinese Culture","description":"Writing under the pseudonym of Bo Yang, Guo Yidong has been a trenchant critic of Chinese people and their culture since he fled to Taiwan in 1949.

This study, based on interviews with 500 people of Irish ancestry in Albany, New York, aims to discover in what senses and in what degrees the present-day descendants of nineteenth-century Irish immigrants possess distinctive social practices and ways of seeing the world, and raises questions about the social conditions in which ideas of Irishness have been created and re-created.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ziooyzo7x7YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruth Ann and The Green Blowster","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"America's Stupidest Business Decisions: 101 Blunders, Flops, And Screwups","description":"Americas Stupidest Business Decisions is a hilarious and hugely entertaining selection of absolutely true business blunders.

Moreover, Athens, as well as other classical Greek poleis, resorted to limited measures, well short of war or other modes of economic imperialism, to attract them. However, at least in the minds of individual Athenians considerations of traders' indispensability to Athens displaced what otherwise would have been low estimations of their social status.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-gwO68JZ9jkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UBC PLUS, the Plus programming language","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dickens of the Mounted","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WSAVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Dickens+of+the+Mounted&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circumstantial Evidence/(English Title = James Tarrant Adventurer)","description":"A guide to series fiction lists popular series, identifies novels by character, and offers guidance on the order in which to read unnumbered series.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tBUlCAwAtNwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sikh religion,: Its gurus, sacred writings and authors,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J7Y-AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signs in the Sky","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Pastor's Challenge: Parish Leadership in an Age of Division, Doubt, and Spiritual Hunger","description":"Parish Leadership in an Age of Division, Doubt, and Spiritual Hunger An extensive and comprehensive examination of modern priesthood and the role of the parish priest in contemporary times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FL4YtAEACAAJ&dq=A+Pastor%27s+Challenge:+Parish+Leadership+in+an+Age+of+Division,+Doubt,+and+Spiritual+Hunger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Walls Of Jericho","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Demian,","description":"2011 Reprint of 1948 Edition.

Many reflective people are convinced that the problem, the problem of evil, is insoluble. The reasons that underlie this conviction can be formulated as a powerful argument for the non-existence of God, theso-called argument from evil: If there were a God, he would not permit the existence of vast amounts of truly horrible suffering; since such suffering exists, there is no God. Peter van Inwagen examines this argument, which he regards as a paradigmatically philosophical argument. His conclusion is that(like most philosophical arguments) it is a failure. He seeks to demonstrate, not that God exists, but the fact that the world contains a vast amount of suffering does not show that God does not exist.Along the way he discusses a wide range of topics of interest to philosophers and theologians, such as: the concept of God; what might be meant by describing a philosophical argument as a failure; the distinction between versions of the argument from evil that depend on the vast amount of evil in the world and versions of the argument that depend on a particular evil, such as the Lisbon earthquake or the death of a fawn in a forest fire; the free-will defense; animal suffering; and the problemof the hiddenness of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O2RYJPanhuIC&dq=The+Problem+of+Evil:+The+Gifford+Lectures+Delivered+in+the+University+of+St.+Andrews+in+2003&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer","description":"When Anatoli Boukreev died on the slopes of Annapurna on Christmas day, 1997, the world lost one of the greatest adventurers of our time.

Passing through the straights of Dover, the ships faced everything the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy could throw at them. In a dramatic running fight, the ships managed to sail right under the nose of history's greatest maritime nation to reach the safety of Germany. The brilliantly executed operation brought great humiliation to the British - Hitler, who had developed the plan, had judged perfectly the reaction of the British command to the Channel Dash. Repositioned, these fast, heavily armed ships went on to threaten the Allied Arctic convoys that kept Russia in the war at Stalingrad.

But if you're a biologist with little or no programming experience, starting out in Perl can be a challenge. Many biologists have a difficult time learning how to apply the language to bioinformatics. The most popular Perl programming books are often too theoretical and too focused on computer science for a non-programming biologist who needs to solve very specific problems.Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics is designed to get you quickly over the Perl language barrier by approaching programming as an important new laboratory skill, revealing Perl programs and techniques that are immediately useful in the lab. Each chapter focuses on solving a particular bioinformatics problem or class of problems, starting with the simplest and increasing in complexity as the book progresses. Each chapter includes programming exercises and teaches bioinformatics by showing and modifying programs that deal with various kinds of practical biological problems. By the end of the book you'll have a solid understanding of Perl basics, a collection of programs for such tasks as parsing BLAST and GenBank, and the skills to take on more advanced bioinformatics programming. Some of the later chapters focus in greater detail on specific bioinformatics topics. This book is suitable for use as a classroom textbook, for self-study, and as a reference.The book covers: Programming basics and working with DNA sequences and strings Debugging your code Simulating gene mutations using random number generators Regular expressions and finding motifs in data Arrays, hashes, and relational databases Regular expressions and restriction maps Using Perl to parse PDB records, annotations in GenBank, and BLAST output","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OG2xVZnf_ckC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Condominium Bluebook- 2000","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rogue's Valley (Silhouette Intimate Moments, No 240)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thank You for the Flowers: Stories of Suspense & Imagination","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mentor's Spirit: Life Lessons on Leadership and the Art of Encouragement","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ride the Pink Horse","description":"Three desperate men converge in the midst of an annual carnival in Santa Fe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a3WLzQEACAAJ&dq=Ride+the+Pink+Horse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Works of Henrik Ibsen","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yzQYAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis: Discovering God's Answers to Life's Ultimate Questions (Christianity 101 Bible Studies)","description":"The Bible starts with a bang.

Also considering how feminist and gay artists have employed sexuality in the critique and transformation of patriarchy, the high profile of sexuality as a key contributor to public health education in the era of HIV and AIDS, and the implications of the rise of striptease culture for the future of sexual poltics, Brian McNair has produced an excellent book in the study of gender, sexuality and contemporary culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JaLEKllB2bEC&dq=STRIPTEASE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Vampire's Diary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mN9ePQAACAAJ&dq=Little+Vampire%27s+Diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Coaching Book: Secrets to a Winning Life from the Professional and Personal Coaches of the United Coaching Associates","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Contemporary Asian American Experience: Beyond the Model Minority (2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Among the Cinders","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wicked Good Time","description":"As a cop, she was trained to take control of every situation.

During the past decade, SEC has experienced a considerable amount of growth in regard to column and detector technology and new applications. With these advances, SEC can now be used for determining absolute molecular weight, polymer chain conformation and size, and branching, as well as polymer solution properties. This book introduces the reader to the fundamentals of SEC with emphasis on practical aspects of the technique, such as column and mobile selection, calibration, new detector capabilities and guidelines for performing SEC on most types of polymers, especially those of industrial importance. This book is intended for either those new to the field of SEC, or for those research workers who require a more comprehensive background.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wKbvCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord of the Vampires : The Diaries of the Family Dracul","description":"After the death of his half brother, Stefan, at the hands of Vlad Tsepesh--also known as Dracula--and after the destruction of his vampire father, Arkady, also at the hands of Vlad, Abraham van Helsing has traveled the world slaying many vampires. With every vampire he destroys, Bram becomes stronger and Vlad weaker, and soon Bram hopes he will be able to finally kill the fearsome vampire who has kept the Tsepesh family enslaved through a centuries-old blood ritual. But a desperate Vlad and his vampire great-niece, Zsuzanna, summon help from the most powerful, brutal, and beautiful vampire of all--Countess Elizabeth of Bathory. Bram learns of their plot to destroy him, and makes his own move to strike out at Vlad before Vlad can put him to death. He teams up with a courageous band of humans as he hunts Vlad--including Mina Harker and John Seward--and they finally succeed in killing the head of the Tsepesh clan, just as Bram Stoker foretold in Dracula. But the terror does not end with the death of Vlad, for there is another force that drives Vlad, Zsuzanna, Elizabeth and all the vampires, an ancient entity more evil than anything Bram has ever encountered: the Lord of the Vampires. And for Bram to defeat this dark lord, he must once again risk losing his very soul, to save not only his family, but humanity as well. In her final book in The Diaries of the Family Dracul trilogy, Jeanne Kalogridis brilliantly melds her own fascinating story of the Tsepesh family with that of Bram Stoker's classic, Dracula. Told in diary form like the first two books and Stoker's own chilling tale, LORD OF THE VAMPIRES reveals the dark, startling truths behind the original Dracula.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZDWZ2cfIGsQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Irish Republican Army (Inside the World's Most Infamous Terrorist Organizations)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teaching Multilevel Classes in ESL","description":"The world of the multilevel ESL classroom, despite being an exciting, challenging and richly rewarding one for teachers, is by no means an easy environment, particularly for those entering it for the first time. However Jill Sinclair Bell's Teaching Multilevel Classes in ESL, now extensively revised and updated in a second edition to reflect the real world of today's classroom, will prove a tried and trusty friend - ready, like any good friend, with advice and support whenever needed. Inspired by and based on the author's own extensive familiarity with teaching in multilevel classrooms, this classic has been further enriched by the more theoretical understandings from her experience as a professor of education. Furthermore, not only has the author herself personally tested all the ideas and activities in the book, so have groups of teachers of widely ranging experience, from novice to veteran. Above all, Jill Bell recognizes the folly of pretending that multilevel teaching is easy, offering instead reassuring support and encouragement, sample lesson plans to illustrate how the ideas in her book can work in practice, and an easy-to-read text with masses of practical examples. In addition, and as an added bonus, the second edition reflects the latest ideas in teaching practice, discussion material updated to reflect changes in the student demographic profiles, a fully revised list of the latest resources including websites, and an additional chapter, brimming with sparkling and easily implemented ideas, focusing on ways to use technology successfully in the classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXSgSQAACAAJ&dq=Teaching+Multilevel+Classes+in+ESL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Hellenistic Coinage from the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamaea (336-188 B.C.)","description":"This book, first published in 1991, is a full study of early Hellenistic coinage.

Based on his concept of the Great Memory, a shared past from which we draw energies, ideas, and images that lead us to new creations, Anderson argues that creativity is an outpouring of the conscious psyche, not the realization of unconscious impulses. A poet, philosopher, and historian, he provides support for his thesis in a fascinating world tour of anecdotes, events, and images: characters from Aztec literature, the windows of Chartres Cathedral, the siege at Masada, the choreography of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpjjAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Face+of+Glory:+Creativity,+Consciousness+and+Civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Condominium Bluebook - 2001 Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=14jjFl57MhgC&dq=The+Condominium+Bluebook+-+2001+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Triumph of Contrarian Investing : Crowds, Manias, and Beating the Market by Going Against the Grain","description":"\\"The Triumph of Contrarian Investing provides you with analysis and indicators proven to spotlight those points at which investor optimism or pessimism is at its strongest, then show you how to go against the grain - and profit - in virtually every instance.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Its devastating effects were clearly visible during both world wars. During the Macedonian campaign in World War I, an exasperated French general could not counterattack as he desperately reported, \\"Regret that my army is in hospital with malaria.\\" Malaria also popped up in Korea, Vietnam and during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. Often malaria causes more casualties than enemy action. A 1772 Dutch force sent to quell rioting slaves in Surinam lost three-quarters of its troops to malaria, and only a handful to the rebels. Bugs in Armor takes the reader on a historical journey of military expeditions and their encounters with a relentless bug the malaria parasite. It is also a story of how this confrontation fuelled research that gave the world a better understanding of the nature of malaria, its treatment and prevention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BZjRKqJG_h0C&dq=Bugs+In+Armor:+A+Tale+of+Malaria+and+Soldiering&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus on Psychology- A Guide to Mastering Peter Gray's Psychology - Third Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Teacher Who Would Not Retire","description":"When the principal tells first grade teacher Mrs. Belle that she must retire, she and her students wonder how they will keep in touch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hrICAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Teacher+Who+Would+Not+Retire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heroes & Villains - Charles Manson","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rittenhouse Square, past and present,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Truth about Winning!","description":"150 powerful bite-size techniques for handling virtually every day-to-day management challenge, from motivation and team-building to job design Three full books of practical techniques for handling virtually every day-to-day management challenge!

Originating in Persian, Indian, and Arabic sources as far back as the ninth century AD, this collection of bawdy tales-which Burton was the first to bring to English readers in uncensored form-has exerted incalculable influence on modern literature. It represents one of the earliest examples of a framing story, as young Shahrazad, under threat of execution by the King, postpones her death by regaling him with these wildly entertaining stories over the course of 1,001 nights. The stories themselves feature early instances of sexual humor, satire and parody, murder mystery, horror, and even science fiction. Burton's annotated 16-volume collection, as infamous as it is important, was first published between 1885 and 1888, and remains an entertainingly naughty read. Volume I includes: [ Burton's introductory forward [ \\"Story of King Shahryar and His Brother\\" [ \\"Tale of the Trader and the Jinni\\" [ \\"Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban\\" [ \\"Tale of the Prince and the Ogress\\" [ \\"Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince\\" [ \\"The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad\\" [ \\"Tale of the Three Apples\\" [ \\"The Reeve's Tale\\" [ \\"Tale of the Jewish Doctor\\" [ and others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a1X23d4jBwcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rival Enlightenments: Civil and Metaphysical Philosophy in Early Modern Germany (Ideas in Context)","description":"A 2001 reinterpretation of early modern German intellectual history, treating the civil and metaphysical philosophers as rival intellectual cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6zDG8PdWUXoC&dq=Rival+Enlightenments:+Civil+and+Metaphysical+Philosophy+in+Early+Modern+Germany+(Ideas+in+Context)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revelation: Unlocking the Mysteries of the End Times (Christianity 101 Bible Studies)","description":"In this fascinating look at the apostle John's prophecy, the authors explain why believers' daily lives should be affected by the book of Revelation, and demonstrate why the end of the world is something to look forward to.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tCd_b4D3rqUC&dq=Revelation:+Unlocking+the+Mysteries+of+the+End+Times+(Christianity+101+Bible+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introducing Electronic Text Analysis: A Practical Guide for Language and Literary Studies","description":"Introducing Electronic Text Analysis is a practical and much needed introduction to corpora  bodies of linguistic data. Written specifically for students studying this topic for the first time, the book begins with a discussion of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis. It then examines how these corpora enhance our understanding of literary and non-literary works. In the first section the author introduces the concepts of concordance and lexical frequency, concepts which are then applied to a range of areas of language study. Key areas examined are the use of on-line corpora to complement traditional stylistic analysis, and the ways in which methods such as concordance and frequency counts can reveal a particular ideology within a text. Presenting an accessible and thorough understanding of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis, the book contains abundant illustrative examples and a glossary with definitions of main concepts. It will also be supported by a companion website with links to on-line corpora so that students can apply their knowledge to further study.

The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet, despite having experienced great personal and national suffering. From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake, the first being their personal stories and teachings about joy. Both the Dalai Lama and Tutu have been tested by extraordinary adversity, oppression, and conflict. The second layer consists of the exciting research into joy as well as the other qualities essential for any enduring happiness, like gratitude, humility, humour, compassion, generosity, and forgiveness. And the third encompasses practical exercises and guidance based on the Dalai Lama's and Tutu's own daily practices, which anchor their emotional and spiritual lives. Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and even wise-cracking humour, how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9CPXCwAAQBAJ&dq=So+Much+Joy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Thought and Expression: Selected Lyrics of Lou Reed","description":"Digte og interviews.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A_6tQAAACAAJ&dq=Between+Thought+and+Expression:+Selected+Lyrics+of+Lou+Reed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Naked with Harry Crews: Interviews","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Riven Rock","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Case for Easter Book & DVD Set (The Case for Easter Book & DVD Set)","description":"Did Jesus of Nazareth really rise from the dead? Of the many world religions, only one claims that its founder returned from the grave. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the very cornerstone of Christianity. But a dead man coming back to life? In our sophisticated age, when myth has given way to science, who can take such a claim seriously? Some argue that Jesus never died on the cross. Conflicting accounts make the empty tomb seem suspect. How credible is the evidence for--and against--the resurrection? Focusing his award-winning skills as a legal journalist on history's most compelling enigma, Lee Strobel retraces the startling findings that led him from atheism to belief. He examines: The Medical Evidence: Was Jesus' death a sham and his resurrection a hoax? The Evidence of the Missing Body: Was Jesus' body really absent from his tomb? The Evidence of Appearances: Was Jesus seen alive after his death on the cross? Written in a hard-hitting journalistic style, The Case for Easter probes the core issues of the resurrection. Jesus Christ, risen from the dead: superstitious myth or life-changing reality? The evidence is in.

Amnesty has been the light, and that light was truth bearing witness to suffering hidden from the eyes of the world.\\" from the Preface The first in-depth look at working life inside a major human rights organization, Keepers of the Flame charts the history of Amnesty International and the development of its nerve center, the International Secretariat, over forty-five years. Through interviews with staff members, archival research, and unprecedented access to Amnesty International's internal meetings, Stephen Hopgood provides an engrossing and enlightening account of day-to-day operations within the organization, larger decisions about the nature of its mission, and struggles over the implementation of that mission. An enduring feature of Amnesty's inner life, Hopgood finds, has been a recurrent struggle between the \\"keepers of the flame\\" who seek to preserve Amnesty's accumulated store of moral authority and reformers who hope to change, modernize, and use that moral authority in ways that its protectors fear may erode the organization's uniqueness. He also explores how this concept of moral authority affects the working lives of the servants of such an ideal and the ways in which it can undermine an institution's political authority over time. Hopgood argues that human-rights activism is a social practice best understood as a secular religion where internal conflict between sacred and profane the mission and the practicalities of everyday operations are both unavoidable and necessary. Keepers of the Flame is vital reading for anyone interested in Amnesty International, its accomplishments, agonies, obligations, fears, opportunities, and challenges or, more broadly, in how humanitarian organizations accommodate the moral passions that energize volunteers and professional staff alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1zU4FRW7RiMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fibromyalgia Survivor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RENSAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Fibromyalgia+Survivor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Has Globalization Gone Too Far?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bohemian Brigade: Civil War Newsmen in Action","description":"This book reveals not only how the course of the war was viewed through the press, but also how the impact of the war brought about a revolution in journalism which changed the American newpaper from an organ primarily of editorial opinion into the easily recognizable ancestor of the modern metropolitan daily.--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a8Z3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Bohemian+Brigade:+Civil+War+Newsmen+in+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hebrew Study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda","description":"The study of the Hebrew language has been a major preoccupation of many Jews and non-Jews since ancient times.

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \\"blink\\": the election of Warren Harding; \\"New Coke\\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \\"thin-slicing\\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daddy's Boy: A Son's Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father","description":"Chris Elliott tells the story of his life with his famous father, Bob Elliott.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YiIQmpo0sjsC&dq=Daddy%27s+Boy:+A+Son%27s+Shocking+Account+of+Life+with+a+Famous+Father&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great American History Fact-Finder","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Canada Firsts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DxQ4piwOFvIC&dq=Canada+Firsts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brother Zero: A Story of the Life of Saint John of God","description":"Born John Ciudad in Portugal in 1495, founder of the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God, who cared for the sick and unfortunate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m2xNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Brother+Zero:+A+Story+of+the+Life+of+Saint+John+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Acrobat of the Heart: A Physical Approach to Acting Inspired by the Work of Jerzy Grotowski","description":"\\"The actor will do, in public, what is considered impossible.\\" When the renowned Polish director Jerzy Grotowski began his 1967 American workshop with these words, his students were stunned. But within four weeks they themselves had experienced the \\"impossible.\\" In An Acrobat of the Heart, teacher-director-playwright Stephen Wangh reveals how Jerzy Grotowski's physical exercises can open a pathway to the actor's inner creativity.

In this essay, translated by THOMAS BAILEY SAUNDERS (1860-1928) and first published in English in the 1890s, Schopenhauer explores concepts of what internal driving forces and external interpersonal dynamics contribute to the individual's happiness, from our own personalities to our wealth and social standing. The datedness of some of Schopenhauer's ideas?including a decidedly prefeminist interpretation of women's choices and a connection between fame and reputation that is no longer always active in our celebrity culture?only serve to highlight the philopher's basic assumption of human life: that it is characterized chiefly by misery.

He finds symbol to be an essentially religious reality for Coleridge, one that partakes of the nature of a sacrament, especially sacrament as an encounter between material and spiritual reality. Father Barth notes that eighteenth-century poetry was by and large a poetry of metaphor rather than of symbol, a poetry of reference rather than of encounter. In close readings of the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge, he shows how they practiced and developed the poetry of symbol. Finally, analyzing the symbolic imagination, the author concludes that it is a phenomenon profoundly linked with the experience of Romanticism itself and with a fundamental change in religious sensibility.

Jonathan Edwards was America's most influential evangelical, whose revivals of the 1730s became those against which all subsequent ones have been judged. The marvelous accomplishment of Philip Gura's Jonathan Edwards is to place the rich intellectual landscape of America's most formidable evangelical within the upheaval of his times. Gura not only captures Edwards' brilliance but respectfully explains the enduring appeal of his theology: in a world of profound uncertainty, it held out hope of an authentic conversion---the quickening of the indwelling spirit of God in one's heart and the consequent certitude of Godly behavior and everlasting grace. Tracing Jonathan Edwards' life from his birth in 1703 to his untimely death in 1758, Gura magnificently reasserts Edwards rightful claim as the father of America's evangelical tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NU4O2UGfpiUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"German Cancer Therapies: Natural and Conventional Medicines That Offer Hope and Healing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Toward God: The Ancient Wisdom of Western Prayer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Andaman Islands","description":"This book is an ethnographic account of colonialism in the Andaman Islands, Bay of Bengal, India.

When two thugs set upon him, they find their quarry sober and armed. He kills them both, escaping before the police arrive. They will not be the last of Chicago s criminal class to suffer his wrath. Written by Garfield as  penance  for the success of the grisly film adaptation of Death Wish, this sequel shows that when a decent man relies on violence to settle scores, murder becomes addictive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yJjQBQAAQBAJ&dq=Death+Sentence:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Isuzu: Amigo/Pick-Ups/Rodeo/Trooper 1981-96 (Chilton's Total Car Care Manual)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1WABPwAACAAJ&dq=Isuzu:+Amigo/Pick-Ups/Rodeo/Trooper+1981-96+(Chilton%27s+Total+Car+Care+Manual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World","description":"An outspoken, controversial study argues that in order to live up to their potential and feel fulfilled, women need to remain in the workplace rather than stay at home with their children.

Five boys went hunting. Four came back. The boys won't say who fired the shot that killed their friend, Grant; the evidence shows it could have been any one of them. Kate Marino's senior year internship at the District Attorney's Office isn't exactly glamorous-more like an excuse to leave school early that looks good on college applications. Then the DA hands her boss, Mr. Stone, the biggest case her small town of Belle Terre has ever seen. The River Point Boys are all anyone can talk about. Despite their damning toxicology reports the morning of the accident, the DA wants the boys' case swept under the rug. He owes his political office to their powerful families. Kate won't let that happen. Digging up secrets without revealing her own is a dangerous line to walk; Kate has personal reasons for seeking justice for Grant. As she investigates with Stone-the aging prosecutor relying on Kate to see and hear what he cannot-she realizes that nothing about the case-or the boys-is what it seems. Grant wasn't who she thought he was, and neither is Stone's prime suspect. As Kate gets dangerously close to the truth, it becomes clear that the early morning accident might not have been an accident at all-and if Kate doesn't uncover the true killer, more than one life could be on the line including her own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HV9RDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legal Guide for Starting & Running a Small Business, Seventh Edition","description":"All the plain-English legal and business information you need to get your business off the ground and running.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E5n_wAEACAAJ&dq=Legal+Guide+for+Starting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Journal of Patrick Seamus Flaherty : A United States Marine Corps, Khe Sanh,Vietnam ,1968 (My Name Is America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Javanese Ethics and World-View (The Javanese Idea Of The Good Life)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tuesday Blade a Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gRhbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tuesday+Blade+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick and Easy Mathematics","description":"Describes shortcuts to use in solving problems in addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimals, and fractions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yycYAQAAMAAJ&dq=Quick+and+Easy+Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Organization man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thomas Stearns Eliot: Poet","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Health and the Honeybee","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Child With Special Needs: Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional Growth (A Merloyd Lawrence Book)","description":"Offers guidelines to parents of children with developmental challenges","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=42S7AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Child+With+Special+Needs:+Encouraging+Intellectual+and+Emotional+Growth+(A+Merloyd+Lawrence+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sophocles Oedipus at Colonus, (Greek Commentaries Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N5wmAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sophocles+Oedipus+at+Colonus,+(Greek+Commentaries+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El moderno repertorio de Kent (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Recovery Bible-OE","description":"The Life Recovery Bible25th Anniversary Edition points to God himself as the primary source of recovery.

Wall Street Journal ? Boston Globe ? Library Journal ? CrimeReads ? LitReactor ? Air Mail ? Longlisted for the Joyce Carol Oates Prize ? A TODAY Show #ReadWithJenna Book Club Pick ? An Instant New York Times Bestseller New York Times bestselling and award-winning author Megan Abbott's exquisite and disquieting new novel,  dark and juicy and tinged with horror  (The New York Times Books Review), set against the hothouse of a family-run ballet studio. With their long necks and matching buns and pink tights, Dara and Marie Durant have been dancers since they can remember. Growing up, they were homeschooled and trained by their glamorous mother, founder of the Durant School of Dance. After their parents' death in a tragic accident nearly a dozen years ago, the sisters began running the school together, along with Charlie, Dara's husband and once their mother's prized student. Marie, warm and soft, teaches the younger students; Dara, with her precision, trains the older ones; and Charlie, sidelined from dancing after years of injuries, rules over the back office. Circling around one another, the three have perfected a dance, six days a week, that keeps the studio thriving. But when a suspicious accident occurs, just at the onset of the school's annual performance of The Nutcracker a season of competition, anxiety, and exhilaration an interloper arrives and threatens the sisters' delicate balance. Taut and unnerving, The Turnout is Megan Abbott at the height of her game. With uncanny insight and hypnotic writing, it is a sharp and strange dissection of family ties and sexuality, femininity and power, and a tale that is both alarming and irresistible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=COs2EAAAQBAJ&dq=Megan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Hearts and Three Lions ( First Paperback Edition )","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blackjack Basic (Playing) Strategy, 1 Deck","description":"This new Blackjack Basic (Playing) Strategy card for 1 Deck is a blackjack player's dream come true. The laminated, six-panel, tri-fold card with rounded corners devotes four panel sides to covering the possible rule combinations of allowing or not allowing doubling down after a split, and the dealer hitting or standing on soft 17. Thus the card contains four playing strategies to allow you to choose the correct playing strategy for the rules that are in effect where you play.The strategies display color-coded decision cells in addition to showing the text of the decision so you can choose which way you learn best. Also, each strategy panel is section-coded to facilitate learning the most important decisions first. Surrender is included among the decisions, and footnotes provide alternatives when decisions are not allowed. The 3.5\\" x 5\\" panel size makes possible larger text than on other strategy cards and three-letter (not confusing one-letter) decision abbreviations, yet the card still fits in your pocket.End panels, which contain slits, are designed to fold in both directions and to lay flat to make it easy for you to quickly refer to the strategy you wish to use. One panel contains a pithy, insightful discussion of the playing decisions to help new players learn how to play the game; another panel provides a table which shows the House Edge for each of four rule combinations. About 99% of blackjack players do not use the correct Basic Strategy. By using the Blackjack 6 7 8 Strategy Cards, players will now be able to play almost even with the house.Blackjack 6-7-8 strategy cards are also available for 2 Decks, 4-8 Decks, and Counter (as in \\"Card Counter\\") Basic, 4-8 Decks.

Michael A. Barnhart tests this assumption by examining the events leading up to World War II in the context of Japan's quest for economic security, drawing on a wide array of Japanese and American sources. Barnhart focuses on the critical years from 1938 to 1941 as he investigates the development of Japan's drive for national economic self-sufficiency and independence and the way in which this drive shaped its internal and external policies. He also explores American economic pressure on Tokyo and assesses its impact on Japan's foreign policy and domestic economy. He concludes that Japan's internal political dynamics, especially the bitter rivalry between its army and navy, played a far greater role in propelling the nation into war with the United States than did its economic condition or even pressure from Washington. Japan Prepares for Total War sheds new light on prewar Japan and confirms the opinions of those in Washington who advocated economic pressure against Japan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1gyeDgAAQBAJ&dq=Japan+Prepares+for+Total+War:+The+Search+for+Economic+Security,+1919-1941+(Cornell+Studies+in+Security+Affairs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Returned with Love: I Gave My Baby Away-A Story of the Pain and Joy of Adoption","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lip: A Biography of Leo Durocher","description":"Discusses the baseball legend's childhood and rookie years, his managing of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940s and the Houston Astros in the 1970s, and his personal life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hgKdAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Lip:+A+Biography+of+Leo+Durocher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dare To Be Free: How to Get Control of Your Time, Your Life, and Your Nursing Career","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dental Office Management","description":"Make a good first impression!

The book is the product of more than two years of research by J. Darrell Bakken, retired vice-president of engineering of the Indianapolis Water Company, who worked in previously untapped archives, discovering documents and never-before published photographs which helped yield the history of the twenty-five mile canal. This technical history begins in 1835, when Indiana caught \\"canal fever\\" and began a multi-million dollar project to build a network of canals to transport passengers and freight throughout the state. One section of that project, the Indiana Central Canal, started in northern Marion County in Broad Ripple, continued through the city of Indianapolis, and ended in Johnson County, near the town of Waverly. For more than forty years the canal was a failure both practically and financially. Finally in 1881 the canal became part of the new Indianapolis Water Company, and from then until the current day it has been an important part of the history of the city of Indianapolis. The latter part of the book documents the impact of community leaders such as General Thomas A. Morris, F. A. W. Davis, Hugh M. K. Landon, Clarence H. Geist, and Thomas W. Moses, and reveals how, from the 1970s onward, the downtown canal became a driving force in the transformation of Indianapolis into one of America's most livable cities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WATEwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Meter%27s+Running:+Three+Decades+of+the+Adventures+of+New+York+City%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drifter's War","description":"An interplanetary smuggler is pursued by bounty hunters and plunged into battle in this novel by the New York Timesbestselling author of Andromeda s Fall.

Planned as the headquarters and monument of the Comintern in Petrograd, it was to be made from industrial materials iron, glass, and steel as a towering symbol of modernity. Because of the political turmoil and housing shortages in Russia after the 1917 Revolution, the building was never constructed, but it remains a celebrated icon of revolutionary art. In this insightful book, Norbert Lynton investigates the sources and symbolism of Tatlin s Tower and considers not only its significance but also the broader role of allegory in abstraction and as an expression of man s highest aspirations. Then, in light of his new symbolic reading of the Tower, Lynton examines Tatlin s flying machine, Letatlin, and earlier works in his career and discusses their impact on other Russian painters, sculptors, designers, and architects of his era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YS1yHQAACAAJ&dq=Tatlin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master Planning: The Complete Guide for Building a Strategic Plan for Your Business, Church or Organization","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Dubai (Lonely Planet Dubai & Abu Dhabi)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Captain's Daughter","description":"An NYRB Classics Original Alexander Pushkin s short novel is set during the reign of Catherine the Great, when the Cossacks rose up in rebellion against the Russian empress.

Some time around their first birthday most infants begin to engage in a behaviour that is designed to bring it about - say, by means of pointing or gaze-following - that their own and another person's attention are focused on the same object. Described as manifestations of an emerging capacity for joint attention, such triangulations between infant, adult and the world are often treated as a developmental landmark and have become the subject of intensive research among developmentalists and primatologists over the past decade. More recently, work on joint attention has also begun to attract the attention of philosophers. Fuelling researchers' interest in all these disciplines is the intuition that joint attention plays a foundational role in the emergence of communicative abilities, in children's developing understanding of the mind and, possibly, in the very capacity for objective thought. This book brings together, for the first time, philosophical and psychological perspectives on the nature and significance of the phenomenon, addressing issues such as: How should we explain the kind of mutual openness that joint attention seems to involve, i.e. the sense in which both child and adult are aware that they are attending to the same thing? What sort of grip on one's own and other people's mental states does such awareness involve, and how does it relate to later-emerging 'theory of mind' abilities? In what sense, if any, is the capacity to engage in joint attention with others unique to humans? How should we explain autistic children's seeming incapacity to engage in joint attention? What role, if any, does affect play in the achievement of joint attention? And what, if any, is the connection between participation in joint attention and grasp of the idea of an objective world? The book also contains an introductory chapter aimed at providing a framework for integrating different philosophical and psychological approaches to these questions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I-GSPok-WJ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Job Seekers Guide to Wall Street Recruiters","description":"Gives advice on dealing with recruiters, including how to become part of their preferred lists, how to approach the interview, and how to craft effective resumes and cover letters","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AKZZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Job+Seekers+Guide+to+Wall+Street+Recruiters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evil","description":"What is it about evil that we find so compelling? From our obsession with serial killers to violence in pop culture, we seem inescapably drawn to the stories of monstrous acts and the aberrant people who commit them. But evil, Dr. Julia Shaw argues, is all relative, rooted in our unique cultures. What one may consider normal, like sex before marriage, eating meat, or being a banker, others find abhorrent. And if evil is only in the eye of the beholder, can it be said to exist at all? In Evil, Shaw uses case studies from academia, examples from and popular culture, and anecdotes from everyday life to break down complex information and concepts like the neuroscience of evil, the psychology of bloodlust, and workplace misbehavior. This is a wide-ranging exploration into a fascinating, darkly compelling subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X9RQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Better Isn't Enough: Evaluation Tools for the 21St-Century Church","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Loire, 3rd (Country & Regional Guides - Cadogan)","description":"The story of the survival of a rural household economy of small-holders in nineteenth-century France.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yh2GAAAAIAAJ&dq=Loire,+3rd+(Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Bits of Wisdom : A Collection of Tips and Advice from Real Parents","description":"Parents offer their suggestions on becoming a parent, motherhood, breastfeeding, \\"difficult\\" babies, fulltime parenting, sleep, toilet training, relationships with partners, safety, values, and related topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WCRhzpLZwK0C&dq=Little+Bits+of+Wisdom+:+A+Collection+of+Tips+and+Advice+from+Real+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let Down Your Hair","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cronicas del Bebe: Historia de mi infancia (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q2WLJa9rY5MC&dq=Cronicas+del+Bebe:+Historia+de+mi+infancia+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hindutva","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blinded eagle: An introduction to the life and teaching of Edward Irving","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U9UvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Blinded+eagle:+An+introduction+to+the+life+and+teaching+of+Edward+Irving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"View from a Porch Swing: Musings on a Complicated Search for the Simple Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Isabella and Ferdinand","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uPk6nRUT2CEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Performance Success: Performing Your Best Under Pressure (Theatre Arts)","description":"Performance Success teaches a set of skills so that a musician can be ready to go out and sing or play at his or her highest level, working with energies that might otherwise be wasted in unproductive ways.

Through the Fire","description":"Rolling Stone compared it to melted caramel, and Miles Davis compared it to his horn. Chaka Khan's scorchingly soulful voice first dazzled most of us back in 1974 with Rufus and \\"Tell Me Something Good,\\" and most recently in her Grammy Award-winning performance in Standing in the Shadows of Motown, singing \\"What's Going On?\\" with the Funk Brothers. Over the years, she's had twelve number-one hits and nine number-one albums. Over one hundred appearances on the Billboard charts. Nineteen Grammy nominations and eight Grammy wins. Her achievements in the music industry are legendary, and like her twenty albums, they're well-known to the public. But the private side of Chaka, the story of what fame and fortune have cost her-- and taught her-- hasn't been told before. In Chaka! Through the Fire, Chaka Khan gives us the whole story of the woman behind the diva and reveals her high and low points. A happy early childhood in a loving, creative home was shattered by escalating fights between her parents. When they finally split, Chaka's father disappeared without even a goodbye, leaving Chaka bewildered, bereft, and blaming her mother. She reconnected with her dad in her teens, finding that he was as liberal and permissive a parent as her mother was strict. Chaka started experimenting with drugs and joined the Black Panthers. Soon after, she fronted for a band called Rufus. They hit it big with \\"Tell Me Something Good,\\" and Chaka's stardom was launched. But life on the road was grueling, and as the years went by, the pressures grew. Chaka turned to alcohol and drugs to numb the pain of failed relationships, the guilt of leaving her kids to be raised by Grandma, the resentment she felt about the exhausting demands of her career. It wasn't until things got very bad that she started to see the patterns. All the things she had suffered through in her childhood and swore never to do to her kids-- well, she was doing them. That's when she began the work of turning it all around. These days, she's still a musical powerhouse, but she's making sure there's time for family, too. She's drug-free. She's started her own record label and has also started a foundation to help women and children in need. Remarkably, Chaka has remained a true wild child despite all the changes: a fiercely independent woman who never compromised her spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2E-PAAACAAJ&dq=Chaka!+Through+the+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is The Bible ?","description":"Instant New York Times Bestseller Rob Bell, the beloved author of Love Wins and What We Talk About When We Talk About God, goes deep into the Bible to show how it is more revelatory, revolutionary, and relevant than we ever imagined and offers a cogent argument for why we need to look at it in a fresh, new way. In Love Wins, Rob Bell confronted the troubling questions that many people of faith were afraid to ask about heaven, hell, fate, and faith. Using the same inspired, inquisitive approach, he now turns to our most sacred book, the Bible. What Is the Bible? provides insights and answers that make clear why the Bible is so revered and what makes it truly inspiring and essential to our lives. Rob takes us deep into actual passages to reveal the humanity behind the Scriptures. You cannot get to the holy without going through the human, Rob tells us. When considering a passage, we shouldn t ask \\"Why did God say . . .?\\" To get to the heart of the Bible s meaning, we should be asking: \\"What s the story that s unfolding here and why did people find it important to tell it? What was it that moved them to record these words? What was happening in the world at that time? What does this passage/story/poem/verse/book tell us about how people understood who they were and who God was at that time?\\" In asking these questions, Rob goes beyond the one-dimensional question of \\"is it true?\\" to reveal the Bible s authentic transformative power. Rob addresses the concerns of all those who see the Bible as God s Word but are troubled by the ethical dilemmas, errors, and inconsistencies in Scripture. With What Is the Bible?, he recaptures the Good Book s magic and reaffirms its power and inspiration to shape and inspire our lives today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPBEtAEACAAJ&dq=What+Is+The+Bible+%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash, the lead dog,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JAtQGQAACAAJ&dq=Flash,+the+lead+dog,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Direct Instruction","description":"A proven instructional teaching method--in a format you can use.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature Hide and Seek: Oceans","description":"Introduce a variety of marine animals whose shape and coloration helps camouflage them from their enemies, including descriptions of crabs, cuttlefish, slugs, eels, fish, octopuses, turtles, and shrimp, in a text with fold-out flaps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lg0nPwAACAAJ&dq=Nature+Hide+and+Seek:+Oceans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Beauty: Men, Women and Sex Appeal Since Feminism","description":"In 2010, pioneering sociologist Catherine Hakim shocked the world with a provocative new theory: In addition to the three recognized personal assets (economic, cultural, and social capital), each individual has a fourth asset erotic capital that he or she can, and should, use to advance within society.

Social scientists have paid little serious attention to these modes of personal empowerment, despite overwhelming evidence of their importance. In Erotic Capital, Hakim marshals a trove of research to show that rather than degrading those who employ it, erotic capital represents a powerful and potentially equalizing tool one that we scorn only to our own detriment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3szp6Hmq8IoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet East Africa","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The history of Pendennis: His fortunes and misfortunes, his friends and his greatest enemy","description":"Set in 19th-century England, particularly in London.

So writes S. S. Prawer in his concise and penetrating study of the horror film from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein, to Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Omen. After a brief history of the horror genre in film, Prawer offers detailed analyses of specific sequences from various films, such as Murnau s Nosferatu. He discusses continuities between literary and cinematic tales, and shows what happens when one is transformed into the other. Unpatronizing and scholarly, Prawer draws on a wide range of sources in order to better situate a genre that is both enormously popular with contemporary audiences and of increasing critical importance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6K2qzaaU67sC&dq=Caligari%27s+Children:+The+Film+As+Tale+Of+Terror+(Da+Capo+Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shortcut to Italian (English and Italian Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Enoch 1 Hermeneia (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible)","description":"Created in conjunction with an exhaustive critical commentary, this is an English translation of '1 Enoch' taking into consideration all of the textual data now available the Ethiopic version, the Greek texts and the Dead Sea Aramaic fragments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OncCtbNYPsEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Toy Train Maker: Insiders Remember Lionel","description":"The inside story of the Lionel Corporation as told by nine former employees.

These scenes of steam trains and electric interurban lines, of railroad workers and depots and travelers, focus on the period 1900 to 1915, when Ohio railroading was in its heyday and the great American postcard passion was at its height. In his informative and fascinating introduction, H. Roger Grant tells the story of Ohio's relations with the railroad from the 1830s to the present and traces the popularity of the picture postcard, particularly those that still charmingly evoke the images of an era long past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NmPbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ohio%27s+Railway+Age+in+Postcards+(Ohio+History+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam in Global History: Volume One: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Second Sin","description":"A psychiatrist who is an exponent of the \\"second sin\\" of clarity in thought and speech seeks to dispel some of the \\"psychiatric humbug\\" of his peers, whom he sees as the last in a long line of obfuscating authoritarians which reaches back to the Tower of Babel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MAPbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Second+Sin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wild Palms and The Old Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"English Pronunciation Illustrated Cassettes (2)","description":"A popular pronunciation practice book for intermediate and advanced learners of English.

Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted.

The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard. Innovative, provocative, and hopeful, Deep Medicine shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the humans involved.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7iFlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Good Man: The Pete Newell Story","description":"Pete Newell is considered one of the finest basketball minds in the sport s history.

And what is the all-pervading religion of Tibet? The Buddhism of that country has been described to us, of course, but that does not mean the question has been answered.

The reader is made a witness to cultic proceedings through which the author guides him carefully. He does not force one to accept easy explanations nor does he direct one's attention only to aspects that can be counted on to please. He leads one step by step, without omitting anything, through entire rituals, and interprets whenever necessary without being unduly obtrusive.

The laminated, six-panel, tri-fold card with rounded corners devotes four panel sides to covering the possible rule combinations of allowing or not allowing doubling down after a split, and the dealer hitting or standing on soft 17. Thus the card contains four playing strategies to allow you to choose the correct playing strategy for the rules that are in effect where you play. The strategies display color-coded decision cells in addition to showing the text of the decision so you can choose which way you learn best. Also, each strategy panel is section-coded to facilitate learning the most important decisions first. Surrender is included among the decisions, and footnotes provide alternatives when decisions are not allowed. The 3.5\\" x 5\\" panel size makes possible larger text than on other strategy cards and three-letter (not confusing one-letter) decision abbreviations, yet the card still fits in your pocket. End panels, which contain slits, are designed to fold in both directions and to lay flat to make it easy for you to quickly refer to the strategy you wish to use. One panel contains a pithy, insightful discussion of the playing decisions to help new players learn how to play the game; another panel provides a table which shows the House Edge for each of four rule combinations. About 99% of blackjack players do not use the correct Basic Strategy. By using the Blackjack 6 7 8 Strategy Card, players will now be able to play almost even with the house.

In this landmark, one-of-a-kind volume Sonia Uvezian gives this time-honored cuisine the kind of presentation it truly deserves. \\"Recipes and Remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean Kitchen\\" is a revelatory work rich in personal reminiscences; insightful quotations, anecdotes, and proverbs; valuable information on ingredients, utensils, daily meals, and traditions; and evocative period illustrations. Sonia Uvezian's many memories and associations establish a sense of place and emotional pull rarely encountered in Middle Eastern culinary literature. The \\"eastern Mediterranean Kitchen\\" in the title is actually that of her family's summer home in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon's fertile agricultural and winemaking region, as well as the one in their Beirut apartment. It is where the Uvezians prepared the food they grew themselves or bought from nearby farms, orchards, and markets. Written by an expert in the field and over two decades in the making, \\"Recipes and Remembrances\\" is a fascinating and highly original book imbued with a keen historical perspective and a deep respect for the region's cultural heritage. Few cookbook authors have approached their subjects with the thorough, painstaking research reflected in this work. A profound understanding of eastern Mediterranean food shines through in its hundreds of superb, clearly written recipes, which are often preceded by illuminating introductory remarks. From the definitive section on pomegranates and pomegranate molasses through the fabulous chapters on desserts and beverages, this book provides indispensable reading for anyone interested in the cookery and culture of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. Like the author's groundbreaking classics, \\"The Cuisine of Armenia\\" and \\"Cooking from the Caucasus,\\" which were among the first to bring Middle Eastern and Caucasian cooking to America, it is long on such traditional dishes as tabbuleh and baklava but also includes innovations, among them Damascus-Style Cheese Dip with Toasted Sesame Seeds and Nigella and Grilled Quail with Sour Cherry Sauce. Timeless and timely, \\"Recipes and Remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean Kitchen\\" is a welcome blend of outstanding scholarship and entertaining reading. A genuine contribution to culinary literature, it has achieved the status of a classic. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Sonia Uvezian was born and brought up in Beirut, Lebanon. A leading authority on Middle Eastern and Caucasian cooking and the winner of a James Beard Award, she is the author of six other highly acclaimed cookbooks, including \\"The Cuisine of Armenia,\\" \\"Cooking from the Caucasus,\\" and \\"The Book of Yogurt.\\" Several of her books have been selections of Book-of-the-Month Club and published internationally.

The author then traces the development of neo-institutionalism, experimental economics, and evolutionary economics exemplified by the new theory of the firm; and discusses implications of the neurobiological approach.

In this lucid and absorbing study, Andrew Epstein argues that an obsession with both the pleasures and problems of friendship erupts in the \\"New American Poetry\\" that emerges after the Second World War. By focusing on some of the most significant postmodernist American poets--the \\"New York School\\" poets John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and their close contemporary Amiri Baraka--Beautiful Enemies reveals a fundamental paradox at the heart of postwar American poetry and culture: the avant-garde's commitment to individualism and nonconformity runs directly counter to its own valorization of community and collaboration. In fact, Epstein demonstrates that the clash between friendship and nonconformity complicates the legendary alliances forged by postwar poets, becomes a predominant theme in the poetry they created, and leaves contemporary writers with a complicated legacy to negotiate. Rather than simply celebrating friendship and poetic community as nurturing and inspiring, these poets represent friendship as a kind of exhilarating, maddening contradiction, a site of attraction and repulsion, affinity and rivalry. Challenging both the reductive critiques of American individualism and the idealized, heavily biographical celebrations of literary camaraderie one finds in much critical discussion, this book provides a new interpretation of the peculiar dynamics of American avant-garde poetic communities and the role of the individual within them. By situating his extensive and revealing readings of these highly influential poets against the backdrop of Cold War cultural politics and within the context of American pragmatist thought, Epstein uncovers the collision between radical self-reliance and the siren call of the interpersonal at the core of postwar American poetry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ej6cZOroggoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffalo Soldiers,","description":"Originally published in 1967, William H. Leckie s The Buffalo Soldiers was the first book of its kind to recognize the importance of African American units in the conquest of the West.

Now, in a newly revised edition, the authors have expanded the original research to explore more deeply the lives of buffalo soldiers in the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry Regiments. Written in accessible prose that includes a synthesis of recent scholarship, this edition delves further into the life of an African American soldier in the nineteenth century.

Hitting the Road offers a striking collection of illustrations of over 200 road maps, together with a fascinating discussion of the popular culture they reveal. From the early touring maps of 1912, featuring covers ablaze with a sense of motoring adventure, to the Art Deco-inspired graphics of the thirties and the family-oriented images of the fifties and sixties, the examples in Hitting the Road are themselves maps of the recreational twists and turns of the public they sought to guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yqMeAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hitting+the+Road:+The+Art+of+the+American+Road+Map&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooperating With Europe's Monetary Union (Policy Analyses in International Economics)","description":"Europe's monetary union will represent the most profound transformation of the international monetary system since the transition from fixed to flexible exchange rates in the early 1970s. It will compete with the erosion of American dominance and the dramatic increase in capital mobility for the distinction of being the most far-reaching change in the global monetary system since the Bretton Woods conference of 1944. Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will create in Europe a new monetary actor with an economic size roughly comparable to the United States, ushering in a new era in international monetary relations. Nonetheless, while broad interests coincide, the creation of the monetary union will pose challenges to American, Japanese, and other non-European policymakers. Europe's monetary union could prove to be a difficult partner in international monetary cooperation. Henning recommends that European institutions and policy processes be strengthened, representation of the monetary union in the G-7 be consolidated, and that European, American, and Japanese authorities cooperate to reduce instability during the transition to monetary union.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kwi3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Cooperating+With+Europe%27s+Monetary+Union+(Policy+Analyses+in+International+Economics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masonry Construction Manual","description":"The construction manuals from Edition Detail have set new standards in the field of specialist literature, becoming an indispensable part of any architect's library.

A theologian who was firmly committed to the Lutheran confession, he could yet see very c1early the flaws in his church and argue for their reform; without being an ecumenicist in the modern sense, he yet admired many aspects of the society he observed in Calvinist Geneva, and he recognised the outstanding merit of individual Catholic scholars. A linguist and a lover of art and music, he was the friend of scientists and an enthusiastic student of mathematics wh? held that science leads both to an appreciation of the wonders of the material world and its rejection in favour of more spiritual concerns. In his satirical writing he could be ironic and flippant, his rhetoric was often laboured and over elaborate, but there is no mistaking the sincerity of his outrage at cruelty, inhumanity and injustice. Andrere was optimistic, in that he believed that the corruption and deceit, the luxm. y and deprivation, the hypocrisy, tyranny and sophistry of the age could be transformed in a second reformation; yet there runs through his life a deep-rooted pessimism or depression which makes his willingness to continue the struggle all the more admirable. As early as 1618, while still a young deacon at the beginning of his career, he defined the four ages of l human life as terror, error, labor and horror.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=shcrBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Island Boyhood: A Memoir","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cope's Early diagnosis of the acute abdomen","description":"Provides a reference on the clinical rather than laboratory diagnosis of the acute abdomen.

The Old Testament Speaks offers a clear picture of the archaeological, geographical, historical, and linguistic dimensions of God's covenant with his people from the time of Abraham to the coming of the Messiah. The Old Testament Speaks examines the historical and religious life of the Hebrews, integrates the development of non-hebraic cultures with conventional biblical history, and reviews the best modern scholarly research in placing the Scriptures in their Near Eastern setting. Samuel J. Schultz emphasizes the importance of letting the Scriptures tell their own stories. He makes selective use of the best and latest literature in Old Testament studies, and offers a balanced perspective. Schultz sifts the facts and follows them to their inevitable conclusions. However, when the evidence is not definitive, he exercises caution, presenting his own interpretation as only one of several possible views. Schultz also appraises the impact of recent archaeological and historical findings on the understanding of key portions of the Old Testament. The Old Testament Speaks contains all the relevant material -- biblical and nonbiblical -- necessary for classroom use or personal study of the Old Testament. Schultz provides outlines that reflect the historical background and summarize the contents of each biblical book, as well as charts and maps to help visualize the biblical narrative. He has also revised and updated the biblio-graphies at the end of each chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=otchaASAlaYC&dq=The+Old+Testament+Speaks:+a+Complete+Survey+of+Old+Testament+History+and+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of television,: The life of Philo T.

Yet there is no authoritative book available to guide building committees, ministers, and others responsible for new churches in the theological implications of their work. Dr. White explores the theological and historical considerations relevant to building for Protestant worship. Surprisingly, these are often ignored by building committees, usually with disastrous results. His approach is highly original, especially in his theological treatment of worship; yet his book is also a operative in the largest sense, in that it relates theology to practice. Professor White begins with a critical analysis of contemporary concepts of Protestant worship and then defines the liturgical factors in church design. Following this, there are four chapters giving an historical account of various experiments from the third century to the present. This section indicates the tremendous variety of possibilities open to the church builder, many of which have been ignored too long. A final chapter deals with emotive factors - all vitally relevant to the architect: choir, liturgical art, and style. The opportunity to design a new church building occurs only once or twice in each generation of church members. It is all the more important that it be done carefully since the building will continue to affect the life of the congregation for many years. Until fundamental questions as to what the Church is and what the Church does in worship are raised, a congregation is not prepared to build. This book will help churches find the answers. The 155-item bibliography should be of value to many since a recent extensive bibliography on Protestant church architecture does not exist.

Husband and wife team Barry and Emily McCarthy view divorce and remarriage with optimism, showing it to be a courageous choice that should not be viewed as personal failure but rather as a positive step towards a better life. In Getting it Right This Time, they zoom in on remarriage issues and identify the factors that led to the end of a marriage, using that information to help you learn from past mistakes and start over. Marriage is based on a respectful, trusting relationship, and the McCarthys affirm that remarriage is an important choice that can lead to a rich, rewarding, and loving second chance. Getting it Right This Time provides resources needed to assess and change attitudes, behavior, and feelings to help you build a new marriage and step-family that will bring out the best in you as individuals and as a couple.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lvAflPJLFr0C&dq=Getting+it+Right+This+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life (Science Masters S.)","description":"How did the replication bomb we call  life  begin and where in the world, or rather, in the universe, is it heading?

For example, if you play by HIPAA s rules, a physician is a provider; however, Medicare requires that the same physician must be referred to as a supplier. Even more troubling is the need to alter claims to meet specific requirements that may conflict with national standards. Far from being a benign issue, differing guidelines can lead to false claims with financial and even criminal implications. Compliance for Coding, Billing & Reimbursement, Second Edition: A Systematic Approach to Developing a Comprehensive Program provides an organized way to deal with the complex coding, billing, and reimbursement (CBR) processes that seem to force providers to choose between being paid and being compliant. Fully revised to account for recent changes and evolving terminology, this unique and accessible resource covers statutorily based programs and contract-based relationships, as well as ways to efficiently handle those situations that do not involve formal relationships. Based on 25 years of direct client consultation and drawing on teaching techniques developed in highly successful workshops, Duane Abbey offers a logical approach to CBR compliance. Designed to facilitate efficient reimbursements that don t run afoul of laws and regulations, this resource  Addresses the seven key elements promulgated by the OIG for any compliance program Discusses numerous types of compliance issues for all type of healthcare providers Offers access to online resources that provide continually updated information Cuts through the morass of terminology and acronyms with a comprehensive glossary Includes a CD-ROM packed with regulations and information In addition to offering salient information illustrated by case studies, Dr, Abbey provides healthcare providers and administrators, as well as consultants and attorneys, with the mindset and attitude required to meet this very real challenge with savvy, humor, and perseverance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=94D9lxNpqBYC&dq=Mind+Mapping:+How+to+Liberate+Your+Natural+Genius&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arrival (Atlantean's Quest, Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Robert Jordan: A Reader's Checklist and Reference Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jYAAAAAACAAJ&dq=Robert+Jordan:+A+Reader%27s+Checklist+and+Reference+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder Take Two","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Baby Stuff: A No-Nonsense Shopping Guide to What to Buy, What to Borrow, and What to Avoid -- No Matter What Your Budget","description":"Provides advice about what products parents should buy and borrow for their baby, discussing price, convenience, brand names, safety features, and European manufacturers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z85tGwAACAAJ&dq=Baby+Stuff:+A+No-Nonsense+Shopping+Guide+to+What+to+Buy,+What+to+Borrow,+and+What+to+Avoid+--+No+Matter+What+Your+Budget&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash(R) MX Virtual Classroom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Siva Purana (Ancient Indian Tradition and Mythology Series)","description":"The Purana is a class of literature that treats of ancient religion, philosophy, history, sociology, politics and other subjects. It is an encyclopaedia of various branches of knowledge and ancient wisdom. It has been defined as a class of literature that contains material on the topics of Creation, Dis-solution of Manus, Ages of Manus, Genealogies and the History of glorious kings. For dealing primarily with these subjects it has been called Pancalaksana-a title that was incorporated in the Puranas themselves and had become popular by the Fifth Century A.D., for it was included by Amarasimha in his lexicon 'Amarakosa'. But as the process of interpolation continued, the Pancalaksana definition was found inadequate. The Puranic redactors adopted a Dasalaksana definition that suited the contemporary text. Still, the dynamic forces were at work and the process of insertion, modification and abridgement went on and it was soon discovered that the Dasa-laksana definition too fell short of an actual fact. It was found that the Puranas contained certain aspects that were not covered by any five or ten characteristics. The Puranas are divided into two classes-the Maha-puranas and the Upapuranas. Each class consists of eighteen Puranas. Thus the number of the Puranas is thirty-six. Mahapuranas are classified into different categories-Vaisnava, Brahma, Saiva etc. Sivapurana has all the characteristics of a Mahapurana. According to the ancients, a Mahapurana contained five main characteristics that concerned either early religion or traditional history. Sivapurana possesses the conventional characteristics of a Mahapurana in common with its other colleagues. These entitle it to the status of a great Purana. But its real greatness lies in expounding the philosophical background of the Siva ritual. The Purana conceives Siva as the eternal principle, the supreme god, the cosmic soul, the support of all existence. But the ignorant aspirant bound in the meshes of illusion goes in quest for knowledge and imagines that his lord has a personal form possessed of attributes distinct from his self, who in moments of distress responds to his prayers and bestows grace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4kbmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Simple Thing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SsMngaRkcUQC&dq=No+Simple+Thing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov (Great Books of the Western World, Vol. 52)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Democritus: The Great Philosophers (The Great Philosophers Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Historical Atlas of the Vietnam War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nissan Pick-ups 1998-2001: Frontier Pick-ups, 1998-2001, Xterra, 2000 and 2001, Pathfinder, 1996-2001 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manuals)","description":"Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Andrew Nagorski has written the story of a doomed generation, of evil, hopelessness, sexual perversion and murder that set the stage for the ultimate destruction of a society. But in a stunning denouement, a young Nazi brownshirt, acting out of passion and revenge, changes the course of history. Karl Naumann, a German teenager who has lost his father and brother in World War I, has tried to find a place in a defeated, demoralized and anarchic Berlin. Impressed by the returning veterans who refuse to lay down their arms and fight running battles with communist revolutionaries, and alone and adrift on the streets, he is recruited to their cause and camaraderie. He is sent to Munich, where he works his way up the ranks to become one of Adolf Hitler's bodyguards, a storm trooper. The new movement is increasingly split between Hitler and rival leaders, including Karl's mentor, Otto Strasser, a real-life Nazi activist. As the schism within the party widens, the battles intensify and Hitler asserts his dominance, Karl must determine where his loyalty lies. He has fallen in love with a nurse, Sabine, whom he marries, but he is infatuated with Hitler's young niece, Geli Raubal, who is caught up in a deeply disturbing sexual relationship with her uncle. Obsessed by the seductive and elusive Geli, Karl is startled by what he sees through her of the dark core of Hitler's personality. When Geli finally summons up the courage to leave her uncle, it is too late. Soon after, she is found dead in their apartment, a gun in her hand, allegedly a suicide. Karl believes that Hitler has murdered her. He follows him to Geli's grave in Vienna where their final confrontation takes place.

This situation has given rise to disputes that continue to divide those who practice their faith. But what has created this state of affairs? Author Denis Crouan shows how the decisions made by Vatican II that aimed at restoring the Roman rite were presented poorly, applied incorrectly, and often not applied at all. In many places the Mass has been turned into a permanent work-in-progress, in which the objectivity of the liturgy yields to the subjectivity of those who take part in it. Where does the current unwillingness to apply the liturgical rules come from? Why have the directives of the last council been ignored or circumvented? This book offers answers to the questions asked by Catholics who want to understand their liturgy better, so as to put an end to deviant practices that threaten Church unity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dYxHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works 2nd Edition","description":"The second Oxford edition of Shakespeare's Complete Works reconsiders every detail of their text and presentation in the light of modern scholarship.

D. To 1871 A. D If we look for striking personalities and events, the reigns of Frederick the Great and of William I. Were of supreme importance to Europe, and, as was not the case with Louis XIV. And Napoleon, their acquisitions were of a permanent character. All in all, it has seemed to me that I could engage in no more thankful occupation than in writing the history of Germany the more so as German treatments of the subject presuppose more knowledge than is usually to be found in the American reader, and as no other American writer has ever attempted the task. The work of Lewis, founded on an antiquated German text-book, does not fulfil the most modest demands. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Bernard Lewis examines the historical roots of the resentments that dominate the Islamic world today and that are increasingly being expressed in acts of terrorism. He looks at the theological origins of political Islam and takes us through the rise of militant Islam in Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, examining the impact of radical Wahhabi proselytizing, and Saudi oil money, on the rest of the Islamic world. The Crisis of Islam ranges widely through thirteen centuries of history, but in particular it charts the key events of the twentieth century leading up to the violent confrontations of today: the creation of the state of Israel, the Cold War, the Iranian Revolution, the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, the Gulf War, and the September 11th attacks on the United States. While hostility toward the West has a long and varied history in the lands of Islam, its current concentration on America is new. So too is the cult of the suicide bomber. Brilliantly disentangling the crosscurrents of Middle Eastern history from the rhetoric of its manipulators, Bernard Lewis helps us understand the reasons for the increasingly dogmatic rejection of modernity by many in the Muslim world in favor of a return to a sacred past. Based on his George Polk Awardwinning article for The New Yorker, The Crisis of Islam is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what Usama bin Ladin represents and why his murderous message resonates so widely in the Islamic world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kE9LmS6QvacC&dq=The+Crisis+of+Islam:+Holy+War+and+Unholy+Terror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Aces of World War I (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 42)","description":"At the outset of World War I the British had some 110 assorted aircraft, used mostly for the visual reconnaissance role.

It was not until 1917 that the British developed a truly effective interrupter gear, which paved the way for excellent single seaters such as the Sopwith Triplane Camel and the RAF S.E.5., later joined by the Bristol F.2B the war's best two-seat fighter.

First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time. In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today. With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of  Christianities  emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment and access to God within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary or worthy expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BWvxehGJ6Q0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Matter of Trust: The Case of the Mesmerizing Boss/The Case of the Confirmed Bachelor (Most Wanted Series 1-2)","description":"Nick Reed, private investigator for the Lassiter Agency, wasn't the marrying kind.

A hunt for the American buffalo an adventurous, fascinating examination of an animal that has haunted the American imagination. In 2005, Steven Rinella won a lottery permit to hunt for a wild buffalo, or American bison, in the Alaskan wilderness. Despite the odds there s only a 2 percent chance of drawing the permit, and fewer than 20 percent of those hunters are successful Rinella managed to kill a buffalo on a snow-covered mountainside and then raft the meat back to civilization while being trailed by grizzly bears and suffering from hypothermia. Throughout these adventures, Rinella found himself contemplating his own place among the 14,000 years  worth of buffalo hunters in North America, as well as the buffalo s place in the American experience. At the time of the Revolutionary War, North America was home to approximately 40 million buffalo, the largest herd of big mammals on the planet, but by the mid-1890s only a few hundred remained. Now that the buffalo is on the verge of a dramatic ecological recovery across the West, Americans are faced with the challenge of how, and if, we can dare to share our land with a beast that is the embodiment of the American wilderness. American Buffalo is a narrative tale of Rinella s hunt. But beyond that, it is the story of the many ways in which the buffalo has shaped our national identity. Rinella takes us across the continent in search of the buffalo s past, present, and future: to the Bering Land Bridge, where scientists search for buffalo bones amid artifacts of the New World s earliest human inhabitants; to buffalo jumps where Native Americans once ran buffalo over cliffs by the thousands; to the Detroit Carbon works, a  bone charcoal  plant that made fortunes in the late 1800s by turning millions of tons of buffalo bones into bone meal, black dye, and fine china; and even to an abattoir turned fashion mecca in Manhattan s Meatpacking District, where a depressed buffalo named Black Diamond met his fate after serving as the model for the American nickel. Rinella s erudition and exuberance, combined with his gift for storytelling, make him the perfect guide for a book that combines outdoor adventure with a quirky blend of facts and observations about history, biology, and the natural world. Both a captivating narrative and a book of environmental and historical significance, American Buffalo tells us as much about ourselves as Americans as it does about the creature who perhaps best of all embodies the American ethos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ys1msOAETFEC&dq=American+Buffalo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preschool to the Rescue","description":"When a mud puddle traps a pizza van, police car, tow truck, and other vehicles, a group of preschoolers comes along and saves the day.

Interactive Video-on-Demand Systems: Resource Management and Scheduling Strategies collectively addresses multiple issues including QoS, throughput, responsiveness and efficiency. The solutions discussed in this volume are particularly valuable to practitioners who are building digital library, interactive multimedia and hypermedia servers. Interactive Video-on-Demand Systems: Resource Management and Scheduling Strategies is an excellent reference for researchers, practitioners and educators in the field of multimedia systems, and may be used for advanced courses on multimedia systems and Video-on-Demand servers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ld5_ngEACAAJ&dq=Interactive+Video-On-Demand+Systems:+Resource+Management+and+Scheduling+Strategies+(The+Springer+International+Series+in+Engineering+and+Computer+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photojournalism: Mary Ellen Mark and Annie Leibovitz: the Woman's Perspective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PqM88yfTkH8C&dq=Photojournalism:+Mary+Ellen+Mark+and+Annie+Leibovitz:+the+Woman%27s+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const D=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-7638915f"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/46.md","filePath":"glossary/46.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/46.md"},H=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(D)]))}});export{J as __pageData,H as default};
