And the better you get to know your ancestors, the better you will get to know yourself: the who's and what's and why's of you. Barbara Renick, a nationally-known lecturer on genealogy, tells the uninitiated researcher the steps needed to find out who their ancestors really were, and brings together for even the more experienced genealogical researchers the important principles and practices. She covers such topics as the importance of staying organized and how to go about it; where and how to look for information in libraries, historical societies, and on the internet; recognizing that just because something is in print doesn't mean it's right; and how to prepare to visit the home where your ancestors lived.

Variously compared to Ryokan and Francis of Assisi, Tosui has been called \\"the original hippie.\\" After many grueling years of Zen study and the sanction of a distinguished teacher, Tosui abandoned the religious establishment and became a drifter. The arresting details of Tosui's life were recorded in the Tribute (Tosui osho densan), a lively and colloquial account written by the celebrated scholar and Soto Zen master Menzan Zuiho. Menzan concentrates on Tosui's years as a beggar and laborer, recounting episodes from an unorthodox life while at the same time opening a new window on seventeenth-century Japan. The Tribute is translated here for the first time, accompanied by woodblock prints commissioned for the original 1768 edition. Peter Haskel's introduction places Tosui in the context of the Japanese Zen of his period--a time when the identities of early modern Zen schools were still being formed and a period of spiritual crisis for many distinguished monks who believed that the authentic Zen transmission had long ceased to exist. A biographical addendum offers a detailed overview of Tosui's life in light of surviving premodern sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b3meBw25E3YC&dq=Letting+Go+(Topics+in+Contemporary+Buddhism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recetas del valle: Mesilla Valley recipes : recipes from Mexico, Spain, and the desert","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Storytelling: Art and Technique","description":"Join the countless professionals who have benefited from the best how to storytelling guide available today.

Despite escalating paranoia, an initial diagnosis of Schizophreniform Disorder and taking medication with debilitating side effects, Claire learned to face her demons and manage her condition without the need for long-term medication. In this gripping memoir, Claire recounts with eloquence her most troubled times. She explains how she managed to regain control over her mind and her life even while intermittently hearing voices, through self-guided and professional therapy and with the support of family and friends. Challenging a purely medical understanding of hearing voices, Claire advocates for an end to the stigma of those who experience auditory verbal hallucinations, and a change of thinking from the professionals who treat the condition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1YIbDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Heroes: A Dynasty of Courage","description":"A collection of stories of men who stayed when others ran, fought against incredible odds, and somewhere along the way became legends, from the l8th century to WWII.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zbbBPAAACAAJ&dq=Texas+Heroes:+A+Dynasty+of+Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel and Islam: A 1978 compendium","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QTWmQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Gospel+and+Islam:+A+1978+compendium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nez Perce Dictionary (UC Publications in Linguistics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sai Baba: man of miracles","description":"India has always nurtured true yoginsthose who have transcended the lower self, those in whom wonderworking powers of siddhis have flourished.

Properly treated, bamboo is as reliable as prime-grade hardwoods, beautiful in its own right, and suitable for commercial and residential structures in any climate.

Also covered are France and Germany, where architects are discovering the delights of working with bamboo. Guadua is beautiful but not so delicate that it cannot be used in commercial structures like the auditorium-size pavilion built for the Hannover Expo 2000.

Today, the demand for faster approaches is increasing across a broad spectrum of organizations in business and society, as they are faced daily with an array of change mandates-new business strategy development and deployment, merger and acquisition integration, work re-design, community organizing, and more. Traditional command and control structures and processes no longer enable and mobilize people in organizations-the rapid rate of change in the environment demands new and different ways for organizations to respond. Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations combines systems theory and practical methodology to offer a proven, flexible approach that leads to aligned action by hundreds, even thousands of people-and creates powerful processes for change. Shattering the old paradigm about how long it takes organizations to change, the book shows how to rapidly engage the whole system in meeting organizational agility and flexibility demands. It offers adaptable, repeatable strategies for different settings and convening issues through the authors' unique Whole-Scale approach-which has been successfully applied in diverse businesses and industries, the service sector, health care, education, government, other nonprofits, and communities throughout the world. Imagine everyone in your organization pulling in the same direction, everyone with the same information, acting quickly to solve the problems and confront the issues facing your organization. Whole-Scale Change provides not only the theories and principles underlying the approach, but also the practical methods, tools, and road maps for unleashing the energy and combining the power and wisdom of all the people in an organization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZSfSnQEACAAJ&dq=Whole-Scale+Change+Toolkit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Ambitions","description":"The post-Cold War era has been difficult for Japan. A country once heralded for evolving a superior form of capitalism and seemingly ready to surpass the United States as the world s largest economy lost its way in the early 1990s. The bursting of the bubble in 1991 ushered in a period of political and economic uncertainty that has lasted for over two decades. There were hopes that the triple catastrophe of March 11, 2011 a massive earthquake, tsunami, and accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant would break Japan out of its torpor and spur the country to embrace change that would restart the growth and optimism of the go-go years. But several years later, Japan is still waiting for needed transformation, and Brad Glosserman concludes that the fact that even disaster has not spurred radical enough reform reveals something about Japan's political system and Japanese society. Glosserman explains why Japan has not and will not change, concluding that Japanese horizons are shrinking and that the Japanese public has given up the bold ambitions of previous generations and its current leadership. This is a critical insight into contemporary Japan and one that should shape our thinking about this vital country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=70CIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All my Friends Are Going to Be Strangers / Terms of Endearment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pc2TtwEACAAJ&dq=All+my+Friends+Are+Going+to+Be+Strangers+/+Terms+of+Endearment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kamala Das: A selection with essays on her work (CRNLE writers series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u_vFQgAACAAJ&dq=Kamala+Das:+A+selection+with+essays+on+her+work+(CRNLE+writers+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Married in Buffalo Jump","description":"Sophie Ware, weary of noncommittal affairs, accepts a marriage proposal from Alexander Bresnyachuk, a poor uneducated Ukrainian, knowing that her husband-to-be-only wants her for her land","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rjKsAAAAIAAJ&dq=Getting+Married+in+Buffalo+Jump&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Urantia Papers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pie in the Sky","description":"A poignant, laugh-out-loud illustrated middle-grade novel about an eleven-year-old boy's immigration experience, his annoying little brother, and their cake-baking hijinks! \\"Pie in the Sky is like enjoying a decadent cake . . . heartwarming and rib-tickling.\\"  Terri Libenson, bestselling author of Invisible Emmie Sometimes life isn't a piece of cake . . .

Is it just a matter of being at the right place in the right time? Is it because they had the right people to guide them? If you have been asking yourself these questions, then you are in the right place. While it is true that almost all the things mentioned above are true to some extent, no one can deny that it takes more than sheer luck to become a success. It requires a lot of hard work. It requires a lot of focus, planning, and management. It requires learning and education. It requires availing oneself of the right opportunities. Success also involves the willingness to take risks and make challenging decisions at the right time and in the right place. Success requires getting rid of negative attitudes and replacing them with positive ones. It requires you to be open to new challenges that take you beyond your comfort zone. Success also requires a person to be constantly learning, changing, adapting, innovating, and keeping up with the times. While all this is easier said than done, it is definitely not an impossible task. If you want to be successful, you need to adopt the habits of successful people. The list of good habits is virtually endless and may vary from one individual to the other. But here in this guide, we will be discussing the 10 best habits that can put you on the road to success.

At the dawn of the 1830s, Lydia Maria Child was a celebrated author, known for her popular domestic handbook, The Frugal Housewife, and Hobomok, a novel of American Indian life. In 1833, with the publication of her controversial Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans, Child's life changed dramatically from literary figure to antislavery activist. Her Appeal helped ignite the abolitionist movement, and several antislavery leaders -- including Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner -- credited it with converting them to the cause. An inspirational look at an extraordinary woman, Lydia Maria Child is the story of how one person fought for the basic human right of freedom -- for all.

Pay particular attention to Chapter 3, 'Christianity & Indian History.' I was so moved by this chapter several years ago that it inspired me to write my own book. Very little is written about what the Church has done to Indian people. When we think of atrocities that were experienced by Native Americans, we tend to think that it was primarily the U.S. government that was responsible. Such was not the case, for in many instances, the Church has been responsible for genocide, sexual abuse, and kidnapping. We must face up to these facts before reconciliation can begin, and Mr. Smith's book accomplishes just that. I speak not as an outsider but as a fellow minister to Native Americans. For three years I have worked among the Omaha and Winnebago Tribes and I can tell you that 'Whiteman's Gospel' is very factual, relevant, and much needed. Indian people rank at the bottom in academics, their young people commit suicide at rates 5 times higher than the general population, and medical facilites are either non-existent, or in disrepair. Clearly, these people are in distress and only the Church can meet many of their needs. Craig Smith's book makes those needs known. If you don't know anything about Native American ministry, then 'Whiteman's Gospel' is a book that you must read\\"--Amazon.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQZ9AAAACAAJ&dq=Whiteman%27s+Gospel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Probability Theory: An Advanced Course (Universitext)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Research for Writers (Writing Handbooks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The founder's dilemma.

Four chaplains were assigned to the Dorchester with more than 900 men on board. Alexander Goode, a Jewish rabbi; John Washington, a Catholic priest; George Fox, a Methodist minister; and Clark Poling, a Baptist minister, all offered comfort, reassurances, and prayers with a warning from the captain that a German submarine was hunting their convoy. The Nazi U-boat captain, Karl-Jurg Wachter, had been stalking the Americans for days. When bad weather separated the Dorchester from the other convoy ships, Wachter was finally in a position to strike. Just past midnight, on February 3, just hours from their destination, the Dorchester was torpedoed and sank, throwing its passengers into the frigid waters and creating the worst single loss of an American personnel convoy during WWII. Many of the survivors credit the four chaplains with saving their lives. Those chaplains would become known as \\"The Immortals\\" for their heroism in making the ultimate sacrifice. With no thought of themselves, they calmly helped men to safety through the chaos of their badly damaged ship, searched for spare life jackets for those without--eventually giving away their own life jackets and encouraging men in the freezing waters. The celebrated story of the Immortals is now joined for the first time in print by the largely untold story of another hero of the sinking of the Dorchester: Charles Walter Davis Jr. was a young Black petty officer aboard a Coast Guard cutter traveling with the convoy who bravely dived into the glacial water over and over again, even with hypothermia setting in, to try to rescue the men the chaplains had first helped and inspired to never give up. Thoroughly researched and told in an engrossing non-fiction narrative, the book alternates between accounts told from the perspective of the Nazi U-boat captain and his crew, and the hunted--the men of the American convoy. Using his expertise as an attorney specializing in religious freedom and constitutional law, the author, Steven T. Collis, also paints a thought-provoking portrait of religious life in America during wartime and how American views of faith affected the chaplains and the men they served. Page-turning and inspiring, The Immortals explores the power of faith and religious conviction and powerfully narrates the lives of five heroic men who believed in something greater than themselves, living lives of service and sacrifice for their country and their fellow man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gCuuzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Immortals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nada (Spanish Edition)","description":"Renowned as Spain s The Catcher in the Rye, this passionate coming-of-age novel follows a rebellious college-age girl as she uncovers her family s secrets in chaotic, polarized, post-Civil War Barcelona.

Meath. A third group known as the Veterans & Drivers Division attached to Gormanston Camp comprising of 1,069 (190 Irish-born) were recruited. Due to huge volume of recruits being immediately required and arriving in Ireland at such short notice, there was a shortage of complete regular 'rifle-green' RIC uniforms being available, they were fitted initially with ill-fitting khaki trousers and green tunics and vice-versa and collectively by March 1920 gained the title 'Black & Tans.'

J. Bell's Recollections of the Civil War Era (Railroads in America)","description":"Nimrod J. Bell worked as a conductor for several southern railroads in their formative period, from 1857 to 1894. After his career was cut short by an accident, he wrote his memoirs detailing his first glimpses of some of the earliest trains in the South and his thirty-eight years as a conductor. Published in Atlanta in 1896, his book offers a first-hand account of working conditions on the railroads, operational procedures, wartime railroading, and passenger travel during Reconstruction. Full of stories about colorful characters who rode the trains - from Confederate troops to train robbers - Southern Railroad Man is a rich source on late nineteenth-century southern culture, tradition, and travel. Perhaps because Bell worked as a conductor, some of his most interesting observations pertain to the people he encountered. Unintentionally, he also provides insights into race relations in a time of transition as he recalls his interactions with blacks as slaves, laborers, and patrons. Written in the language of the ordinary worker, Bell's narrative is a veritable treasure trove of information on southern railroads and their operations. Among the roads he traveled were several in the Carolinas, the Western & Atlantic, the East Tennessee & Georgia, the Alabama & Chattanooga, the South & North Alabama, and the East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia. Many of the railroads for which Bell worked were eventually incorporated into the Southern Railway. A rare account of early railroading, Southern Railroad Man is edited by James A. Ward, who provides notes and an introduction that places Bell's story in historical context. This unique book will appeal to anyone interested in railroad history, the history of industrialization, the Civil War, and the culture of the South in the late nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MgZcSwAACAAJ&dq=Southern+Railroad+Man:+Conductor+N.+J.+Bell%27s+Recollections+of+the+Civil+War+Era+(Railroads+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Strangling of Persia/Ekhtenag-E Iran","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mexican-Tales: A Compilation of Mexican Stories and Legends with Maps and Complete Travel and Shopping Directory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wzfXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mexican-Tales:+A+Compilation+of+Mexican+Stories+and+Legends+with+Maps+and+Complete+Travel+and+Shopping+Directory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Attitude (Hollywood Wars)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and","description":"In Megawatts and Megatons, world-renowned physicists Richard L.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EMT-B National Standard Review Self-Test (2nd Edition)","description":"This text is designed to assist the EMT-Basic in preparing for any written exam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nR4NAQAAMAAJ&dq=EMT-B+National+Standard+Review+Self-Test+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Across Realtime","description":"Encompassing time-travel, powerful mystery and the future history of humanity to its last handful of survivors, Across Realtime spans millions of years and is an utterly engrossing SF classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=raZiHQAACAAJ&dq=Across+Realtime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spurgeon on Leadership: Key Insights for Christian Leaders from the Prince of Preachers","description":"The impact of Charles Haddon Spurgeon continues to inspire evangelical leaders more than a century after his death.

Sharing his years of experience as a teacher and using his building designs as examples, the author shows us that buildings are not objects but organisms, and cities are not machines but complex ecosystems. Fleeing Holland just weeks before Hitler's invasion, the Van der Ryn family settled in the outskirts of New York City. Young Sim grew up exploring the tiny pockets of grass, puddles, and swamps he found in Queens. An avid high school art student, he progressed to studying architecture in college. But he found the pervading modernist-style buildings to be emotionally cold and lacking human sensitivity. He longed for a way to restore architecture back to life. His breakthrough came during the frequent campus visits of R. Buckminster Fuller, who inspired him to think and design with the geometries of the natural world. Design for Life shows how the young architect began to look at the world with new eyes and saw the shifting patterns in nature and how these patterns profoundly affect how we live and work in the structures we build. Using his own projects and teaching experiences as examples, the author reveals the evolution of his thinking and the emergence of a new process of collaborative design that honors the buildings' users and connects them to the Earth. The book shows how architecture has created physical and mental barriers that separate us from our world, but how we can recover the soul of architecture and reconnect with our natural surroundings. Sim Van der Ryn is the president of Van der Ryn Architects, a Northern California firm known for its work in sustainable architecture. He taught architecture and design at the University of California, Berkeley, for over 30 years, inspiring a new generation to create buildings and communities that are sensitive to place, climate, and the flow of human interactions. Appointed California State Architect in the 1970s by then-Governor Jerry Brown, Van der Ryn introduced the nation's first energy-efficient government building projects. His vision and persuasive skills heralded a golden age of ecologically sensitive design and resulted in the adoption of strict energy standards and disability access standards for all state buildings and parks. As the author of six groundbreaking books about planning and design, including Sustainable Communities (1986, with Peter Calthorpe), Ecological Design (1996, with Stuart Cowan) and numerous articles, Van der Ryn has helped inspire architects to see the myriad ways they can apply physical and social ecology to architecture and environmental design. The author lives and works in Northern California, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M2SpKEVeN10C&dq=Design+For+Life:+The+Architecture+of+Sim+Van+der+Ryn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solar Observing Techniques (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","description":"Astronomers and students interested in studying the Sun require a thorough understanding of the proper techniques and equipment.

Not only had King George III of England closed the Boston harbor to punish all those who spoke against his harsh laws, he had sent thousands of soldiers, led by their commander-in-chief General Thomas Gage, to reinforce his edicts. Large numbers of British soldiers were encamped on the Boston Common, preventing the people of Boston from using their own public space. But at least the king had not closed the schools -- young Henry Price and his two brothers still had classes every day. It had snowed hard for three nights, but Henry's ninth birthday was clear, perfect for sled riding. To his delight, despite the hard times, he was given a beautiful new sled made by his father. Excited by the thought of sledding on the Common, which had the best hills in Boston, Henry and his brothers took their sleds to school. Their sister, Kate, met them at lunchtime with corn bread, apple jam, and her own sled. Together, they hurried to the Common -- only to find that British troops had put their tents and cooking fires right in the middle of the sled runs. But Henry was determined to try his new sled. Could he find a way? Based on the local lore of Boston, this tale of a courageous boy gives a rich picture of colonial life at a troubled time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PL03PwAACAAJ&dq=Sleds+on+Boston+Common:+a+Story+From+the+American+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Ann Omnibus (1) (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SrXyAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mary+Ann+Omnibus+(1)+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Music of Santeraia: Traditional Rhythms of the Bataa Drums [With CD] (Performance in World Music Series)","description":"Revised edition of the only book to describe in detail the music and cultural context of Santeria bata drumming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZkGkzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Music+of+Santeraia:+Traditional+Rhythms+of+the+Bataa+Drums+%5BWith+CD%5D+(Performance+in+World+Music+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apt. 3","description":"In his apartment in the city, Sam hears voices, barking dogs, snoring, and all kinds of other noises.

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as  a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.  A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today s leading Steinbeck scholars. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&dq=Of+Mice+And+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Testament basis of pacifism and The relevance of an impossible ideal","description":"The author discusses the modern ethical problem of war as it relates to the Christian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xIE9AAAAYAAJ&dq=The+New+Testament+basis+of+pacifism+and+The+relevance+of+an+impossible+ideal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Dreams","description":"A groundbreaking history of the human mind told through our experience of dreams from the earliest accounts to current scientific findings and their essential role in the formation of who we are and the world we have made. What is a dream? Why do we dream? How do our bodies and minds use them? These questions are the starting point for this unprecedented study of the role and significance of this phenomenon. An inves-tigation on a grand scale, it encompasses literature, anthropology, religion, and science, articulating the essential place dreams occupy in human culture and how they functioned as the catalyst that compelled us to transform our earthly habitat into a human world. From the earliest cave paintings where Sidarta Ribeiro locates a key to humankind s first dreams and how they contributed to our capacity to perceive past and future and our ability to conceive of the existence of souls and spirits to today s cutting-edge scientific research, Ribeiro arrives at revolutionary conclusions about the role of dreams in human existence and evolution. He explores the advances that contempo-rary neuroscience, biochemistry, and psychology have made into the connections between sleep, dreams, and learning. He explains what dreams have taught us about the neural basis of memory and the transfor-mation of memory in recall. And he makes clear that the earliest insight into dreams as oracular has been elucidated by contemporary research. Accessible, authoritative, and fascinating, The Oracle of Night gives us a wholly new way to under-stand this most basic of human experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHUJEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A critical exposition of the philosophy of Leibniz,: With an appendix of leading passages,","description":"The writings of German mathematician and philosopher GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ (1646-1716) have had an incalculable impact on modern science and technology, from physics and computers to law and psychology. But not everyone is a fervent fan. At the turn of the 20th century, the great British thinker Bertrand Russell uncovered what he believed was the hypocritical secret to Leibniz's philosophy: a hidden devotion to a logic he did not reveal in his writings. Here, Russell explores Leibniz's work from this perspective, examining the premises of Leibniz's work, the questions raised by his arguments, the validity of Leibniz's proofs, problems with his \\"philosophy of matter,\\" and much more. First published in 1900, this is a replica of the 1937 second edition, and is complete with the original, extensive appendix of relevant extracts from Leibniz's work, essential for understanding Russell's critique. British philosopher and mathematician BERTRAND ARTHUR WILLIAM RUSSELL (1872-1970) won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Among his many works are Why I Am Not a Christian (1927), Power: A New Social Analysis (1938), and My Philosophical Development (1959).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nSrbtsjbHHYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXMjPwAACAAJ&dq=Electronic+Devices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blue Hills","description":"Story of a picnic in Torminster, at which each guest makes a wish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMAqAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Blue+Hills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Ears: Cultural Criticism, Essays and Obituaries","description":"All Ears collects Dennis Cooper's cultural criticism, a journalism that probes toward the meaning of this late century's culture.

In any of the one hundred and fifty sects and sub-sects of Islam, the common denominator is Allah. Who is this Allah? Much has been written on the religion of Islam and its prophet; but not much is said about the god of the religion. One reason is the assumption that the god of Islam and the God of Christianity are one and the same. When, on September 11, 2001, some Muslims carried out a well-organized attack, destroying the The World Trade Center and damaging the Pentagon, a letter of last instruction from the leaders of the terrorist network was discovered. Written in Arabic, it says their mission was a service to God. Actually this was a mistranslation. The word the terrorists used is not the Arabic word for God but Allah. The Arabic word for God is Ilah. So they believed they were working for Allah, not God. Who is this Allah? Were these terrorists extremists, or were they serving the Allah of the Qur'an? The war against terrorism goes beyond overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan or even killing Osama bin Laden. The war on terror may not be won unless we understand the Allah the terrorists say inspires them. Not all Muslims are terrorists. But the terrorists' letter, which is quoted fully in chapter three, gives great insight into the Islamic religion and the motivation for religious terrorism in the world. Why have we shied away from probing the identity of the Allah of Islam? Possibly it is because if Allah is not the God of the Bible, it would force us to face many ugly facts. For example, if Allah is the true God, and the Qur'an, Islam's sacred book, is true, then Christians can be sure they are lost, no matter how zealous they may be. The reverse would also be true. It is necessary, therefore, to provide sufficient information to enable you to determine your own verdict, and answer the question: Who is this Allah? This book will do that.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VxAvAgAAQBAJ&dq=Allah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","description":" Picaresque, properly funny, unpredictable and altogether irrepressible.

First manufactured in Great Britain in 1959, Triumph's legendary model resonates deeply with motorcycle enthusiasts worldwide who love its style, sound, performance, and undeniable coolness.

The Bonneville's story is one of successes and challenges as Triumph grew steadily in the post-World War II decades to become America's most successful \\"import\\" motorcycle marque. Triumph won every championship worth winning, owned the world speed record for fifteen years, and wooed Hollywood's hottest stars. Bonneville was Triumph s halo machine, one of the highest performance motorcycles of the 1960s. However, as competing marques eventually eclipsed the Bonneville in the 1970s, Triumph management struggled, leading first to bankruptcy and then to the demise of the company in 1983. Triumph was resurrected by British industrialist John Bloor in the late 1990s to become a twenty-first century global success story, which includes a revived and thoroughly retro-contemporary Bonneville range.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CVFjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hblLzQEACAAJ&dq=Sanity,+madness,+and+the+family+(Studies+in+existential+analysis+and+phenomenology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meetings with Remarkable Muslims: A Collection of Travel Writing","description":"Meetings with Remarkable Muslims is a collection of travel writing celebrating friendship and the chance encounters that unexpectedly enrich our lives, which shows the diversity of the modern Islamic world and the way in which it continues to inspire, bemuse and enrich the western imagination.

Inspired by her experience as a young Jewish woman from the Midwest, Fanny Herself is the story of a young woman who recognizes the unhappiness in her life and decides to risk it all for something better. Lighthearted in nature, yet serious in its ideals, Ferber s novel recalls the best of Fitzgerald in its unswerving commitment to humanity in all its beauty and heartbreak.  You could not have lived a week in Winnebago without being aware of Mrs. Brandeis.  Such a confident pronouncement proves even truer for young Fanny, whose mother is the Mrs. Brandeis in question. As the owner of Brandeis  Bazaar a successful store raised from the ashes of her deceased husband s chronic mismanagement Molly Brandeis is a deeply serious woman who wants nothing but the best for her daughter. Where they differ, of course, is in the definition of that deceptive superlative. While Molly wants to train her daughter to follow in her managerial footsteps, Fanny dreams of training as an artist in order to escape the confinement of small-town life. Consistently moving, frequently funny, and supremely true, Fanny Herself is an underappreciated novel from Pulitzer Prize winning author Edna Ferber. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Edna Ferber s Fanny Herself is a classic work of American literature reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XzcyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Public Philosophy","description":"In this book, Michael Sandel takes up some of the hotly contested moral and political issues of our time, including affirmative action, assisted suicide, abortion, gay rights, stem cell research, the meaning of toleration and civility, the gap between rich and poor, the role of markets, and the place of religion in public life. He argues that the most prominent ideals in our political life--individual rights and freedom of choice--do not by themselves provide an adequate ethic for a democratic society. Sandel calls for a politics that gives greater emphasis to citizenship, community, and civic virtue, and that grapples more directly with questions of the good life. Liberals often worry that inviting moral and religious argument into the public sphere runs the risk of intolerance and coercion. These essays respond to that concern by showing that substantive moral discourse is not at odds with progressive public purposes, and that a pluralist society need not shrink from engaging the moral and religious convictions that its citizens bring to public life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CKOlVEL_WY4C&dq=Public+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fair Play: The Ethics Of Sport, Second Edition","description":"Ethics in Sport, Third Edition, offers 32 essays by well-known authors.

Now available in paperback, this book explores the idea that modern, Western secular cultures have retained a belief in the concept of Hell as an event or experience of endless or unjust suffering. In the contemporary period, the descent to Hell has come to represent the means of recovering - or discovering - selfhood. In exploring these ideas, this book discusses descent journeys in Holocaust testimony and fiction, memoirs of mental illness, and feminist, postmodern and postcolonial narratives written after 1945. A wide range of texts are discussed, including writing by Primo Levi, W.G. Sebald, Anne Michaels, Alasdair Gray, and Salman Rushdie, and films such as Coppola's Apocalypse Now and the Matrix trilogy. Drawing on theoretical writing by Bakhtin, Levinas, Derrida, Judith Butler, David Harvey and Paul Ricoeur, the book addresses such broader theoretical issues as: narration and identity; the ethics of the subject; trauma and memory; descent as sexual or political dissent; the interrelation of realism and fantasy; and Occidentalism and Orientalism.Key Features*Defines and discusses what constitutes Hell in contemporary secular Western cultures*Relates ideas from psychoanalysis to literary traditions ranging from Virgil and Dante to the present*Explores the concept of Hell in relation to crises in Western thought and identity. e.g. distortions of global capitalism, mental illness, war trauma and incarceration*Explains the significance of this narrative tradition of a 'descent to hell' in the immediate political context of 9/11 and its aftermath","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V6UxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible book by book","description":"Reading the Bible doesn't need to be a difficult journey through strange and bewildering territory.

She contrasts the activism of the 1970s, the passivity of the 1980s, and the ambivalence and antipathy demonstrated toward feminism in the 1990s. These waves of change, she explains, were brought about by external forces, by generational differences among women, and by intellectual and ideological struggles within the women's movement and the larger academic culture. In tracing three decades of women's progress in the academy, the author provides data from a variety of sources on women's rank, salary, employment status, and education. The book also draws on the experience of women faculty and administrators as they articulate and reflect on the social, economic, political, and ideological contexts in which they work and the multiple influences on their professional and personal lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pTWzBcW07RwC&dq=Shattering+the+Myths:+Women+in+Academe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On My Swedish Island: Discovering the Secrets of Scandinavian Well-being","description":"An exploration of the integral relationship between nature and personal development and how this manifests itself in the Scandinavian lifestyle-from outdoor life and relaxation to design, cuisine, gardening, and herbalism.

Though they are students at the same school, they hardly know each other, so it's strange that they should disappear together. Katy's mother, self-centered and unloving, doesn't mind if her daughter never comes home. Alan's solid working-class parents are pained and puzzled by their son's departure. There's not much the police can do about runaway teenagers, but Detective Constable Charlie Peace goes through the motions. He interviews the families, he visits the school. Alan had friends and had aspired to a good education. Katy had nothing, least of all self-esteem. The two teens could be anywhere, even living dangerously on the streets of Leeds, so it's with relief that Charlie discovers them in a hostel for homeless young people. But are they safe? And who is Ben Marchant, the man who runs the shelter? Whoever he is, he seems to be doing well. Young people beg or work as street musicians during the day, then eat and sleep at the hostel at night. They can remain there two weeks and then must leave for two weeks before beginning the cycle again. Only Katy and Alan stay longer. Only they have a special, mysterious understanding with Ben. But all is not well at the shelter. Neighbors complain about strange goings-on. Residents too often display feelings of jealousy and suspicion. A young woman flees from a violent family member, perhaps bringing danger with her. Emotions run high, ranging from love and gratitude to fear and hate. One person may even hate enough to murder. One person's hate may destroy this place that some regard as a haven of peace and safety and others fear as something more complex and diabolical. No Place of Safety combines brilliant social commentary with a mesmerizing mystery plot that will once again enthrall Robert Barnard's legion of fans. Recognized as one of the best of all contemporary crime writers, Barnard is in top form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dGXq_Ua084sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus Collection - At Table with Jesus","description":"Jesus used food and mealtimes to build community and to teach about the Father, Son and Kingdom.

In 2001, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a press release to the American public containing some disturbing statistics: 14 percent of teenagers and 13 percent of children were overweight or obese. This skyrocketing figure is associated with increases in high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, as well as higher obesity figures in the adult population. In response to the growing crisis affecting America's youth, Frances M. Berg, MS, LN, brings her lifetime of knowledge to bear on the problem of obesity in children and teens in the groundbreaking book Underage and Overweight: America's Childhood Obesity Epidemic. Studies and statistics prove that diets and exercise regimens don't work on children and teens; instead, they can lead to eating disorders, malnutrition, and increased weight gain in the long run. More than a diet and exercise plan, Underage and Overweight encourages families to promote a more active lifestyle and provide healthier food choices, rather then prescribing aerobics and limiting portions.

Yet in many parts of East Asia over the past century, an additional flavor has entered the culinary lexicon: umami, a fifth taste impression that is savory, complex, and wholly distinct. Combining culinary history with recent research into the chemistry, preparation, nutrition, and culture of food, Mouritsen and Styrb?k encapsulate what we know to date about the concept of umami, from ancient times to today. Umami can be found in soup stocks, meat dishes, air-dried ham, shellfish, aged cheeses, mushrooms, and ripe tomatoes, and it can enhance other taste substances to produce a transformative gustatory experience. Researchers have also discovered which substances in foodstuffs bring out umami, a breakthrough that allows any casual cook to prepare delicious and more nutritious meals with less fat, salt, and sugar.

So why cooperate? In The Evolution of Cooperation, political scientist Robert Axelrod seeks to answer this question. In 1980, he organized the famed Computer Prisoners Dilemma Tournament, which sought to find the optimal strategy for survival in a particular game. Over and over, the simplest strategy, a cooperative program called Tit for Tat, shut out the competition. In other words, cooperation, not unfettered competition, turns out to be our best chance for survival. A vital book for leaders and decision makers, The Evolution of Cooperation reveals how cooperative principles help us think better about everything from military strategy, to political elections, to family dynamics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GxRo5hZtxkEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","description":"In this concise text, the distinguished American philosopher John Dewey compiled excerpts from the massive Progress and Poverty to provide those unfamiliar with Henry George's work with the essence of the author's thinking on economics.

Is it education? Is it money? Is it something beyond the understanding of humans? Does it require certain skills? Is it just hard work? Is it just a matter of being at the right place in the right time? Is it because they had the right people to guide them? If you have been asking yourself these questions, then you are in the right place. While it is true that almost all the things mentioned above are true to some extent, no one can deny that it takes more than sheer luck to become a success. It requires a lot of hard work. It requires a lot of focus, planning, and management. It requires learning and education. It requires availing oneself of the right opportunities. Success also involves the willingness to take risks and make challenging decisions at the right time and in the right place. Success requires getting rid of negative attitudes and replacing them with positive ones. It requires you to be open to new challenges that take you beyond your comfort zone. Success also requires a person to be constantly learning, changing, adapting, innovating, and keeping up with the times. While all this is easier said than done, it is definitely not an impossible task. If you want to be successful, you need to adopt the habits of successful people. The list of good habits is virtually endless and may vary from one individual to the other. But here in this guide, we will be discussing the 10 best habits that can put you on the road to success.

Published fifty years ago, a time when being gay was illegal in 49 out of 50 states, Joseph Hansen s first Dave Brandstetter novel shattered stereotypes and redefined the Private Eye novel as we know it. Five decades after its original landmark publication, Joseph Hansen s Fadeout is as fresh and important as ever. Preceded only by a handful of gay protagonists in crime fiction, Hansen s Dave Brandstetter, a ruggedly handsome World War II vet with a quick wit, faultless moral compass, and endless confidence, shattered stereotypes and won over a large reading audience, a feat previously considered impossible for queer fiction. Set in the mid-1960s, Fadeout centers on the disappearance of a southern California radio personalitynamed Fox Olson. A failed writer, Olson finally found success as a beloved folksinger and wholesome country raconteur with a growing national audience. The community is therefore shocked when Olson s car is found wrecked, having been driven off a bridge and swept away in a fast-moving arroyo on a rainy night. A life insurance claim is filed by Olson s widow and the company holding the policy sends their best man to investigate. The problem is that Olson s body was never found. Not in the car. Not further down the river. As Dave Brandstetter begins his investigation he quickly finds that none of it adds up.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZNA0EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The long way back","description":"On February 16 2016, motorcycle adventurer Charley Boorman suffered a major road traffic accident in Portugal. Having spent the better part of his life on some form of motorbike, his world came crashing down after he was knocked off a Triumph Tiger Explorer, smashing his right ankle and causing severe damage to his left fibia and tibia. It was unclear if he would ever walk properly again, let alone ride a motorbike. Moving between past and present, Long Way Back recounts Charley's journey back of recovery, the ambulance ride, the numerous operations in a Portuguese hospital, the medivac aircraft flight back to London. In alternating chapters, as his inability to walk for several months provokes introspection, Boorman recounts his childhood, where his passion for motorbikes began, and the formative influences in his life - from his father, a touring film director, to his long-time friend Ewan McGregor, and Sean Connery's son Jason, who first introduced him to bikes. As Charley struggles to cope with this potentially life-changing situation, it is these touchstones who will give him strength on the long way back to health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5fennQAACAAJ&dq=The+long+way+back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Solar System and Back","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Enough is Enough","description":"You need to get to safety.

Art Nouveau buildings are unique, audacious and inspirational. Rejecting historic styles, considered inappropriate for an era driven by progress, architects and designers sought a new vocabulary of architectural forms. Their vision was shaped by modern materials and innovative technologies, including iron, glass and ceramics. A truly democratic style, Art Nouveau transformed life on the eve of the twentieth century and still captivates our imaginations today. Beautifully illustrated, this book explains how the new style came into being, its rationale and why it is known by so many different names: French Art Nouveau, German Jugendstil, Viennese Secession, Catalan Modernisme, Italian Liberty and Portuguese Arte Nova. It covers the key architects and designers associated with the style; Victor Horta in Brussels, Hector Guimard in Paris, Antoni Gaudi on Barcelona, Otto Wagner in Vienna, Odon Lechner in Budapest and Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow. There are detailed descriptions and stunning photographs of buildings to be found in Brussels, Paris, Nancy, Darmstadt, Vienna, Budapest, Barcelona, Milan, Turin and Aveiro.

This comprehensive \\"catalog of catalogs\\" is now available in its newly updated Third Edition, which lists 280 nurseries that offer nearly 6,000 varieties of fruits, berries, and nuts-everything from apples and bananas to tangerines and walnuts. There's nothing sexy here, no color photographs or quaint illustrations. But the information presented in this book is so unique and invaluable that fruit growers everywhere will turn to it again and again, looking for sources that offer rare nineteenth-century apples, or for descriptions of newly bred grapes, or even for unusual varieties of tropical fruits. Where else could you find sources for Maiden Blush apple (1817), African Rhino Horn banana, Leningrad Giant currant, Adriatic fig, Pineapple grape, Dr. Beaumont macadamia, Choctaw pecan, or Yellow Egg plum? Backyard and commercial growers concerned with the loss of biodiversity will deeply appreciate the Fruit, Berry and Nut Inventory. Fruit breeders, plant collectors, and amateur growers can quickly tell which varieties are being offered by only one or two companies and need to be purchased, while sources still exist, and permanently maintained to prevent being lost forever. Everything commercially available can be scanned to find varieties perfect for specific climates, or resistant to local diseases and pests. Northern and high-altitude growers can use the book to find exceptionally hardy, short-season varieties that will survive and mature in their locations. Orchards, nurseries, and botanical gardens can use it to find sources for unique plant material. The fruits, berries, and nuts available today are the result of centuries of collection and amateur development, further refined by the world's finest breeding programs. Growers and breeders have developed regionally adapted varieties with superior taste, disease resistance, and countless other virtues.

The Queen of Persia is not an exotic figure but a fierce Ohio farmwife who presides over a household of daughters and granddaughters. The novel tells their stories through the eyes of the youngest members of the family, four cousins who spend summers on the farm, for them both a life-giving Eden and the source of terrible discoveries about desire and loss. The girls bicker and scrap, they whisper secrets at bedtime, and above all, they observe the kinds of women their mothers are and wonder what kind of women they will become. But always present is the family s great trauma, the decline and eventual death from cancer of Gram s daughter Grace. A powerful story about family ties and tensions, During the Reign of the Queen of Persia is also a book about place, charting the transformation of the old hardscrabble Midwest into the commercial wilderness of modern America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PcBvDwAAQBAJ&dq=During+the+Reign+of+the+Queen+of+Persia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Researching the Small Enterprise (Sage Series in Management Research)","description":"Although there are plenty of books devoted to small business and management research, few give much attention to the small enterprise.

Anise Wise loves three things: baking, potion making, and reading her spellbooks in blissful silence. She might not be the most powerful witch, but enchantment is a rare skill, and her ability to bake with magic is even rarer. Too bad no one wants witchcraft on their campus. Anise s dream of attending pastry school crumbles with rejection letter after rejection letter.

A principal aim of this volume follows from these interconnected ways of considering landscape: the conventional, Western notion of 'landscape' may be used as productive point of departure from which to explore analgous ideas; local ideas can in turn reflexively by used to interrogate the Western construct.The Introduction argues that landscape should be conceptualized as a cultural process: a process located between place and space, inside and outside, image and representation. In the chapters that follow, nine noted anthropologists and an art historian exemplify this approach, drawing on a diverse set of case studies. These range from an analysis of Indian calendar art to an account of Israeli nature tourism, and from the creation of a metropolitan \\"gaze\\" in nineteenth-century Paris to the soundscapes particular to the Papua New Guinea rainforests. The anthropological perspectives developed here are of cross-disciplinary relevance; geographers, art historians, and archaeologists will be no less interested than anthropologists in this re-envisaging of the notion of landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KgdhQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Anthropology+of+Landscape:+Perspectives+on+Place+and+Space+(Oxford+Studies+in+Social+and+Cultural+Anthropology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Orange Tree","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Engineering Circuit Analysis with Replacement CD ROM","description":"This classic text has been thoroughly revised by a new co-author, Steve Durbin of University of Canterbury.

And what she wanted was  little Gloria.  The leading characters: Gloria Morgan, who was one of the fabled Morgan Twins (invented by society reporter  Cholly  Knickerbocker as the quintessential Caf  Society beauties) and who, as a shy, stammering eighteen-year-old, living on nothing a year, did what she was raised to do, becoming the wife of . . . Reggie Vanderbilt, at forty-three a worn-out alcoholic who had managed to go through almost $25 million in fourteen years and who died only two years after his marriage to Gloria, leaving his beautiful young widow nothing but their baby, their baby s untouchable trust fund, and the Vanderbilt name . . . Gloria Morgan s twin, Thelma, who, as Lady Furness, was for years the mistress of the Prince of Wales (until she introduced him to her  best friend  Wallis Simpson) . . . Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Reginald s sister, a formidable Society woman, a sculptor and the founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art, a woman who conformed on the surface to everything expected of American royalty and yet lived a hidden second life as a passionate bohemian . . . And the child little Gloria herself shunted out of her mother s life, carted around Europe, depending for her existence on her neurotically overprotective nurse, Dodo, who never left her for a single day, and her mad Morgan grandmother, who insisted that her own daughter might murder the child for the Vanderbilt millions. Deserted,  dressed in rags,  neglected, she became an almost mythic incarnation of  the poor little rich girl.  This child, who was to grow up to become a world-famous fashion designer, her name Gloria Vanderbilt a household word. We come to understand and care about this child as we observe, close up, the astonishing lives and intrigues surrounding her. We see her at the age of ten brought to the courthouse, rushed through mobs of spectators, reporters, photographers. We follow a courtroom drama of sensation after sensation, the judge ultimately banning both public and press, the final scandalous testimony reaching to the heart of the English royal family. We listen to the parade of witnesses servants, millionaires, society celebrities, aristocrats, family retainers. We watch the judge himself a classic Tammany pol becoming another of the many victims of the case, reviled on all sides. And finally we see little Gloria pushed to choose between her mother and her aunt, making the decision that will affect her whole life with nobody ever asking her the basic question,  Why are you afraid?  For the first time, the thousands of pages of documents and sealed court testimony have been unearthed and explored. Hundreds of people have been interviewed. And a writer completely knowing about society and the period has used all this material to create a compelling narrative of vitality, resonance, and fascination. Combining her extraordinary abilities as an investigative reporter with the skills and sensitivity of a novelist, Barbara Goldsmith has given us a galvanizing story, a whole world of astonishing emotional and social circumstances, unforgettably revealed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QPaQNMkgYwwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fallen Flower","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Treating Sexual Shame: A New Map for Overcoming Dysfunction, Abuse, and Addiction","description":"In therapy, as in the world at large, sexuality is different from other issues because of the culturally imposed secrecy and shame that inhibit open, non-defended talk about it.

Given that it's not only affluent women who turn to nannies anymore, this arrangement is also a watershed in the history of women's rights. Women now have choices. And therein lies the problem. Having choices has forced women to confront their feelings about motherhood and work, and to make difficult decisions requiring wrenching sacrifice. It's a murky, ambivalent time, and nowhere is that ambivalence more acutely expressed than in a working mother's relationships with her children's nanny, who serves such a precious function in the private space that is the family home. Lucy Kaylin, an experienced journalist who has interviewed prominent newsmakers of every stripe, isn't afraid to ask the tough questions to get to the heart of this complex relationship. She looks at the nanny/mother relationship from both sides. As a working mother who hired a babysitter of her own, she knows the process intimately. Kaylin exposes both the great joys and the difficult emotional issues that play out when working women invite perfect strangers into their homes to help care for their children. Lucy Kaylin is the executive editor of Marie Claire. She was a senior writer for GQ and is the author of For the Love of God. She lives in New York with her husband and two children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UrWHwwSZgDMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greece 1971","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=epMSGMkyaiAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Steps of the Master","description":"Here, in the spirit of Bruce Feiler's beloved bestseller Walking the Bible, is a portrait of the Holy Land as a physical embodiment of faith.

L'auteur y inclut des th mes relevant de l'esth tique tels que l'art, la beaut , la jeunesse, la morale, l'h donisme, etc. Le roman est fantastique, mais aussi philosophique, et met en lumi re la personnalit   quivoque du dandy irlandais ainsi que le courant d cadentiste, ce qui suscite de virulents  changes de lettres entre Wilde et plusieurs journaux tr s critiques jugeant l'?uvre \\"r pugnante\\". C'est  galement l'unique roman de Wilde dans toute sa carri re. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" (1891), by Oscar Wilde, was first published as a serial story in the July 1890 issue of \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". As submitted by Wilde to the magazine, the editors feared the story was indecent, and deleted five hundred words before publication   without Wilde's knowledge. Despite that censorship, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press. Wilde revised and expanded the magazine edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" (1890) for publication as a novel; the book edition (1891) featured an aphoristic preface   an apologia about the art of the novel and the reader. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own literary right, as social and cultural criticism. In April 1891, the editorial house Ward, Lock and Company published the revised version of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". The only novel written by Wilde, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" exists in two versions, the 1890 magazine edition and the 1891 book edition, the story he submitted for serial publication in \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". As literature of the 19th century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an example of Gothic fiction with strong themes interpreted from the legendary \\"Faust\\".","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ImZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Machine Embroidery (Creative Machine Arts)","description":"Provides information on design transfer, applique, basic and advanced embroidery techniques, automatic stitches, machine accessories, special fabrics, and lettering, and includes a dozen project ideas","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PEVBAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Machine+Embroidery+(Creative+Machine+Arts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rumble in the Jungle (Big Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Volume 5, July 5 to December 27, 1942","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Colors of the Rainbow : About Life and the Beauty of Living","description":"Synopsis The Colors of the Rainbow is an inspiring collection of one womans opinions, experiences, and world perceptions.

Its epitaph may well prove to be: \\"Great was its fall.\\" Earnhart says, \\"For this reason it is the more urgent that we look often and carefully at the one sermon of God's Son which perhaps more than any other defines the very essence of the kingdom of heaven. Here, if we listen humbly, our lives can be transformed, our spirits refreshed, our souls saved.\\" Few preachers of our generation have studied the Sermon on the Mount as intensively or spoken on its contents so frequently and effectively as Paul Earnhart. His excellent and very readable written analysis appeared first as a series of articles in Christianity Magazine. By popular demand it was published in a single volume in 1999. Now, DeWard Publishing Company is thrilled to make this wonderful material available again so that it will continue to be preserved, circulated, and read by those who would not have otherwise had access to it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4MQfPwAACAAJ&dq=Invitation+to+a+spiritual+revolution:+Studies+in+the+Sermon+on+the+mount&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The transportation revolution, 1815-1860 (The Economic history of the United States)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHonAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+transportation+revolution,+1815-1860+(The+Economic+history+of+the+United+States)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADO.NET: From Novice to Pro, Visual Basic .NET Edition","description":"The author shows developers with litte or no ADO.NET background how to apply ADO.NET fast to real world scenarios by giving examples and code that really works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u-srzQEACAAJ&dq=ADO.NET:+From+Novice+to+Pro,+Visual+Basic+.NET+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Boat: A Memoir of Adoption","description":"The Baby Boat resonates with the joys and sorrows adoptive parents face.

B. Jackson Prize from the Association of American Geographers Three centuries ago, the Los Angeles River meandered through marshes and forests of willow and sycamore. Trout spawned in its waters and grizzly bears roamed its shores. The bountiful environment the river helped create supported one of the largest concentrations of Indians in North America. Today, the river is made almost entirely of concrete. Chain-link fence and barbed wire line its course. Shopping carts and trash litter its channel. Little water flows in the river most of the year, and nearly all that does is treated sewage and oily street runoff. On much of its course, the river looks more like a deserted freeway than a river. The river's contemporary image belies its former character and its importance to the development of Southern California. Los Angeles would not exist were it not for the river, and the river was crucial to its growth. Recognizing its past and future potential, a potent movement has developed to revitalize its course. The Los Angeles River offers the first comprehensive account of a river that helped give birth to one of the world's great cities, significantly shaped its history, and promises to play a key role in its future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC&dq=The+Los+Angeles+River:+Its+Life,+Death,+and+Possible+Rebirth+(Creating+the+North+American+Landscape)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reaching for Rainbows: Resources for Creative Worship","description":"Ann Weem's litanies & poems are ideal for individuals looking for devotional readings to use privately or share with a group.

Even under the protestantism of the reformed Church, the spiritual and social dramas of birth, marriage, and death were graced with elaborate ceremony. Powerful and controversial protocols were in operation, shaped and altered by the influences of the Reformation, the Revolution, and the Restoration. Each of the major rituals was potentially an arena for argument, ambiguity, and dissent. Ideally, as classic rites of passage, these ceremonies worked to bring people together. But they also set up traps into which people could stumble, and tests which not everybody could pass. In practice, ritual performance revealed frictions and fractures that everyday local discourse attempted to hide or to heal. Using fascinating first-hand evidence, David Cressy shows how the making and remaking of ritual formed part of a continuing debate, sometimes strained and occasionally acrimonious, which exposed the raw nerves of society in the midst of great historical events. In doing so, he vividly brings to life the common experiences of living and dying in Tudor and Stuart England.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DrMyGQGmwmoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hilltop on the Marne: Being Letters Written June 3-September 8, 1914","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8SAuAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snoopy's Love Book","description":"Snoopy writes love letters and romantic fiction, and Charlie Brown and his friends celebrate Valentine's Day and cope with unrequited love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=46IpHQAACAAJ&dq=Snoopy%27s+Love+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost","description":"Edited with an introduction and notes by John Leonard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MhX6bAUUbZYC&dq=Paradise+Lost&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educational Thought and Ideology in Modern Japan: State Authority and Intellectual Freedom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G8u4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Educational+Thought+and+Ideology+in+Modern+Japan:+State+Authority+and+Intellectual+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buying Stocks Without Money","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XMqVPQAACAAJ&dq=Buying+Stocks+Without+Money&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dying, Death, and Bereavement","description":"Using a social-psychological approach, the new edition of this book remains solidly grounded in theory and research, while also providing useful information to help individuals examine their own feelings about-and cope with-death and grieving.

Deep Cuba recounts Bill Belleville's month-long journey around the island in the company of American and Cuban marine biologists and a Discovery Channel film crew. It was the first, and so far only, United States submersible research expedition in Cuban waters. From coral reefs to mangrove swamps to a submerged volcanic mountain, the voyagers encountered sublimely wild places unseen before by anyone from the United States or even by many Cubans. Belleville conveys the tempo of the scientists' workday, during which the routine gathering of data and specimens could be punctuated by trips in a state-of-the-art submersible, the discovery of new species, or a tropical storm. Throughout the trip, as well, all on board had to work through differences that arose from the expedition's contrary goals: to produce a commercially viable seagoing adventure film and to conduct controlled, methodical scientific investigations. Belleville paces his coverage of the expedition with absorbing stories about the history and culture of the island's peoples, from the indigenous Taino to its current inhabitants of African and European heritage. Deep Cuba even includes a candid portrait of Castro himself. An avid diver, sport fisherman, and naturalist, El Comandante paid a visit aboard the research vessel. Deep Cuba is an engaging mix of nature and travel writing, along with scientific reportage that is keenly attuned to current crises in research funding. Revealed here is a magnificent marine world with crucial ecological links to the Caribbean Basin and the southeastern United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t0VaDgAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Cuba:+The+Inside+Story+of+an+American+Oceanographic+Expedition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Most Difficult Business Letters You'll Ever Have to Write, Fax, or E-Mail, T","description":"The 100 Most Difficult Business Letters You'll Ever Have to Write, Fax, or E-Mail could well be the most useful book you'll ever own.

Is anyone there?\\" before turning his boat back towards England. Tradition tells us that the dramatic events of the evacuation of Dunkirk, in which 300,000 BEF servicemen escaped the Nazis, was a victory gained from the jaws of defeat. For the first time, rather than telling the tale of the 300,000 who escaped, Sean Longden reveals the story of the 40,000 men sacrificed in the rearguard battles. On the beaches and sand dunes, besides the roads and amidst the ruins lay the corpses of hundreds who had not reached the boats. Elsewhere, hospitals full of the sick and wounded who had been left behind to receive treatment from the enemy's doctors. And further afield - still fighting hard alongside their French allies - was the entire 51st Highland Division, whose war had not finished as the last boats slipped away. Also scattered across the countryside were hundreds of lost and lonely soldiers. These 'evaders' had also missed the boats and were now desperately trying to make their own way home, either by walking across France or rowing across the channel. The majority, however, were now prisoners of war who were forced to walk on the death marches all the way to the camps in Germany and Poland, where they were forgotten until 1945.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jw3BBAAAQBAJ&dq=Dunkirk.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sinister Street (Penguin Modern Classics)","description":"Michael Fane arrives in the thin red house in Carlington Road to his new family of Nurse, Cook, Annie the housemaid, his younger sister Stella, and the occasional presence of Mother. From here, the novel follows the next twenty years of his life as he tries to find his place in the upper echelons of Edwardian society, through prep school, studies at Oxford, and his emergence into the wide world. The setting is rich in period detail, and the characters portrayed are vivid and more nuanced in their actions and stories than first impressions imply. Sinister Street was an immediate critical success on publication, although not without some worry for its openness to discuss less salubrious scenes, and it was a favourite of George Orwell and John Betjeman. Compton Mackenzie had attended both St. James  school and St. Mary s College at Oxford and the novel is at least partly autobiographical, but for the same measure was praised as an accurate portrayal of that experience; Max Beerbohm said  There is no book on Oxford like it. It gives you the actual Oxford experience.  Although originally published in two volumes (in 1913 and 1914) for commercial reasons, the two form a single novel and have been brought back together again for this edition.

Though the book is not intended as a general course in neural networks, no background in neural works is assumed and all models are presented from the ground up.

Other network models with strong performance records are also included. Bound in the book is an IBM diskette that includes the source code for all programs in the book.

She concludes that women, acting in their legitimate sphere, were more likely than men to exhibit true piety. Based on the promise of Joel 2:28, restated by Peter at Pentecost in Acts 2:17-18, Phoebe takes God at his Word.

Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=Reload:+Rethinking+Women+++Cyberculture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audio CD's to Accompany Quest L/S Bk 3","description":"A New York Times Best Seller A February IndieNext Pick Named A Most Anticipated Book of 2019 by Buzzfeed, Nylon, The A. V. Club, CBC Books, and The Rumpus. And a Winter's Most Anticipated Book by Vanity Fair and The Week Starred Reviews: Kirkus and Booklist \\"Warm, immediate and intensely personal.\\" New York Times How does one pay homage to A Tribe Called Quest? The seminal rap group brought jazz into the genre, resurrecting timeless rhythms to create masterpieces such as The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders. Seventeen years after their last album, they resurrected themselves with an intense, socially conscious record, We Got It from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service, which arrived when fans needed it most, in the aftermath of the 2016 election. Poet and essayist Hanif Abdurraqib digs into the group s history and draws from his own experience to reflect on how its distinctive sound resonated among fans like himself. The result is as ambitious and genre-bending as the rap group itself. Abdurraqib traces the Tribe's creative career, from their early days as part of the Afrocentric rap collective known as the Native Tongues, through their first three classic albums, to their eventual breakup and long hiatus. Their work is placed in the context of the broader rap landscape of the 1990s, one upended by sampling laws that forced a reinvention in production methods, the East CoastWest Coast rivalry that threatened to destroy the genre, and some record labels  shift from focusing on groups to individual MCs. Throughout the narrative Abdurraqib connects the music and cultural history to their street-level impact. Whether he s remembering The Source magazine cover announcing the Tribe s 1998 breakup or writing personal letters to the group after bandmate Phife Dawg s death, Abdurraqib seeks the deeper truths of A Tribe Called Quest; truths that like the low end, the bass are not simply heard in the head, but felt in the chest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1XV-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grammaire Francaise","description":"Une grammaire du fran?ais d'aujourd'hui, claire, concr te, syst matique, int grant les acquis de la linguistique moderne.

They are divided into ten sections called Centuries (which refers to the number of verses in each section, not to a unit of 100 years). The Centuries were published in 1555 and 1558, and have been in print continuously ever since. Nostradamus had the visions which he later recorded in verse while staring into water or flame late at night, sometimes aided by herbal stimulants, while sitting on a brass tripod. The resulting quatrains (four line verses) are oblique and elliptical, and use puns, anagrams and allegorical imagery. Most of the quatrains are open to multiple interpretations, and some make no sense whatsoever. Some of them are chilling, literal descriptions of events, giving specific or near- specific names, geographic locations, astrological configurations, and sometimes actual dates. It is this quality of both vagueness and specificity which allows each new generation to reinterpret Nostradamus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&dq=The+prophecies+of+Nostradamus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fall of America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Eat Away Your Impotence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PlsOAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Eat+Away+Your+Impotence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sensible Christianity","description":"Around the globe religion is under attack. Humanists, secularists and atheists depict believers as deluded and dangerous. The aim of this book is to challenge this perception. Sensible Religion defends the validity and emphasises the excitement of the religious quest across the faiths. It demonstrates that the practice of sensible religion is often a courageous path pitted against religious extremism and secularism. Written by committed believers from the major world's faiths, the book endorses the term 'sensible' as expressing religious reasonableness as well as sensitivity to criticism and new insights. Followers of the different traditions live ordinary lives in the mainstream of the world. This volume therefore addresses beliefs and the manner in which these convictions relate to social, political and ethical action. Countering the argument that religion is at root extremist and irrational, Sensible Religion brings together thoughtful and critical reflections by leading thinkers about humanity's spiritual quest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PbTeCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yorktown Campaign and the Surrender of Cromwallis, 1781","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rWwFAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wings Bestsellers: Robert Parker: A New Collection of Three Complete Spenser Novels","description":"A mystery fan's collection of three works by the best-selling Robert Parker features the wisecracking, pizza-and-beer-consuming detective Spenser in The Godwulf Manuscript, Mortal Stakes, and Promised Land.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Z8MAAAACAAJ&dq=Wings+Bestsellers:+Robert+Parker:+A+New+Collection+of+Three+Complete+Spenser+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chance of a Lifetime","description":"The Harmony novels are  Jodi Thomas all the way super characters [and] lots of riveting subplots. * Now the New York Times bestselling author takes us back to Harmony, Texas, where big dreams are brewing and anything and everything is possible  Emily, the local librarian, has started a writing group, but as the group stumbles through both the fiction and reality of their lives, they re learning much more than how to write.

Though there may be a great many things that divide the country, the love of hockey is perhaps its single greatest unifier. Before the latest labour unrest in the National Hockey League (NHL), however, it was easy to forget that hockey is also a multi-million dollar business run, not by the athletes or coaches, but by corporate boards and businessmen. The Lords of the Rinks documents the early years of hockey s professionalization and commercialization and the emergence of a fledgling NHL, from 1875 to 1936. As the popularity of hockey grew in Canada in the late nineteenth century, so too did its commercial aspects, and players, club directors, rink owners, fans, and media had developed deep emotional, economic, and ideological interests in the sport. Disagreement came in the ways and means of how organized hockey, especially at the elite level, should be managed. Hence, some coordination, by way of governing bodies, was required to maintain a semblance of order. These early administrative bodies tried to maintain a structure that would help to coordinate the various interests, set up standards of behaviour, and impose mechanisms to detect and punish violators of governance. In 1917, the NHL held its first games and by 1936 had become the dominant governing body in professional hockey. Having performed extensive research in the NHL archives  including league meeting minutes, letters, memos, telegrams, as well as gate receipt reports  John Chi-Kit Wong traces the commercial roots of hockey and argues that, in its organized form, the sport was rarely if ever without some commercial aspects despite labels such as amateur and professional. The Lords of the Rinks is the only truly comprehensive and scholarly history of the league and the business of hockey.

By June of that year, he had shown it to Thomas Wolsey, but it remained private until three years later, when the earlier manuscript became the first two chapters of the Assertio, the rest consisting of new material relating to Luther's De Captivitate Babylonica. It is believed that Thomas More was involved in the composition of the piece. Author J. J. Scarisbrick describes the work as \\"one of the most successful pieces of Catholic polemics produced by the first generation of anti-Protestant writers.\\" It went through some twenty editions in the sixteenth century and, as early as 1522, had appeared in two different German translations. It was dedicated to Pope Leo X, who rewarded Henry with the title Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) in October 1521 (a title revoked following the king's break with the Catholic Church in the 1530s, but re-awarded to his heir by the English Parliament).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDq-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden cities of to-morrow","description":"Reproduction of the original: Garden Cities of To-morrow by Ebenezer Howard","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cvf0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Garden+cities+of+to-morrow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced SOAP for Web Development","description":"This is the first book in the .NET for Developers book series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aABTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Advanced+SOAP+for+Web+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Longarm 330: Longarm and the Apache War","description":"Longarm s settling a war on his terms.

Yet the role that memory plays in C and C++ programming is a subject often overlooked in courses and in books because it requires specialised knowledge of operating systems, compilers, computer architecture in addition to a familiarity with the languages themselves. Most professional programmers learn entirely through experience of the trouble it causes. This 2004 book provides students and professional programmers with a concise yet comprehensive view of the role memory plays in all aspects of programming and program behaviour. Assuming only a basic familiarity with C or C++, the author describes the techniques, methods, and tools available to deal with the problems related to memory and its effective use.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gGYK1brqPeEC&dq=Memory+as+a+Programming+Concept+in+C+and+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holt Science and Technology: Life Science","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2cUAAAACAAJ&dq=Holt+Science+and+Technology:+Life+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girl from the Diadem","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IvNqmgEACAAJ&dq=The+Girl+from+the+Diadem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Durable Fire","description":"In the first years of Kenyan independence, three young women return to the East African highlands where they shared a carefree childhood.

As a young scientist studying natural history, Charles Darwin set out on the HMS Beagle for a five-year voyage that would bring him in contact with animal species, plant species, and rock formations all over the world. This voyage established him as an eminent geologist, and his publication of his journal of the voyage established him as a well-known popular author. After continued, careful studying of his findings from his trip around the world, he published one of the most controversial books of history The Origin of Species which opposed the church s theory that all species had come into existence at the time of the Creation. Darwin on Evolution contains quotes and wisdom from The Origin of Species, as well as from his other publications, pertaining to his theories of evolution and natural selection. Readers young and old alike will have the opportunity to learn more about his theories while also taking away important life lessons. As Darwin says,  In the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.

For some people their closest relationships may be with their pets. In the wake of the animal rights movement, some ethicists have started to re-examine this relationship, and to question the rights of humans to \\"own\\" other sentient beings in this way. In this engaging and thought-provoking book, Stephen Webb brings a Christian perspective to bear on the subject of our responsibility to animals, looked at through the lens of our relations with pets--especially dogs. Webb argues that the emotional bond with companion animals should play a central role in the way we think about animals in general, and--against the more extreme animal liberationists--defends the intermingling of the human and animal worlds. He tries to imagine what it would be like to treat animals as a gift from God, and indeed argues that not only are animals a gift for us, but they give to us; we need to attend to their giving and return their gifts appropriately. Throughout the book he insists that what Christians call grace is present in our relations with animals just as it is with other humans. Grace is the inclusive and expansive power of God's love to create and sustain relationships of real mutuality and reciprocity, and Webb unfolds the implications of the recognition that animals too participate in God's abundant grace. Webb's thesis affirms and persuasively defends many of the things that pet lovers feel instinctively--that their relationships with their companion animals are meaningful and important, and that their pets have value and worth in themselves in the eyes of God. His book will appeal to a broad audience of thoughtful Christians and animal lovers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k5qFK0aBm2cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lemegeton, Clavicula Salomonis: Or : The Complete \\"Lesser\\" Key of Solomon the King : The Five Books : \\"the Goetia\\", \\"the Pauline Art\\", \\"the Almadel of Solomon\\", \\"the Artem Novem\\"","description":"Now you can learn from the original, most important source for magic in the Western world that has ever been published, when you get Agrippa'sThree Books of Occult Philosophy.

The primary argument has been over nature vs. nurture. Are homosexuals born that way? Dr. Clark Penrose has settled that argument with his discovery of the gay gene. Now the real controversy begins. Do parents have the right to prevent their child from being born gay? GALLANT (Gay And Lesbian Liberation And National Tolerance) is first out of the gate to file a lawsuit to stop Dr. Penrose. But they aren't the only ones. The Christian Way Organization objects to the procedure on the basis that once genetic tampering is allowed, it will never stop. Parents will be able to order up a baby like buying a new car. The fact that Dr. Penrose has found the gay gene puts the founder of CWO, Lucius Gaylord, in a quandary. He's been preaching for years that homosexuality is a sin. Can being gay really be a sin if one is born that way? Kurt Ford is an ambitious greenhorn attorney who's been chosen by the firm's senior partner to handle the Penrose case. Trouble is, Kurt Ford is gay. Does he choose to do his duty as an attorney and blindly represent his client, or does he have a bigger obligation to people of his own kind?

N. Kolmogorov","description":"This textbook presents a modern account of turbulence, one of the greatest challenges in physics. The state-of-the-art is put into historical perspective five centuries after the first studies of Leonardo and half a century after the first attempt by A.N. Kolmogorov to predict the properties of flow at very high Reynolds numbers. Such \\"fully developed turbulence\\" is ubiquitous in both cosmical and natural environments, in engineering applications and in everyday life. First, a qualitative introduction is given to bring out the need for a probabilistic description of what is in essence a deterministic system. Kolmogorov's 1941 theory is presented in a novel fashion with emphasis on symmetries (including scaling transformations) which are broken by the mechanisms producing the turbulence and restored by the chaotic character of the cascade to small scales. Considerable material is devoted to intermittency, the clumpiness of small-scale activity, which has led to the development of fractal and multifractal models. Such models, pioneered by B. Mandelbrot, have applications in numerous fields besides turbulence (diffusion limited aggregation, solid-earth geophysics, attractors of dynamical systems, etc). The final chapter contains an introduction to analytic theories of the sort pioneered by R. Kraichnan, to the modern theory of eddy transport and renormalization and to recent developments in the statistical theory of two-dimensional turbulence. The book concludes with a guide to further reading. The intended readership for the book ranges from first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, geosciences and engineering, to professional scientists and engineers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K-Pf7RuYkf0C&dq=Turbulence:+The+Legacy+of+A.+N.+Kolmogorov&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caliburn","description":"Im Wettlauf mit der Zeit begibt sich Daria auf die Suche nach dem sagenumwobenen Schwert Caliburn.

In this, their second of two volumes, they place particular emphasis on applying human factors principles in a book intended to serve as a practical guide, as well as an academic text. Features include: - A real 'how to' approach that serves as a companion to the previous volume: 'Risk Management and Error Reduction in Aviation Maintenance'. - Self-reports of maintenance errors used throughout to illustrate the systemic susceptibility for errors as well as to discuss corresponding solutions. - Two tools - a pre-task scorecard and a post-task scorecard - introduced as means to measure individual as well as organizational safety performance. - Interpersonal trust and professionalism explored in detail. - Ethical and procedural issues associated with collection and analysis of both qualitative as well as quantitative safety data discussed.

Black theology developed in response to widespread racism and bigotry in the Christian church and seeks to understand the social and historical experiences of African Americans in light of their Christian confession. Fields discusses sources, hermeneutics, and implications of black theology and reflects upon the function and responsibilities of black theologians. This concise, accessible introduction to black theology draws upon history, hermeneutics, culture, and scripture and will create a dialogue of respect and reconciliation between blacks and whites within the evangelical church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3NmjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Introducing+Black+Theology:+Three+Crucial+Questions+for+the+Evangelical+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","description":"Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) was the largest battle fought on the American continent. Remarkably few who study it contemplate what came after the armies marched away. Who would care for the tens of thousands of wounded? What happened to the thousands of dead men, horses, and tons of detritus scattered in every direction? How did the civilians cope with their radically changed lives? Gregory Coco's A Strange and Blighted Land. Gettysburg: The Aftermath of a Battle offers a comprehensive account of these and other issues. The late Coco was a park ranger at Gettysburg deeply interested in the battle and what was left in its wake. The Vietnam veteran who wrote well and often about the battle waxes eloquently about the carnage of war, its terrors and pain, its irreplaceable cost in human life and treasure, and the toll it took on the families who lost sons and husbands there. Arranged in a series of topical chapters, A Strange and Blighted Land begins with a tour of the battlefield, mostly through eyewitness accounts, of the death and destruction littering the sprawling landscape. Once the size and scope is exposed to readers, Coco moves on to discuss the dead of Gettysburg, North and South, how their remains were handled, and how and why the Gettysburg National Cemetery was established. The treatment of the wounded, Union and Confederate, was organized chaos. Every house and barn became of hospital or medical station, and the medical and surgical practices of the day were little short of compassionate torture. The author also discusses at length how prisoners were handled and the fate of the thousands of stragglers and deserters left behind once the armies left before concluding with the preservation efforts that culminated in the establishment of the Gettysburg National Military Park in 1895. Coco's prose is gripping, personal, and brutally honest. There is no mistaking where he comes down on the issue: There was nothing pretty or glorious or romantic about a battle--especially once the fighting ended.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v3bzswEACAAJ&dq=A+Strange+and+Blighted+Land:+Gettysburg,+The+Aftermath+of+a+Battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Changes for Samantha : A Winter Story (The American Girls Collection: Samantha Stories, Bk. 6)","description":"When she discovers that Nellie and her sisters have been sent to an orphanage, Samantha, now living with her aunt and uncle in New York City, tries to help her friends as much as she can.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PY88PgAACAAJ&dq=Changes+for+Samantha+:+A+Winter+Story+(The+American+Girls+Collection:+Samantha+Stories,+Bk.+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caribbean: The Islands","description":"Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher Lonely Planet Caribbean Islands is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

The reason Garrett Sutton s book is so important is that like it or not, debt is a powerful force in our world today.

In this beautifully written tale, a promising young politician, Grant Arliss, flees from this pressure-ridden life in New York City to the serenity of the desert's open spaces. There, he finds not only a place to sort out his confusion but also a remarkable woman, unlike any he has met. In his eyes, Dulcie Adelaid is an aloof creature of the desert who relies only on herself. Challenged and yet inhibited by the desert's unrelenting force, Arliss admires Dulcie's instinctive ability to thrive in the harsh country. She also provides a spiritual sustenance that he has never found with any other woman. Together they engage in lively conversations about his political convictions and her beliefs and values. Inspired, Arliss returns to New York where he delivers eloquent speeches to an overwhelmingly supportive constituency. Placing Cactus Thorn in biographical, feminist, and literary perspective, Melody Graulich's commentary discusses how Austin's themes are timeless in setting and moral tone. Foreword and afterword by Melody Graulich.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CEd2zAEACAAJ&dq=Cactus+Thorn+(Western+Literature+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real People","description":"This is a fun but respectful (and very comprehensive) guide to everything you ever wanted to know about wine from the creator and host of the popular podcast Wine for Normal People, described by Imbibe magazine as \\"a wine podcast for the people.\\" More than 60,000 listeners tune in every month to learn a not-snobby wine vocabulary, how and where to buy wine, how to read a wine label, how to smell, swirl, and taste wine, and so much more!

Aulen asserts that in traditional histories of the doctrine of the atonement only two views have usually been presented, the objective/Anselmian and the subjective/Aberlardian views. According to Aulen, however, there is another type of atonement doctrine in which Christ overcomes the hostile powers that hold humanity in subjection, at the same time that God in Christ reconciles the world to Himself. This view he calls the \\"classic\\" idea of the atonement. Because of its predominance in the New Testament, in patristic writings, and in the theology of Luther, Aulen holds that the classic type may be called the distinctively Christian idea of the atonement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nWyvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Time We Need","description":"Kids, It's Time We Have THE TALK because doing the sex-thing or doing the drug-thing can ruin a kid's life, but NOT doing The God-thing can ruin a kid's eternity.Using teachings from John Paul II, Fulton J.

His best-known roles include a mysterious criminal in The Mask of Dimitrios and the indolent husband in Mildred Pierce. He garnered further acclaim for his portrayal of villains in Her Kind of Man, Danger Signal, and South of St. Louis. Although he earned critical praise for his performance as a heroic tenant farmer in Jean Renoir s The Southerner, Scott never quite escaped typecasting. In Zachary Scott: Hollywood s Sophisticated Cad, Ronald L. Davis writes an appealing biography of the film star. Scott grew up in privileged circumstances his father was a distinguished physician; his grandfather was a pioneer cattle baron and was expected to follow his father into medical practice. Instead, Scott began to pursue a career in theater while studying at the University of Texas and subsequently worked his way on a ship to England to pursue acting. Upon his return to America, he began to look for work in New York. Excelling on stage and screen throughout the 1940s, Scott seemed destined for stardom. By the end of 1950, however, he had suffered through a turbulent divorce. A rafting accident left him badly shaken and clinically depressed. His frustration over his roles mounted, and he began to drink heavily. He remarried and spent the rest of his career concentrating on stage and television work. Although Scott continued to perform occasionally in films, he never reclaimed the level of stardom that he had in the mid-1940s.

If he approached the Emperor with a Bible in one hand, in the other he carried much of the accumulated technological and philosophical wisdom of the late Renaissance Europe, and thus found favour among the Mandarins, the men of learning who enjoyed high status at the Imperial Court. He learned Chinese the better to discuss with them the problems in science and technology, as also questions of religion and the hereafter. But his progress was not unopposed, for the Wise Man from the West came to be seen as an unsettling element in a too-settled society. Ricci died in 1610, disappointed in his ambition to convert the Emperor, and with him the whole of China, to Christianity. But the seed was sown and the crop, even after almost a century of atheistic communism, continues to grow in present-day China. This story of the first fully documented contact between West and East offers a fascinating insight into the history of ideas during one of the most fertile eras in European and Chinese history. Vincent Cronin has built up a reputation with his scholarly, elegantly written works of history and biography, as one of the finest popular historians of his generation.

Leadership, mission statements and planning, finances and fund raising, personnel issues, communications, and public relations all of these seemingly  secular  activities serve to build up the Body of Christ and deserve to be recognized as authentic Christian ministry.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of  normal science,  as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3eP5Y_OOuzwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hand Bone Age: A Digital Atlas of Skeletal Maturity","description":"In the past, determination of bone maturity relied on visual evaluation of skeletal development in the hand and wrist, most commonly using the Greulich and Pyle atlas.

This is the clear and urgent message of this powerful book. Based on four national surveys and drawing on more than a decade of research, Growing Up with a Single Parent sharply demonstrates the connection between family structure and a child's prospects for success. What are the chances that the child of a single parent will graduate from high school, go on to college, find and keep a job? Will she become a teenage mother? Will he be out of school and out of work? These are the questions the authors pursue across the spectrum of race, gender, and class. Children whose parents live apart, the authors find, are twice as likely to drop out of high school as those in two-parent families, one and a half times as likely to be idle in young adulthood, twice as likely to become single parents themselves. This study shows how divorce--particularly an attendant drop in income, parental involvement, and access to community resources--diminishes children's chances for well-being. The authors provide answers to other practical questions that many single parents may ask: Does the gender of the child or the custodial parent affect these outcomes? Does having a stepparent, a grandmother, or a nonmarital partner in the household help or hurt? Do children who stay in the same community after divorce fare better? Their data reveal that some of the advantages often associated with being white are really a function of family structure, and that some of the advantages associated with having educated parents evaporate when those parents separate. In a concluding chapter, McLanahan and Sandefur offer clear recommendations for rethinking our current policies. Single parents are here to stay, and their worsening situation is tearing at the fabric of our society. It is imperative, the authors show, that we shift more of the costs of raising children from mothers to fathers and from parents to society at large. Likewise, we must develop universal assistance programs that benefit low-income two-parent families as well as single mothers. Startling in its findings and trenchant in its analysis, Growing Up with a Single Parent will serve to inform both the personal decisions and governmental policies that affect our children's--and our nation's--future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kLUX8BJ1exUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Mind: A Tale of Discovery and Mistaken Identity","description":"Written in a provocative, witty, and highly accessible style, this is not only a splendid general introduction to the central questions of consciousness and brain science, but also an answer to some of them.

The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America. Free Air heads toward a West that was brimming with possibilities for suddenly mobile Americans at the end of a world war.The vehicle in Lewiss novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble. The greatest distance to be overcome is the social one between Claire and a young mechanic named Milt, who, with a cat as his traveling companion, follows close behind. If Free Air anticipates many of the themes of Lewiss later novels, it also looks forward to a genre that includes John Steinbecks Travels with Charley and Josh Greenfeld and Paul Mazurskys Harry and Tonto. And the character of Claire, blazing her own trail across the West, looks back to the nineteenth-century pioneer woman and ahead to the independent-minded movie heroines played by Katherine Hepburn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FTNMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honda and Acura Performance Handbook (Motorbooks Workshop)","description":"This new edition of Motorbooks' best-selling guide to Honda and Acura performance now delivers more and better information than ever before.

Macmillan provides a meticulous account of the historical evolution of Freud's thought and its background in Freud's contacts with the books and people that influenced him and evaluates the entirety of the Freudian system.

THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW (EDITORS  CHOICE)  [A]n extraordinary writer at her electrifying best.   PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (STARRED REVIEW) When Molly, home alone with her two young children, hears footsteps in the living room, she tries to convince herself it s the sleep deprivation. She s been hearing things these days. Startling at loud noises. Imagining the worst-case scenario. It s what mothers do, she knows. But then the footsteps come again, and she catches a glimpse of movement. Suddenly Molly finds herself face-to-face with an intruder who knows far too much about her and her family. As she attempts to protect those she loves most, Molly must also acknowledge her own frailty. Molly slips down an existential rabbit hole where she must confront the dualities of motherhood: the ecstasy and the dread; the languor and the ferocity; the banality and the transcendence as the book hurtles toward a mind-bending conclusion. In The Need, Helen Phillips has created a subversive, speculative thriller that comes to life through blazing, arresting prose and gorgeous, haunting imagery. Helen Phillips has been anointed as one of the most exciting fiction writers working today, and The Need is a glorious celebration of the bizarre and beautiful nature of our everyday lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lS-BDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holman Bible Dictionary","description":"For 25 years the Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary has been the go-to Bible reference resource for lay Bible students, teachers, pastors, academic courses, and libraries.

Henry started to write it in 1519 while he was reading Martin Luther's attack on indulgences. By June of that year, he had shown it to Thomas Wolsey, but it remained private until three years later, when the earlier manuscript became the first two chapters of the Assertio, the rest consisting of new material relating to Luther's De Captivitate Babylonica. It is believed that Thomas More was involved in the composition of the piece. Author J. J. Scarisbrick describes the work as \\"one of the most successful pieces of Catholic polemics produced by the first generation of anti-Protestant writers.\\" It went through some twenty editions in the sixteenth century and, as early as 1522, had appeared in two different German translations. It was dedicated to Pope Leo X, who rewarded Henry with the title Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) in October 1521 (a title revoked following the king's break with the Catholic Church in the 1530s, but re-awarded to his heir by the English Parliament).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDq-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hired Bride (The Fortune'S Of Texas) (Fortunes of Texas, 12)","description":"Zane Fortune wasn't looking for love.

The book uses Malaysia as a case study of the role played by foreign domestics in a rapidly industrializing Asian country. Christine Chin discusses how the state elites and the middle classes come to rationalize the demand for-and treatment of-domestic workers while pursuing the country's modernity project, designed to create a stable, developed, multiethnic society. She shows how different and competing pressures on the regional, national, and household levels leave Filipina and Indonesian domestics open to mistreatment and abuse, most directly by employment agencies and employers. Chin argues that late-twentieth-century efforts to expand open markets and establish global free trade, encourage the exploitation of transnational migrant workers, and that such exploitation should not become an acceptable part of pursuing the \\"good life.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9YXTfPliEJoC&dq=In+Service+and+Servitude&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","description":"Follows the life of six-year-old Jean-Luc during the Depression, living with his little sister and young mother after being abandoned by his con-artist father.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MyPbiSL_UPgC&dq=The+Crazyladies+of+Pearl+Street:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You Alone on Purpose?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r3FNAAAACAAJ&dq=Are+You+Alone+on+Purpose%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economic Growth of Brazil; A Survey from Colonial to Modern Times","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ajPJWhwVKqQC&dq=The+Economic+Growth+of+Brazil%3B+A+Survey+from+Colonial+to+Modern+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snowshoe Trek to Otter River","description":"Three short stories relate the adventures of twelve-year-old Daniel and his friend Seth while camping in the woods alone and together.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NDegabJEjwQC&dq=Snowshoe+Trek+to+Otter+River&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 3: Procedures and Protocols","description":"Twenty-five years of study and experience went into the making ofthis one-of-a-kind reference.

Spacecraft have since become essential to life on Earth. They perform a wide variety of useful functions, including telecommunications, navigation, exploration, mapping, environmental monitoring, scientific research, and, more recently, space tourism. The prominence of space law has grown in recent years as private companies rapidly expand their spaceflight capabilities and open new markets in outer space. With this transition, the space industry has many new opportunities and must also confront increased risks. Well thought-out laws that govern spaceflight activities minimize the risk to people and property in outer space and on the ground, while not prematurely stifling innovation.

The Campaigns of Napoleon is an exhaustive analysis and critique of Napoleon's art of war as he himself developed and perfected it in the major military campaigns of his career. Napoleon disavowed any suggestion that he worked from formula, but military historian David Chandler demonstrates this was at best only a half-truth. To be sure, every operation Napoleon conducted contained unique improvisatory features. But there were from the first to the last certain basic principles of strategic maneuver and battlefield planning that he almost invariably put into practice. To clarify these underlying methods, as well as the style of Napoleon's fabulous intellect, Mr. Chandler examines in detail each campaign mounted and personally conducted by Napoleon, analyzing the strategies employed, revealing wherever possible the probable sources of his subject's military ideas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hNYWXeVcbkMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","description":"To All the Boys I ve Loved Before is now a major motion picture streaming on Netflix!

Ellul offers a penetrating analysis of our technological civilization, showing how technology which began innocuously enough as a servant of humankind threatens to overthrow humanity itself in its ongoing creation of an environment that meets its own ends. No conversation about the dangers of technology and its unavoidable effects on society can begin without a careful reading of this book. \\"A magnificent book . . . He goes through one human activity after another and shows how it has been technicized, rendered efficient, and diminished in the process.  Harper's  One of the most important books of the second half of the twentieth-century. In it, Jacques Ellul convincingly demonstrates that technology, which we continue to conceptualize as the servant of man, will overthrow everything that prevents the internal logic of its development, including humanity itself unless we take necessary steps to move human society out of the environment that 'technique' is creating to meet its own needs.  The Nation  A description of the way in which technology has become completely autonomous and is in the process of taking over the traditional values of every society without exception, subverting and suppressing these values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all non-technological difference and variety are mere appearance.

The Option Method is a way to let go of your unhappiness through a dialogue method of self inquiry. It is a self educational tool that allows you to get to the heart of your assumptions about unhappiness and gradually see reality in a new light. It is practical, compassionate and non-ideological in nature. The fictionalized settings give a fine overview of how this method is utilized. You will see how Option could have operated with Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov and the Grand Inquisitor in particular; how it reflects itself in Tolstoy's \\"Death of Ivan Ilych,\\"; or in a lost dialogue of Plato, or in a new version of Euripides' Medea, or eavesdrop on an Option discussion with the Buddha. That and more covering themes of Death, the Meaning of History, Love, Hate, Evil etc., are brought to life in the creative setting of the Option perspective at work in the creative process, a process alive in each of us.

Does evolution tell us what is morally right and wrong, or does it imply that ultimately 'nothing' is right or wrong? In this fascinating and intriguing book, Steve Stewart-Williams addresses these and other fundamental philosophical questions raised by evolutionary theory and the exciting new field of evolutionary psychology. Drawing on biology, psychology and philosophy, he argues that Darwinian science supports a view of a godless universe devoid of ultimate purpose or moral structure, but that we can still live a good life and a happy life within the confines of this view.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KBp69los_-oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anti-Federalists and Early American Political Thought","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Workbook/Lab Manual for Dimelo tu!: A Complete Course, 5th","description":"Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jR4FAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on Wastewater Analysis and Interpretation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ben Folds - Rockin' the Suburbs: Piano/Vocal Transcriptions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sailing designs: The design reviews of Robert H.

In little more than a decade the Romanov dynasty was toppled, and its time-honored institutions repudiated. How did it happen? How could Nicholas and Alexandra, the nobility, middle class anarchists even Lenin himself not foresee the catastrophic changes that were shaking the empire? Why could nothing be done? And why were the efforts so ineffectual? Black Night, White Snow captures the rich drama of this whole period.

The pagans who reacted to biblical texts include Celsus (II C.E.), Porphyry (III C.E.), and Julian the Apostate (IV C.E.). These authors thought that if they could refute one of the primary foundations of Christianity, namely its use or interpretation of the Septuagint, then the new religion would perhaps crumble.

This book is here to help you understand the reason for your hope as a Christian so that you can see it with fresh sight and invite others into the conversation.

But they might be stuck if a stranger asked them to explain what they believe and why they believe it. Author, pastor, and theologian Mike Horton unpacks the essential and basic beliefs that all Christians share in a way that is easy to understand and applicable to our lives today. And in a way that will make you excited to be a Christian! Core Christianity covers topics like: Jesus as both fully God and fully man. The doctrine of the Trinity. The goodness of God despite a broken world. The ways God speaks. The meaning of salvation. What is the Christian calling? Includes discussion questions for individual or group use.

Is the road to Hell truly paved with good intentions? Will the world really end not with a bang, but with a whimper?

The narrator looks back on the events of the book some time after The End has occurred. \\"The book is full of ironies and symbols. The story of The End takes place over the course of seven days, an ironic parallel of The Creation. Ms. Spiller's concept of Hell is portrayed as a shattered and broken world, yet shockingly similar to the world around us in the present day. The End of the World, we find, is not caused by a nuclear holocaust, or global warming, or an incurable disease; but rather the simple but deadly combination of good intentions, and misguided decisions. \\"The concept and the story are excellent, insightful and hypnotic.

Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz, the Emerald City. But just as Dorothy, Toto, and their traveling companions discover a darker reality upon entering the green gates of the imaginary Emerald City. those who look more closely at Seattle's landscape will find that it reveals a history marked by environmental degradation and urban inequality. This book explores the role of nature in the development of the city of Seattle from the earliest days of its settlement to the present. Combining environmental history, urban history, and human geography, Matthew Klingle shows how attempts to reshape nature in and around Seattle have often ended not only in ecological disaster but also in social inequality. The price of Seattle's centuries of growth and progress has been high. Its wildlife, especially the famous Pacific salmon, and its poorest residents have paid the highest price. Klingle proposes a bold new way of understanding the interdependence between nature and culture, and he argues for what he calls an 'ethic of place.' Using Seattle as a compelling case study, he offers important insights for every city seeking to live in harmony with its natural landscape\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xDX4750sv2gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daily Guideposts, 2007","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ekmHtQEACAAJ&dq=Daily+Guideposts,+2007&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","description":"Many people seem to have it all together outwardly, but inside they are a wreck.

In 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty emerged after three years of intense international negotiations. However, after nearly a decade, there is no sign that the treaty will ever enter into force. Despite the general support for and adherence to a series of national moratoria on nuclear explosive testing, it is important to understand why the effort to achieve a permanent ban on nuclear testing has experienced such difficulties and continues to travel such a problematic road. The author of this book is neither a promoter nor a critic of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, but rather he provides a brief historical and analytical understanding of the events surrounding its negotiation and implementation. The author's analysis, based on his personal involvement in the CTBT negotiations, provides one insider's view of how the critical events unfolded and how they are likely to affect future nonproliferation initiatives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yTb2zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Comprehensive+Nuclear+Test+Ban+Treaty:+An+Insider%27s+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","description":"Produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand, information anxiety is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn't tell us what we want or need to know.

During his unprecedented twenty-seven year tenure at Warner Bros., he directed swashbuckling adventures, westerns, musicals, war epics, romances, historical dramas, horror films, tearjerkers, melodramas, comedies, and film noir masterpieces. The director's staggering output of 180 films surpasses that of the legendary John Ford and exceeds the combined total of films directed by George Cukor, Victor Fleming, and Howard Hawks. In the first biography of this colorful, instinctual artist, Alan K. Rode illuminates the life and work of one of the film industry's most complex figures. He begins by exploring the director's early life and career in his native Hungary, revealing how Curtiz shaped the earliest days of silent cinema in Europe as he acted in, produced, and directed scores of films before immigrating to the United States in 1926. In Hollywood, Curtiz earned a reputation for his explosive tantrums, his difficulty communicating in English, and his disregard for the well-being of others. However, few directors elicited more memorable portrayals from their casts, and ten different actors delivered Oscar-nominated performances under his direction. In addition to his study of the director's remarkable legacy, Rode investigates Curtiz's dramatic personal life, discussing his enduring creative partnership with his wife, screenwriter Bess Meredyth, as well as his numerous affairs and children born of his extramarital relationships. This meticulously researched biography provides a nuanced understanding of one of the most talented filmmakers of Hollywood's golden age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kIE5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white calf;: The story of Eagle Child, the Piegan boy, who found a white buffalo calf said to have been sent by the Above Ones","description":"A tale of life and adventures among the Piegan Indians in the early 1850's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WPYauQAACAAJ&dq=The+white+calf%3B:+The+story+of+Eagle+Child,+the+Piegan+boy,+who+found+a+white+buffalo+calf+said+to+have+been+sent+by+the+Above+Ones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion in Chinese society: A study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GkqUCg07JagC&dq=Religion+in+Chinese+society:+A+study+of+contemporary+social+functions+of+religion+and+some+of+their+historical+factors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Is Grandpa?","description":"As his family reminisces after his beloved grandfather's death, a boy realizes that his grandfather is still with him in all the special places they shared.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BCw0AAAACAAJ&dq=Where+Is+Grandpa%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Examkrackers McAt Biology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XmILzwEACAAJ&dq=Examkrackers+McAt+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WZZPc1FmL7QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","description":"A  vivid and extremely interesting  novel of an upper-class Chinese wife s quest for freedom, from the Nobel Prizewinning author of The Good Earth (The New Yorker).

Based on the author's extensive research and experience of education in several areas afflicted by conflict, the book explores the relationship between schooling and social conflict and looks at conflict internal to schools. It posits a direct link between the ethos of a school and the attitudes of future citizens towards 'others'. It also looks at the nature and purpose of peace education and war education, and addresses the role of gender and masculinity. In five lucid, vigorously argued sections, the author brings this thought-provoking and original piece of work to life by: * Setting out the terms of the debate, defining conflict and peace and outlining the relevant aspects of complexity theory for education * Exploring the sources of conflict and their relations to schooling in terms of gender/masculinity, pluralism, nationalism and identity * Focusing on the direct education/war interface * Examining educational responses to conflict * Highlighting conflict resolution within the school itself. This is the first time that so many aspects of conflict and education have been brought together in one sustained argument. With its crucial exposure of the currently culpable role of formal schooling in maintaining conflict, this book will be a powerful and essential read for educational policy makers, managers, teachers and researchers dealing with conflict in their own contexts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dztdFup3WVgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Isotope Effects In Chemistry and Biology","description":"The field of isotope effects has expanded exponentially in the last decade, and researchers are finding isotopes increasingly useful in their studies.

In the decades following the Civil War, nearly a quarter of African Americans achieved a remarkable victory they got their own land. While other ex-slaves and many poor whites became trapped in the exploitative sharecropping system, these independence-seeking individuals settled on pockets of unclaimed land that had been deemed too poor for farming and turned them into successful family farms. In these self-sufficient rural communities, often known as  freedom colonies,  African Americans created a refuge from the discrimination and violence that routinely limited the opportunities of blacks in the Jim Crow South. Freedom Colonies is the first book to tell the story of these independent African American settlements. Thad Sitton and James Conrad focus on communities in Texas, where blacks achieved a higher percentage of land ownership than in any other state of the Deep South. The authors draw on a vast reservoir of ex-slave narratives, oral histories, written memoirs, and public records to describe how the freedom colonies formed and to recreate the lifeways of African Americans who made their living by farming or in skilled trades such as milling and blacksmithing. They also uncover the forces that led to the decline of the communities from the 1930s onward, including economic hard times and the greed of whites who found legal and illegal means of taking black-owned land. And they visit some of the remaining communities to discover how their independent way of life endures into the twenty-first century.  Thad Sitton and James H. Conrad have made an important contribution to African American and southern history with their study of communities fashioned by freedmen in the years after emancipation.   Journal of American History  This study is a thoughtful and important addition to an understanding of rural Texas and the nature of black settlements.

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luxury Houses Country","description":"Living in the country means enjoying peace and calm far away from urban stress.

Hilarious and heartbreaking  (Daily Mail). At the age of six, Tim Guest was taken by his mother to a commune modeled on the teachings of the notorious Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The Bhagwan preached an eclectic doctrine of Eastern mysticism, chaotic therapy, and sexual freedom, and enjoyed inhaling laughing gas, preaching from a dentist's chair, and collecting Rolls Royces. Tim and his mother were given Sanskrit names, dressed entirely in orange, and encouraged to surrender themselves into their new family.

The armies of Philip H. Sheridan and Jubal A. Early contended for immense stakes. Beyond the agricultural bounty and the boost in morale a victory would bring, events in the Valley also would affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in the November 1864 presidential canvass. The eleven original essays in this volume reexamine common assumptions about the campaign, its major figures, and its significance. Taking advantage of the most recent scholarship and a wide range of primary sources, contributors examine strategy and tactics, the performances of key commanders on each side, the campaign's political repercussions, and the experiences of civilians caught in the path of the armies. The authors do not always agree with one another, yet, taken together, their essays highlight important connections between the home front and the battlefield, as well as ways in which military affairs, civilian experiences, and politics played off one another during the campaign.

As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943. When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion.

Published by Bridget Williams Books. This beautifully written story of a radical nun who founded a religious congretation sold thousands of copies when it won the Book of the Year award in the 1997 Montana Book Awards. Suzanne Aubert grew up in a French provincial family in the mid-nineteenth century. Lyon's Catholic missionary spirit brought her to live with Maori girls in war-anxious 1860s Auckland. She nursed Maori and Pakeha in Hawke's Bay as the settler population swelled. Later, living up the Whanganui River at Jerusalem, she set up New Zealand's home-grown Catholic congregation, published a significant Maori text, broke in a hill farm, manufactured medicines, and gathered babies and children through the family-fracturing years of economic depression. The turn of the century sent her windswept skirts through the streets of the capital city. There she would be a constant sign of political commitment and caring for people 'of all creeds and none' until she died in 1926.

A prolific lecturer and author, he has been at the forefront of key developments in contemporary theology, ranging from narrative theology to the  recovery of virtue.  Yet despite his prominence and the esteem reserved for his thought, his work has never before been collected in a single volume that provides a sense of the totality of his vision. The editors of The Hauerwas Reader, therefore, have compiled and edited a volume that represents all the different periods and phases of Hauerwas s work. Highlighting both his constructive goals and penchant for polemic, the collection reflects the enormous variety of subjects he has engaged, the different genres in which he has written, and the diverse audiences he has addressed. It offers Hauerwas on ethics, virtue, medicine, and suffering; on euthanasia, abortion, and sexuality; and on war in relation to Catholic and Protestant thought. His essays on the role of religion in liberal democracies, the place of the family in capitalist societies, the inseparability of Christianity and Judaism, and on many other topics are included as well. Perhaps more than any other author writing on religious topics today, Hauerwas speaks across lines of religious traditions, appealing to Methodists, Jews, Anabaptists or Mennonites, Catholics, Episcopalians, and others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IpRmx8twLAoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biographia Literaria (2 volumes)","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Firstly slaves became used for producing cloves and grains for export. Previously the slaves themselves were exported. Secondly, there was an increased international demand for luxuries such as ivory. At the same time the price of imported manufactured gods was falling. Zanzibar took advantage of its strategic position to trade as far as the Great Lakes. However this very economic success increasingly subordinated Zanzibar to Britain, with its anti-slavery crusade and its control over the Indian merchant class. Professor Sheriff analyses the early stages of the underdevelopment of East Africa and provides a corrective to the dominance of political and diplomatic factors in the history of the area.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pJYpDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It Could Happen To You: Diary Of A Pregnancy and Beyond","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Indian Country - America's Sacred Land","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What Lisa Knew: The Truth and Lies of the Steinberg Case","description":"An account of the death of Lisa Steinberg at the hands of her adoptive father examines the relationship between Joel Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum and analyzes the shocking issue of family violence in America","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2aZsP1KndqYC&dq=What+Lisa+Knew:+The+Truth+and+Lies+of+the+Steinberg+Case&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Rome","description":"Professor Sheldon uses the modern concept of the intelligence cycle to trace intelligence activities in Rome whether they were done by private citizens, the government, or the military.

What is the role of an intelligence service in a free republic? When do the security needs of the state outweigh the rights of the citizen? If we cannot trust our own security services, how safe can we be?

With his surgical intelligence, Juan Jos  Arreola exposes the shams and hypocrisies, the false values and vices, the hidden diseases of society. Confabulario total, 19411961, of which this book is a translation, combines three earlier books Varia invenci n (1949), Confabulario (1952), Punta de plata (1958) and numerous later pieces. Although some of the pieces have a noticeably Mexican orientation, most of them transcend strictly regional themes to interpret the social scene in aspects common to all civilized cultures. Arreola s view is not limited; much of his sophistication comes from his broad, deep, and varied knowledge of present and past, and from his almost casual use both of this knowledge and of his insight into its meaning for humanity. His familiarity with many little-known arts and sciences, numerous literatures, history, anthropology, and psychology, and his telling allusions to this rich lode of fact, increase the reader s delight in his learned but witty, scalding but poetic, satire.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LzKKerFthWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Visions and Other Poems (Norton Critical Editions)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Avalon (Arthurian Novel)","description":"Mad Merlin told the story from a god's point of view.

This set includes Mellencamp's songs interspersed with key dialogue from King's libretto, and while the story might be too complex -- essentially, it's the tale of two brothers involved in a murder/suicide whose ghosts haunt an isolated cabin and whose tragic deeds and consequent fate seems about to be repeated by their living nephews -- to be truly appreciated in single-disc form like this, so it's Mellencamp's songs, sung by the likes of Elvis Costello, Neko Case, Sheryl Crow, Dave and Phil Alvin (real-life brothers whose estrangement with each other ended while working on this project), Taj Mahal, Ryan Bingham, Clyde Mulroney, Rosanne Cash, and Kris Kristofferson (Mellencamp only sings on one song here, the summing-it-up last track \\"Truth\\") that are really left to carry things. They certainly work as songs, and may well be among the best Mellencamp has ever written, while the overall sound of the whole musical suite, crafted by T-Bone Burnett, is kind of like a sparse and shined-up version of a late-period Tom Waits album, due in part to the presence of multi-instrumentalist Marc Ribot on most of the tracks, and the tight, spare rhythm section of Jay Bellerose on drums and David Piltch on bass. The performances? Elvis Costello sounds gleeful and sinful on \\"That's Me\\" (identity and fulfillment are key themes of Ghost Brothers of Darkland Country, that and history's tendency to repeat itself), Neko Case is sassy and sure on \\"That's Who I Am,\\" Kris Kristofferson sounds old, wise, and weary on \\"How Many Days,\\" Taj Mahal rages through \\"Tear This Cabin Down,\\" and Sheryl Crow is confident and cocky on \\"Jukin',\\" while Rosanne Cash turns in a delicately worn and wise reading of \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" and for a story that spans decades and generations, it's obvious that everyone is singing about who they are, who they ought to be, and who they ended up becoming. It's difficult to say how good this musical is just from the songs and pieces of dialogue presented here, but the songs have a weary, inevitable flow to them, as if fate forced them into a dark room with little light or air or chance of redemption. Redemption comes with acceptance of who one is, the songs and story here seem to say, and only then can the real truth about what has happened to anyone really be revealed. It's a ghost story, after all. ~ Steve Leggett","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RBWuzT1EaE0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appleby's answer, (A Red badge novel of suspense)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QG48AQAAIAAJ&dq=Appleby%27s+answer,+(A+Red+badge+novel+of+suspense)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murdered in Central America: The Stories of Eleven U.S. Missionaries","description":"The Sisters of the Holy Family, founded in New Orleans in 1842, were the first African American Catholics to serve as missionaries. This story of their little-known missionary efforts in Belize from 1898 to 2008 builds upon their already distinguished work, through the Archdiocese of New Orleans, of teaching slaves and free people of color, caring for orphans and the elderly, and tending to the poor and needy. Utilizing previously unpublished archival documents along with extensive personal correspondence and interviews, Edward T. Brett has produced a fascinating account of the 110-year mission of the Sisters of the Holy Family to the Garifuna people of Belize. Brett discusses the foundation and growth of the struggling order in New Orleans up to the sisters' decision in 1898 to accept a teaching commitment in the Stann Creek District of what was then British Honduras. The early history of the British Honduras mission concentrates especially on Mother Austin Jones, the superior responsible for expanding the order's work into the mission field. In examining the Belizean mission from the eve of the Second Vatican Council through the postVatican II years, Brett sensitively chronicles the sisters' efforts to conform to the spirit of the council and describes the creative innovations that the Holy Family community introduced into the Belizean educational system. In the final chapter he looks at the congregation's efforts to sustain its missionary work in the face of the shortage of new religious vocations. Brett s study is more than just a chronicle of the Holy Family Sisters' accomplishments in Belize. He treats the issues of racism and gender discrimination that the African American congregation encountered both within the church and in society, demonstrating how the sisters survived and even thrived by learning how to skillfully negotiate with the white, dominant power structure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJUFDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plant Indicators Of Soils, Rocks, and Subsurface Waters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cvaeoAEACAAJ&dq=Plant+Indicators+Of+Soils,+Rocks,+and+Subsurface+Waters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artillery Through the Ages, a Short Illustrated History of Cannon, Emphasizing Types Used in America.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8zkj5UTzI1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Venus on the Fairway : Creating a Swing--and a Game--That Works for Women","description":"Designed to bridge the instructional gender gap, a guide to creating a golf swing and a game that works for women features helpful tips on the grip and setup, the full swing and getting the most distance, fitness, and discussion of essential rules and etiquette.

Remini recounts how in the years before his presidency Adams was a shrewd, influential diplomat, and later, as a dynamic secretary of state under President James Monroe, he solidified many basic aspects of American foreign policy, including the Monroe Doctrine. Undoubtedly his greatest triumph was the negotiation of the Transcontinental Treaty, through which Spain acknowledged Florida to be part of the United States.

Can literature, in fact, be political at all? These are the questions Roland Barthes addresses in Writing Degree Zero, his first published book and a landmark in his oeuvre. The debate had engaged the European literary community since the 1930s; with this fierce manifesto, Barthes challenged the notion of literature's obligation to be socially committed. Yes, Barthes allows, the writer has a political and ethical responsibility. But the history of French literature shows that the writer has often failed to meet it--and from Barthes's perspective, literature is committed to little more than the myth of itself. Expert and uncompromising, Writing Degree Zero introduced the themes that would soon establish Barthes as one of the leading voices in literary criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OYKbkQEACAAJ&dq=Writing+degree+zero%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyberforce Wildcats: Killer Instinct","description":"GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING!

In the spring of 2004, graphic photographs of Iraqi prisoners being tortured by American soldiers in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison flashed around the world, provoking outraged debate. Did they depict the rogue behavior of \\"a few bad apples\\"? Or did they in fact reveal that the US government had decided to use brutal tactics in the \\"war on terror\\"? The images are shocking, but they do not tell the whole story. The abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents but the result of a chain of deliberate decisions and failures of command. To understand how \\"Hooded Man\\" and \\"Leashed Man\\" could have happened, Mark Danner turns to the documents that are collected for the first time in this book. These documents include secret government memos, some never before published, that portray a fierce argument within the Bush administration over whether al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners were protected by the Geneva Conventions and how far the US could go in interrogating them. There are also official reports on abuses at Abu Ghraib by the International Committee of the Red Cross, by US Army investigators, and by an independent panel chaired by former defense secretary James R. Schlesinger. In sifting this evidence, Danner traces the path by which harsh methods of interrogation approved for suspected terrorists in Afghanistan and Guant?namo \\"migrated\\" to Iraq as resistance to the US occupation grew and US casualties mounted. Yet as Mark Danner writes, the real scandal here is political: it \\"is not about revelation or disclosure but about the failure, once wrongdoing is disclosed, of politicians, officials, the press, and, ultimately, citizens to act.\\" For once we know the story the photos and documents tell, we are left with the questions they pose for our democratic society: Does fighting a \\"new kind of war\\" on terror justify torture? Who will we hold responsible for deciding to pursue such a policy, and what will be the moral and political costs to the country?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7paBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Torture+and+Truth:+America,+Abu+Ghraib,+and+the+War+on+Terror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be My Wife (Silhouette Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FwmW_bOABR0C&dq=Be+My+Wife+(Silhouette+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tibetan Diary: From Birth to Death and Beyond in a Himalayan Valley of Nepal","description":"High in the Nepali Himalaya are a number of ethnic Tibetan communities.

Armed with his pragmatic approach and his belief in the power of critical intelligence, Dewey argues that individualism has in fact been offered a uniquely higher plane of technological development upon which to grow, mature, and redefine itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ichHAAAAYAAJ&dq=Individualism,:+Old+and+new,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vanishing Virginian,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-3NFngEACAAJ&dq=The+vanishing+Virginian,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying Kites (Teletubbies)","description":"One by one the Teletubbies give their kites to Po to hold while they go off to play with Laa Laa's ball","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4xrnGwAACAAJ&dq=Flying+Kites+(Teletubbies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"River Stories: Growing Up on the Wisconsin","description":"Dace Chamberlain was a man of the river.

It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques. Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . . ? A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas. ? A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern. ? A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base. ? A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers. This book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise \\"wisdom of the crowd.\\" Kawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people. As Kawasaki writes, \\"Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do.\\" That's a big goal, but one that's possible for all of us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xmYBTQcF1TsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blindsight & The Nature of Consciousness","description":"Blindsight is the Hugo Awardnominated novel by Peter Watts, \\"a hard science fiction writer through and through and one of the very best alive\\" (The Globe and Mail).

Who should we send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn't want to meet?

Throughout the ages, they live life after life in normal society until each one falls in love and fathers his own child. Before that child is born, they undergo a rapid degeneration into a fetal state before they disappear entirely and become reborn into a new life, essentially becoming their own fathers.

The gunfight at the OK Corral lasted less than a minute yet it became the basis for countless stories about the Wild West. At the time of the event, however, Wyatt Earp was not universally acclaimed as a hero. Among the people who knew him best in Tombstone, Arizona, many considered him a renegade and murderer. This book tells the nearly unknown story of the prosecution of Wyatt Earp, his brothers, and Doc Holiday following the famous gunfight. To the prosecutors, the Earps and Holiday were wanton killers. According to the defense, the Earps were steadfast heroes willing to risk their lives on the mean streets of Tombstone for the sake of order. The case against the Earps, with its dueling narratives of brutality and justification, played out themes of betrayal, revenge, and even adultery. Attorney Thomas Fitch, one of the era s finest advocates, ultimately managed, against considerable odds, to save Earp from the gallows. But the case could easily have ended in a conviction and Wyatt Earp would have been hanged or imprisoned instead of celebrated as an American icon.  This trial has everything: a family feud, famous outlaws and lawmen, politics, sex, and the most famous shootout in frontier history . . . Lubet s accessible and highly original book will set a standard for scholarship in a field laden with folklore.

This collection--among the oldest records of the historical Buddha's original teachings--consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikaya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity. The translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Nanamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.

This work carries on the ancient debate about the scope of God's saving purposes and the manner of his effecting salvation in human beings. It defends the proposition that God is a dynamic personal Agent who respects the freedom he chose to delegate to his human creatures and relates sensitively to us in the outworking of his plans for the whole of history. God is love and expresses his power by working salvation among us under conditions of genuine mutuality. The contributors to this volume are Christian scholars who are eager to present this evangelical model as an alternative to deterministic theology.

Werner and Smith trace the impact of a variety of biological and psycho-social risk factors and stressful events on the development of these individuals, most of whose parents did not graduate from high school and worked as semiskilled or unskilled laborers. Incorporating vivid case study accounts with statistical analysis, the authors focus on both the vulnerability and the resilience of those who overcame great odds to grow into competent and caring adults. They trace the recovery process through which most of the troubled adolescents in the cohort those with histories of delinquency, teenage pregnancy, and mental health problems emerged with improved prospects in their twenties and early thirties. Identifying both the self-righting tendencies that enable high risk children later to adapt successfully to work, marriage, and parenthood, and the conditions under which professional and volunteer care is most beneficial, Werner and Smith offer concrete suggestions for effective intervention policies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lf6tDwAAQBAJ&dq=Overcoming+the+Odds:+High+Risk+Children+from+Birth+to+Adulthood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Stanley's Creature Features Strikes Again Movie Guide","description":"The book features capsulised reviews of 4000 genre films of science-fiction, fantasy, horror, psychoterror and weird mystery; Reviews oddball films and novelties ignored by other popular movie guides; Coded so you can instantly see if a title can be rented or purchased at your local video store; Reviews of movies and offbeat fare made exclusively for videocassette and not listed in other encyclopaedias; 529 photographs, many exclusives from the author's private collection, plus 24 original sketches; Scores of hilarious lines of dialogue and classical movie tag-lines.

Shinto is an ancient spiritual tradition, primarily practiced in Japan, which is now spreading its traditions to the western world. Its primordial rituals and traditions touch a deep chord within one's spiritual self. Shinto's focus on divinity of all beings and of all creation, on living with gratitude and humility, and on purification and lustration of one's self and environment will bring light and joy to any reader. The purpose of prayer and ritual as practiced in the Shinto tradition, is to reinsert ourselves into a divine state of being, not as a new position, but as an acknowledgement and reinforcement of what already exists. Ritual restores sensitive awareness to our relationship to the universe. Through purification and removal of impurities and blockages, we return to our innate internal brightness and cultivate a demeanor of gratitude and joy. Shinto rituals and prayers were created by ancient man over 2,000 years ago in a time when mankind was more intuitive about his relationship to this world. Because of this, the rites are archetypal and invoke deep emotion within the participants. This book of prayers will introduce the western reader to the deep spirituality of Shinto, providing explanation of the spiritual tradition and practice and providing a collection of 22 prayers for use in personal meditation and devotions.

This principle is expected to endure, whatever the language in which it may be couched, or whatever greater precision may be developed in its application and extension.

This is followed by separate chapters on correlation diagrams, the conservation of orbital symmetry, theory of electrocyclic reactions, theory of cycloadditions and cycloreversions, and theory of sigmatropic reactions.

First deployed in Vietnam in 1967 and loaded with a formidable arsenal of weaponry, the Cobra was the first helicopter designed from inception as an attack aircraft. It dramatically changed the nature of the war in Vietnam by offering the Army, for the first time, its own powerful and highly accurate weapons platform for close-air-support missions. Randy Zahn arrived in Vietnam shortly before the 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia, one of the most impressive demonstrations by the Cobra in the war. He describes his stunning transformation from a naive, middle-class teenager from southern California to a hardened killer during his tour in Vietnam. Unlike the pilots who flew the fast-moving strike jets, Zahn experienced the war \\"up close and personal,\\" witnessing the grisly effects of the Cobra's firepower on enemy soldiers. The author does not glorify killing but rather explains in sharp relief the kaleidoscope of emotions associated with combat: fear, revenge, hate, remorse, pity, and even ecstasy. He captures many of the ironies and nuances inherent in Vietnam, especially during the final years of the conflict. Zahn displays a sensitivity rarely found in memoirs written by battle-hardened warriors. This human element, combined with the vast amount of archival research and interviews with members of his former unit, ensures that Snake Pilot will become the definitive account of the role helicopters played in Vietnam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o9bv3ne--p4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parables of the Forest","description":"Looks for parables of faith in rainforests, avalanches, and the eruption of Mt.

Written by activists with decades of experience organizing in grassroots anticapitalist struggles against white supremacy, the book established itself as an essential reference point for revolutionary nationalists and dissident currents within the Marxist-Leninist and anarchist movements. Always controversial within the establishment left, Settlers uncovers centuries of collaboration between capitalism and white workers and their organizations, as well as their neocolonial allies, showing how the United States was designed from the ground up as a parasitic and genocidal entity. As recounted in painful detail by J. Sakai, the United States has been built on the theft of Indigenous lands and of Afrikan labor, on the robbery of the northern third of Mexico, the colonization of Puerto Rico, and the expropriation of the Asian working class, with each of these crimes being accompanied by violence. This new edition includes a new essay and an interview with author J.

On closer inspection, the presentation of project descriptions, photographs, and annotated drawings reflects a concern to analytically explain the operative aspects at work. The publication is not intended to serve only as a catalogue, guide, or manual on how to produce public space in spontaneous settlements. Rather, it goes beyond the aims of an index of best practices. It is intended, instead, as an empirical base for a critical and theoretical engagement with the problematic of development, social inclusion, public investment, (in)formal settlement, civil society and the public sphere. The publication achieves its final function at this third level, by providing a compelling argument to expand the agency of architects and urban designers and creatively find ways of justifying, financing, and building public spaces in communities  spaces that have a catalytic effectiveness in achieving significant urban and social transformation. This book was awarded by a Graham Foundation Grant and CAF Development Bank of Latin America.

In contrast to the Republic, which presents an abstract ideal not intended for any actual community, the Laws seems to provide practical guidelines for the establishment and maintenance of political order in the real world. With this book, the distinguished classicist Seth Benardete offers an insightful analysis and commentary on this rich and complex dialogue. Each of the chapters corresponds to one of the twelve books of the Laws, illuminating the major themes and arguments, which have to do with theology, the soul, justice, and education. The Greek word for law, \\"nomos,\\" also means musical tune. Bernardete shows how music in the broadest sense, including drama, epic poetry, and even puppetry mediates between reason and the city in Plato's philosophy of law. Most broadly, however, Benardete here uncovers the concealed ontological dimension of the Laws, explaining why it is concealed and how it comes to light. In establishing the coherence and underlying organization of Plato's last dialogue, Benardete makes a significant contribution to Platonic studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d4bm3FEk4o8C&dq=Plato%27s+%22Laws%22:+The+Discovery+of+Being&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Root Causes of Suicide Terrorism: The Globalization of Martyrdom (Political Violence)","description":"This highly topical new study clearly shows how there are at least two reasons to question the central role that is assigned to religion, in particular Islam, when explaining suicide terrorism. suicide terrorism is a modern phenomenon, yet Islam is a very old religion. Except for two periods in the twelfth and eighteenth centuries, suicide was never part of Islamist beliefs and behaviours. Actually, Islam clearly forbids suicide, hence, the argument that Islamic religious beliefs are the main cause of suicide terrorism is inherently dubious many suicide attacks have been carried out by secular organizations with little connection to fundamentalist Islam: Palestinian Fatah; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and the Kurdish Workers Party. Moreover, one of the organizations that has employed this strategy devastatingly and regularly is the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam). Not only are members of this organization not Muslim, most of them are not religious at all. This superb new book contains essays by some of the world's leading scholars of terrorism and political violence. It is essential reading for students of terrorism, political science and Middle Eastern politics, and useful to students of social psychology, theology and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aAGTAgAAQBAJ&dq=Root+Causes+of+Suicide+Terrorism:+The+Globalization+of+Martyrdom+(Political+Violence)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pillow Talk","description":"Perfect for fans of One Day You ll Thank Me and Capital Gaines, the star of Southern Charm and cofounder and CMO of Sewing Down South reveals how he turned his passion for sewing into a profitable enterprise and a fulfilling life, while also taking us behind-the-scenes of one of Bravo s most popular shows. As a young boy sitting at a sewing machine in home economics class, Craig Conover had no idea that this hobby would one day change his life for the better. Growing up in Delaware, Conover experienced cruel bullying and suffered from severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder that robbed him of his childhood confidence and made him crave success. But while law school in Charleston seemed to provide him the direction he needed, Conover spent years searching for meaning and passion in life. The chance to become a cast member on Bravo s Southern Charm promised to provide that. Though the show gave Conover his shot at fame and fortune, it also offered destructive temptations that fed his insecurities. As the show increased in popularity, he sank deeper into procrastination and self-doubt. Unable to take control of his life, Conover quickly lost his job, his girlfriend, and his motivation. Then, at his lowest point, Conover turned to his passion sewing and slowly pulled himself out of the spiral. A chance phone call from an old friend gave Conover the support he needed to turn his hobby into a business. Soon after, Sewing Down South was borne and became an overnight success, with Conover launching a multi-state  Pillow Party Tour,  being featured on HSN, and opening a retail store in downtown Charleston.

World War II saw skiing featured in a dozen films dealing with that conflict. Fueled by postwar prosperity, the sport exploded in the 1950s--filmmakers followed suit, using scenes on snow-covered slopes for panoramic beauty and the thrill of the chase. Through the free-spirited 1960s and 1970s, the downhill lifestyle shussed into everything from spy thrillers to beach party romps. The extreme sports era of the 1980s and 1990s brought snowboarding to the big screen.

He showed that by blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting--or imposing--too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up too fast, to mimic adult sophistication while secretly yearning for innocence. In the more than two decades since this book first appeared, new generations of parents have inadvertently stepped up the assault on childhood, in the media, in schools, and at home. In the third edition of this classic (2001), Dr. Elkind provided a detailed, up-to-the-minute look at the Internet, classroom culture, school violence, movies, television, and a growing societal incivility to show parents and teachers where hurrying occurs and why. And as before, he offered parents and teachers insight, advice, and hope for encouraging healthy development while protecting the joy and freedom of childhood. In this twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the book, Dr. Elkind delivers important new commentary to put a quarter century of trends and change into perspective for parents today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6s607DFWiBgC&dq=The+hurried+child:+Growing+up+too+fast+too+soon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House of Cards: Inside teh Troubled Empire of American Express","description":"A study of American Express chronicles the history of the financial-services conglomerate, whose public fiascos and private internal battles have eaten away at its power","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LhGLkiRMXo0C&dq=House+of+Cards:+Inside+teh+Troubled+Empire+of+American+Express&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counter Paradise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qfOfQgAACAAJ&dq=Counter+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The call of the minaret (Galaxy book, GB 122)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reflections on the Spirituality of Gregorian Chant (From Solesmes about the Chant)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Good Wine: Reading John from the Center","description":"The Good Wine is an exciting and challenging overview of the gospel of John. Bruno Barnhart has created a mystical roadmap of the biblical book, which is often considered the most difficult and theological of the four gospels. Following the lead of Peter Ellis, Barnhart has organized the whole of John's gospel around a single truth: that God poured divine reality into humankind through the person of Jesus Christ. This belief stands at the center of the gospel, and every episode in the narrative refracts the light of that core affirmation. The gospel, when interpreted this way, assumes a mandalic pattern in which all parts are related to the center and through it to each other. The mandalic pattern is also a gate of entry for believers who seek to relate their own destinies to the Source of Life. This book differs from other treatments of John's gospel in that its method is sapiential, following the wisdom-tradition of the church fathers. It explores the symbolic significance of the gospel and pays attention to chiastic textures which establish patterned, repetitive relationships between narrative episodes. The result is a deeply spiritual work that explodes with flashes of illumination for persons who come to the gospel jaded with traditional scholarship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z_JLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars Survivor's Quest","description":"Three years after his marriage to Mara Jade, Luke receives word that the remains of the legendary Outbound Flight Project have been found, prompting Luke and Mara to join a team of adventurers on an expedition into the Unknown Regions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yp1TYF1KXm8C&dq=Star+Wars+Survivor%27s+Quest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Every Soul Be Jesus' Guest: A Theology of the Open Table","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Green grass of Wyoming","description":"As well as Ken's battle against the odds to achieve his dream, 'Green Grass of Wyoming' shows a boy's growth into maturity, taking his first steps in love.

Earthy and spiritual. Fred weaves a tale of a Christian family who thrives and survives some of history's world-crushing events. The strength of a rural American family, thrust into the decades of depression, war, and cultural change, demonstrates how a strong spiritual foundation produced the greatest generation America has ever witnessed. It depicts a long-lost tradition of true faith, honest values, and hard work in tune with nature that everyone needs to read.--Jan Dean, Retired English teacher. The Bridge To Paradise by Fred Dickenson chronicles five generations of a Christian family--Lafayette and Louise--in rural North Texas from before the Great Depression to the present. The forty chapters--a number reminiscent of the years of testing in the Bible--present a nostalgic account of a family's journey through time and how their faith in God was rewarded in the lives of their descendants. Fred's style captures the language, attitudes, and culture of Texas while integrating reflective, poetic sonnets at the beginning of each chapter.

This essay has been widely acclaimed as the precursor to Marx's important treatise Das Kapital. The ideas that are expressed in the essay have a very thorough economic contemplation about them as he put aside some of his materialist conceptions of history for the time being. This essay did, however, start to show an increased scientific rationale on his ideas of \\"alienated labor,\\" which in Marx's perspective would eventually lead to the proletarian revolution. Wage-Labor and Capital is considered by Marxists as an \\"in-depth economic and scientific observation on how capitalist economy works, why it was exploitative, and ultimately why it would eventually implode from within.\\" Some of the main topics that the essay examines are about labour power and labour, and how labour power becomes a commodity. It also presents the Labour Theory of Value that further develops the distinct differences between labour and labour power. The essay also examines the commodity and how the economic principles of supply and demand affect the pricing of certain commodities. Beyond that the essay explores how capital and capitalism do not service any purpose other than to gain more of it, which Marx presents as an illogical method of living one's life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OwCEtAEACAAJ&dq=Wage-labor+and+capital&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crazy Ape","description":"A Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Szent-Gy?rgyi concerns himself with the underlying forces and conditions that have prevented the realization of the higher possibilities of the American Dream, and, by extension, of all mankind.

The fundamental question asked by this book is: why is it that most of the scientific research that is done to elevate human life serves in the end to destroy it? That this phenomenon exists is unarguable. How to alter it is the problem the author tackles. He finds the possibility, indeed the instrument of our survival, in our youth.

Riveting . . . A legal thriller.\\"--Kevin Boyle, The New York Times Book Review Following the Civil War, Colfax, Louisiana, was a town like many where African Americans and whites mingled uneasily. But on April 13, 1873, a small army of white ex-Confederate soldiers, enraged after attempts by freedmen to assert their new rights, killed more than sixty African Americans who had occupied a courthouse. Seeking justice for the slain, one brave U.S. attorney, James Beckwith, risked his life and career to investigate and punish the perpetrators--but they all went free. What followed was a series of courtroom dramas that culminated at the Supreme Court, where the justices' verdict compromised the victories of the Civil War and left Southern blacks at the mercy of violent whites for generations. The Day Freedom Died is a riveting historical saga that captures a gallery of characters from presidents to townspeople, and re-creates the bloody days of Reconstruction, when the often brutal struggle for equality moved from the battlefield into communities across the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PzgHngEACAAJ&dq=Colfax&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Teen Health Book: A Parents' Guide to Adolescent Health and Well-Being","description":"A practical guide designed to help parents navigate the crucial health issues that accompany the teen years covers sexuality, eating disorders, substance abuse, acne, growth, and development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sd-8Mn5Op54C&dq=The+Teen+Health+Book:+A+Parents%27+Guide+to+Adolescent+Health+and+Well-Being&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neighbourhood Threat: On Tour WIth Iggy Pop","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjnBswEACAAJ&dq=Neighbourhood+Threat:+On+Tour+WIth+Iggy+Pop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paterno Legacy","description":"Joe Paterno, legendary coach of the Penn State football team, will be breaking the all-time coaching record of Bear Bryant this season.

So, Grant Fargo argues to his grandfather Lincoln, it's perfectly all right that he's desperately in love with his first cousin, Bella-she's the only source of intelligent conversation for miles, and in a town like Verdon, it would be hard not to end up with a relative of one kind or another. Before it all plays out, men will be murdered, jailed, tarred and feathered or worse, and while everyone in the Fargo clan would kill for the family deeds, God might just end up with them instead. In Heed the Thunder, one of Thompson's earlier works, Thompson's signature style collides with a sweeping picaresque of the American prairie, in a multigenerational saga that's one part Steinbeck, two parts Dostoyevsky, and all Jim Thompson.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xap7ETI74hUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aa Explorer Japan (Explorers)","description":"In this first volume in the Space Biology and Medicine series, contributors describe the current status of their understanding of space, highlighting physical and ecological conditions as well as heavenly bodies, and provide general information that will prove useful in the later volumes.

Thinking can be something productive and creative, but without integrating body and mind, much of our thinking is useless and unproductive. In Peace of Mind, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that integrating body and mind is the only way to be fully alive in each moment, without getting lost in our thoughts while walking, cooking, driving, and going about our everyday lives. Only by cultivating a mindful body and an embodied mind can we be fully alive. Bringing together ancient wisdom and contemporary thinking, Thich Nhat Hanh says it's like hardware and software if you don't have both, you can't do anything. Peace of Mind provides a foundation for beginning mindfulness practices and understanding the principles of mind/body awareness. By learning how our physical body and mind are inseparable in creating our own perceptions and experiences we can begin to trust and nourish our ability to create well-being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-qMtAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fear of Frying (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #9)","description":"Suburban Chicago single mother and amateur sleuth Jane Jeffry investigates a murder at a summer camp when the victim shows up alive and well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r4B7mgEACAAJ&dq=Fear+of+Frying+(Jane+Jeffry+Mystery+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BMW M-Series and Performance Specials (Sports Car Color History)","description":"Bimmerphiles rejoice!

In this work, the author compares the three most prominent representatives of evolutionary algorithms: genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and evolutionary programming. The algorithms are presented within a unified framework, thereby clarifying the similarities and differences of these methods. The author also presents new results regarding the role of mutation and selection in genetic algorithms, showing how mutation seems to be much more important for the performance of genetic algorithms than usually assumed. The interaction of selection and mutation, and the impact of the binary code are further topics of interest. Some of the theoretical results are also confirmed by performing an experiment in meta-evolution on a parallel computer. The meta-algorithm used in this experiment combines components from evolution strategies and genetic algorithms to yield a hybrid capable of handling mixed integer optimization problems. As a detailed description of the algorithms, with practical guidelines for usage and implementation, this work will interest a wide range of researchers in computer science and engineering disciplines, as well as graduate students in these fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=htJHI1UrL7IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The creative way to paint","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-dkgPAAACAAJ&dq=The+creative+way+to+paint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns","description":"\\"The chapter for each election provides a wonderful snapshot of United States history and culture.

The author explains how to manage software development measurement systems, how to build software measurement tools and standards, and how to construct controlled experiments using standardized measurement tools. There are three fundamental questions that this book seeks to answer. First, exactly how do you get the measurement data? Second, how do you convert the data from the measurement process to information that you can use to manage the software development process? Third, how do you manage all of the data? Millions of dollars are being spent trying to secure software systems. When suitable instrumentation is placed into the systems that we develop, their activity can be monitored in real time. Measurement based automatic detection mechanisms can be designed into systems. This will permit the detection of system misuse and detect incipient reliability problems. By demonstrating how to develop simple experiments for the empirical validation of theoretical research and showing how to convert measurement data into meaningful and valuable information, this text fosters more precise use of software measurement in the computer science and software engineering literature.

In The Power of Feminist Art, coeditors Norma Broude and Mary D. Garrard, professors of art history at The American University in Washington, D.C., bring together many of the influential art historians, critics, and artists who participated in the events of the 1970s. Together, they have created this landmark volume, the first history and analysis documenting this fertile and dynamic period of artistic growth.\\" \\"We learn about the first feminist art education programs, with artists Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro helping to lay the foundation; about the now legendary Womanhouse project; and about such banner exhibitions as \\"Women Artists: 1550-1950,\\" organized in 1976 by art historians Linda Nochlin and Ann Sutherland Harris. We follow the development of the movement as seen in the various feminist organizations, networks, exhibitions, and publications it generated; and most particularly in the emergence of feminist art. Performance art, social protest and public art, and collaboration; exploration of such formerly taboo aesthetic areas as \\"Pattern and Decoration\\"; and subjects such as divinity and the body viewed from female perspectives are among the multiple aspects of the Feminist Art movement. The last section of the book traces the ups and downs of the movement, as experienced through the backlash of the 1980s and the resurgence of women's issues in the 1990s.\\" \\"Uncompromising, probing, thoughtful, and as provocative and exciting as the period itself, The Power of Feminist Art is an immensely stunning book. Reproductions of hundreds of works of feminist art from the 1970s and beyond - by such artists as Judith Baca, Harmony Hammond, Joyce Kozloff, Barbara Kruger, Ana Mendieta, Alice Neel, Faith Ringgold, Betye Saar, Miriam Schapiro, Cindy Sherman, Nancy Spero, May Stevens, and Hannah Wilke - and the meticulously researched essays make this an invaluable source book and major contribution to American art and social history.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In recognition of their contribution to aviation, Boardman-Polando field in Hyannis, Massachusetts, was named in their honor on the 50th anniversary of their flight. Two years after this amazing journey, Boardman was killed in a crash, but Polando flew for the rest of his life, mainly in New England. The book recounts his 1934 participation in the 11,123-mile MacRobertson race from England to Australia, in which he and his copilot got only as far as Calcutta after landing in the Persian desert where Polando was briefly held captive by Arabs.

Samat: An Easter Story contained some certain literary worth, but I cannot be the judge for my opinion is skewed and I feel unworthy in the arena of literary wisdom. I can; however, hope that the story is worthy of a reading at least by my children. I believe there can be no greater goal for fiction than to give the reader a true slice of the life of its characters, setting, and in a sense, speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. Such is the value of Faulkner's Light in August, although I tremble to even mention that hollowed name when referencing something I have written. Thus my goal, other than to entertain the reader with words is to search for what remains hidden, and to reflect how it really was. Mt. Samat: An Easter Story is a fictional account of three days and nights spent by two companies of men near and on a mountain, Mt. Samat, over Easter weekend a few years ago. Men of different colors and cultures gather on the mountain with one common goal, the liberty of Asia, but liberty as seen through different eyes. Each company experiences dire trials and deadly difficulties as they try in earnest to do their duty. New acquaintances are made on the trail to the top and by surprise an old acquaintance is renewed. As the Sunday worship hour approaches, there is a wild rush for the summit; however, like the first Easter, blood will freely flow on Mt. Samat before the story ends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TZnhwAEACAAJ&dq=Pawned+Sovereignty:+Sharpened+Black+Perspectives+on+Americanization,+Africa,+War+and+Reparations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Greece: State and society","description":"Ancient Greece: State and Society greatly enlarges the scope of subjects traditionally regarded as appropriate to historical inquiry.

Filling both a theoretical and a practice gap in the literature, the book discusses the experiences of academics, practitioners and students involved in international exchanges in social work. It draws on a major EU-Canadian exchange project as well as separate projects in countries including South Africa, the USA, China and Australia. The contributors highlight the opportunities and barriers that shaped their experience and give guidance on how to deal with both the practicalities and aspirations of living and working across borders. This book will thus be invaluable both to readers interested in the meaning and realities of international social work and to those hoping to embark on an exchange programme themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6YZBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mosaic Techniques & Traditions: Projects & Designs from Around the World","description":"With the breathtaking work of hundreds of artists on display throughout, this visually arresting volume showcases mosaics from all corners of the globe and teaches the skills needed to produce 15 beautiful pieces.

In this respect, his work, as in the preparation of this edited volume, is an indispensable tool for Muslims themselves so they can wage their struggle for enlightenment and reform of their faith tradition.- Middle East Quarterly...probably the first book of its kind-a compendium of testimonies from former Muslims about the reasons for their estrangement from the Islamic faith itself.-New York Review of BooksIn the West abandoning one's religion (apostasy) can be a difficult, emotional decision, which sometimes has social repercussions. However, in culturally diverse societies where there is a mixture of ethnic groups and various philosophies of life, most people look upon such shifts in intellectual allegiance as a matter of personal choice and individual right. By contrast, in Islam apostasy is still viewed as an almost unthinkable act, and in orthodox circles it is considered a crime punishable by death. Renowned scholar of Islamic Studies Bernard Lewis described the seriousness of leaving the Islamic faith in the following dire terms: Apostasy was a crime as well as a sin, and the apostate was damned both in this world and the next. His crime was treason   desertion and betrayal of the community to which he belonged, and to which he owed loyalty; his life and property were forfeit. He was a dead limb to be excised.Defying the death penalty applicable to all apostates in Islam, the ex-Muslims who are here represented feel it is their duty to speak up against their former faith, to tell the truth about the fastest growing religion in the world. These former Muslims, from all parts of the Islamic world, recount how they slowly came to realize that the religion into which they were born was in many respects unbelievable and sometimes even dangerous.These memoirs of personal journeys to enlightenment and intellectual freedom make for moving reading and are a courageous signal to other ex-Muslims to come out of the closet.Ibn Warraq is the highly acclaimed author of Why I Am Not a Muslim and Defending the West. He is also the editor of The Origins of the Koran, What the Koran Really Says, Leaving Islam, The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, and Which Koran'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9q0y21B9BoUC&dq=Leaving+Islam:+Apostates+Speak+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r6AWAQAAMAAJ&dq=Late+Modern:+The+Visual+Arts+Since+1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cholesterol Control Without Diet!","description":"New, Updated, Enlarged Edition of this Best-Selling guide on using niacin for cholesterol control Niacin with medical supervision, DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT for the profile of cholesterol and other lipids, preventing heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.
