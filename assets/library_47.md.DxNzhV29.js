It draws you in the first sentence, and you cannot give it up.Roxanne and her boyfriend Pepper had a slight problem-Rox was pregnant. But in the middle of her abortion, before the actual surgery, Rox gets up and leaves. One the way home, she sees a mysterious figure in the sun, who disappears when Rox turns. She pays no attention to it; its just a hitchhiker, right? But at home, Pepper and Rox discover an empty town; they call people in other places in the world-no one. They find three other teenagers; Leslie, the perfect girl, Helter, the tough guy and the class brain, someone else whose name I can't remember. They are all directly or indirectly involved with Betty Sue McCormack, the odd girl who doused herself with gasoline and set herself on fire. They find Betty Sue's diary, which reveals secrets the people in the group had, secrets which shouldn't have been revealed . . . Then there's the stories; stories which have their names in them-if the names are slightly different. They are stories of death, pain. Soon, they begin to wonder who . . . or what Betty Sue really was.Definitely read this. It is so great, and it will leave you going &quot;wow&quot;."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"What happens when what you feel on the inside surfaces out into the real world? What happens when that power is given over to someone who doesn't have your best interests at heart? What happens if you can't get out of that world to regain that power? You'll find yourself asking those questions and answering them by the end of this book. Fiction books have many layers. On the surface Whisper Of Death is just an excellent horror story. It is frightening to think about but just under the surface there is a message. That message is the key to what makes this book excellent. All novels existed somewhere else before they were written just like the characters in this novel find themselves in perils and perdicaments think about yourself in that situation as it applies to your own personal reality.Read and enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Wow. Wow. Wow. And wow some more.This book has an amazing plot for a young adult thriller. In fact, I would recommend it to just about any adult I know.The story is amazing. There's twists, bends, curves, scrapes, and bumps. The ending is a shocker of sorts, each scene is an unpredictable event that makes your heart beat with more than just suspense, but pure emotion - yes, definately emotion. I even cried. Twice. (Or maybe more times...yes, I'm a softie, what can I say??)I don't care that this is a YA, this one was INTELLIGENT. Plenty of hidden meanings, commentaries, explorations of life. Again, wow.The atmosphere was simply frustrating and depressing - good!Characters were convincing, I loved nearly every one. Pike writes amazingly well. Sometimes he has long paragraphs with stylish words that could be almost considered poetry - other times it's shorter and clear, forward and to the point.This type of work, with its creativity, originality, genuineness,and passion - is, and forever remains, timeless."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"wow! did you ever have the feeling that since you'd never heard anyone else talk about a book (or something else) you loved, you were the only person in the world that loved it? i had always felt this way about this CP book! it is by FAR his best YA book, leaps and bounds above the others. i was way into reading his books when i was about 12 or 13 (a little young for the material but i was an avid reader!) and this is the one that has always stuck in my brain like a piece of bubblegum. it is just everything a good book should be- creepy, imaginative, well-written, descriptive, eerie, memorable. i have looked far and wide for this book and just thought to look here and i ordered it! being 24 now it's been a long time since i've read it and i can't wait for it to get here. please read this book! i would recommend this book to people of all ages, it's that good."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This book was pure genius. The ending affected me like nothing else ever had.

I mean the story was so cool and the characters were almost alive (well for most of the book). I mean it also takes a stab and bringing something new into a story. This book has a really big issue in it that is facing alot of teens today... abortion. I am glad that Mr. Pike is not afraid to pull all the punches and treat his readers as mature people. This book was very creepy with great characters that I wish could have been in more books. A MUST!!!!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I've read everything by Christopher Pike I've ever been able to get my hands on. If you've never read anything by him, try this one first. The characters are very real. I compared myself to all of them at different times. I've read Wisper of Death twice, like most of his books, but I could read it over and over again and understand it a little more each time. It gets very deep and it has some hidden morals that you might not see on the surface. You won't be able to put it down until you're done. Then you'll want to pick it up again. A message to people who haven't read any of Pike's books: Read all the old stuff first. Books like Remember Me (my favorite), Witch, Wisper of Death, and Scavenger Hunt show Pike at his absolute best."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"As a teenager I read all of Christopher Pike's books, but this has always stood out in my mind as one of his very best. I love Stephen King, but this book affected me like no King ever has. I still remember the moment when I closed the book and felt like the earth was falling away. The book touched my perception of reality like no other. The last chapters contain some of the most harrowing passages I have ever read. The characters are great! A MUST-read for suspense &amp; horror fans of all ages."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"For a teenage potboiler, this bbok is rather creepy. Five teenagers inexplicably find themselves in a dead, abandoned world; the only common thread linking them is their connection to a dead girl. They soon find themselves being killed off in ways so imaginatively gruseome as to be worthy of an Italian horor film. The only drawback is the out-of-date moralizing: Roxanne had an abortion, so she must die! Otherwise highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Wkisper of Death is not your average corny teenage horror book. It doesn't have any passion scenes or elabrate fighting scenes that confuse the plot, It was nicely writen and really made me think about life and not wanting to be alone.It was nicely detailed,I felt like I was right there in the thick if it. It has suprising twists and a great ending."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Those are the first things that come to my mind when I think about this book. But as great as the overall story was, I was dissapointed with the ending. It also in a way had a deeper meaning then what was originally thought. As all of Christopher Pike's books do, this had a mystifying storyline with &quot;real&quot; characters, ones that everyone can relate to. I suggest all Christopher Pike fans read it."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"You will never find another book that both scares you to death and changes the way you think like this one did. Christopher Pike is a genius, simply stated."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Pike amazes readers once again with this mind-spinning read. The plot is as excellent as thesuspense which leaves you huddling in bed with aflashlight, long after you should've been asleep.The heroine is believable and very human. The villain is horrfying but human enough for readers to be sympathetic. The plot itself could leave you reeling, especially on retrospect. If you even remotely like Pike, you've got to read &quot;Whisper of Death.&quot;"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I love Christopher Pike's novels. And although I'm not usually frightened by them, this book gave me the heebee-jeebees!!! I was so scared i couldn't go to sleep! It is still a must read."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This book was so good! I had to keep on reading it becasue it stumped me the whole way through about who or what was doing this.It's about a girl who is about to go get an abortion adn when she get's thier her doctor makes one cut and then her doctor runs out. She then get's up, deciding she doesn't wanna do this and she, her boy friend, a girl from school and two boys from school and a stranger that only she has seen is left in the world. They roam around till they find a paper describing how each of them is going to die one by one. They suspect that it's a girl who had killed herself three weeks before then.This book is my favourite of all of Chritopher Pike's books. I especially like what happened in the end. So you'll have to read it the whole way though."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I read this book when I was 13, and I'm now 21. I have thoughtabout this book so much in the years sine I first read it. I can'tremember a lot of the detail, but I, too, remember the feeling of loneliness that accompanied this book. I loved all of Christopher Pike's books, however this one in particular is extra creepy. The books of Christopher Pike, aren't like the typical preteen books. He does not write in a condescending manner...and this is what makes his books so awesome!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Read this as a teen enjoyed it so much then I had to buy it again.

I remember the day I picked it up. It was half torn on the cover, kind of dusty and old, not too many had read it or even heard of it. I checked it out, I was a literary freak, read all the time, and wouldn't have checked it out but it was written brilliantly and I could not put it down. The details were so vivid, the transitions were flawless and intriguing and the characters normal, inquisitive, ignorant, stubborn and relate-able people. I read the entire book in a matter of hours and have been pining to own it for myself ever since. I've been graduated for a year now, ten years later, and can still imagine the entire story, every detail, every expression, every moment of the book as though I saw the movie recreation of it yesterday. Amazing book. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I've read ALL of Christopher Pike's stuff, and I have to say, this book made me feel things I've never felt with his other books. I've always been fascinated with the concept of being one of the last people on earth, and the fact that Pike made it this total mystery just kept you biting your nails for more. I was really scared for those kids, and the novel really made you feel the lonliness and creepiness of being one of the only people left alive. I totally recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"this book was awesome. it is one of those books that make you think. it is a very weird book but in a very good way. it makes you think about what you would do if there only a few people around. i really liked how pike developed these characters."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"One of the Best books i have ever read and it is Christopher Pikes best book."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"When I read this book I had tons of different reactions.

As soon as they return home and find the world empty the terror and horror sets in.It is no doubt his scariest book and his best.I read it all in one day and when I got to the ending It was nearly 1:00A.M. and I was scared out of my wits!This book actually gave me nightmares.The expression can't put down page turner was made for this book."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"whisper of death was the first christopher pike book i read.

This book was one of his best. From page to page, the reader wonders whatwill happen next. The suspense is great, and the storylineis rather chilling, egging the reader to read on and on."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Christopher Pike was perhaps the catalyst for my passion for reading. Starting in 3rd grade, I set out on what seemed like a divine mission to read everything the man had written (and, I believe, I succeeded)...it gave me my first taste of another world, aside from my small childhood universe. Because I was hardly old enough to appreciate &quot;real&quot; literary material, I was drawn in solely by his flair for storytelling...and that is why my appreciation for this story is based only on my first, immediate impressions. &quot;Whisper Of Death&quot; was the first book to have a real emotional impact on me. I haven't read the book since - it's been about six years; I couldn't tell you any of the specifics of the plot. All I remember is, as I closed the book, I felt the most intense feeling of loneliness I'd ever experienced. The stilted rhymes, the dark fairy-tale veneer, there was something about it that was truly haunting. After reading it, I felt as if I were the only person left in the world. It frightened me more than any &quot;Cujo&quot; or &quot;American Psycho&quot; could.Christopher Pike may write young adult novels with less-than-impressive substance material...but that doesn't explain the feeling I get when I think about the book I read in 4th grade. If you read &quot;Whisper Of Death&quot;, don't examine it too closely - let it work its way into your mind and then, after a while, see if your perception hasn't changed in some small way.(Of course, it might help to be 10 years old.)"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I don't think there's a word to describe this book. I first read this book years ago as a 7th or 8th grader, i don't remember when to be honest, its a great book and i recommend it to anyone whom likes it. Rox and Pepper are teenage couple, and one day when returning back home, they find their whole world empty, besides the other three kids, the beauty, the tough guy and the smart guy. Slowly, one by one, each of them die and the only cause anyone can think of was related to Betty Sue. Its a great book, and shows one that every teenager has a life outside of school, be they nerds or the most popular person. Christopher Pike is a master at writing these type of books."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Whisper of Death is a great book! It is very exiting and unpredictable! I reccommend this book to everyone who likes mystery and adventure books by Christopher Pike. Iwould read this book again and again!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"As always, Pike manages to weave a web of mystery and suspense, while still relating very close to real life, and the issues that many of us face, not just as teens, but as human beings. The book starts out at the height of Roxanne's - the main character - existence, as it shows the ever interesting relationship between her and her boyfriend, Pepper, develop. Things head slightly downward after that, as they are plunged into a vapid world where only they, and 3 other teens exist. There, along with the help of their newfound friends, they must figure out just why they were brought to this place, and how to go about escaping.The plot may sound simplistic in itself, but that couldn't be farer from the truth. The characters are rich with very distinct personalities, and the mystery of Betty Sue and her spiderweb will keep you on the edge of your seat longing for more.Not to underplay the greatness of the book, but the one problem I did find was the end. I won't spoil it for anyone who doesn't want to know, but let me just say it left a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"well what can I say....I just finished it an hour ago and justneeded to write something about it. I purchased a lot of books byChristopher Pike and because of the reviews here, decided to read this one first. And boy am I glad I did. This book is so well written that it makes you part of it, it is like you are there with the characters and experience this empty world too. The thing I hated most of this story is with the scene where Rox will have the abortion, the way it all was described gave me chills and made me dizzy. This is so real written, it is like you are the one having an abortion. Too creepy for words. Makes me thinking about using condoms even more, thank you. all I just want to say is that you all have got to read this book and experience a new world (an empty one)."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"never ever before has a book made me feel like this one. when i was finished with this book i just sat there wanting to cry so bad. i made me feel so lonely.i suggest anyone who is even remotely a pike fan read this book and pass it on to others.there was never ever another book written like this one and i doubt if there ever will be again."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I just unpacked a box of old books from high school while moving. I remembered the cover of this book. I remembered the character's names. I remembered something about driving out of town to have an abortion and some weird girl they went to high school with. That was about all I remembered. The last time I read this was about 18 years ago.The first thing I'm struck by is that Pike is an amazing writer. Really. You might say TOO amazing to be writing high school teen novels, but had there been no Pike, there may have been a lot of kids out there who just never got into reading. He talked about all the things teens weren't supposed to be reading about, but here's the shocker -- Underneath the very mild swear words and sexuality, there were morals.This book is a good 20 years old and it's shocking and saddening that morals have deteriorated so much since then. Here, abortion is a shameful thing. Here, women are the nurturers we genetically ARE. This was still in the 90's age of innocence before politics seeped in and corrupted normality. The moment this morality tale is unraveled (I predicted part of it long before it was over, even though parts still don't make sense to me), my eyes filled with tears. There are some very poignant lessons to be learned here after the horrors wear off, which makes for good, creepy late night reading - especially if you listen to a creepy soundtrack to enhance your experience.This brings up the really uncomfortable things about a controversial topic people never think about or don't WANT to think about. I'm amazed that so many years have gone by and I've forgotten why my mind was forever settled on this topic, surely with some of the influence of Pike's words. Some flippantly called it \\"preachy\\" which is absolutely false. There is absolutely NO preaching on the topic, just a few hard realities and deepest revelations that maybe no human being has the absolute moral authority to decide the fate of another human being and that there may be consequences for playing God. It's very open-ended and there are zero religious overtones. Just a really cool idea. Lest we forget, before our country was so sharply divided into right vs. left, morality was usually an across-the-board standard held by both sides. Pike breathed such life into this topic and into all the horrors that I cringed as well as cried...I wasn't expecting this much from a novel I read as a teen! It was really deep with a lot of integrity. Too bad you don't find this depth and encouragement of critical thinking in today's teen horror."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"My favorite story by this author, and it's extremely creepy. It takes a lot to creep me out. A short read but very original and exciting, read it all in one sitting!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I LOVE this book. It's moved me in a way no other book has... especially the part about where she's going to get an abortion and changes her mind. This book drove me to tears. I am 26 years old and I can say I still love this book... I do not think it is for \\"young adults\\" as they suggest. It takes a more mature mind to truly understand and appreciate this work of art. I love just about every Christopher Pike book, but this one takes the cake ."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I read this when I was in middle school soooo long ago! Since that first time I've probably read it over and over at least 5 times. This was my favorite Christopher Pike book (and I owned and read them all) and it still is. I hope to see some new material soon. I don't care if it's young adult; I'll still but and read it.Oh yeah, this book is the reason I can't sleep with the tv off. I have to know the rest of the world is still there ;)"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"i loved this book so much it's so scary well the idea and it was so well written i love christopher pike books this IS his bestYOU HAVE GOT TO THIS IT IS SOO GOOD!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This is a really good one of his; I read this when I was maybe 12 and I think I read it at least five or six times throughout junior high. The only thing I dislike about it--and some other reviewers pointed this out as well--is that it borders on preachy with the abortion theme. Pike is very good with writing teenage girls, in fact his best books are written from the female perspective IMO. But this is a topic that he really has no idea about, and it shows. Other than that, though, I loved it."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Okay, i am a PIke fan, though i am not keeping up with his latest novels. Not wanting to spend too much money, i know realize i am going to have too. ANyways, this was the book that hooked me into this brilliant mastermind. THough it's not his best, it's one i will take out late some night, and read over. thoroughly chilling, and very intense, i reccommend this to anybody, as long as you think you can handle it. . ."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I adore Christopher Pike. Adore him like I adore Keanu Reeves. This book made me shudder, think, and become a fiction writer. What if it did happen? What if you were trapped in someone's world with them playing with you? Christopher Pike explores this with depth, emotion, and searing pain, making it number one on my top ten Pike List. Up there with it is Sati, Master of Murder, the Last Vampire series, See You Later, Witch, Remember Me, and Fall into Darkness. All of the others are just as good. Pike rarely hits a sour note. I read his books over and over again, ever since I was about 13. I'm 22 now and I advise you, if you love suspense, sci-fi, deep characters, mystery, and Vampires, start in on his books. Even if you're past the suggested reading level!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Whisper of death is the best christopher pike book i have ever read.....i love this book!!!!!!! it was different than the other books i have read of his.

I've read it 4 times and it never gets old. I've practically memorized it. I love the mystery in \\"where did everybody go?\\" kinds of books. It is infused with awesome little poem/stories like my favorite \\"Holt Skater Takes a Walk\\". I might read it again. Words cannot discribe how excellent this book is. You'll feel like you're there in Salem with them. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"Whisper of Death has an intriguing premise. What if you woke up and all the people of the world had vanished? That is what happens to eighteen year-old Roxanne (Rox) and her boyfriend Pepper. All the stores are open and stocked with goods, and eventually they find three other teens: jerk Helter, nerd Stan, and beautiful Leslie. The teens soon find that the situation has something to do with Betty Sue, a classmate who killed herself three weeks ago.The premise was great, and so is the writing in the first third of the book. I keep a journal, and if I see a quote I like from a book, I jot it in my journal for future inspiration. I wrote three sentences from Whisper of Death. The writing was that beautiful.But as the story progresses, and the true horror of the situation is revealed, the story is too bleak and depressing. I didn't feel the end wrapped things up. I do not agree with the reason for the dead world - Pike said some statements about God that suggest He is not All-Powerful.Last, there was a lot of sex in the story, and suggestions of incest. I don't think teens should be having sex. However, Pike discusses abortion a bit, which I feel is well-done.Character development is great here, as well as the eerie setting. I don't feel the plot development built to a strong middle and powerful ending. It just kind of petered out."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"okay, i was honestly rather surprised at the sexual basis of this whole book. i wasnt really expecting it from a young adult genre book. still, it was an interesting read. i deduced the relative ending early on in the story, so i wasnt suprised by the ending. this certainly is not one i'd consider to be the better of pike's work, but it's still good. if you like twisted stories, and don't have issues with teen sexuality or abortion, then this would possibly be of interest to you."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This was a great book, but not scary. This had an amazing plot, great charecters, and Betty Sue was great. Betty Sue was actually a witch for any one who wants to know. The ending though is confusing, was it a dream, or was it real? Only thing we know is Rox died during the abortion."},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"This book was flawless in every definition of the word. One of my top 5 favorite books of all time. Though Christopher Pike writes teenage horror, his prose and ingenious ideas come off better and indefinitely more enjoyable that any other author I've read, including adult novels as well. Im 23 and devour his novellas in one sitting. His blend of mystery, intrigue, horror, and spirituality make for a perfect combination in almost every one of his books.Betty Sue was one of the most mysterious and horrific villians in any piece of fiction I have read thus far, and the dark setting stirred feelings of terror in me till I was finished with the book. Still hours after reading, I feel a slight chill, and the ending was absolutely brilliant. Trust me when I say that it will catch you off guard. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","review":"I am 29 years old and read most of the Christopher pike books published before 1996 when I was in middle and high school.

Particularly useful if the reader has the basics on the ideology of colonialization, Albert Memmi, Franz Fanon, Edward Said etc. Or the other way around: for the reader who is reading up on colonial writings would find the non-Western discourse on colonialization interesting, the discourse on racial destiny and the Japanese \\"burden\\" to enlighten Asia, compared to the \\"White Man's burden.\\"The second half of this book catalogues, with official figures and many personal accounts of Japanese life in Korea, for the middle-class and aspiring middle-class entrepreneurs who sought to take advantage of the colonial government and the expansionist policies of the time. And it is particularly useful as a (scholarly) portrait of people, history written from the bottom up, instead of mainly from governments policy and war.The book is written by a Japan scholar, from Japanese documents, so the reader must take into account the sources (and sympathies) involved, the author's lack of current Korean, Korean sources and scholarship, and the text's (near) absence of Korean agency alongside the efforts at Japanese economic absorption. It offers only a hint (in the occasional phrase) at the tolls of economic policies on \\"normal\\" Korean people as people (human beings with lives and names), in its report of the lives of \\"normal\\" Japanese. But perhaps that is not this volume's purpose.For a volume written 10 years ago, it's a valuable and readable resource, more useful when read with the collected essays in \\"Colonial Modernity in Korea\\" that was published around the same time (Eds. Gi-wook Shin and Michael Robinson, 1998) for a fleshed out view of life in the late 19th century and early 20th.Hopefully, almost 10 years after this volume, and with the emerging generation of East Asian scholars, trained in Korean, Japanese, and Chinese, we'll find fuller, more nuanced and complex accounts of history."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"The author reviews the history behind the annexation of Korea and presents it in the context of the industrialization of Japan. On a conceptual level the book is intriguing, but I feel that it trivializes the ethnic cleansing performed by the Japanese on the Korean race. The author admittedly knows that his research was biased by the generous amount of Japanese documents and not only the lack of Korean documents but his inability to read Korean language. All in all its worthwhile for readers interested in recent Asian history, Japan's industrial movement, or understanding Korean political history."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"I wrote a thesis in college about the Japanese seizure of Korea, and my main argument was that there was no nefarious plot to take over Korea; rather, the annexation was the result of conflicting elements within the Japanese government. (The annexation was, of course, a victory for the reactionary elements.)This book illustrates that there WERE elements within the Japanese government who wanted to help Korea reform. They certainly had ulterior (read: self-centered) motives in doing so, namely economic/financial gain. But there was, at least according to this book, a noted absence of imperialistic/expansionist attitudes by Meiji Japan towards Yi Choson Korea, at least for a time.It is a challenging examination of that time from the Japanese point of view, and it certainly merits a reading from the serious historian."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"This is a scholarly work and not \\"popular history.\\" I say the book is important because this is really not a covered subject. Aside from being a bit boring and confusing for people not an expert in Japanese political hisotry during Meiji, I found it disturbing that the author cited only Japanese and English sources. And the majority of English sources are old (1960s). In the intro, the author freely admits he neither speaks or reads Korean (!)So, this is a one sided version of history (from the imperialist side). We will have to wait for some of the very good Korean accounts to be written or translated into English. In the meantime, try Bruce Cumming's work on Korean modern history."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"One of the many aspects of East Asian relations insufficiently appreciated in Western nations is the troubled history of Japan and its neighbors, specifically Korea. Peter Duus' The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1893-1910 is a an economic analysis of the relationship between Japan and Choson Korea before the Japanese Occupation. A very demanding book by a reputable Japan scholar, Abacus and the Sword requires a beginner's acquaintance with Japanese and Korean history, and a knowledge of international relations in the nineteenth century is also helpfulFor those living outside of Korea, the reasons for Meiji Japan's occupation of Korea may seem unimportant, but, in all the countries of Northeast Asia, Japanese responsibility for many actions committed in the 20th Century are highly controversial and relevant. Debates concerning North Korean policy, Japanese militarization, Japanese war guilt, comfort women, Japan's economic recession and endemic corruption are all subjects affected by the histories of Japan and Korea. But this book also contributes to the discussion concerning colonialism and imperialism.Why did an isolationist victim of Western imperialism become a conqueror itself? Instead of championing the rights of weaker nations, Japan determined to imitate it's American transgressors and build an empire of it's own, to compete with the West. This is Duus' starting point, which he painstakingly traces in its political and economic history. Duus argues, that industrialization was the condition for Japanese imperialism, not the reason. Furthermore, British, French, and American government support for empire-building affected how the Japanese government policies worked.Although he admits so himself, I would prefer if Duus had used more Korean sources, especially when discussing the Korean resistance armies (uibyong-gun), but he uncovers the Japanese players and popular Japanese attitudes without bias. The other side of the equation is important, though, namely how Korea fell so easily to foreign domination. Duus also discusses the other international players, Russia and China. And the last chapter on Japanese cultural domination invaluably narrates how Japan obliterated a nascent Korean identity. Still, the Japanese accounts of Korean conditions are insightful, since Korean accounts are sparse and suspect.Given the politicized nature of the two countries' relationship, the reader must be skeptical of any history. Undisputed data is sparse and analysis, particularly on the Korean sides, has progressed little from conspiracy theories. Any amount of sober analysis is welcome, and Duus delivers."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"I was outraged when I started reading this book. I seldom read a history book so biased as this one. If the author had bothered to read Korean history books written by Korean scholars ( and some of them are translated in English for heaven's sake), this book would not have written in this manner.The late 19th century and half part of the 20th century was the darkest period of Korean history. We lost our country and become subjected to the most brutal and oppressive colonization by Japanese government. The atrocities committed to Koreans during this period are only comparable to the Holocaust by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.At the pacific war accelerated, they began to draft Korean men to fight or work in slave like conditions in mines and factories. They took young Korean girls with promises of jobs and then turned them to become &quot; Comfort Women&quot;, the sex slaves of Japanese soldiers in various parts of Asia.The use of Korean language and books were banned. They demanded that we changed our names to Japanse names. The systematic cultural genocide began to escalate. Rice and other crops were taken to Japanese armies and left Korean people in near starvation. Many Koreans left their homeland to China and Manchuria, even Russia in search for better lives.When you write a book about Holocaust, you don't just ask German Nazi soldiers and fail to talk to Jewish victims. And this is exactly what the author had done here.If the German government had paid compensations to various victims of Nazi era, why is it that Japanese government had not paid a cent to numerous victims of their brutality during the war and occupation of Korean penninsula?They still have the arrogance to talk about the superioty of Japanes people and why the annexation of Korea was for the good of Korean people. I demand an apology from the author of this book to all Korean people."},{"Title":"The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895-1910 (Twentieth Century Japan: The Emergence of a World Power)","review":"Somebody says that it was biased because it was written by Japanese documents.

Catton's passion for the subject, combined with his journalistic talents, captured the essence of a fundamental of American mythology. As a boy in Wisconsin he idolized the veterans he came to know in his community and he became committed if not obsessed to learning about them and documenting what he learned. What he learned is one of the great stories in our country's history - the story of the common soldier in the American Civil War. It is not an attempt at applying the academic method, it is journalism - and first rate journalism., and great story telling. Yet, it is still historically relevant and significant. Catton was able to put the various complex subplots in the perspective of the maturation of the democratic nation and its institutions (for example, Indiana Governor O. P. Morton's wartime state dictatorship and the implications for states' rights in relationship to the national government). The famous figures are included, and humanized, but it is really the story of the rank and file. The common soldier, who suffered unmercifully under incompetent leadership, wasteful bureaucracies, political maneuvering, a multitude of physical hardships, bad food and medicine and every other handicap imaginable (including death and dismemberment in what was then a new and highly efficient killing field of warfare) - and yet somehow emerged victorious. It is not a romantic story, but it is a story full of praise for those who served their nation in one of its great defining moments. There isn't any sympathy for the opposing Confederates - neither is their any condemnation or hatred (because the soldiers themselves did not condemn or hate). For the hard core ACW armchair campaigner there is still much to be gleaned from a read or re-read of Catton's trilogy. For the casual reader, this work is a great starting place to understand the ACW - the conflict that, in Catton's view, framed and defined the unique history of the United States. There are a few misconceptions scattered about - but no matter, this is the stuff of legends. There are conclusions drawn that are not thoroughly supported - again, no matter. Catton told a great story greatly, and it has stood the test of time as a benchmark accomplishment."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, Bruce Catton is considered to be one of the best authors to read if you are interested in the Civil War. Despite many recommendations from others I had not read any of Catton's books until now. Having just finished Mr. Lincoln's Army, I can finally understand why Mr. Catton has received so many accolades (to include the Pulitzer prize). This book is an outstanding introduction to General McClellan, and the Army he commanded.I truly enjoyed this book for several reasons. First, the writing style is excellent. This book is not boring history (facts, figures, hyposthesis, conclusion). Instead, Catton tells the interesting story of what happened to the Federal Army from the beginning of the war up until the battle of Antietam. The book reads more like a good novel, than a history text book. Having read many Civil War authors, I would put Catton in the top category.Secondly, Catton includes many observations and stories from the everyday soldier which add vivid details to events as they unfold. His description of the Battle of Antietam comes alive when he includes descriptions of what the men who fought actually saw and experienced. I learned a lot and gained new insight into many events which speaks volumes to the quality of this book, considering it was written back in the 1950s.Lastly, Catton stays focused on his topic and does not try to cover too much material. The book is about the Union Army, so he does not waste time getting into too many details about what was happening on the Confederate side. I enjoyed this perspective because Catton succesfully answers the question of why the Union Army could not defeat the Confederates early in the war, despite the great advantage of resources that it possessed.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War. Whether you are a &quot;Civil War Buff&quot;, or just trying to find out more about this pivotal event in American history, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"There are so many great Civil War authors out there whose work I enjoy and admire--McPherson, Foote, Sears, and others; but Bruce Catton is, in my humble estimation, the best of all time.It amazes me how consistently interesting Catton's writing is. You would think that with all of the books that he has written on the Civil War that the inevitable overlap would cause some books to be less than fresh--but that is never the case. Above all, I enjoy Catton's writing because of the poignancy that he can convey when he describes a scene. Many a time have I been so moved while reading his books that I have had to pause to collect myself, and then I re-read the emotional scene in order to savor the enjoyment again.Read this trilogy and you will find out what I mean."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"What a wonderful book. I was so lucky to be able to pick up a great condition trilogy of the AOP (Mr. Lincoln's Army, Glory Road, and Stillness at Appomatox).Catton's style is so amazing. You get the broad strokes of tactical movement, political wranglings, down in the ditch tales, camp life, and of course the human equation.Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.I must say, I'm glad I had a little working knowledge of the ACW before reading. He does have a tendency to just start up. For instance, Lincoln's Army starts in the middle of 2nd Manassas, then kind of works back into a flash back and fills in some of the bios. This may be a little confusing for an un-informed reader. You may want to read a very general, one volume sort of history before moving on to Catton.The good thing though is the book is suitable for a beginner and yet I think the more you know about the ACW, the more you will enjoy it. There are so many great little stories about politicians, soldiers, officers, etc.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton is still the dean of American military historians and the Civil War. He tells his story with wit, verve, accuracy, and the feeling of having been there. Unfortunately, like other great American historians who have passed on, such as John R. Elting, Frederick P. Todd, H. Charles McBarron, and Anne Brown, we won't see his like again.In this marvelous first volume of his trilogy of the great, luckless, and hard-used Army of the Potomac, Catton tells the story of an army in search of a commander that can win with it. After the first botched attempt at First Bull Run, the army gets a commander who knows how to organize and train them, Goerge McClellan. What he cannot do, however, is lead them in combat. McClellan doesn't have the killer instinct of a true independent commander, nor does he have the requisite moral character to send the army into the fire, accept the losses needed to win, and be done with it. What he condemns his beloved army to is three years of defeats and heavy losses, punctuated by the few glorious moments, such as Gettysburg, where, despite the deficiencies of its many commanders, it fights on until final victory.This volume tells of the growing and training of the Army of the Potomac, the heartbreak of the Peninsular Campaign, and the thrown away opportunity at Second Bull Run. We meet famous units, such as the 5th New Hampshire, the immortal Iron Brigade of western regiments, the Irish Brigade under such regimental and brigade commanders as John Gibbon, Israel Richardson, Francis Barlow, Phil Kearney, and Grimes Davis.Grimly enduring, faithful to the Republic, stolid in the defense and gallant in the attack, the Army of the Potomac, repeatedly defeated and badly led at the army level, comes back time and again to face its foe. It is probably the worst led army in American history, but none have been more glorious in the sense that it never quit and gained enduring fame as the outfit that finally defeated Robert E. Lee. This book can stand alone, or with its two companion volumes, Glory Road and A Stillness at Appomattox. This is military history at its best. All are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Catton describes the transformation of the Army of the Potomac from a collection of amateurs into an army of hardened veterans. He particularly brings out the &quot;loss of innocence&quot; at Antietam. His description of Antietam will make you shudder in horror. The fury of battle leaps off the pages as no other civil war author can do. Catton gets inside the head of Gen. McClellan and shows how he repeatedly failed to gain the crushing victory that was always just out of reach. I read the book in two sittings and could not put it down. If you can find a copy, snap it up!"},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton is, in my opinion, the most readable author of American Civil War history. Whenever I've labored through some book I wanted to read but have struggled with, I reward myself with something he has written. This trilogy is, as all his work is, thoroughly researched and very balanced. It would be hard to detect any bias in this native Michiganer of the first half of the 20th century, though I vaguely suspect he had more sympathy for the South, if only for the \\"pluck\\" (he likes that word in fact) of their \\"David vs. Goliath\\" undertaking. In any case, this first volume delivers a very important message in a very complete way, and it's a message I had never before considered: The Army of the Potomac's loyalty to the government was never compromised, but it was fretted about in some pretty high places, perhaps not the least important of which was in the White House. So completely was this Grand Army made in the image of its creator, McClellan, that his removal gave cause for many to hold their collective breath and pray that it would remain intact and loyal to the Union once stripped of its beloved leader. That it did, and the rest, as they say, is history. McClellan is thoroughly understood by the reader of this work. He is a man of some complexity and some sympathy, diminished by his ego perhaps. Despite many lost opportunities that would have made the war much shorter and correspondingly less bloody, he was a good soldier caught between military logic and political caution. In fact, Catton points out to us that never before had there been a general of a great army of a democracy, and that that arrangement itself is tenuous at best. In the end, we understand that the Army of the Potomac was Lincoln's Army for just as long as he remained the Commander-in-Chief, and despite their love for McClellan, they always stood ready to do what was asked of them."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Mr. Lincoln's Army tells the story of the Army of the Potomac from the beginning of the Civil War through the Battle of Antietam. The history is told from the point of view of the soldiers in the army, but it also explains the larger political and military issues that affected the country. The book is full of vivid details that help you understand how the soldiers really experienced the war and why they did what they did. If you don't know the history of the Civil War and have ever wondered why so many people are fascinated by it, this would be a great place to start. I have read a number of books about the Civil War, and was familiar with most of the general history, and I still found the book enthralling."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"In an earlier era of scholarship, Shelby Foote and Bruce Catton representd the very best of a narrative tradition of history: the Civil War as epic human drama, peopled by individuals who made and were made by events. \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" is the first of a three volume set on the long-suffering Union Army of the Potomac that spent four years in bloody and often unsuccessful battle with the Confederacy's Army of Northern Virginia, finally closing out the war at Appomattox in 1865.\\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" covers the early years of the Civil War, as the Union stood up an army to defend Washington and to take Richmond, and sought for an effective commander. It is very distinctly the story of George McClellan, the young Napoleon-to-be, who built the Army of the Potomac into an effective fighting force, but who failed on the Virginia Peninsula and at Antietam to show the kind of killer instinct that might have ended the conflict.It is also the story of the political cross-currents behind the war, as a conflict to reunite the Union slowly also turned into a war to end slavery. As political attitudes hardened, so did conduct on the battlefield; what was once militarily sufficient might become politically inadequate. Catton captures the dilemma of generals caught in the changing approach to the war.Catton, a journalist before he became an historian, brings to his task a superb command of the English language and an ability to capture the drama of war at the level of the individual soldier and of the general. Despite its age, \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" is very highly recommended to fans of the Civil War as a superb reading experience."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"When it comes to writing, Catton's style is nearly impeccable. When reading Catton's book, you get the feeling that this is a great writer writing about the Civil War, not a great Civil War historian who is writing.Catton paints with broad strokes regarding the campaigns of the Army of the Potomoc up to November 1862. People who are interested in the Civil War will definitely want to read more detailed histories of the individual campaigns, but for those who have already done so, reading Catton is great because he ties them all together and really gets into the psyche of the soldiers and the army as a whole.Much of the book focuses of course on McClellan, who is persona non grata in most histories being written these days. But Catton is able to evoke some sympathy for McClellan's odd position in the power struggle between the military commanders and the Administration's politics, let alone the power struggle within the Administration itself.All in all, this is a great book for people who have read about the Civil War in depth and are looking for enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Around the time of the Civil War's Centennial celebration, Bruce Catton dominated Civil War writing in this country. His books still speak to the reader in a literary style that brings the feeling of the war and its participants very much alive.&quot;Mr. Lincoln's Army&quot; is the first of his three-part trilogy on the Army of the Potomac. Catton traces the tragic evolution of this army -- always a superb fighting force in the ranks -- from a misused and abused weapon to the anvil that finally broke the rebellion.In this book, Catton focuses on one of America's few men of Destiny -- at least until he had the opportunity to confront destiny in the face -- General George B. McClellan. McClellan picked up the pieces of the Army of the Potomac twice. First, after its inauspicious start at the First Battle of Bull Run and again after the army's route following the second tussle with the Confederacy near that same small battlefield.McClellan was good at everything in which a general had to excel except fighting. An outstanding organizer and moral builder, &quot;Little Mac&quot; trained the army to a professional level and instilled in it an esprit de corps that helped sustain it through disappointment and disaster.The one thing McClellan could not do, as Catton illustrates through his focus on the Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Antietam, was use this superbly honed weapon decisively in battle. Always thinking he was outnumbered when in fact he held the advantage in forces, and lacking the inner confidence to take even good battle risks, he wasted multiple opportunities to end the war (or at least the existence of the Army of Northern Virginia) and save years of conflict and hundreds of thousands of lives. McClellan ends up as the ultimate in tragic figures, outwardly seeming so perfect for the job and bearing the loftiest of expectations as a savior, but inwardly cowed by fears and suspicions that he wasn't up to it.This book is a wonderful and evocative portrait of the spirit of the Army of the Potomac in the McClellan era. Catton's great strength is the use of anecdotes to draw the big picture and sniff out &quot;what was in the air&quot; at different points in time. Thus his books are not exhaustive campaign and battle portraits and are short on troop movements and deployments of particular units. He seeks to demonstrate what was actually happening when all the personalities and actors of a moment are factored together. It is a big picture look at his subject buttressed by observations, iconic stories and the unusual that allows the reader to understand the feeling that surrounded events.Thus, Catton focuses mightily on the relationship between McClellan and Lincoln's administration, his relationship and the performance of senior officers and in deciphering the motives, mindsets and chess game that seemed to envelope significant figures in the Army of the Potomac to a much greater degree than any other Union or Confederate army engaged in the conflict.As all of Catton's writings on the Civil War are, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton is one of my favorite Civil War authors - along with Shelby Foote - and thankfully I don't have to make the choice between the two. Catton's books are labeled \\"narrative\\" history - combining history, battle scenes, anecdotes, first-person descriptions, analysis and mini-bios of the historical figures involved - all tied together in great narratives with excellent writing and compelling \\"story telling\\". Reading a book by Catton is similar to reading a novel in the best sense - never boring, always engaging and difficult to put down. And regardless if you are a Civil War \`novice\\" or \\"expert\\" - Catton does not disappoint.Mr. Lincoln's Army is the first book of the author's trilogy chronicling The Army of the Potomac, covering the first 14 months or so of its existence. General George McClellan is the focus, but by no means the \\"star\\" in this saga, for The Army of the Potomac has that role. The book opens with the Second Battle of Bull Run, (August 1862) - during which time McClellan was somewhat on the sidelines - and John Pope was on the losing end of a military \\"encounter\\" with Robert E. Lee and his Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.The story then jumps back in time, (June 1862), tracking McClellan's meteoric rise to the head of the army and then his less than successful Peninsula Campaign. The conclusion of this first volume is the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in U.S. military history. The First Battle of Bull Run, also part of this Army's early days is here, but not covered in detail.The book's theme, told from countless perspectives, is that during these early months of the war this Union Army of brave and courageous men was ill-used, time and time again, by its commanders, who were either unwilling or unable - or both - to lead them to the victory it deserved. Just the description/analysis of McClellan's personality/mind-set, his effect on the Army of the Potomac and Catton's narrative of the Battle of Antietam make this book well worth the read, but that's only part of the story you will find here.Mr. Lincoln's Army was published 60 years ago, but the book is still available, though you may have to do a little looking around for it. Trust me it's worth the effort to secure this book and the two that follow it for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton was the premier historian of an earlier era of Civil War students and buffs, an era that valued the well-written narrative history over the scholarly study. Bruce Catton, a journalist before he became an historian, used his prodigous writing gifts to pen the history of the Army of the Potomac, that long-suffering Union Army that fought the Civil War in the Eastern Theater and endured many mediocre commanders along the way. This volume is one of a set of three, but can be enjoyed on its own.\\"Glory Road\\" captures the middle years of the Civil War as experienced by the Army of the Potomac, roughly from the Fredericksburg Campaign in late 1862 to the tide-turning Battle of Gettysburg in July 1864. It is Catton's gift to recount the story from multiple points of view, from private to president, while making the speakers come to life in well-written vignettes. Catton covers the tactical battle at the point of the bayonet and the political struggle in progress behind the lines, as a war to reunite the Union hardened into a war to end slavery. Catton portrays the Civil War as the nation-changing epic that it was.The scholarship of \\"Glory Road\\" may be a little dated a half century on, but its narrative has lost none of its power to move the reader with its intimate sense of the soldiers it portrays. It is very highly recommended as entertaining narrative history to students and fans of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"I first read Catton's trilogy at age 17, before I went to Vietnam. I enjoyed the books tremendously and Catton started a lifetime interest in the American Civil War. I thought he was an outstanding writer, but with the hubris of youth, I rated him as a bit of a lightweight, a fine storyteller and nothing more. In the past month, at age 60, I read Mr. Lincoln's Army again. I was amazed at how much wiser Catton has become. He is the still the best historian I've read at explaining the interplay between the political and military factors of the war. He also is phenomenal at capturing the experience and awakening of the common soldier, and by extension the forging of new American identity.He deals fearlessly with many of the controversies that still trouble historians and Civil War buffs. For example, historians still argue the question of whether the outcome was foreordained, whether the advantages of the North in men and materiel were insuperable no matter what individuals did. This is a popular theory, comforting to those who like deterministic approaches as well as the \\"Lost Cause\\" partisans. I've always thought it was a load of bull, and Catton deals with it forcefully. He practically says that if the Indiana private hadn't found the Confederate battle plan before Antietam, the history of the United States would have been much different. And if McClellan had made full use of the information and destroyed Lee's army, the history of the United States would have been far different, not necessarily in the ways we might think."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton writes memorably about the officers and strategy that guided the Union Army in the early days of the Civil War, but if \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" is about anything it is about the title subject, common soldiers who fought hard and loyally even as their sacrifices on the altar of freedom served no apparent positive purpose.\\"From first to last the Army of the Potomac was unlucky,\\" he writes near the outset of this first volume of his \\"Army Of The Potomac\\" trilogy published in 1951. \\"It fought for four years, and it took more killing, proportionately, than any army in American history, and its luck was always out; it did its level best and lost; when it won the victory was always clouded by a might-have-been...\\"Such was the case with Antietam, a battle fought in Maryland in September 1862 which forms \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army's\\" big climax. Union commander George B. McClellan found himself literally holding the playbook of opposing leader Robert E.

The result was the bloodiest battle of the war, which Catton calls a tactical Union victory though still a might-have-been in that Lee and his army lived to fight three more years.Catton's portrait of McClellan as ego-choked Hamlet is masterfully nuanced, not as venal a man as others have painted him but too prone to self-exultation and myopia. Other Northern generals are limned in capsule form; Israel Richardson dresses so slovenly his men mistake him for an aged wagon driver, Ambrose Burnside is honorable but hopelessly out of his depth as he waits too long to cross Antietam Creek, Phil Kearny is a fire-eating one-armed Patton of his time able to laugh when another general, Otis Howard, says after having lost his opposite arm: \\"We can buy our gloves together.\\"The lot of the soldiers is Catton's chief concern here, though. In a foreword he writes of his boyhood awe of the Civil War veterans in his midst and his surprise at finding them now two generations gone. It's Catton's desire to speak for them that informs the strongest passages of this book.So eager were they to go to war that, Catton writes, underage boys would write the number \\"18\\" on a slip of paper, stick it in their shoe, and then tell the recruiter in all honesty: \\"I'm over 18.\\" They made bad food, smoked pipes, and chinned with each other and sometimes the enemy about their commanders. After battle, the survivors picked their way through the charnel house that had, hours before, been a pleasant glen.\\"Many dead had gone unburied in the swamps and thickets, others have been given a mere covering of earth which the rains quickly washed away, and anyway, nobody had warned these boys that one of the worst things about war is the way it stinks.\\"It's to this story that Catton returns, again and again, sometimes losing himself in flights of poetry and rumination that feel excessive because they are. The book is oddly structured, beginning right after what would be the middle of the period covered, with McClellan watching as his army is temporarily taken from him and slaughtered. This necessitates not one but two jumps, backward to McClellan's first period of command (until the summer of 1862 at Malvern Hill) then forward to the lead-up to Antietam. It gets confusing.I found \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" a slow starter. Once it gets to Antietam, though, it grabs you with an intensity that doesn't relent. Catton still waxes eloquent, but the reveries feel more earned with the narrative otherwise being so bleak and tense. Soldiers fight and die and scream and go a little mad as Catton catalogs every charge and setback in vivid style. It's a masterpiece of historical writing that leaves you with an appetite for the rest of this revered trilogy."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"As is the case with the other Catton books I've read, this is an easy to read, narrative history of the Civil War. This particular volume focuses on the Army of the Potomac under the command of Gen. George McClellan, from his re-organization of the army following the loss at the first Battle of Manassas to the devastating bloodshed at Antietam (which remains, even today, the single bloodiest day in American military history).The story of this army under McClellan is a story of missed opportunities. Time and time again, McClellan failed to recognize and capitalize on chances to hand the Confederacy decisive losses, ones that may well have ended the war in its early days had they happened.I've long understood that McClellan is considered to be an incompetent commander, but after reading this book, my assessment is that he wasn't so much incompetent as he was overly cautious (to the point of incompetence). He relied far too heavily on faulty information from spies, especially in the face of battlefield reconnaissance, which led him to believe that Lee had far more troops than was in fact possible. While there were also political reasons for his actions, his fear of being surprised by superior enemy numbers was, perhaps, his greatest handicap.This failure of leadership ensured that the war would drag on for years, becoming an epic struggle that would forever change the texture and structure of America."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Part 2 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy of the Civil War is an interesting look at the road to Gettysburg through the eyes of the army of the Potomac. By the end of this book the army is ready to go and win under a new commander but you can see how the politics involved have worn down the morale of the army. It is very well written using historical accounts and while newer works have added more and disproved some of Catton's conclusions it is still one of the best books on the civil war."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Part 1 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy on the Civil War is a great way to start learning about one of the most interesting conflicts in American history. While recent accounts offer more and have gone into a better analysis using modern historical tools this still remains one of the most interesting looks at classical history. This book really focuses on the relationship of McClellan to the soldiers and does a decent job using historical documents to make his point. While there are many rich documents out there and the status of McClellan has changed since this book was written it is still an interesting account of the time."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Catton has taken the task of reporting about the Union side of the Civil War and brought it together in a very well written, entertaining and intriguing book. Being the first book in a trilogy Catton focuses on early leadership, high morale, Washington politics and the creation of McClellan as the leader of the Army of the Potomac. Catton has brought to life the trials and hardships that the army suffered and endured during 1861 and 1862. In this text, Catton reveals Lincoln's desires for quick resolution while leadership fails or doesn't take advantage of manpower to end the war. In a constant struggle to find the right general McClellan appears to be the right person for the job although Republicans in the Whitehouse fear he may not have the heart for it as his believed to be a solid democrat, rather over cautious, misinformed and downright treasonous. Catton follows the army chronologically and brings the fighting to the forefront from Manassas to Antietam. With this we get great insight as to McClellan's motives and conflicts that express the problems of the army during the early days of the war."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"&quot;Mr. Lincoln's Army&quot; is the first volume in Bruce Catton's celebrated trilogy chronicling the history of the Army of the Potomac during the Civil War, one of the most exciting war narratives in literature. Catton had grown up in Michigan around men who had served in that Army and these books were his attempt &quot;to find out about the things which the veterans never discussed.&quot; Catton relies on a host of source material to weave his tales, from autobiographies of Generals McClellan and Howard, to the correspondence of Generals Sedgwick and Meade, to dozens of soldiers' reminiscences and regimental histories, to military histories relating to specific battles, campaign, military tactics and weapons. As you read these books you are always feel that you are dealing with living literature rather than dead history. This is because Catton privileges &quot;The Diary of an Enlisted Man&quot; by Lawrence Van Alstyne and the history of &quot;The 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry in the War of the Rebellion&quot; more than he does &quot;McClellan's Own Story.&quot;&quot;Mr. Lincoln's Army&quot; covers the Army of the Potomac from its creation to the Battle of Antietam. Despite the title the central figure in the book is General George B. McClellan, the war's most paradoxical figure who gave this Army the training it needed to become a first rate military unit and who then refused to use the great army he had created. There are 6 sections to the book: (1) &quot;Picture-Book War&quot; actually covers the events in 1862 that led to McClellan being placed back in charge of the Army of the Potomac, setting up a rather ironic perspective for what happens both before and after that decision; (2) &quot;The Young General&quot; provides the background on McClellan and details his formation of the Army; (3) &quot;The Era of Suspicion&quot; covers the ill-fated Peninsula Campaign; (4) &quot;An Army on the March&quot; centers on the Second Battle of Manassas/Bull Run when the Army was under John Pope; (5) &quot;Opportunity Knocks Three Times&quot; begins with the great intelligence coup of the Civil War, the discovery of Lee's Special Order No. 191 and establishes how the upcoming battle was handed to McClellan on a silver plate; (6) &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot; tells the story of how McClellan snatched defeat--or at least a bloody tie--from the jaws of victory.Bruce Catton's books on the Civil War are eminently readable, and with his History of the Army of the Potomac he finds his perfect level, writing about the men who were the common soldiers as much if not more than he does about the generals and politicians. You certainly get the feeling his heart was in these volumes more than it was in his larger histories of the Civil War. For those who are well versed in the grand details of the war, these books provide a more intimate perspective on those great battles."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"One reason I am a life-long Civil War buff is because of the pleasant memories I have as a teenager reading several of Mr. Catton's books. Just recently I bought some used ones at a flea market and have decided to read them again. This book is the first one I have reread.Rereading this book reminded me why Catton is one of the best writers on comprehensive or themed Civil War histories. He was not known for many titles on individual battles but instead focused on particular themes (US Grant taking command of the Army of the Potomac in 1864, a comprehensive history of the Army of the Potomac, etc.).Mr. Lincoln's Army covers the time from Bull Run to the Battle of Antietam, mainly from the Union perspective. Yes, the folks who like a histories on the Confederacy may like not the perspective, but the book is fair in evaluating the leaders of the Army of the Potomac. The book also has Catton's unique writing style - excellent descriptions of troop movements, battles, and personalities.The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was not the content or style of the text but the maps. The maps were few and were of okay quality. To be fair, the book was written in the 1950s, so one should not expect the quality of maps one sees in newer titles.Complaint aside, read the book and enjoy what is in my humble opinion one of the best histories of the Army of the Potomac.Recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"This is the second of Bruce Catton's \\"army of the Potomac\\" books that I have read. I have the whole series but let them sit on my shelf for years until I discovered Catton's genius for communicating history while reading \\"Glory Road\\". Some historical books are written by persons adept at research but short on writing skills. Others are adept at writing but short on research skills. A good book is when you find someone good at both. Catton EXCELS at both. His ability to show us the Civil War through the eyes of the participants is quite impressive. It's even more impressive when realizing that he takes us across a lot of ground in a mere 339 pages yet never lets us feel that we missed anything nor that we were bogged down in anything. He gives us his philosophy yet seems to try and give us enough leeway to decide for ourselves on a number of issues such as the merits of McClellan as commanding general.\\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" covers the war from post First Bull Run with emphasis on the Penninsula Campaign and Antietam. Along the way we get a lot of insight into the politics that had many a politican exasperated with McClellan while the majority of soldiers worshipped him. As we explore the book, we frequently come across many a sideline subject. For example, he covers in this vollume the food that the common soldier had to eat. It was surprizing how thorough he covered the subject in far fewer pages that I encountered in other books.I've read plenty of fiction that wasn't written as well as Catton writes. Given the fascinating subject matter, this book was a pleasure to read. I can't wait to read \\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\"."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"I must have spent a small fortune on books on the War Between the States. My grandfather passed on two passions: history and books. And one name is repeated over and over in my collection: Bruce Catton. There are others, who equal the superior history writing of Catton, but Bruce Catton transcends writing - he opens a door on his time machine and takes you on the amazing journey into the past.The War Between the States was a complex chunk of American history, and saying it was fought to free the slaves is bad information. Less than 2% of the population of the South owned slaves. Many young boys in the South, who fought and gave their lives for the Confederacy had, never ever seen one. Yes, it was a factor, a rallying cry for humanity, but it was not THE single cause for the War. Even Lincoln was willing to see slavery continue - IF it meant preserving the Union. There were many causes, and Bruce Catton helps you understand them. He also brings to life the men that were vital to the conflict. Starting with this volume is an excellent point to get to know Catton and his beautiful prose. He does not tell you history, he makes you live it, down to the smallest detail. He makes it so accessible, so alive. He puts you into the mind set of Lincoln, McClellan, even the common soldier, so you understand well what drove people to these extremes, to life and death decisions.When one reads Catton, it is like reading the words of someone who lived through the battles, the hardship. Yet, his prose reads more on par with beautiful fiction, so that you forget you are reading just plain factual history.Bruce Catton had the enviable position of being a small boy in Michigan where so many Veterans of the War resided. They talked, telling their tales of the War Between the States, and Bruce listened. He passed on this gift, presenting us with those tales, in a form that few historical writers ever achieve.In this volume, Catton introduces you to a Lincoln you have never known, to the handsome, dashing and well-loved 'Little Mac' General George McClellan, and their protracted struggle over the Army of the Potomac, how each wanted it run. Catton shows this single loggerhead between these powerful men likely caused the war to drag on for nearly a year longer than it would have otherwise. Two strong figures, determined the army would do as they wished. McClellan saw Lincoln as an ignorant country bumpkin, unworthy to be President. Having his eyes on being Chief of State himself, and knowing being General of the Army of the Potomac could make that dream real, he was determined not to listen to Lincoln. Lincoln saw \`Little Mac' as all show and no action. He just wanted a General who would fight. Their continual maneuverings reminds one of a chess match, showing Lincoln losing patience and possessing the incisive ability to assess people, handle them. On the other side, there is Little Mac with his arrogance and gross underestimating of Lincoln, blinded by his vainglory, and more concerned with his popularity and ambitions, than what was best for the nation.This is intended as a three-volume set with GLORY ROAD and A STILLNESS AT APPOMATTOX in that order. Historical writing at its best.So, if you are interested in the Civil War, perhaps the films GETTYSBURG and GOD AND GENERALS make you hunger for a better understanding of why it happened, who these people were, you cannot do any better than starting your journey here."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Bruce Catton's trilogy, \\"The Army of the Potomac,\\" is well written and provides readers with a good sense of this star-crossed force, often led by generals not worthy of the troops themselves. This volume, \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army,\\" is the first in this three book set. To a large extent, the book is the story of an army devoted to General George McClellan becoming Mr. Lincoln's Army. As eloquently stated by author Bruce Catton at the close (Page 332): \\"[The young soldiers] were not McClellan's army any longer, and they never could be again; they were Mr. Lincoln's army now, or the country's, or the army of some inscrutable tide that was flowing down the century to change everything they were used to and break the way for something unimaginable.\\"In this volume, we see how McClellan reshaped the army into a fine fighting force--but also how McClellan's own demons kept him from using that force in a way as to defeat Confederate forces. He did not have the will to fight fiercely and conjured up superior forces, much larger than what in reality the southern forces actually possessed. The book also provides an interesting character study of differences between leaders--John Pope and George McClellan among Union leaders. There is also nice juxtaposition of the difference between fighting corps/division commanders, such as Phil Kearny, and McClellan.This is not a detailed history, but the book does provide enough detail to get a sense of the major battles of the Army of the Potomac until McClellan was cashiered by President Lincoln. First and Second Manassas, the Peninsular Campaign, and the slugfest at Antietam. Catton is very good at developing character sketches of key actors, and the reader gets a fine sense of them.This is a book that still works, over half a century since it was originally written. Very literate and a good read."},{"Title":"Mr. Lincoln's army","review":"Frankly I am at a loss of the glowing reviews of Catton's book. Admittedly his discussion of the personalities at the command level is astute (if a bit out of date at this time), but the historical narrative is dull and plodding.I picked up the book with the sole intention of getting a better perspective on who Halleck and Hooker were. Catton provided much insight, particularly the surrounding political machinations, manipulation and in-fighting between Union officers and Lincoln's cabinet. Catton's writing, however got in the way - I found him stylistically dull. I was similarly disappointed by Catton's writing about the general disposition of the Union army, particularly during the work-up prior to Chancellorsville.Taking into consideration that it has been over fifty years since its publication, the book is not without its merits. However, many of the points Catton makes are not as revealing or revolutionary (especially regarding the political infighting and jostling for position). With a modern eye, I found his writing style to be dry and difficult going. For the speicalist in the Civil War, this book may have appeal. For those with only a passing interest, I would look elsewhere."},{"Title":"HERE COMES ALEX PUMPERNICKEL!","review":"Unlike many wordless books, the stories in this one are short and incredibly easy to follow. They're written in a sort of comic-strip style that means you don't have to spend much time puzzling out what just happened.I bought several books this year to give to my niece's pre-k class before it goes. This one isn't my favorite, no, but it's pretty good. Each story is short and funny, and the punchlines certainly made the four year old crack up laughing!Some people object to wordless picture books on principle, because they are unfamiliar with them. This is what I have to say to that:Wordless picture books are PERFECT for pre-readers. It gives them the ability to read a book - REALLY own the experience instead of just \\"playing\\" as they must do when they can't understand the words - on their own. It gives them practice in putting together stories and working out details from context. And it allows them to be the expert at some activity that is usually restricted to adults and older children in their life - reading a book.By that same token, they are also ideal for early readers. It's non-threatening, and yet it's still a way to practice following a storyline. Reading is more than just mechanically putting together sounds and reciting them, after all. Many people are impressed by a five year old who can say, word-perfect, some complex piece he or she \\"reads\\" from a page, but later they find out that the child has no idea what they just read and wasn't thinking of reading as an exercise in gleaning meaning from text, but merely as reciting memorized sounds and letter combinations. Working out the story for themselves from a book with no words is a wonderful way to practice this sort of \\"reading for meaning\\".But what of the child who stumbles in reading? Well, the child who stumbles when reading but can tell you WHAT they read is light-years ahead of the one who sounds pretty but doesn't grasp the meaning. At any rate, this child is still getting much needed practice in the conventions of reading without the letters to stress and trip them up.Of course, you don't want the only book in your house to be a wordless picture book, I understand that, because children do need print to practice reading, but a few are a WONDERFUL thing for a child. And who has just one book, anyway?"},{"Title":"100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park","review":"The most enjoyable hours of my life have been spent hiking in Yosemite and Mammoth and this guide is absolutely indispensible for the novice or experienced hiker.The photographs themselves are breathtaking; all in color and printed on hih quality, glossy paper. The photos give you an excellent idea of what each hike is going to look like. I use it almost daily during hiking season and it helps in selecting hikes, planning them, reaching the trailhead and gauging whether a hike will be worthwhile. Each hike contains an accurate and fairly detailed description of the rigors of each trek. Occasionally I quibble with the author's ranking of a given hike, but usually he is on the mark.A few cautionary notes: there are no detailed maps in the book, except general maps which introduce the hiker to each specific place. The map for the John Muir trail, for example, is very basic. Don't expect detailed maps for each hike because there are none. The descriptions of how to reach each trailhead are excellent, unless you have little experience with Yosemite.My favorite part of the book is that the Touloume Meadows High Country area is not neglected, nor the great hikes around Hetch Hetchy. Equally detailed are the fantastic hikes in Mammoth, including Ediza and Shadow lakes, Duck pass and Valentine Lake. All in all, a fabulous and beautiful hiking guide."},{"Title":"100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park","review":"Beautiful guide and thorough examination of the myriad of hikes one can take in and around Yosemite National Park. Excellent graphics and map layouts. Detailed description of the hikes, trailheads and parking. Good descriptions of what you can expect to encounter along the way as far as hiking time, high points in elevation you will encounter (along with the hikes averaged elevation gain) and the hike's relative difficulty ranked from easy to strenuous (with some hikes running the gamut of just that in the very hike itself). Also, the best seasons for each hike are included.A good job of was also done of including the various contact numbers that might be of interest to those planning to visit the Park plus required permits and tips on what wildlife/insect life you can expect to encounter along the way.The author has thoughtfully included various safety tips concerning what to bring and a nice section on wilderness ethics. For those hikers looking to do a quick scan of what each various hike has to offer, there's a helpful trail index in the back of the book.Personally, my favorite sections were the hikes surrounding Mono Lake, especially hike No. 50 with it's detailed information on the lake itself, it's strange composition and insect inhabitants. A description of Mono and its tufa castles as &quot;a sci-fi dream city&quot; seems entirely appropriate.Special distinction must be made of the book's photographs, most credited to the author, which are gorgeous! Some are simply jaw dropping. Helpfully included in the book's introduction is a section on taking photographs in Yosemite -- although one would be hard-pressed to match some of the photographs he has included. One would hope for a future publication devoted entirely to the author's photographs.Pretty easy to see why &quot;100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park&quot; has recently garnered the prestigious distinction of winning the 2003 National Outdoor Book Award (NOBA) for best guidebook.If you're planning to hike Yosemite, don't leave home without it.

As a reference I backpack for 5 to 15 day trips every year. My wife looked at the book and some of the hikes I had talked about and couldn't figure out the maps.Looking over the book I could see why. The only friendly way to say it is that the maps are pretty and pretty useless. They are the type of maps you would find on a treasure hunt breakfast cereal box and SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY PLANNING PURPOSES. Purchase a topo map from the USGS or a backpacking supply house and then use this book to find out where in Yosemite a described hike really is and what the countryside is like around it.One mile walks look the same as a 16 mile several day hike. Every map takes great license with the topology and direction of orientation. Follow one map to the next on a trail and you will get lost since the first puts north at the top of a page, the next shrinks it and flips north to the bottom of the page and the next slants north off to the left while changing the size of landmarks again.The natural guides are nice. The verbal descriptions are nice. The rating of the hikes are fine. The maps are cute but border on being dangerously so. Sorry but I feel that a hiking guide that has bad maps is not appropriate. It would have been better to have none in the book."},{"Title":"100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park","review":"The only thing not to like about this book is its weight, which discourages you from taking it along on a hike. That aside, it is blessed with great color photos, good trail maps, elevation gains, how to get to the trailhead, and generally everything you need in a hiking guide. If you only buy one Yosemite hiking guide, this should be it."},{"Title":"100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park","review":"Almost didn't get this book because of the reviews I seen saying that the maps were hard to understand. After looking at the preview pages I decided to risk it anyway and I am glad I did. It would really take an idiot to not understand what the maps are doing. They are set up so that you are looking at the trail in 3D from the trailhead, not in a North, South top down orientation. They make great sense when you are standing there with the trail live and in front of you and it does not take much of a stretch of the imagination to figure it out without being there. My one bit of advice, if you can't figure out the maps in this book, you should reconsider going into the wilderness, because you are not ready for it. And in my opinion, you don't take the book with you, you take a map. The book is just for helping you figure out were it is that you want to go."},{"Title":"100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park","review":"I use this book every time I go to Yose.

Dr. Magnusson's review is also right. Loehbeck's is the typical gushing childish narrative, of the type that characterises modern Western writers on Afghanistan, especially those of the controversial period of the 1980s and '90s. It also contains many name-spelling and minor contextual mistakes and errors throughout. People such as him do no service to the historical reality of a very profound and key situation of the present era of the world. For one, they blame the Soviet invasion of 1979 for events in Afganistan since then. That is untrue. What the invasion did was to precipitate this crisis, but as far as its causes are concerned, among other things, the character of the Afghan nature and society are wholly responsible and should be addressed and exposed by concerned writers. The underpinnings of this crisis had started well before 1979, and this is what could have been expected to have transpired because of the rigid and vicious nature of Afghan society when it encountered social, technological and cultural progress of any kind. The pseudo-science of Marxism wasn't at all the ideal solution to anything, but Western writers should refrain from using its defeat as a scapegoat or whipping post to hide their own weaknesses and/or mask their own doings which, since 1991 especially, are almost equal in magnitude to Marxist fallacies and wrongs. Expert observers will note that both Islam and Marxian communist politics, though diametrically opposed, struck a very resonant chord somewhere deep in the sinister murkiness of the Afghan psyche. (And this isn't quite the &quot;communism&quot; any Europeans are used to knowing). I hate &quot;my&quot; people for their nature.

Truly a disgraceful place."},{"Title":"William Carey : Missionary, Pioneer and Statesman","review":"This is the second biography of William Carey which I have read. Although short (256 pages), it is a comprehensive portrait of his life, nearly every chapter clearly setting forth the years in view. The edition which I own was printed in Chicago by Moody Press in 1960.Toward the beginning, the author, F. Deaville Walker, briefly wades into the theology behind Carey's drive for mission, unfolding that he left the Church of England to become first a Dissenter, then a Baptist. Although a Baptist and Calvinistic, he did not agree with the hyper-Calvinistic views of his peers who shrunk from taking the gospel to the heathen. Although disagreeing in soteriology, he affirmed the work of Charles and John Wesley in proclaiming the gospel where it had not been known.This then was the topic of his first book,An Enquiry, and the great force of his life: \\"to spread the knowledge of [Christ's] name,\\" as his book begins: \\"As our blessed Lord has required us to pray that his kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven, it becomes us not only to express our desires of that event by words, but to use every lawful method to spread the knowledge of his name...conscientious activity therein would form one of the strongest proofs that we are the subjects of grace.\\"Then, later on in his book, Carey says \\"If the prophecies concerning the increase of Christ's kingdom be true...it must be inferred that all Christians ought heartily to concur with God in promoting His glorious designs.\\"Although I wish the author had spent more time contemplating the theological connections to Carey's purpose, the contours of his life and theology are clearly visible. Of these, the feature of his life that has most stuck in my mind is this paragraph, from chapter four. Carey is now old, writing to his nephew:\\"Eustace, if after my removal anyone should think it worth his while to write my life, I will give you a criterion by which you may judge of its correctness. If he give me credit for being a plodder he will describe me justly. Anything beyond this will be too much. I can plod. I can persevere in any definite pursuit. To this I owe everything.\\"Later in the book, when Carey's pursuits were challenged, he answered his critics with this statement: \\"Few people know what may be done till they try, and persevere in what they undertake.\\"F. Deaville Walker has held true to Carey's own criterion. His biography shows a wretched sinner, William Carey, and his glorious plod -- his love for Christ and his love for the gospel expressed in enduring service that Christ might be known and renowned among the peoples of East Asia."},{"Title":"William Carey : Missionary, Pioneer and Statesman","review":"The life of William Carey is a remarkable one. Born in 1767 - he lived until the age 66 passing away in 1834.He was a shoemaker, brilliant at studying and learning a number of languages and a pioneer in the field of missions. He convinced many churches to fund a missionary society and send missionaries out. He had a unique vision for missions involving groups of missionaries to settle in the same location and work together in evangelizing the lost. He spent much of his life implementing this in India. He translated scripture into many languages, printed them in India, founded a Christian college and taught converts to pastor their own churches.

We first meet Babs and Betty Moss at a dolls' tea party in which they discover the clever show dog Sancho foraging for his master Ben, a runaway from the circus. Ben's father had left the circus for a more promising job, intending to send for his son once he was settled. With his father's protection gone, Ben is harshly treated by the circus master and runs away.Arriving soon after the runaways are Celia and her young brother Thornton, returning to their old home after being gone for years. Thorny is weak from a long illness and is wheelchair-ridden and crabby although he admits that Celia is \\"the best sister that ever was\\". She hires Ben to amuse her brother during his convalescence while allowing Babs and Betty, whose mother takes care of the premises, to continue to play house on the porch and path. The kids occupy themselves with botanical expeditions, ship-building, water wheels and other waterworks play, picnics, baseball and archery. Babs loses Sancho at a circus and Betty finds him again in pitiful shape after accompanying Thorny to the dentist. Celia breaks her arm after a fall from her horse and is rescued by Ben. He is gradually weaned away from the roving circus life although Celia invites the school to a splendid birthday party for him where he shows himself in his former circus glory as Cupid on a galloping horse. There is a little trouble with missing money and false accusations but Ben, who is honest and true, gradually endears himself to the two families. Several joyous unions and reunions take place at the end as well as one intended for the future, although in the midst of preparing for one, the incorrigible Babs almost burns down the house under the lilacs. The tone is quaint and old-fashioned but the simple pleasures of life shine through and Ben is both boy-like and engaging."},{"Title":"Under the Lilacs","review":"I appreciate this company for making so many classic pieces of literature available on the kindle.

Which tells us little about the book's veracity or validity.There are no truly neutral observers, simply variations in the degree to which one is prejudiced toward or against a particular position. This book is so heavily footnoted and appendixed, and Boswell seems to be at such pains to clarify exactly what he is and is not claiming, and why, that it is hard to believe he is not being intellectually honest, despite the fact he had a vested interest in promoting same-sex marriage. In short, Boswell gives at least the illusion of objectivity. This is enhanced by the fact that he builds his argument over many chapters, showing the social context into which church-authorized same-sex unions fit, rather than presenting documentation on just the unions -- a point which most of his detractors conveniently overlook.The bias -- and carelessness -- of some reviewers is blatant. Kevin Davis states \\"...Boswell argues that rituals for the binding of two males (in Eastern Christendom) between the 12th and 16th centuries is evidence of the support for same-sex marriages in earlier Christianity. This is yet another example of a scholar misinterpreting historical facts in order to serve an agenda.\\"Anyone who paid attention while reading this book knows that the preceding statement is mostly untrue. (For example, the rituals existed for over 1000 years, and were in use in other parts of Cristendom.) Boswell explicitly states, repeatedly, that these same-sex unions were not, as far as the ceremony itself went, marriage ceremonies (which is why the book has the title it does), and he repeatedly shows how they differ (though the difference is not huge). He does, however, draw a distinction between what is written in a ceremony, and how people perceive the ceremony, suggesting that \\"the populace\\" might have viewed the union as a marriage (though not necessarily with a sexual element).\\"matt\\" states \\"I would suggest that we all need to be careful in reading into texts and history what would make us feel better about ourselves.\\" Agreed. But what about reading text and history based on what we currently perceive as true or false, right or wrong? matt conveniently forgets that \\"the church\\" systematically persecuted homosexual men and women for a thousand years -- and he's surprised when some of them are happy to find a bit of history that indicates the church at one time supported (if probably only unintentionally) their affectional preferences?Which brings us to the issue of the essentialist / constructivist argument. Throughout the book, Boswell (it seems to me) leans in the constructivist direction, by attempting to interpret everything in the context of how the people of the time would have seen or valued it. This is far from trying to force a \\"modern\\" homo / hetero perspective on the analysis, which many critics seem to accuse Boswell of doing. (They, of course, do the same thing, but from \\"the other side\\".)Those disagreeing with Boswell do so primarily by grossly misreading him, by taking his arguments out of context, or out of simple prejudice. They don't want to believe his interpretation might be correct.There is another set of \\"facts\\" not discussed (or even mentioned) in this book. One is that homosexual practice between consenting adult males (I'm deliberately omitting paederasty, the love of young men, violation of slaves & prisoners, etc) is not unheard-of historically (qv, the pagan Celts). A berdache was often married to a man of the tribe (see Ruth Benedict), who presumably enjoyed sodomizing another male.I don't believe Boswell is guilty of stirring up a hornet's next by means of bad scholarship or specious reasoning. He doesn't seem to be indulging in either.As (the non-gay) friendly Professor Peter Schickele likes to say... \\"Truth is truth. You can't have opinions about truth.\\" Boswell's interpretation of the historical evidence is almost certainly correct."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"After reading this fine book, I wished that there was some way I could thank Boswell for such a revelation. Knowing that this would be impossible since he passed away, there is no way to thank him, but simply to praise his work, and tell other people about it. This study in same-sex unions performed throughout premodern European history debunks the notiont that marriage was only performed between a male and a female. The book presents astounding facts and information that has been suppressed, or misinterpreted by homophobe bias. In the appendices of the book, there are actual transcriptions of the same-sex marriage ceremonies used, in the vernacular, and translated by Boswell into English. This study was made all the more fascinating by the wealth of footnotes. When Boswell came across an ambiguous word that could mean many things in different languages, he includes that specific word written in its own language in the text. The appearance of these arcane languages in the text were beautiful, and one could call them &quot;eye candy.&quot; There was writing from ancient Greece, some Slavic languages, and Hebrew. This novel is a major contribution to European history, and history in general, and being a college student and a future professional historian myself, I am glad to know that Boswell's presence graced the field of history, and has brought the craft of history to new heights."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"The \\"but\\" is well expressed in the last two reviews here. The issue revolves around a specific translation question, and it's a debatable one.Father Kurt's review comes closest to mine. It takes careful reading,and it has some significant problems, but it does present the issues fairly, and many of the objections made in recent reviews are addressed in the book's text. It may well be arguing a debatable proposition, but it is not \\"intellectual claptrap\\". Dr. Boswell makes a game effort to argue that his documents are speaking of something more significant than proerty transfers or normal \\"friendships\\". It's quite another thing as to whether he succeeds.Evaluating this book as a historian, I fond myself at a loss for the lingustic skills to make much of a judgement on most of his texts. His argument, if he could maintsin the linguistic argument in the context in which the documents were produced, otherwise is well put. To repeat, it is not \\"claptrap\\".However, there was one exception where I do have some ability to assess one of his documents: an excerpt in Latin from Giraldus Cambriensis' \\"History and Topography of Ireland\\".Dr. Boswell lays out the Latin text, then gives his translation, and then explains his justification for translating it in the way it does. All of which is quite proper. I had a run at the Latin myself, and while, yes, using some standard definitons, you CAN translate it the way he does, it works equally well as a rite for the formal allaince of families or kinship groups. Since the social structure of Ireland at the time was based almost entirely on kinship groups, that's the way scholars of Irish history would translate it, rather than as a form of personal union between two people. Charitably, one might suppose that 12th century Ireland was not familiar ground for him judging from his other work, it wasn't), so while he seems to have misunderstood the context here, I wouldn't say that he got it wrong elsewhere. I did find a factual error in one of his footnotes (there is another modern translation of which he was apparently unaware), although it was the type of slip which happens fairly easily.Simply for that reason I've given, I would not take this book as more than advancing an ingenious hypothesis, which remains at best unproven. Still, it is worthy of consideration...and as far as scholarly works go, it's pretty readable. That in itself is a virtue!"},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Friends of mine who had been familiar with Boswell's first book, 'Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality', from its initial publication in 1980 waited impatiently for the follow-up volume. In the end, it took fourteen years to produce, and sadly, did not live up the expectations that had been given it.Firstly, it did not in fact reveal (if such places exist, the not-always-so-hidden charge behind the disappointment) communities that had continued the practice of tolerance to same-sex couples through the last millenium within the structures of Christendom.For part of the book he covers old ground, talking about the milieu of the Greco-Roman world, and talks about the development of the idea of marriage and liturgical practices for that. He then proceeds to give examples of liturgies which, Boswell claims, are proof that the church did recognise and bless same-sex unions. This claim is still debated, as there is no blantant 'I now pronounce you husband and husband (or wife and wife)' kinds of statements or liturgies here, but rather testimony to friendship, companionship, communal support, of a sort that is ambiguous.While this book is important for liturgical forms and narrative discussion (although the narratives can be reinterpreted as something different from Boswell's), it failed to deliver the knock-out punch readers of the first book had been waiting for, i.e., conclusive proof the church was up to no good. Boswell does make some points worthy of attention in the debate, such as, 'The extent of early Christian hostility to same-sex eroticism has been exaggerated by modern Christians, who tend to overlook comparable Christian strictures against divorce or other common aspects of modern life also condemned by the early church, while focusing their energy and moral outrage on this particular issue.'Boswell is interesting but far from satisfying on either side of the debate. So, after providing us with some historical framework, we must move on to more explicitly theological discussions. Boswell's contribution is an important one, in that it shows that this has been an issue with varying degrees of acceptance and controversy throughout the life of the church, and the history of society in general. It does not, however, settle anything, or satisfy either side -- it is rather more grist for the mill for both sides. An important book, but not definitive by any means.Unfortunately, Boswell died not long after the publication of this volume, and so further clarifications, or any unpublished research of sensitive nature, will not be forthcoming."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"The other reviews cover most of the issues with this book admirably. One could have appropriately, but less titilatingly, retitled the book \\"Unions in Pre-Modern Europe\\", since his study was fairly balanced between two-sex and same-sex unions. It is certainly an eye-opener for those of the \\"traditional\\" marriage hue and cry. \\"Traditional\\" marriage as we see it today was unknown until the late middle ages, although that sort of union among same-sex couples was known from the earliest. The church did not recognize marriage as a sacrament until about 800 years ago. Those today who speak of traditional marriage need to read their history to know whereof they speak. I found his writing immensely readable and enjoyable. Although I have not yet read his first work, it is certainly now on my list."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"I've been recommending this book since it was first published, and certainly have not stopped as the question of recognizing same-sex marriage is still at issue across the United States. Boswell's book is an authoritative look at the subject (and yes, please do read the foot notes), and provides not only much insight into the realities of marriage, but also fodder for countering the arguments of those who would deny two consenting adults from having a civilly recognized union. (Amusing it remains that there are more religions and religious bodies which recognize same sex marriage than there are states.) This is definitely a \\"scholarly\\" work, but still very readable and fascinating. A must-read for anybody who wants to dig deeper than bumper stickers and lawn signs."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"I came to this work from Boswell's famous 'Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality', and found it quite a different sort of book - less panoramic in scope, less assertive, and somehow lacking the zealous excitement of the former work. Maybe that is just an indication of the impact 'CSTH' has had on our understanding of gay history. I would advise the general reader to read CSTH first, and - if you only read one book by Boswell - for CSTH to be it. 'Marriage of Likeness' is probably one for the more specialist library. Having said that, I found 'Marriage of Likeness' fascinating - and very relevant to the current debates of 'gay marriage' - in the way it focusses on identifying the real nature of heterosexual marriage, in order to open the way to a recognition of the true significance of same-sex unions. Finally, if you are planning a 'union' ceremony, 'Marriage of Likeness' contains an extensive selection of historic texts, with plenty of words that still resonate."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Boswell is most famous for his 'Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality,' and this book certainly does not have so great an impact as that classic work. It is, however, a thoroughly interesting read about an equally interesting topic. Of course, Boswell is always readable, though his frequent footnotes - essential for the specialist - can easily break one's concentration.As for the effectiveness of his argument. Boswell wisely does not assert that the ceremony in question is marriage, but he does raise a number of difficult points; the parallels to marriage are utterly unquestionable. I doubt that he establishes that same-sex marriage existed, but the ceremony is nonetheless an important element in the history of same-sex relations.In all, this is a worthy investment, but not for the casual reader."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Solid historic research that is as fresh today as it was 16 years ago when it was published. Any one who wants to speak about Gay marriage either for or against should have to read this. Boswell was one of the premier historians of his generation before his untimely death. That there has been no one who has shown any realistic opposing view show how well his research was, though there has been additional research on newly found early Christian Gay marriage since then. Must read."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Fascinating, dense and incredibly detailed scholarly work (I think half the book is footnotes!) which compares heterosexual and same-sex pagan (i.e. non-Christian) 'marriage' rites, with heterosexual and same-sex CHRISTIAN 'marriage' rites in the early Christian church of the Roman world (that is, BEFORE the Catholic and orthodox hierarchy decided to ban such ceremonies). To fully enjoy this book is to make it a slow read over time... but well worth it for those interested in religious and/or gay rights issues."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"This book disputes the assertion that marriage is only meant to be between a man and a woman. Originally, heterosexual marriage was mostly arranged by families for money and power and it was same-sex marriage (sanctioned by the church) that was considered for the true love of the other person. Ancient texts of same-sex unions are included and are a great addition to any modern ceremony!"},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"The whole argument of this book revolves around the interpretation (or misinterpretation) of the words \\"adelphopoiesis\\" and \\"adelphopoieia\\". The obvious translation of these words is \\"brother-making\\" but Boswell wants us to have none of that. In fact, he often goes to great lengths to bury these words in footnotes and presents them in Greek characters rather than transliterating them for vulgar eyes. The reason for this is that he wishes us to be kindly disposed to his translation of \\"adelphopoiesis\\" as \\"same-sex union\\" (the English phrase that forms the center of his argument). The obvious translation (\\"brother-making\\") would clearly tell against Boswell's tendentious claims. Thus, he does his best to keep the obvious translation out of the reader's mind.But he can't do this forever. Thus he is pressed to do the following:1) Argue that \\"brother-making\\", the obvious translation, is misleading. He then provides us with page upon page of contorted (but ultimately unconvincing) exegesis to show why this is apparently so.2) Argue that \\"homosexual marriage\\" is an unwarranted and \\"tendentious interpretation\\" (his words, not mine) of \\"adelphopoiesis\\".3) Contend that \\"same-sex union\\" is the best translation of \\"adelphopoiesis\\".Of course, anyone can see that \\"same-sex union\\" is a tendentious generalization as well. \\"Same-sex\\" is more abstract and suggestive than the figure \\"brother\\"; and \\"union\\" is more abstract than the relationship of spiritual brotherhood that is specified by \\"adelphopoiesis\\". Making his translation more general allows him to smuggle more meaning into the word.Also, Boswell (as far as I can recall) fails to note one of the main reasons \\"brother-making\\" presents parallels to a marriage ceremony: namely, the transmission of ecclesiastical property to one of the parties. Just as a marriage would stipulate the conditions under which property would be transferred from a husband to a wife upon his death, so too would \\"brother-making\\" stipulate to whom and under what conditions ecclesiastical property would be transferred upon the death of one of the \\"brothers\\". \\"Brother-making\\" would appear from one point of view as a succession ritual that establishes the claim of the younger \\"brother\\" to the duties and ecclesiastical property of the elder \\"brother\\" following the latter's death. Their relation is thus more like that of father and son than that of husband and wife.Perhaps the most distressing thing about this book is that, rather than using the canons of academic reason to support his contentions, Boswell instead resorts mostly to a rhetoric of scholarly authority. The tricky parts of his interpretation are couched in an academic style that subsitutes pedantic framing for honest argument. Rather than using reason to establish his thesis, he assumes the truth of his thesis and constructs various tendentious standpoints from which one can better view his preordained \\"truth\\". This is not only distressing but insulting. It's as if he thinks the reader can't see what he's really doing and will simply be swayed by the stylistic apparatus he employs to advance his claims to academic authority.This book is a disgrace. I would have given it zero stars if it weren't for the interesting bibliographical information it contains. I did find some gold in this dross -- but it had, alas, nothing to do with Boswell's thesis.Finally, as I noted above, this book does not provide support for the claim that the Orthodox Church contained rites for \\"gay marriage\\". Boswell explicitly states that translating \\"adelphopoiesis\\" as \\"gay marriage\\" is a \\"tendentious interpretation\\". A lot of readers seem to have missed this point."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"I find it amazing that so many readers think that Boswell, may he rest in peace, has discovered that in fact the early church actually blessed same sex unions. THis book, combined with his \\"Christianity, Social Tolorance, and Homosexuality\\", has done more to promote the legitimacy of homosexuality in theological terms than any other other, with Spong's half-baked attempts coming in a close second.Please understand that I am not trying to bash gays or gays who are living the CHristian life. It is only that this sort of book misrepresents that tradition of the Church- east and west.Read Boswell, by all means. But also read critiques. One very useful and kind critique is found in Marva Dawn's \\"Sexual Character\\" which goes into great detail about the scholarship of Boswell. I must say that the question is so very important to the Church and society and the Church should not be vindictive or loose withthe facts- but neither should those who disagree with the Tradition.THere are several thorough reviews of Boswell's books at First THings so I won't repeat what is written there. However, I would suggest that we all need to be careful in reading into texts and history what would make us feel better about ourselves. Orthodox and heretic both do this, and it is exactly why we need to listen carefully to all sides as dispassionately as possible."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"In this work, Boswell argues that rituals for the binding of two males (in Eastern Christendom) between the 12th and 16th centuries is evidence of the support for same-sex marriages in earlier Christianity. This is yet another example of a scholar misinterpreting historical facts in order to serve an agenda.Robert L. Wilken, Professor of the History of Christianity at the University of Virginia, wrote an excellent critique of Boswell's work. The article is entitled \\"Procrustean marriage beds\\" and is found in Vol. 121 of Commonweal, 09-09-1994, pp 24. It is also on the web (do a google/yahoo search).Here's an excerpt:On an initial reading these rituals appear similar to marriage ceremonies. They refer to the joining of two people in life-long relationship, they speak of a bond of peace and love and oneness of mind, they include ritual actions that parallel those of marriage ceremonies. Yet there are certain features of the rituals that are unlike marriage ceremonies. For example, the texts make it clear that the relation of the participants is spiritual not carnal (\\"by faith and spiritually\\"), there is no mention of the marriage bed, the term \\"marriage\\" is not used (as it is in marriage rites), the biblical readings are different from those used in marriage ceremonies, several of the rites, significantly, indicate that the relationship is that of an \\"elder\\" to a \\"younger,\\" and the persons joined in the ceremonies are males.Wilken then continues with specific examples. It turns out that, as Wilken states, \\"What these rituals solemnize is not 'gay marriages' but a form of ritualized friendship between males that had been practiced in the Eastern Mediterranean since the time of Homer.\\" And, of course, Wilken proceeds to support this and gives reason for why this was done. His article is an excellent read.For those Christians who promote the affirmation of homosexual practice, this book is too good to be true. Alas, it turns out that such is the case."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"I couldn't disagree more with claims that this book is dry. As a student planning to become a historian focusing on homosexual history (one that is interested in the pre-1869 \\"gay identities\\" that social constructionists like to downplay), I thought this book was insightful, interesting, and an easy read. The field of gay history needs more scholars like the late Boswell."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Acceptance of homosexuality is already a rich source of heated talk, but discussion on gay marriage certainly does not help in dampening spirits. To bring some new perspective to the possible sanctioning of gay unions, historian John Boswell tried to look for evidence of same sex blessed unions in the early European middle ages. Certainly homosexuality was viewed quite differently in earlier times and Christian faith condemned it rather late, somewhat simultaneously with the advent of celibacy in the clergy. In this book, Mr. Boswell presents us his findings and comments. Indeed there is some serious evidence that same sex union were at least more than tolerated a millenium ago. The book is thus an interesting read and helps us consider in a different light some specious arguments presented today to deny civil recognition for homosexual unions. Unfortunately, the book suffers from wanting to say more than what the findings warrant. A pity since the mere fact of finding evidence for same sex unions is already quite telling even if it is not clear in some cases whether it was only a special friendship recognition or a bona fide carnal union recognition. Perhaps the haste at which the book was written and edited explains this, since Mr. Boswell was sick and died around the time of publication. That haste might be deduced from the fact that 25% of the book are notes, and the feeling that ones get upon finishing it that the book could have been at least 50 pages shorter. Still, a convincing case for getting out of today's conventional parameters for marriage is hinted by this book: clearly Mr. Boswell shows us that marriage and homosexuality were not that contrary centuries ago, and did not hinder the development of Western Civilization. And I might add, this book makes us wonder where Mr. Boswell's desire to chart new path of historical research would have lead him, and with what findings he would have regaled us. Not to mention how much stronger the book could have been with a tighter editing and criticism."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"I have now read this book twice and both times I find myself looking at great scholarship. However, there is something missing. Boswell elucidates marriage history extraordinarily well, and his citations to same-sex unions are remarkable. There was no silver bullet that clearly and convincingly ties the same sex ceremonies he cites to the kind of same-sex relationship that parallels heterosexual marriage. We must remember that the concepts of homosexual and heterosexual did not exist in pre-modern Europe. They are a product of hte 19th century. Nonetheless, Bosell's scholarship is a delight to read, and raises excellent questions about our past."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"This book was the second I read by John Boswell. It make me rethink everything my religious upbringing had taught me. It is based on ancient church dodcuments that appear to be unions rituals for people of the same sex. Mr. Boswell compairs and contrasts these document with the marriage ritual of the same time period. A very indepth and footnoted study."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"This book had some interesting things to say but it went about it in the wrong way. First of all, I think this book demonstrates that marriage is more then superficial ceremonies and the exchanging of rings. I found it a great expose' on how same sex unions can be just as affective as heterosexual ones. ... The problem with this book is that its just so dry. The ton of footnotes make it a chore to read and a couple of chapters could be left out altogether. I would love to listen to an abridged version of this book on CD. It would be more interesting and probably would get Boswell's argument across to the lay reader more efficiently. I manage to get through most of it but I got tired in the end. It was like he kept repeating the same points over and over again. A more simplified version would be welcomed with all the footnotes in the back well away from the main text. Conclusion, an interesting thesis but not a read for everyone."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"This book illustrates the importance of proper words for the proper functioning of society. It also brings to mind the raging modern debate about the word \\"marriage:\\" Those who want to define it to also mean the sanction of homosexual unions and those who oppose that particular use of the word.Past linguistic history suggests a possible end to this debate (presently in an impasse) by creating a neologism for same-sex unions. I propose, for whatever it is worth, the word \\"parriage.\\" It is remarkably close to \\"marriage\\" and it strongly suggests pairing. It may well satisfy those who seek social change without antagonizing the feelings of those who want to continue to use the word \\"marriage\\" in its traditional sense. After all, while the past has certainly a claim on the present and even the future, it cannot prevent social progress."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"WHAT CAN I SAY.

Some very interesting insights to all \\"unions\\". If you're like me, you'll want to abolish or redefine \\"marriage\\" in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Potential Reader: If you are interested in historical realities, fact and not bias, truth, and same-sex studies, then you need to read everything that John Boswell has written in this regard. Here, Boswell peels layer after layer of obscuring biases, prejudices, and untoward mis-apprehension from this long buried subject matter, thereby allowing us to view it clearly without the purposefully applied and clouding gloss from centuries of overt, outright lies about the character, naturalness, myths and legends, and the true history and works of an entire group of always existing human beings, who differ from their fellows only in terms of affective interest. Boswell's book does not promulgate an \\"agenda,\\" whether perceived curiously as hidden or open, as asserted by and irrespective of the dishonest pretenses of its somehow blissful detractors. Rather, this is a very prescient, professionally competent and scholarly presentation of historical fact. It is tremendously unfortunate that some have chosen the disappointing path of continued denial and purposeful, wanton ignorance, yet even long after its publication. And like all and any other works of the professional historian, portions of such are open to learned, dispassionate debate, but should not be the subject of stubbornly ignorant and myopic diatribes of the most wrong-headed and biased sort, especially when coupled with no factual bases to somehow buttress their failed argument on behalf of the contrary opinion. Some of the reviewers here must be addressing instead some work other than that of Boswell, since what they assert has nothing whatever to do with either the extraordinary breadth and depth of this present work nor with its several and brilliantly interwoven theses. For example, one reviewer's reiteration of a Greek term uncomfortably provides the sense of homophobic panic, and this then is compounded by a wondrously absurd attempt to use a preposterous and nonexistent conflict in interpretation to deconstruct Boswell's entire work, on the simpleminded basis of that reviewer's peculiar use and his uniquely perceived meaning of one word in Greek. The Greek word as suggested does not, obviously was not intended to, and simply could not conceivably bear the entire weight, thematically or otherwise, of Boswell's much broader conception for his quite extensive work, which is the subject of my review. Boswell was wholly conversant, as this book more than clearly demonstrates, in several ancient and modern languages and was also a greatly respected and internationally recognized scholar of renown (a full professor at Yale University) in his own right. I would conjecture that this book's naysayers' supposed credentials or degrees were mail-ordered from some evangelical bible college. As for the unschooled, silly, but too conveniently oft-parroted misconception that asserts as some kind of unassailable fact the totally fanciful, nonhistorical idea of \\"male friends as only just friends\\" in ancient through pre-modern times, if one had bothered to read the book past the first fifty pages or so, it would have been learned and such provided with a number of verifiable examples that would inform even the most closed of minds that the concept of male \\"friends\\" and \\"friendship\\" had a much more significant, certainly romantic, and very serious meaning to males who lived during those historical periods. For some, these attitudes are operative, valid and present to-day. Reviewers also missed large sections of this work that addressed same-sex union ceremonies and, more importantly, those paragraphs abundantly devoted to the clear contemporary meaning of these unions to the actual participants and to their contemporaries. I myself am a Near and Middle Eastern History scholar, and I can attest to Professor Boswell's professional accuracy and correctness with regard to his translations, as well as to his use of the sources and materials he had to hand, and also to the substantiveness of the undoubted in-depth peer reviews that preceded and substantiated each and every part of this book. Boswell's scholarly appreciation for and his very selection and use of the many resources and source materials cited and compiled here, some quite arcane and largely unknown or even those illicitly altered and redacted centuries ago, are a virtual treasure trove of hidden, ignored and bypassed knowledge, even if some of it is general, that we are at long last made aware, having been brought from forgotten depths in to the light to inform. All is presented and conveyed in a style that is as interesting and informative to read as a good novel, or perhaps, for example, the excellent social histories by Barbara Tuchman. Yet 'Same-Sex Union...' is both a serious book for the historian (and even more so for the public at large, if they only will take the opportunity to learn) and moreover an exceedingly necessary work that I, for one, am very pleased was written, especially so by a person with the outstanding credentials Boswell possessed. I am very proud to have this book resident in my bookshelf, it having been read and referenced many times since being acquired. The information concerning Nero and Hadrian and their respective lovers and husbands (Sporus and Antinous), as well as the many so-called paired saints (Serge and Bacchus, etc.), together with the internal mini-histories and fascinating cultural aspects of abduction, adoption and marriage (greatly differing from the practices and rationales employed in our presumably modern society) in the ancient and premodern worlds was, for me, the most intriguing, informative and fascinating. His extra-textual cites, definitions, explications, notes, and appendices are utterly superb, and could not be bettered or more revealing. Surely, it was (and is again) time that someone with the requisite credentials, background, intellect and scholarship, moxie, rectitude, and writing skills, like Boswell, wrote this sort of history (I would definitely say the same for his previous much needed and heralded work: 'Christianity, Social...'). This book is a very densely-packed, highly intellectual and appropriately technical work, so if you like your histories 'light,' I would strongly recommend a sort of 'warm-up' first with other works of like but less intensive nature before tackling it without some preparatory information and knowledge. In my opinion, you, the fortunate reader of this book, will actually derive more from Boswell's work should you be prepared to comprehendingly read and thoroughly understand it--rather than try to get by with only the application of, at best, a pedestrian, provincial background and with a near dearth of requisite knowledge, such as that so embarrassingly exposed and natteringly evinced by some few intellectually challenged and clearly prejudiced exemplars displayed and revealed in a number of preceding reviews. I only wish that I could give this monumentally excellent work by Boswell more than 5-stars!"},{"Title":"Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe","review":"Messrs.: Some reviewers' titles, when combined with their texts, are remarkably suggestive of Freudian slips with regard to what is seemingly in their respective minds, and reveal where their thoughts and inhibitions lie. Part of this is exposed by an attendant desire to promote whatever they define as a sort of self-supposed or imagined world standard for an amorphous mythical \\"tradition,\\" which is to be supposedly found by all a higher authority to the numerous and irrefutable historical facts presented by Boswell. First of all, to-day's concept of Romantic Love was simply unrefined before three hundred or so years ago, and the evolving nature of various associated rituals come down to us from that point. Second, before that evolution (or devolution, depending on your perspective), the so-called traditions of friendship, brotherhood (and all related terms and practices), abduction, and marriage as then and also formally practiced, I would emphasize, together with the near universal association of the masculine or masculinity with male same-sex personages (most often heroes, gods and demi-gods), practices, acts and interests, were all firmly homosexual. Practitioners were unabashedly presentated worldwide as homosexual to a predominant audience for many tens of centuries. Third, homosexual relationships and not heterosexual ones were considered the more natural, ascendant, as well as the norm, and certainly the position actively and overtly promoted by the early and later Church. Most churchmen (and members of their flock), of yester-day and to-day, were exceedingly avid practitioners of homosexual desire, love and friendships. Read for yourself what they reduced to writing, in whatever language you read, for proofs. Why then the anguished surprise, unfounded denials and the sense of disgust, for lack of other expressions, publicly expressed concerning the long, historical, widely known, and accepted practice of marriage between same-sex partners, either as performed and thus sanctified by the Church or via the equally acceptable alternative vehicle, which also bestowed the appellation of marriage on the same-sex relationship, of simply living together as a couple and being recognized as married by your neighbors? This is what Boswell has written in both of his monumental works, as I comprehend him. Some have missed these essentials altogether. This reality, as conveyed and constructed of fact after fact by Boswell, is the complete obverse, quite obviously, of what many uninformed or head-in-the-sand people believe, or are determined to believe, as traditional because of what they have been taught erroneously or might prefer to think for various reasons. But Boswell's revelations and relentless enumeration of historical facts and their elucidation is nonetheless well researched and undeniably true, and his work stands appropriately at the polar opposite to the watered-down and factually ignorant fabrications written by others, which non-facts and mis-apprehensions are further carelessly bandied about by the majority of heterosexualists (or non-Uranians), whether due to willful ignorance, nervous denial, or homophobic hysteria. To compound this egregious situation, during the mid-Nineteenth Century, as Boswell also informs the reader, we began to define individuals in terms of which of two genders they loved, which is itself an absurd shrinking of the spectrum of human practice, something not previously thought remotely to be necessary, or yet considered and conceptualized before then. Homosexualists were first categorized as Uranians until the term homosexual became the standard adjective (it is not properly used as a noun), although the word Gay had been used previously for centuries, for those having similar natural interests. Do not confuse the heterosexual family unit of to-day with the preferred arrangement from antiquity to present because indeed it was not the relational preference until quite recently along the timeline. As well, heterosexual marriage, when and if selected, was almost always performed for dynastic reasons (usually under terms of a contract), but not for love as is asserted to be the cause to-day. There was also a real need to address familial concerns related to procreation and rights of inheritance, which actively drove the contractual parties (the parents or guardians) to ensure that the husband would be the most likely father of any resultant progeny. These particulars are clearly demonstrated by what Boswell (and other historians and intellectuals of current and past note) presents again and again in his book(s). To the ancients and those living up to the Modern Era's fringe, the female was a drone and a minor property item, and mostly recognized as an object of procreative necessity-this is a fact, not a statement of belief or errant misogyny--although not the object of true friendship or love (i.e., intelligent love or bond), and certainly not an equal partner in marriage as our common but incorrect heterosexual currency would now define it. If you should care to read the ancient wits, various Greek and Roman philosophers and like playwrights, up to the beginnings of the Romantic Era, their most acidic and vituperative comments and biting satires would focus upon the cuckold who actually professed to love his mate (notice I do not here use the terms spouse or wife because, once more, as shown by Boswell, there were no official ceremonies, whether secular or religious, then extant, until the Late Middle Ages, which is why most relationships of whatever type were what we to-day define as common law). Since females were universally thought not to possess the intellectual equipment, loyalty or logic requisite for true love or even friendship (the term \\"friends,\\" when used to described a relationship amongst males, was then more freighted with serious meaning than to-day), and possessed of no capability to form a lasting relationship, they were employed in drudgery, for ready sexual satisfaction, child-bearing and rearing, and housekeeping duties. In the centuries before condoms and the pill, as Boswell relates, young men were more frequently employed for the sexual release of older males (unwanted children were very frequently abandoned or sold), especially when all members of a household were under the sway of the pater familias or dominant male, and where all members were dominated and considered equal prey. In addition, Boswell writes, homosexual love was considered greatly preferable to heterosexual love in all respects, as well as being far more natural, tasteful and enduring. Indeed, most ancient males held the opinion that heterosexual sex was highly disgusting and distasteful, and could cause one to become effeminate, if performed too regularly. At present, due largely to the misanthropy of the so-called feminist revolution and its resultant devolution, already infected and informed by the limpid ideals of Romantic Love that preceded it, true historical tradition with regard to one's affective interests, love and relationships has been literally turned upside down. Neither the ancients, members of the so-called Church, both early and late, nor the Renaissance Man or the scholars of the Enlightenment would recognize or yet understand this massive turn of events in affective interest. Given only one of the many well-documented examples provided by Boswell, it could be easily established that, following the historical precursors of same-sex abduction and adoption, marriage was first practiced amongst those with same-sex affective interests. These facts are directly converse to the inaccurate and deceiving portrayal concocted by to-day's (and yester-day's) ignorant rabble that marriage is of heterosexual origin and that heterosexual relationships have been the exclusive preference of all mankind since time out of mind, regardless of such assertions being proven non-historical and without basis in fact or reality. As with one reviewer here, who wrote when addressing Same-Sex Unions..., \\"the parallels to marriage are utterly unquestionable,\\" but then backs away and asserts that he \\"doubt(s) that he (Boswell) establishes that same-sex marriage existed,\\" there is a consistently disappointing and confused attempt to somehow create a distinction without a real difference. That is timidity, intellectual atrophy and denial taken to extremes, which is, sadly, just one example of what can be described as intellectual suicide and the stubborn avoidance of reality whenever and wherever this particular subject matter is broached. I think the singularly tremendous and beneficial scholarship of Boswell and what will be his distinguished legacy require all honest readers, together with his book reviewers, to consider the known (even if uncomfortable) and unavoidable facts, and to not bring their biases, sense of denial, misunderstandings (purposeful or otherwise) and timorousness to bear on this great work of history, or to this subject matter as a whole."},{"Title":"Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine","review":"I received the book, 'The Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine' direct from Amazon. I have to say, there's nothing like it in English that I have encountered so far in my studies of Chinese medicine dating back to 1984. Of course, back then, Dan Bensky's book, 'Acupuncture, A Comprehensive Text' was still relatively hot off the press and his herbal series weren't out yet. The 'Essentials of Chinese Acupuncture' was the standard text at most acupuncture schools in the U.S. We've come a long way: clearly, Wiseman's terminological linguistics have made Chinese medical concepts and terms really accessible to the non-Chinese fluent student and practitioner. It's apparent that Wiseman is setting the standard for Chinese medical translations in English for our time. No one even comes close, though I do think that Blue Poppy Press puts out some outstanding books and there are other clinical publications that I have found very useful. All that said: an authoritative and linguistically consistent dictionary is absolutely necessary and I believe that Wiseman's is the one to get! I give this book 5+ stars. Of course, no book can ever have everything but that goes without saying.June 20 2009 Additional Comments:As an addendum to my review back in 2005, I was surprised to see a review that gave 'A Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine' only ONE star along with some very negative comments. This book is a complete encyclopedia (It's not just a dictionary!) of carefully translated terminology, concepts and treatment protocols rendered into high level English for those of us who haven't tackled the Chinese language. Lucky for us somebody did it! To those who don't want to approach Chinese medicine with technical precision, don't buy it! But if you want to upgrade your understanding of Chinese medicine using a terminology worthy of the breadth and scope of this traditional medicine's capacity, I can think of no other book in English that compares. It's easy to criticize and difficult to create something of value. This work is monumental in scope and I'd seriously suggest taking a hard look at this book before discounting its place in the development of Chinese medicine in the western world.

The authoring of dictionaries is a thankless task. Samuel Johnson, no stranger to this work, noted that mankind tends to consider the writers of dictionaries as the slaves of science. The work of Nigel Wiseman and Feng Ye reflects a deep sense of service to their chosen discipline, but far from being slaves they stand in the vanguard of a liberating force that is developing in Chinese medical studies. We all owe them our thanks for having put so much information between the covers of a single volume that can be used to forward the development of deeper understanding of this complex subject.

Included are small anecdotes of the families/plantations near their home as well of her stories from her time in New Orleans when she served as a maid for the Rex Krewe ball one Mardi Gras season. It is a exceptionally well-written memoir and a must-read for any history buff, visitor to the Laura Plantation (best tour of the River Road plantations IMHO) or someone that loves old plantation homes."},{"Title":"Memories of the Old Plantation Home: A Creole Family Album","review":"I collect womens diaries and memoirs from the Civil War era as well as the pioneer era. This book is a must have for southern plantation buffs. I felt like Laura was personally introducing to each member of her family. The wonderful old photographs add so much to the text. Not sorry I bought this one and it will definitely stay in my collection."},{"Title":"Memories of the Old Plantation Home: A Creole Family Album","review":"\\"Memories of the Old Plantation Home\\" invites the reader into the world of Creole Louisiana. It is centered on the family of Laura Plantation, a Creole sugar plantation just west of New Orleans. The bulk of the book is the memoirs of Laura Locoul Gore, who, born into the family and the business, chose to leave it for the world of the man she loved. Eventually, when her own children ask about her life, she wrote down everything she could remember about the old days at Laura. The manuscript remains unknown until the restorers of Laura tracked it down and brought it to publication. It is this book which brings the house to life. It use for this purpose reminds me of how Julia Grant's memoirs are used to enliven her home, Whitehaven.Laura's story includes both the legends of her ancestors and her own memories. Beginning with Laura's great-grandparents, Guillaume DuParc and Nanette Prud'homme, she tells how the families got to Louisiana and how they started the plantation which would be the family business for over a century. Progressing to her own life, Laura tells of the joys and disappointments, the monotonies and surprises and the characters who came into and out of her world. She tells of her the travels of her family between Europe and Louisiana as well as her own domestic journeys with family and friends that opened her mind to the broader world.Laura's story is supplemented by the co-authors, Norman and Sand Marillion, managers of Laura Plantation. They tell of the search which they made to discover Laura's treasure and complete it with other information about her family which they have derived from other sources.I found this to be a very interesting book. The plantation life that is so foreign to anything makes it fascinating reading. Laura lived in Webster Groves, Missouri, the suburb just east of my own. The thought that people I know could have known someone with such a story to tell makes me wonder what stories are within acquaintances of mine. What makes this book unique is its introduction to Creole life. There are other stories about plantation life in the Cotton or Tobacco Kingdoms of the Old South, but few, if any, others which have as their subject the Creole culture which lived alongside the Anglo South. This book illustrates that the Old South was a mosaic of peoples and not the uniform monolith envisioned by many. For any student of French America or the American South, this book is indispensable."},{"Title":"Memories of the Old Plantation Home: A Creole Family Album","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Wright received his M.A. and Ph.D. under the dean of biblical archaeologists, William Foxwell Albright. This 1960 book is a condensation of a larger volume that appeared in 1957.Wright begins the book by saying, \\"Biblical faith is the knowledge of life's meaning in the light of what God did in a particular history. Thus the Bible cannot be understood unless the history it relates is taken seriously. Knowledge of biblical history is essential to the understanding to biblical faith.\\"He also admits, however, that \\"The study of archaeology, however, involves the theologian in certain risks. The first is that he may find that the biblical events did not occur at all, that the Bible is little more than a congeries of myth and legend. For the most part archaeology has substantiated and illumined the biblical story at so many crucial points that no one can seriously take this position. Nevertheless, the role of archaeology has sometimes been negative.... It has to be admitted that there are numerous historical problems which archaeology cannot solve because there is not enough evidence. In addition, there is in the Bible an interpretation of events and of experience which is not subject to historical or archaeological testing.\\"Concerning the Exodus, he states, \\"(since) there is abundant evidence of the building operations of Rameses II, the Israelites must have worked there at least during the early part of his reign, if there is any historical value in the tradition at all. Thus Rameses II must have been the Pharoah who figures in the story of the Exodus.\\"Wright is no dogmatic \\"fundamentalist.\\" He accepts a 2nd century B.C. origin of the Book of Daniel, for example, and concerning the Census of Quirinius in Luke 2:1-7, he says that \\"This chronological problem has not been solved.\\"This book, though old, is still of interest to anyone interested in biblical archaeology."},{"Title":"Biblical archaeology","review":"This book is about the Bible and has nothing to do with archaeology or scientific research."},{"Title":"Geology of Oregon,","review":"The book reflects the Orrs' respective roles in geology and paleontology at the University of Oregon that began back in 1967.

Some readers may be put off by its jargon, which appears only occasionally when the author wants to make a point, e.g. calling the Letter from Birmingham Jail a &quot;performative utterance.&quot; Others might be distracted by his attention to philosophical matters, which he handles with fairly clear prose but the issues can be complex. Don't let these aspects of the book deter you from reading it. If you want to get an idea of what freedom meant to Martin Luther King (two chapters) and the organizers of SNCC (one chapter), you must read this book. That said, this book gets four stars instead of five because the author should have had a chapter on Malcolm X instead of Frantz Fanon. If it weren't as thought-provoking as it is on the issues it addresses, this omission would make it a two-star book. As it is, that someone could finish reading a book with this title and think that Malcolm X contributed nothing to the understanding of freedom during the civil rights movement is deeply problematic."},{"Title":"Stalking Justice The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer","review":"&quot;Stalking Justice&quot; is a very good book. It is the story of the arrest, conviction, and eventual putting to death of Timothy Wilson Spencer for a series of gruesome rape/murders in Virginia in the 1980s. The murders took place in Arlington and Richmond. The book focuses on Arlington Detective Joe Horgas' investigation. This was also the first murder conviction that hinged on the breakthrough forensic science of DNA fingerprinting. This not only lead to the conviction of Spencer but helped free a man who had been convicted of one of the murders.Paul Mones does an excellent job of recreating the horrific crimes and crime scenes. Spencer was also linked to a series of break-ins/rapes that had been committed by a masked man. He was truely an evil person. Mones takes the reader step by step through Horgas' investigation. He shows the reader the right things that were done and also the errors that were committed by others. I grew up in Richmond and remember the panic that shook the city to it's core during the &quot;Southside Strangler's&quot; 3 murder spree. The number of murders may not seem large by serial killer standards, but there was a genuine fear in the city, especially by women who lived alone. I also knew one of the victim's mother. She was a teacher of mine in elementary school, so I always remembered the case. A whole other book could be written about the psychological aspects of the killer's makeup, but the bottom line is this was an individual who ritualistically tortured his victims and kept them alive for long periods of time before killing them. Luckily, he was stopped.I have a few complaints about the book. First, Det. Horgas is depicted as a one man wrecking crew while all other investigators are depicted as pig-headed or incompetent. I don't believe the entire Richmond PD was that inept. It was pointed out that several people involved had reservations about how Horgas came up with Spencer's name. While the evidence shows that Spencer undoubtedly committed the murders, the question of how Horgas pulled Spencer's name out of thin air is a curious one. I have no doubt this can happen in an investigation, but it is very coincidental that it happened this way in such a high profile one. My only insinuation is that maybe there was more information not privy to the reader. Also it was mentioned that animal hairs/fibers were found but the author never gave resolution to this. Did Spencer have a dog? Maybe I missed that in my reading. These complaints are minor as the author overall did an outstanding job. My only major complaint is that no picture of Spencer was included in the photo spread in the book. All major players were shown including the man falsely accused, but not Spencer. This was an error in editing. My last observation is in regards to the DNA analysis. The author mentions another case involving Barry Sheck, where DNA analysis was thrown out when the lab's quality control came under fire. DNA fingerprinting is revolutionary in crime fighting but it is only as good as the people analyzing the samples. Spencer was undoubtedly guilty, but for the sake of innocent persons accused the labs doing the tests have to be closely monitored. The Spencer case is also mentioned in John Douglas' &quot;Journey into Darkness&quot;."},{"Title":"Stalking Justice The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer","review":"which satisfied many of my long-standing questions & concerns regarding the tragic death of one of Mr. Spencer's victims.

Knowing this book well and memorizing the key concepts doesn't make you a superb singer, just like knowing what to eat and how to exercise doesn't make you in better shape than you started. It is the practice that counts and makes the most difference. I wanted to learn to sing so I got this book. After finishing it, I noticed it takes a lot of practice, which requires time and energy. So in comparison, it's like losing weight. If you don't have the time to squeeze in 20-30 minutes or practice a day, this book won't help you much. The CD is excellent because it gives you examples of how to perform the key concepts in the book. For the price, it's well worth it since a hour of singing teachers will cost much more.

You will also see text on pages that provide definitions, quotes of various people, as well as short writings explaining various situations. This book also provides an index that could be used as a reference to quickly answer questions about Dr. King.

Alas, it's a good idea poorly executed. Beginning with its misleading title (quite a bit of the artwork is found outside the confines of Detroit City Limits), Art in Detroit Public Places is a narrow paperback stuffed with photographs and descriptions of public works of art in the Metro area.Each mosaic, statue, or sculpture is given a lone, poorly reproduced black and white picture apparently taken from the same angle by David Clements. How can a picture snapped from across the street capture the impact of something like The Heidelberg Project? A solitary monochromatic image eschews the splendor of the enormous collection of junk with its telephone poles decorated with doll heads and artist Tyree Guyton's ever-present motif of playful polka dots. I've seen inept tourists take better pictures.Alongside these pictures, Dennis Alan Nawrocki pens sketchy descriptions of the works, their creators, and their current status. It's rather ironic that this is the second edition of the work as the writing is aggravatingly set in the present. One would hope that the language would be given a more indefinite time frame. Instead of saying &quot;recently&quot; or &quot;currently,&quot; it'd be smarter to have dates cited.Even the maps that precede each of the five sections of the book are problematic. These graphics are slightly better than if a dot-matrix printer had produced them. In addition, very little effort would need to be expended to list the location of the artwork in succeeding pages on these maps. While this might seem a trifling issue, it exemplifies how Art in Detroit Public Places is an overly ambitious, under-produced mess.

Grossman and Elhanan Helpman astutely note \\"in their new book \\"Special Interest Politics\\" that \\"special-interest groups\\" (SIGs) admit of no easy definition. Grossman and Helpman sensibly adopt a definition with some empirical referents. An organization is something we can look for, and an identifiable group is a collection of individuals who resemble one another in some important respect, not just a collection of people with enough shared beliefs to have the potential to share goals and act on them.\\"\\"For Grossman and Helpman, \\"membership\\" in a group is defined functionally. Members of a group are those people whose preferences are taken into account by the leader(s) of the group. So, the main question they raise is: How do SIGs change the policymaking process? Do lobbyists improve or distort the process by providing information? The largest question is also the most difficult: How and why does money affect the policy process? What form of regulation of campaign finance, if any, would constitute an improvement over the present system?\\"To capture the intricacies of group competition, Grossman and Helpman draw on nearly one hundred years of hindsight and a very precise model. \\"Their main results offer both some standard conclusions and some more surprising ones.\\"\\"First, SIGs can distort the process, sometimes dramatically, compared to what happens in a full-information world. Because that world is not the world of modern politics, however, it is not clear that this \\"distortion\\" should be a focus for policy.\\"\\"Second, the effects of lobbying may be counterintuitive. If two well-organized groups contest a policy, the information provided by lobbyists may result in a \\"distortion\\" that actually improves policy by moving it closer to the full-information ideal, in contrast to what happens in a world in which lobbying is outlawed. Further, lobbying organizations themselves may be made worse off by the availability of a lobbying strategy. More precisely, if members of interest groups must pay the lobbying costs and the net result is worse for them, they might well prefer an equilibrium where lobbying was outlawed. Something close to an \\"invisible hand\\" result may be lurking here: lobbyists pay to provide information that improves the quality of legislative debate and choice because competition forces them to participate to avoid and even worse outcome.\\"\\"Some of the other interesting discussions involve \\"access fees\\" for legislators, the information content of lobbyists who bias is known, and the value of grassroots lobbying of voters by interest groups (through direct contact).\\"\\"The depth and scope of the literature Grossman and Helpman review and the range of topics they consider in this book are impressive. Much of the exposition is accessible, although the meat of the work is in the model developed in chapters 4-10.

While Pleasant Valley flows like a continuous story, Malabar Farm is more disconnected, and is really a set of essays that don't attempt to be in chronological order, and are occasionally redundant. Bromfield comes across here as more arrogant about his approach to farming, however, there is still a good deal of interesting material, and if you've read Pleasant Valley and liked it, you will appreciate finding out what happened over the next few years. By this time, they had given up on being a general purpose farm, and had become specialized as a grass farm focused on both beef and dairy cattle. He spends quite a while rationalizing this, and indeed, I found his discussion of this insightful as it represents the beginning of the development of the large, specialized farms of today. He presents the argument both economically and technologically. Also, this book talks more about mechanization which is featured only a bit in Pleasant Valley. Summary: not as good as Pleasant Valley, but if you read and enjoyed Pleasant Valley you will want to read this too. This book could be read independently of Pleasant Valley but will make a lot more sense if you have read that first."},{"Title":"Malabar Farm","review":"A continuation of life on the farm started in Pleasant Valley.

There's also a chapter on the organic fertilizer vs chemical fertlizer debate. Here he tries to create a balance, feeling that being a fanatic for either side is limited and though he does focus on improving soil naturally he's not opposed to chemical fertilizers. He did die at a relatively young age of bone cancer and one wonders if chemical fertilzers and herbicides/pesticides played a part. He said he was the 'fertlizer man' on the farm and also used herbicides and pesticides at first. It is sad if that's the case, devoted as he was to good farming and getting nutrients from the soil into the crops, beef and milk to prevent nutrient deficiencies in people."},{"Title":"Malabar Farm","review":"One of the important books of the 21st century.

The first time I tried to read this Short Introduction, I didn't get very far before setting it aside with the feeling that I just wasn't getting it. A year later, after reading a lot of Schopenhauer and a several longer treatments of his ideas, I found that Janaway's book was clear as a bell, and I read right through it. I'm not sure what to make of that, but I think that I just didn't approach this kind of material with the right attitude and that the fault was therefore entirely mine. See below.In any case, this is a first-rate introduction to Schopenhauer, and a very well-written one, too. Schopenhauer himself was a very clear and careful writer (no Hegel, by far), and Janaway continues in that tradition. Schopenhauer's metaphysics is, of course, speculative and that can be a problem if, like me, you come to it from an analytic tradition where everything has to be provable to be considered meaningful or taken seriously. In reading Schopenhauer, or a book like this describing his philosophy, you need to suspend those criteria temporarily and to look at his system as one extremely smart man's best guess about the nature of the world. Call it a working hypothesis that is necessarily underdetermined by the possible empirical evidence. The judgment required therefore must be an overall one as to how well you think that picture fits with the world as you experience it, granting that some number of alternative systems are possible that would fit equally well. To some degree, it's an aesthetic judgment, or perhaps a decision about what kind of world view you can be comfortable with; the key question is whether you are willing to entertain the possibility that the empirical world might not be all there is.If you are shopping around for a congenial view at that level, then Schopenhauer's ideas are well worth considering, and Janaway's introduction would be a good place to start. Or, if you just have a detached curiousity about what one of the giants of 19th-century philosophy had to say, then it's a good book for that purpose, also. One thing about Schopenhauer is that once you understand his view of things, you will have a hard time seeing the world in quite the same way as you previously did."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Concise yet engaging, this book is an excellent introduction to Schopenhauer's life and thought. The author's remarks on the difficulties and limitations of Schopenhauer's metaphysics are highly illuminating. His notes highlighting the important and influential aspects of this philosophy provide a perfect contrast to his critical remarks, and give the reader a sober, balanced view of the subject. All in all, this is a great book to read before and after delving into Schopenhauer's own works."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Janaway's little volume was the perfect introduction to Schopenhauer for me. I completed a degree in philosophy during the early 1970s. At that time, the academic world of philosophy was still in thrall to analytical philosophy. Continental philosophy was largely represented by thinkers like Merleau-Ponty or Heidegger. Habermas, Gadamer and Foucault were just beginning to be translated. My philosophy classes taught a lineage that went directly from Kant to Hegel to Marx to Husserl. Thinkers like Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer were ignored. Others like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were left for personal reading.So coming into my reading of Janaway's book I had practically no background in Schopenhauer. After reading this book, I feel like I have a sense of the historical context, a grip on the main points of Schopenhauer's philosophy, and both where to go in my reading of Schopenhauer and in the secondary literature. Not bad at all for 127 pages.The main thing I want to emphasize is that Janaway makes me want to read Schopenhauer himself. I have long had the volumes of The World as Will and Representation hanging around my bookshelf. I have now bought a copy of The Fourfold Root.. as the beginning to my further study.All I am saying is that you couldn't ask for much more than what this book gives. All in an inexpensive paperback that you can carry around in your back pocket and pull out to read during the odd moments in your day.The VSI series continues to impress me with their outstanding publications."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Arthur Schopenhauer remains somewhat notorious for his fervent pessimism concerning human existence. Not only does he claim that the universe and our embedded lives contain no purpose or special status, he also argues that determinism and unavoidable suffering inherently imbue our lives. Beneath this lies 'the will,' a kind of force or compulsion that drives us onwards towards life (not living, but life). This 'will to life' provides the foundation for our motivations, desires, and passions. It has no meaning or purpose apart from 'life.' Thus many cherished human institutions, including love, crumble into mere manifestations of this mysterious striving. Love becomes natures' way to get us to reproduce, not to passionately embody another person's being. It should come as no surprise that Schopenhauer remained unmarried throughout his long privileged, but seemingly bitter, life. Regardless, his work, written througout the nineteenth century but often sounding extremely modern, has influenced other well-known thinkers, artists and movements including Nietzsche, Wagner, Wittgenstein, and psychoanalysis. Some threads of our modern ethos seem to trace back to his brooding texts.Given that the basis for much of Schopenhauer's thought rests on the rather unintuitive Kantian notion of appearances vs. things in themselves, those unacquainted with such turgid concepts should not delve will-nilly into his magnum opus \\"The World As Will and Representation\\" without a life vest. This little book will provide the uninitiated with such security. Written in clear and readable prose, concepts such as \\"things in themselves\\" and \\"Platonic Ideas\\" become almost instantly accessible. An entire chapter is devoted to the infamous \\"things in themselves\\" as well as a survey of Schopenhauer's dissertation (inhale) \\"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\\" (exhale). The latter elucidates four ways that effects get predicated with causes. On knowledge, Schopenhauer straddles the Idealists and the empiricists. He says, like an Idealist, that reality comes from the mind (the mind-dependent and categorized appearances), but likewise says that all knowledge of this reality comes from the senses, like an empiricist. Ultimate reality, or reality as it \\"really is\\" remains mostly inaccessible to us, apart from aesthetic experiences, particularly via music (a later chapter covers his intriguing but somewhat bizarre aesthetic thoughts; 19th century artists ate it up). Thus, all we experience are representations. And our actions largely derive from the will. This book excuses this metaphysical doctrine as \\"obviously flawed\\" (as have others), but concedes that this rubbery foundation nonetheless provided the structure for the aspects of Schopenhauer's thought that still influence us today. He also had iconoclastic views on ethics and reason. Reason doesn't make a person ethical, he claims, but it can make an evil person more efficiently evil. Ultimately, reason represents a means, not an end. Ethical theories cannot produce \\"good people\\" any more than aesthetic theories can produce staggeringly beautiful eye candy. He also held surprisingly modern views towards animals and homosexuality (which he considered 'natural') given his time, but held the 19th century line on the inferiority of women. Two final chapters focus on suffering, death, denial of the will, pessimism, and Schopenhauer's influence. Much of this sounds very Eastern, particularly Vedantic or Buddhist, but the book merely grazes the surface of Schopenhauer's Eastern influences.Given Schopenhauer's contributions to our conceptions of existence, it's surprising the existentialists didn't appropriate him as fervently as they did Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. The author points out that the early 20th century was really \\"Schopenhauer's Time\\" given the pessimism and angst that followed the First World War. Many of his ideas continue to ring true in an increasingly pessimistic world. And it remains here, not in metaphysics, that Schopenhauer continues to resonate. This little book provides the perfect introduction or thumbnail sketch of the thought of the 19th century man who systematized pessimism."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book focuses on the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860).The author states in his preface that \\"This book aims to give a sympathetic but critical account of Schopenhauer's philosophy.\\" Indeed, the book at times is certainly critical; the very last paragraph of the book begins \\"Though Schopenhauer's metaphysics is not credible as a system...\\" Janaway's basic message throughout seems to be that Schopenhauer is very important for the influence he had on others (for example, Wagner and Nietsche), for the unique and often troubling questions he raised, and for the new ideas he brought into philosophy - but he is not a Schopenhauer apologist.The focus of the book is on Schopenhauer's ideas about philosophical topics like will, the body, the self, metaphysics, character, sexuality, the unconscious, art and aesthetic experience, ethics, and other issues. Special focus is given to Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, which is presented as his greatest work, and much is made of the philosopher's idea of the will to life and physical reality as a manifestation of this will.All in all I would say that Janaway does a decent job in introducing Schopenhauer's ideas, although his summary at times is a bit less clear than some of the other books in the Very Short Introduction series."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Schopenhauer, a German philosopher of the early 19th century, is a greatly neglected thinker today, despite being hugely influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably on the thought of Nietzsche, Wagner and Freud. The latter in particular, although he denied it, was greatly influenced by him. Janaway convincingly extends the list to include Mahler, Jung, Mann and others. In fact, if you have not yet delved deeply into the work of Freud or Nietzsche, I would strongly recommend that you tackle Schopenhauer before doing so, and Janaway's is the perfect introduction. It is a well-informed, readable and balanced account, neither an apology nor a savaging. Schopenhauer's metaphysics have not stood the test of time, but his worldview, essentially pessimistic yet with promise of redemption, is still very relevant, and in many ways strikingly modern. If you are at all interested in the development of modern thought, especially that of the various German and Austrian schools, then you need to acquaint yourself with Schopenhauer, and I doubt you will find a better introduction than this book."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"To pack an account of Schopenhauer's philosophy - including discussions of where he is inconsistent or where his metaphysics is questionable - into a book of 127 pages is an achievement. Such a concentrated text requires concentrated reading. I have found Bryan Magee's 'The Philosophy of Schopenhauer' of 456 pages not only more enjoyable but also more rewarding. But if it has to be done in 127 pages, it is well done here."},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is a dreadful account of Schopenhauer's philosophy. If you are coming to Schopenhauer WITHOUT having carefully read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (which I don't recommend) you would do well to read Bryan Magee's \`The Philosophy of Schopenhauer' as an appetiser, as this will set you on firm ground before reading The World as Will and Representation. I'm not going to subject people to a long and tedious essay on this introduction (Janaway's) so I will simply list various points that rankle or are flat out wrong.(x) The tone of the book, on the whole, is RANK; it being a horrible mix of both pomposity and incredulity. It is the kind of attitude that is an anathema to honest philosophical enquiry and is out of place in an introductory text designed for a lay reader: \\"How are we to take this? If meant literally, it is merely embarrassing.\\"Such an attitude becomes even more inexplicable in light of 20th century science which presented us with a plethora of counter intuitive notions about the nature of the world and which, in their emphasis on the subjectivity of experience and the limits of human knowledge, took on a distinctly Kantian-Schopenhauerian flavour. The distorting of the perceptual form in Einstein's relativity, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the wave-particle duality, Bell's theorem and the non-locality of space. Does sneering condescension befit such ideas? Janaway's attitude which seems to treat Schopenhauer as a relic of the past who is silly and inconsequential is utterly bizarre when physics has been moving in a generally Kantian-Schopenhauerian direction. (It's also an interesting side note that Schr&ouml;dinger was a Schopenhauerian)I mention the irritating and pompous tone as it seems Janaway has previous form in this regard, as can be witnessed in one of the most idiotic and vacuous reviews of a philosophical work that I have ever read, the book in question being the aforementioned \`Philosophy of Schopenhauer' by Bryan Magee, the review being published in MIND 84 . I will perhaps post the review at some point, suffice to say such writing as \\"Magee's book simply lacks sufficient first-hand involvement with philosophical issues\\" is not only deeply wrong but ACTIVELY DISHONEST. The roots of such dishonesty I can only guess at. The opening snottiness of \\"Bryan Magee has written a readable book, in a fairly popular and non-academic style, appropriate to what I take to be its introductory function. It is fairly light-weight, for all its size,\\" is equally unbearable and dishonest. If Magee's book is \\"lightweight\\" where on earth does that put Janaway's thunderous introduction? Flyweight? Bantamweight? Amoebaweight?On to the content of the book:(1) on page 21-22 Janaway writes in reference to Schopenhauer's account of perception: \\" The account has a certain ingenuity, but is troubling. For one thing, where do bodily sensations come from? They must surely be originally caused in the body by something prior to the operation of the intellect, but Schopenhauer does not discuss what that prior cause might be. Secondly, how do we apprehend the initial sensation? It cannot be that the mind perceives the sensation as a change in a material thing (the body), and yet if it does not do so, why is the principle of causality, which governs changes of material things, called into operation at all?? I'm not sure if these questions are being asked in bad faith or whether Janaway has not understood what is being said, so let's be clear: The EFFECT which is apprehended by the mind has its root in a metaphysical substratum which is unknowable, this being the thing-in-itself, the will. This distinction is the difference between what is causality and what is not causality. Causality, as Schopenhauer makes clear, being all that is left once matter has been stripped of every discernible property. If causality is then removed we are left with an X, the will, what is unknowable. (and it is important to make clear that, as should be obvious, there is no causal relationship between phenomena and the thing-in-itself)The extent to which we KNOW sensation is as something already IN a causally connected, phenomenal world as furnished by our understanding; there then appears that great disparity between sensation a some kind of localised feeling under the skin of a body and the sensually variegated phenomenal world of our perception.As regards space as an a priori form, it doesn't matter - speaking now outside this condition - whether we say NO space or space wholly unlike that of human experience (as the string theorists claim with their 9 and 10 dimensions) because neither can become known, that is, both are unknowable and if some creature claimed such apprehension his attempt to explain it to us would be unintelligible, and even then we would claim he does not KNOW the thing-in-itself because such existence constitutes a being-in-itself WITHOUT knowledge.To ask Schopenhauer to go beyond the limits of the phenomenal world and talk directly about the thing-in-itself is utterly absurd, as Janaway is doing here. This is as I said down to either disingenuousness in which case he is misleading the reader or lack of understanding in which case he should not be writing about Schopenhauer at all.(2) on page 7 Janaway writes: \\"Most importantly, the human psyche can be seen as split: comprising not only capacities for understanding and rational thought, but at a deeper level also an essentially \`blind' process of striving\\"This is poorly explained: it should be made very clear that WILL is not OF the mind, that mind is simply phenomena of the brain, but that this brain is an object IN MINDS and is thus phenomenal. WILL is the IN-ITSELF of matter; this notion of pure matter being an abstraction from what we actually perceive in experience i.e. conditioned matter i.e. the FORMS and QUALITIES OF matter.(3) on page 8 Janaway writes: \\"Many have found Schopenhauer's philosophy impossible to accept as a single, consistent metaphysical scheme.\\"Who?? Name names. Give examples. Explain why.(4) on page 8 Janaway writes: \\"What is set down at the beginning should be treated not so much as a foundation for everything that is to come, but as a first idea which will be revealed as inadequate by a second that seems to undermine it, only to reassert itself in transformed guise later on.What is this awful blather?? What is Janaway even referring to?? Schopenhauer begins the World as Will and Representation with his corrected and clarified Kantianism as it pertains to transcendental idealism. It is THE foundation stone of the rest of the book. There is no inadequacy and undermining of this section of his work in later sections. The only inadequacy is Janaway's ability to apprehend what has been said.(5) on page 17 Janaway writes: \\" He believed that empirical consciousness, limited as it was to the phenomena of space, time, and causality, was something inferior which we should aspire to escape from, if possible.\\"Another terrible explanation. It is the WILL, that underlying thing-in-itself of which this phenomenal world is a conditioned manifestation which Schopenhauer finds appalling, and it is this unceasing and unquenchable WILL that Schopenhauer wants to escape from by becoming a \\"pure subject of knowing\\"(6) On a side note: I do not believe for a single second that Janaway has read The Critique of Pure Reason from cover to cover. Maybe he browsed the spark notes?(7) Janaway uses the term \\"transcendental idealism\\" once in the entire book but uses idealism or idealist a dozen or more times in explaining Schopenhauer's position. The sense in which Schopenhauer uses the term idealism is in the sense that transcendental idealism IS idealism PROPER. Any other kind of idealism is simply an incoherent position.(8) on page 30 Janaway writes: \\"One alleges that we cannot imagine anything which exists outside our own minds, because \`what we are imagining at that moment is . . . nothing but just the process in the intellect of a knowing being' (W2, 5). This is reminiscent of a controversial argument attempted by Berkeley, who thought that an unperceived tree could not be imagined. Schopenhauer's use of the argument is not very convincing, however, because even though my imagining a world independent of my mind does presuppose my own mind, the existence of what I imagine - a world independent of my mind - does not.This is stupid and does nothing to nullify what Schopenhauer is saying. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE SUBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IN FORMULATING AN INDEPENDENT WORLD. The rest of Janaway's bluster that follows simply boils down to a matter of preference for a realist interpretation of the world and is not a counter argument.(9) on page 36 Janaway writes: \\"To subsume willing under force (or energy, which has also been suggested) is not Schopenhauer's intention.\\"In Janabuffoon's awful review of \`The philosophy of Schopenhauer' he levels this accusation at Magee, completely misunderstanding what has been said. Magee explains that such words as force and energy would of been far preferable - though not perfect - as they are more NEUTRAL than the loaded term WILL. The most applicable term being something like X. Schopenhauer explains that forces are the most immediate OBJECTIFICATION of the will in the phenomenal world; calling them qualitas occultae i.e. occult qualities because, though they aid us in explaining phenomena, they go unexplained themselves; they just are.(10) on page 40 \\"This is still troubling, however. If knowledge of our acts of will is the nearest we get to the thing in itself, and if even here we do not know it directly, what grounds do we really have for claiming to know what it is?\\"Schopenahuer never claims to know directly what it is but what it's ABOUT. Those two other senses in which he uses the term WILL i.e. ACT OF and PERSONAL (that most DIRECTLY known in consciousness, emotions, pleasure, displeasure) have the same root: MATTER i.e. percieved causality, whether body or brain. Take away the causality and you are left the thing-in-itself, WILL, in its unknowable sense. In other words, ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME. Unfortunately, Janaway does a terrible job of clearly distinguishing between Schopenhauer's uses of the term.(11) on page 40 Janaway writes: \\"As an exercise in metaphysics, Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will as thing in itself is so obviously flawed that some people have doubted whether he really means it - perhaps will is just a concept which explains a wide range of phenomena, and is not supposed to extend to the unknowable thing in itself? \\"Here Janaway ramps up his pomposity, stupidity and bluster to stratospheric heights. WILL IS THE UNKNOWABLE THING-IN-ITSELF: THIS PHENOMENAL WORLD IS A CONDITIONED MANIFESTATION OF THAT WILL. We cannot talk directly OF that will but can talk ABOUT it as we have knowledge of this phenomenal world which is its objectification.(12) on page 42 Janaway writes on the body and my will being one: \\"This would suggest, somewhat perversely, that there can be no such thing as a willing which goes unfulfilled because one's muscles or nerves do not function in the right way. (Would Schopenhauer say that stroke victims have not \`genuinely' willed, if their bodies fail to move as they want them to?)\\"Another utterly idiotic remark. There is no sense in which this willing is going fulfilled or unfulfilled because WILLING is not OF the mind and all that exists in the above case is motivation or idea in the mind of a subject. By Janaway's perverse reckoning he would say that my attempt to move a glass I saw on the table using just my mind, which then failed to move, was a failure of my WILLING. What was in my head was merely an idea or motivation. THE CONNECTION OF THIS THINKING AND WILLING IS COMPLETELY INEXPLICABLE.--This is an open review and i'll add to it when I have sufficient time or desire to rescan the book--"},{"Title":"Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Schopenhauer: A very short introduction by Christopher Janaway, Oxford, 2002, 152 ff.This is another excellent little monograph in the Oxford University Press series. Unlike one reviewer, I did not find Schopenhauer the easiest of German philosophers to study, even in translation. I did find Bryan Magee's book equally readable as this, but it is three times the length and is therefore obviously more detailed, as is Hamlyn's book for Routledge. The author here is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton and is an expert on Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.This book begins with a synopsis of Schopenhauer's PhD thesis work, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason - a ubiquitous principle in philosophy and science since Aristotle that everything must have a cause. His best known work is On the World as Will and Representation (WWR) that was much inspired by eastern mysticism. Janaway tells us how this came about and how it expands on Plato's world of Ideas, on Berkeley's \`reality in perception' and on Kant's view of the numinous: \`only the will is thing in itself . . . It appears in every blindly acting force of nature'. The identification of Wille with Kant's Ding-an-sich is one of Schopenhauer's great insights; but while Kant's ethics is an ethics of duty, Schopenhauer's ethics is an ethics of compassion.The compatibility of Schopenhauer's ideas with the Noble Truths of Buddhism is illustrated by a quote: \`as long as our consciousness is filled by our will . . . we never attain lasting happiness or peace.' Schopenhauer believed that transcendence of the material world was possible through aesthetic experience, and the role of art and music in this regard are discussed in Book III of WWR and the whole of Chapter 6 in Janaway.Schopenhauer was hugely influential on Nietzsche, on composers like Mahler and Wagner, on novelists like Thomas Mann and on C.J. Jung. Other commentators see Schopenhauer as anticipating Freud in his idea of the role of the unconscious rather than influencing him.

There are step-by-step drills provided, along with success tests for each drill.

I have applied many of the principles Strickland outlines to my own bowling technique, such as using a four-step delivery, as well as the timing of each arm motion with the feet in the swing, and have found greater success and consistency in hitting my mark on the lane. While variances will inevitably occur with each bowler (for example, I need to start with my knees bent more deeply, as I tend to lift my shoulders and drop the ball at the line, whereas Strickland recommends a more upright &quot;snooty&quot; posture at the outset of the swing), it is a good book to &quot;review the basics&quot; and check your own technique against."},{"Title":"Bowling-2nd Edition: Steps to Success","review":"I liked this book especially for its very detailed and clear exposition of &quot;targeting.&quot; Other books I have read were rather vague, sometimes confusing the setup position with the target line, never mentioning the approach line, and contradicting themselves in different parts of the book.

They may be useful for some, but many involve the use of other knowledgable bowlers, or a long bowling session, or the need to bowl in a league. I actually think that some of them should be omitted from the book, and a bit more information about the technicalities of the game included.

You gotta be kidding me. $10 maybe.I owned this book a couple of years ago when I lived in Calgary Alberta, home of the notorious Calgary Stock Exchange, and coincidentally the city Alexander Tadich (the author) lived in and the exchange he was working at and writing about. (Before the Calgary Stock Exchange was merged with the slightly better Vancouver Stock Exchange, these two exchanges were infamous for the numerous penny-stock companies involved in oil and minerals that promoters would use to pump up, hype, then dump and thus fleece \\"investors\\" who bought into the hype. But the same thing is going on at all the exchanges.)Alexander Tadich was a broker on the Calgary Stock exchange, and met many of these shysters, whom he profiles as the \\"Rampaging Bulls\\" in this entertaining, comical book. If you are looking for hard facts, there are none here, but rather real insider's wisdom as Tadich profiles how these promoters work, pumping and then dumping \\"exciting\\" companies with no financial value.While regulators moved to partially clean up those particular two exchanges of their worst excesses (probably because of this book), in fact the game continues on everywhere (ie. the pink sheets of unlisted companies, or the penny stocks) and is no better because there's always money to be made off naive \\"investors\\". Don't think for a second that this doesn't go on at all the other stock exchanges which list penny stocks, too, even the big and respectable ones like the NYSE and NASDAQ, because it does and it's legal! (Rent the movie \\"Boiler Room\\" for another (illegal) example of how these operations work.) If you're interested in stock investing, you need to arm yourself with this book.In fact, today in my mailbox I received an expensive 20 page color broadsheet promoting a company with a \\"Medical Breakthrough\\" in Stem Cells. Lots of quotes promoting this company from doctors, even from Nobel Prize winners, etc. Impressive! I just smiled to myself, recognizing the exact same game Tadich describes, and checked the fine print. Sure enough, there in the fine print it noted that this was an advertisement, these doctors were compensated for their glowing endorsements in cash and stock (a clear conflict of interest) and this jewel: \\"Shares of this company are thinly traded and (Rampaging Bull's) disposing of the shares 'may' adversely affect market price.\\" But they wanted you to buy!The game remains the same. If you want an entertaining story of how the game is played, read this book! (But don't get fleeced for $40.)To save yourself getting fleeced in the stock market follow one simple rule I learned playing the penny stocks myself: NEVER BUY ANY COMPANY THAT IS LOSING MONEY. Most of these \\"hot\\" stocks have GREAT prospects, a diamond mine or the next cure for cancer (literally), and not a dollar in actual profits. Don't worry about \\"missing out\\" because a great company this year will continue to be a great company next year, and the year after, and ten years on, giving you plenty of buying opportunities.Good luck and good investing!"},{"Title":"Rampaging Bulls","review":"It could save you THOUSANDS ! I have watched hundreds of people lose money on scams, pump & dumps & promotions. This book tells you what is going on and why you will lose your money. Its VERY rare and expensive because of its value."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"Sometimes when you read a novel, you want a searing look at the human condition or a sprawling epic crossing generations. At other times, you want complete fluff, light entertainment that makes you feel good while offering little real substance. In this field of whimsical words, few can outshine P.G. Wodehouse, and rarely is Wodehouse better than when he writes of Bertie Wooster, the dim but well-meaning member of the idle rich, and his omniscient valet Jeeves.Ring for Jeeves is the only Jeeves and Wooster story without Bertie (who is off getting an education in independence and is only referred to occasionally). Instead, Jeeves is temporarily attending to William Belfry, a poor member of the nobility who has landed himself in the soup. In an effort to raise funds to properly marry his fianc&eacute;e Jill, he has adopted a second identity as a bookie; this works great until an erstwhile great white hunter Biggar wins a long shot; Bill welshes on the bet (intending to pay when he has the funds) and flees to his estate, Biggar in hot pursuit.There is hope, however, with a beautiful, wealthy widow who wants to buy the estate and give Bill more than enough money. But with this hope comes complications. She is secretly in love with Biggar, who is in turn secretly in love with her; as he is also impoverished, he feels it wrong to marry her when it would be assumed he was after her money. She is also Bill's ex-lover, causing a potential rift with Jill. There are also complications regarding a diamond pendant and an upcoming horse race. In the middle of all this is Jeeves, the calm port in the storm of troubles, who offers various solutions, some of which are more effective than others.This is in many ways an atypical novel, hampered by Bertie's absence. Told in the third person instead of with Bertie's usually delightful narration, something is lost. In addition, Jeeves is at his best when he is at his most all-knowing; here, he seems less brilliant than usual, although still clever enough. These problems are sufficient to reduce this to a four-star effort. This is still a good book, but not a good introduction to Wodehouse or the Jeeves & Wooster stories; I recommend reading others in the series first (such as Right Ho, Jeeves; Carry On, Jeeves or Thank You, Jeeves)."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"It seems impossible, but here is Jeeves serving the young lord and master, and .... it's not Bertie Wooster! Instead it's Lord Rowcester -- Jeeves has been lent out while Bertie is off to school learning to be more self reliant.The plot is typical Wodehouse, fast and convoluted, but it's the wonderful reading by Nigel Lambert that prompts me to write this review. I consider myself a most excellent reader, but now I know I'm not worthy to fill the great man's water glass. He is superb! I didn't realize anyone could 'voice' characters that way, even the female ones! Nigel makes the book come alive, and I suspect, though I'm loathe to admit it, that it's better having Nigel read a book to you than to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"Thirty years or so ago, I wandered into a pharmacy in Peabody, Massachusets during a lunch break from a new job. I picked up Full Moon by Wodehouse for a dollar and began reading. That was one of those small turning points in life which can change and enrich all that comes afterwards.According to the Wodehouse website, \\"Plum\\" has written 99 books. That is about 2 to read per year for your adult life. They can come to resemble each other so closely that after 50 or so, you begin to suspect that you have already read the one you are about to finish sometime 5 or 10 years earlier. But it doesn't matter. What is important is the immersion into the world of Wodehouse characterized by quiet contentment, eccentric but likeable people, harmless foils and genuinely absurd twists of plot. Above all is the Wodehouse use of language. No one writes or ever will write humorous dialogue better. I don't ordinarily read books of humor because, due to a likely but undetectable character defect, I do not find them funny. (The reviewer on the back cover describes knee-slapping hilarity. I work to muster a smile.) But I find the best of Wodehouse universally funny and the worst of Wodehouse forgiveable and still worth the time.Ring for Jeeves is missing Wooster but it is fun to see Jeeves as the straight man to someone else. The humor is often provided by the red faced Captain Biggar who can't quite make the transition from equatorial African safari to English country house. In this post Victorian world of England in decline but seemingly untouched by continental wars, the ninth Earl of Rowcester is trying to sell his crumbling castle to a rich American. The path to inevitable happiness is less than smooth.If you have finished most of the Jeeves and Blandings books but have yet to wade into earlier Wodehouse efforts, pick up this book. Written in 1953 (his 74th effort) near the height of his powers, Ring for Jeeves is unlikely to disappoint."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"I concur with mrliteral (below) that this isn't top-tier Jeeves, due to his estrangement from Bertie in this tale. It's full of the typical Wodehousery and wordplay, and you're sure to enjoy, but it's not quite up to the heights of the very best. Another question: was this written as a theatre piece? With the exception of an opening at a pub, the entire narrative takes place at Bill's mansion, and frequently in one room. I imagine this may have been written for the stage and then retrofitted as a novel. No matter-- still much fun. As always, Wodehouse satisfies."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"The plot and characters are pleasant enough. Grossly obvious and slapstick, but that's one of the things we love about Wodehouse.The big problem for me, though, is the portrayal of Jeeves. In this book he seems much more garrulous and pretentious (classical quotes in almost every scene). He abets the bookmaking of the main character, wearing a disguise and a false moustache. Now, does that really sound like Jeeves? I think not. It should have been done with a new character."},{"Title":"Ring for Jeeves","review":"I'm a huge Wodehouse fan, but this is the most unfunny novel of his mature years. I thought it was a Jeeves and Bertie novel that I did not have in my collection, and was excited to come upon one that I may not remember too much of. There's a Jeeves in it, of a sort, but no Bertie. This Jeeves, if you can believe it, actually laughs out loud. \\"Ha ha,\\" Wodehouse has him say, without a hint of irony. As if that weren't enough, a little bit later he is made to scream--as part of a role-play, true enough, but do we want even role-playing Jeeveses going about the place screaming? I thought not. And the rest of the cast talk like they are from a bad 70s British sitcom.

In the preface of the edition I bought here, the Author seems to have something against the movie, but as far as I can tell, it follows the book quite nicely, whether or not the book actually went to Morocco (it didn't). The first quarter of the book was a devil to get through as the primary characters, three Americans and two Brits, all white, are fairly unpleasant to say the least. It is very reminiscent of the post WWI books by Hemingway and Fitzgerald, where the characters are Oh-so sophisticated that the world and everything about it bores them, and everyone they meet is below them. And they have the luxury to travel without end, and no job. So whack me with a dose of that, I'll write about it too. The English couple turns out to be a bit perverse, and larcenous, and the Americans never seem to care about anything, or anyone, including each other.The blurb on the back says the book illustrates the way in which \\"Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures leads to the ultimate destruction of those culutures\\", which I can understand on a national/foreign policy level (and especially if you take into account how European colonizing of the same region had an even more destabilizing effect) but the North African Arabs described here don't seem the least bit disturbed by the self absorbed and self destructive Americans that sweep through their midst, and eventually find themselves at rope's end.After the first quarter, the reader must have come to terms with the characters, and having determined that the only way forward is forward; quite suddenly, the book takes off. Soon you are at the middle and then the pages start flying by like those calendars in the old black and white movies. You can't put it down; if you're at the sort of job where you can read in your down time, as I did, and then go back to work, you find that you are part at work, and part in North Africa back when, and your days take on a rather magical cast, if also rather burdened by the omens the story puts forth, especially if you've already seen the movie and know what happens...Mr. Bowles definitely knew this part of Africa and he brings it all to the reader, in its glory, its squalor, and its sun bleached, dusty, sandstorm misery. These are not modern characters as we know them. They're not so dated that we don't know them, but we write differently when we write at all, and it's been a while since we've had the sort of war that inspired the Hemingways and the Bowles, we don't have that perspective. Of course, in this economy, I found my patience not quite in attendance for a bunch of people who don't have to work for a living, and who still find so much to complain about, but what can I say? This book is a very good read, and the reader who hasn't spent much time in older books would do well to choose this one to familiarize him or herself with an earlier era that isn't so far away that we can't understand the people who lived in it."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I just finished reading this book for a second time and was again struck by how effectively Bowles communicates his themes. We all have tensions and disappointments with our societies, countries, families and friends, but Bowles reveals the terror of complete alienation that happens when we leave it all behind. If you've ever wondered what it feels like when your protective bubble pops, you'll like this book. The plot, characters, and settings in this novel are merely vehicles for communicating this idea. Bowles is poetic: his impact grows within the reader as his words are absorbed.In response to a previous review:Bowles spent a great deal of time in North Africa and would have understood a typical American's perceptions at the time. Of course those perceptions are now outdated - would one expect otherwise? After all, the book was written only a few years after World War II ended. Good literature attempts to portray characters within their historical context, and to offer insights about the human condition - not to mold characters in accordance with someone's political views. I can't think of anything more boring and less literary than a novel portraying characters acting in ways that many university liberal arts faculty think they SHOULD act.It's pointless to judge a novel written over 50 years ago by today's standards. It's as silly as a reviewer 50 years from now passing negative judgement on one of today's novels because a character kept a pet dog, a practice which was outlawed when animals were given full rights in 2030."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I became eager to get to know the works of Paul Bowles (1910 -1999) when I got to know and love the writings of the Beats: Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs all of whom were greatly influenced by this expatriate American writer. Bowles was an American but he lived in Tangiers, Morocco beginning in 1947.Bowles also was an American composer of art music and wrote scores for the plays of Tennessee Williams, a writer I admire greatly. Thus I was pleased to have the opportunity to read Bowles's great novel, \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" (1949). It is, indeed, a remarkable book and captures well moods and feelings that are all-too-common.Bowles's novel is set in North Africa at the close of WW II. There are three primary characters: a married couple, Port and Kit, and their friend Tunner. Port and Kit are educated, intelligent, and financially comfortable. They have been married for twelve years, most of which has been spent in aimlesswandering to obscure places. They decide to visit North Africa and their friend Tunner, a newsman, accompanies them. The novel begins upon their arrival and remorselessly chronicles the deterioration and destruction of Port and Kit.The story is told in spare, understated prose and moves easily. The destruction of the characters unfolds slowly and in detail. The book presents a compelling portrait of outsiders -- of people who are alone, alienated from their families and friends and their own societies with no sense of purpose for themselves. In part, the book amplifies upon the theme of the \\"Lost Generation\\" following WW I and explores subjects, but with a far greater degree of discipline and restraint, that the Beat writers would also explore.We don't learn many details about the protagonists -- about the reasons for their estrangements and feelings. The marriage of Port and Kit is deeply troubled as they sleep in separate rooms and have difficulty talking. An inevitable triangle develops with Kit and Tunner becoming lovers for an instant. During the book, both Port and Kit takes steps to become closer to the other -- with Kit filled with remorse for her affair with Tunner -- but to little avail. The book moves with the force of doom as Port dies midway in the book and Kit, after a series of harrowing experiences, descends into madness.There are vivid pictures in the book of the Sahara Desert, of many towns, trains, hotels, and buses in North Africa and of a host of secondary characters, including French military officials, native inhabitants, and other wanderers of bad or uncertain purpose. We see the shallowness and foolishness of our three travelers in venturing witlessly into a forbidding land that they don't understand. But this book is far more than a conventional story of a clash of cultures. It shows people who are hollow and adrift inside meeting a terrible fate brought about by their own fundamental ignorance.This is a tough-minded and terse book. It taught me about the place and much more about the characters and their condition. The events of the book are sad and disquieting in the extreme. But I felt a certain sense of catharsis, understanding, and release upon the conclusion.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"What a sad, sad story Bowles The Sheltering Sky is. It is not sad in the sense of being powerful, but sad and strange in a completely different way. There is no real resounding message or theme that ultimately comes through. But its very nature seems to depress. The characters are real, in a weird way. I think the sublime description Bowles used about the world around them is the most significant aspect of the novel. It describes the setting and emotions with clarity and originality. I don't know if there is a point to it all, but it is a very interesting ride to take.The story opens in caf&eacute; in Northern Africa. Here we will be introduced to the characters we will follow throughout the remainder of the story. One is an ambitious traveler named Port. It never explains fully how he acquires all the money to go on his trips and journeys. One thing is for certain. This is how he lives his life. He is with his wife named Kit. She is a complex character who is beginning to feel estranged from her husband. They really have little in common. The third character is named Tanner, who is a friend of both of them. Tanner secretly lusts after Kit and will eventually sleep with her later on in the novel. Kit never will tell her husband about it, but it will remain with her.Together the three make their journey deeper and deeper in the Sahara. Tension increases, the weather escalates in climate. Port and Kit seem to constantly be arguing, and on one night of drunken passion inside of a train, Kit and Tanner commit adultery. That is not to say Port is perfect either. There are a couple of scenes in which he attempts to sleep with women, but both turn out badly and he never gets the chance.Eventually, Port ends up ditching Tanner in an attempt to be alone with his wife and spend some together. It seems the more they are alone, the more distance elapses between them. They continue to travel deeper and deeper into the Sahara desert. Conditions become worse. Tanner continues to follow them. Port, however, becomes very ill and only in his final moments is there any moments of closeness between him and his wife. But it feels forced.After his death, Kit realizes she really did love her husband. She ends up going mad from the whole experience. She runs away. The novels final moments show her in her frenzied state and Tanner's quest to find her. These scenes are well drawn out. While before the narration used to comment frequently on her thoughts, after she loses her sanity, the prose suddenly halts. We do actually feel that she is crazy.I felt both sad and intrigued reading The Sheltering Sky. It was highly creative with its use of language and feeling. I guess the main point was to describe the dissolution and strain of relationships. But again, the message was a bit muffled. Nevertheless, my mind didn't think about it all too much. I enjoyed the beauty and depression of it all. It manages to do both at the same time and it works.This is an odd and appealing story. One, despite how familiar it should be, manages to put a fresh spin on its content. Bowles is certainly a talented writer. His description is flawless and the characters are eccentric and believable. It unfolded much like a haunting dream one has, or the haunting moments we fear will never come to pass in our own lives. It is unfortunate that for Port and Kit, their nightmares really did come to pass, but we can't help but be fascinated to experience it.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I regret that Bowles never won the Nobel Prize in Literature for he surely deserved it. Sheltering Sky is poetic and beautifully written. Bowles weaves both dream and fable into the fabric of the novel also. Sheltering Sky is an exceptional existential novel that tears the veil of illusion for the American consciousness in much the same way that Sartre and Camus did for Euro-centric consciousness. The title is a supreme irony, since the sky does not shelter us, the blue is illusion, the darkness is the reality. The characters in the novel carry all the illusions and arrogance of Western civilization with them into a Muslim country and step by step the illusions are stripped from them, challenging their relationships, identities, health, and lives. Bowles is the master at revealing personal identity as a social construct, a fragile collection of illusions and memory and attachments. Bowles sees this personal identity as extremely vulnerable when put under pressure and in Sheltering Sky a rich arrogant well-educated couple are put into the pressure cooker of the Arabian desert.It is a story of loss and adjustment to loss. For example, the protagonists, Port and Kit, have a shell of a marriage and have fallen out of love. They enter the stage partially dealing with this loss. They struggle and never recover. Bowles carefully paints them as selfish, aggrogant, rich, spoiled, intellectualizing, Western-centered folks who actually represent a large portion of the American upper middle and upper classes. Are these characters likeable? Not really, but do we read because we want to \\"like\\" the characters? Rather, Kit and Port are real characters, we feel ambiguous about them, and we shiver as they lose their thin veneer identities under the assaults of contracting cultures and extreme challenges of the natural world.Port and Kit travel to Morocco where they must struggle against a vast and hostile nature and a foreign and unfamiliar culture. Then, step by step they lose every illusion which sustains their flimsy identity. They are forced to confront their mortality and Port does not pass the test. Kit's final situation is more ambiguous. She loses her mind, she becomes the slave concubine of a nomadic camel driver, she is rescued and returned to an oasis of Western culture, yet she escapes back into the dessert.Bowles is the master at stripping away fantasy and illusion, revealing the amazing fragility of human existence and meaning. This is one of the finest novels of the 20th century with so many painful lessons to absorb."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"... having lived and loved in Morocco, I have been eager to find someone who can articulate the ferocious mystery of the places I loved.But Paul Bowles -- who loved the desert, spent his life in Morocco -- gives his characters only disdain. They are people dulled by boredom, depression, loneliness... fascinating, probably, but we can't get into their heads. They speak over ours.After the death of one character, the novel becomes something else entirely. Kit's journey through the desert, her captivity in the harem of a desert man, and her descent into madness felt made-up, tacked onto the end of another story, hype, laziness on the part of a talented writer who got bored with his own work."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I remember the passing of Paul Bowles: writer, composer, traveler, translator, icon, historical figure, friend, and destination to many around the world. I had just finished reading \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", and my paperback edition showed many turned-over corners that I used to mark interesting passages or prose. On everyone's list of the 100 Greatest English Novels, it is an engaging and hypnotizing view of the edge of civilization in North Africa, set in the period just after World War II, as seen through the eyes of a world-weary and disenchanted American couple and their friend. That period in Europe and North Africa following World War II is such fertile ground for expression; the post-war despair amid the growing tide of nihilism in regards to all things human, that is rich soil in which to plant a seed. About us is the daily life we know, and in the desert is the life out there, just beyond our horizon and experience, the one in which all things are possible. As for the life out there, (in which we may find the meaning of ourselves, or in which we may lose everything), that unknown life awaits us if we seek it. As for the life we know, that is moving inexorably to its end, along with us and our possibilities, as we head towards are own demise and the cosmic ironies beyond.\\"How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it?

Little had changed in the landscape, the cities and cafes apparently, since Mr Bowles had lived in the Maghreb. A giant time capsule with raw emotions, hidden yet ever present sexuality, friendliness and sudden hostility alternating in most relations, surprising calm of the Tuaregs when facing obvious dangers, near suffocating history everywhere, sights in the desert defying description of 'magical' or 'surreal'--it was all there.The book is a feverish yet quiet masterpiece. The movie avoid at all cost even a John Malkovich can't save."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Astonishing work, but kind of falls apart at the end.

What I did understand, I did find rewarding. I understood the existential levels of the novel as well as some of the feelings of dissociation I felt during my own travels in North Africa.This book could have received less than five stars from me if I did not stop and correct my attitude towards the writing.Instead on focusing on plot, themes, and the subtleties of the novel in this review I will only recommend to the reader to take their time with it, re-reading parts if they have to.

The further you run, the more lost you become. It is one of the few books I've read which left me searching out others who have read it to disect it to its purest, most profound message. (I want to invite the author to tea!)"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"In The Sheltering Sky, Paul Bowles has written a wonderfully evocative novel of Westerners in Africa in the years after World War II. My experience with Africa amounts to a day spent in Morocco at the turn of the century as a chaperone to a group of students. I loved the experience but many of the students were uncomfortable. I think this was because the culture there is so very different from anything most Americans ever experience in their lives. I am amazed at how well Bowles is able to bring to life this land and culture in his novel.Interwoven with his portrait of this desert culture is the story of a couple, Port and Kit, who are traveling through the region with a friend named Tunner. Port and Kit are the main characters here. They are a pair of well-off Westerners who travel with no itinerary or time limit. They indulge themselves not only in the pleasures of the places they travel but also in their knowledge of the other's nature. They desire closeness with each other but create distance in their denial of their own knowledge and wants. They try to escape in their travels but they have arrived in a land that will force them by its harshness and beauty to look more closely at themselves. They are incredibly interesting characters who undergo very moving tragedies.On top of that there are a number of wonderfully drawn minor characters in this novel. Besides Tunner, there is the horrible and yet comic mother/son pair, the Lyle's. There is the sick French commander, Lieutenant d'Armagnac, as an example of a man who has made his peace with Africa and enjoys it. There is the Jewish merchant, Daoud Zozeph, as well as Belqassim who adds Kit to his harem of three other wives. All of these, and more, populate the novel with intriguing takes on what it is to survive in this world. I recommend this novel to anyone.A final note for fans of the band The Police and their album Synchronisity. The song &quot;Tea on the Sahara&quot; from this album is drawn from this novel. If you like the song, I suggest you read this novel. It will add to your experience of it."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I just finished reading this book for the second time. The first was nearly thirty years ago when I was in my impressionable twenties. At that time I considered it extremely powerful and I, as an addictive maker of lists, thenceforth ranked it as my favorite book. Now, a thousand experiences later, including a ten-day venture to Morocco (I currently am an ex-pat living in Spain), I decided to get the book off the shelf and read it again. Would the book live up to my own rapturous opinion of it?The answer, quite simply, is yes. Bowles creates a story as gripping as any I've known and had me hanging on every word. The bizarre relationship between Port and Kit, the depiction of the Arab world, the caravan crossing the desert, everything is painted in masterful strokes while leaving much food for thought. For instance: Why do some people, like myself, feel so alienated from American culture that we go to great lengths to distance ourselves from it? Bowles offers a clear answer while showing the consequences of fleeing that culture and pitching ourselves headlong into another more exotic one. A more emotional reading experience would be hard for me to imagine."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The protaganists in this book are thrown around with such violent force that even the non-perilous episodes are unsettling. At the opening of the book, which takes place not long after their arrival in Africa, you get a sense for three bored, generally self-centered Americans who seem to be getting along with their lives on reasonably sure footing. By the end of the first chapter, each starts the process of loosing their grip on that forward motion.Bowles examines the loss with a subtle touch. The interior bearings of the characters change in barely noticable increments throughout the book - only after many pages do the internal changes add up substantial changes in action.Even as Bowles depicts the characters with enormous flaws, its hard not to identify with them, and with their growing powerlessness. Its definitely artful, and its most definitely wrenching. When these characters are in pain, the thousands of miles of foreign emptiness surrounding them amplifies their smallness. When they are dominated in many ways by people better equipped to the land then they are they seem smaller still.All in all an outstanding novel, heavier and bleaker than I expected."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"If you are expecting The Sheltering Sky to be nothing more than a travelogue of Morocco coupled with a forgettable story ... well, you'll be surprised. Perhaps more so than any other novel I've read Paul Bowles succeeds in expressing the most deep, complex human emotions into words. And he does so without making The Sheltering Sky a cumbersome read. The narrative flows rather well. Yet this book is not for avid readers of Oprah books; The Sheltering Sky is far more ambitious and disturbing than anything published nowadays. And as for a travelogue, this book will not enhance Morocco's tourist business.The story? On the surface it is about a floundering American couple who, in the late 1940s, head to Morocco with hopes of having some fun (and salvaging their marriage). However as we soon learn, through deliciously subtle language, is that not only is their marriage having troubles but our couple have seemingly forgot about their reasons for living. Worse, this trip becomes a nightmare (..no spoilers). Towards the end of the book we get an especially close look at the wife's spiritual death/re-birth (..this latter aspect might be offensive to conservative/religious folks).As with the other reviewers I must say The Sheltering Sky is truly a special, memorable read. It is a challenging but not an especially difficult read. And I found the author's views of Arabs and foreigners to be relatively balanced. Or rather, no one race/nationality is portrayed better/worse at the expense of another.Bottom line: one of the few books rightly called a modern classic."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A strange and disconcerting book. Sometimes too removed, always visually descriptive, not wholly satisfying, occasionally heartbreaking.Post-colonial Algeria presents the couple with a false sense of belonging in a strange place; and a feeling of arrogant entitlement which they are reluctant to acknowledge in themselves. At once, they view themselves as a part, and apart, of the environment. They distinguish themselves from boorish stereotypes, (Mrs Lyle and her son), by their liberalism, and validate their presence abroad, as travellers, who are exploring not imposing.Landscape as a metaphor - its bleakness and aridity mirrors the state of love between the two protagonists. Its monotony of sky and sand dunes and dirt causes a gross discomfort (for the couple) - similarly, the familiarity of their relationship provokes insecurity. The sky does not shelter; nor what's beyond the sky (Port reaches here through death).The slow breakdown of Kit and Port's relationship is recorded, through its absence, rather than its presence. Their isolation from each other, runs parallel to their alienation as westerners within north Africa.Tunner provides a foil, of sorts, to this event (as well as being an object at which tensions are directed). He directly aids its destruction through his clandestine affair with Kit, but also, he remains the ubiquitous third party with whom one, or neither, of them side. By turns, he brings them together, and splits them further apart.Port's death sees the renewal of Kit's life. It gives a release that she has presumed she would never find again. She abandons her superstitious outlook, realising that the only \`omens' she discovers, are of her own making. She takes control. Previously, control was shared, and responsibilities dictated by this sharing.However, her control is short-lived. Effectively, she's swallowed up by the Sahara. Stylistically, the third section of the novel, with its automatic and unconscious narrative, echoes this. Whilst the previous two parts are rooted in realism, the third gives over entirely to complete surrealism. The descriptions of place, become even more vivid - they take precedence, as the desert overpowers Kit.Kit successfully loses herself - a strangely satisfying ending - to insanity, the desert, and anonymity, her aloneness (only compounded by grief), becoming unbearable. The novel consistently remains a subtle drama, allowing the reader only ever half way into the characters, at which point they become merely symbolic, often frustratingly so. Theme - the psychology of post-war existentialism - predominates characterisation.Bowles' attempts to remove focus from the straightness of the plot can be skimmed, although all sub-events work towards, rather than against, expression of the former. Kit and Port's journey remains mostly unexplained - perhaps Bowles felt no explanation was necessary."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I am essentially a reader. I've spent countless hours reading in my life, and my my career is (can you guess?) librarian. Take my word for it, this book is fabulous. Bowles can transport you. You won't look at life the same way after reading this book. It's beautiful and searing, going straight to a truth like an arrow to a target. It's magic."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles loved Edgar Allen Poe, wrote poetry in Paris and befriended several of the surrealist poets instead of going to college, and he married Jane who later went mad. Bowles terrain is not for the meek and he does not strike a wide variety of notes in his fictions but it is so very well written that the often spare and hollow content of each work is made palatable even seductive to readers who normally might not walk on the wild side. The desert is his favorite atmosphere. The Sheltering Sky is his best known work and the only of his many novels to gain a wide audience. His short stories are also exquisite and there are many of them. The short story is a form he is very comfortable with. Sheltering Sky is the travelogue of a couples journey .....but where to and why. You will have to read it. The less you know going in the better. Invisible Spectator is an excellent biography also. If you catch the Bowles bug you will also be led to Isabelle Eberheart's Oblivion Seekers. And his protege Mohammed Mrabet. Bowles left America in the 40's and lived in North Africa all his life rarely making visits abroad. The beats worshipped him for letting in the sex and the drugs. He was also a trained composer and collector of tribal music(Master Musicians of Morroco, excellent CD). His original recordings might be worth seeking out as a good accompaniment to his written work."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"After having spent a night in Tangier, Morocco, I now admire Paul Bowles' attention to the eccentricities of Arab life for such nave foreigner readers as myself. One can read The Sheltering Sky in a number of ways. To begin with there exists enough of a plot to read it straight through without considering the existential philosophies integrating into the narrative. I do not suggest such a bare reading. You will be left feeling both empty and partially disgusted by the novel. However, one may, with a deeper vision, uncover the extensive thought and emotion with which the book was written. There is substance, perhaps more than you are prepared for in your own reading of it. Bowles' language varies from the sparsest of descriptions to such heart-wrenching of psychological analyses that the reader may need to put the book down to contemplate the situations of the characters. Bowles' structure is supported by the subtle and affective repetition of themes. From the opening scene, he continually draws our attention back to characters while they are in or emerging from states of utter rest, and unconsciousness, even. The Sheltering Sky exists now as a classic of 20th century literature. If you are interested in the travels of such mid-century artistic renegades as Ginsberg, Kerouac, or Gysin, this novel is essential in understanding their fascination with the author and his setting. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to improve on Bowels' description of North Africa and its inhabitants. Although he doesn't bombard you with flowery prose, he captures the essence of the land and the people who he encountered there."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Upon reflection after reading The Sheltering Sky, I found the eccentricity of the characters, the haunting, dreamlike quality of their lives, and the way in which their dreams deteriorated into abject nightmare overwhelming. So much so, that I sat and cried for the better part of an hour.Kit's desire to be close to Port leads her into the desert chasing his love of the desert, and her twin desire to be rid of all responsibilty whatsoever comes to pass as her captivity in the harem. I heard in my head the admonishment to be careful what you wish for as I read this book, and it seemed as if almost everything the character's wanted they were given, but the finer points which they failed to elucidate in their wishes were spelled out for them in lieu of further clarity on their parts as to what they wanted from their relationships to the world.I identified strongly with Kit. Port was her connection to reality, and at one time, I had my own, which mired me within the ports of the sane. For a time, I took a trip on the road to insanity, and finally found the connection to reality within myself. Kit's passage on her own trip felt frighteningly familiar. I daresay, that the description of her descent into madness is neither facile, nor unbelievable. I found it very disquieting, and the memories it engendered were quite painful. The feeling of being at more than a loss for words that Kit's character describes at one point rang all too true. At a certain point you can feel as if your native tongue is like a foreign language that you do not know, and therefore you cannot give an accurate account of your tenuousness to bystanders.All of this brings me to the point that if the ultimate journey to be made is into our own souls, then running and hiding from everything that surrounds us, looking for the exotic won't change the ultimate destination. We cannot get away from ourselves. The world is our house of mirrors. At the risk of sounding facile, we can be our own worst enemies, or own best friends.And in the adventure to understand ourselves and others, the unrelenting, and often harsh world of nature will be none to happy and emotionless about helping us to find what it is we seek. Nature, represented by the desert in this harsh existentialist tale, is a demanding mistress. The presence of the desert as a character makes me wonder about the necessity of Tunner as a character on the trip with Port and Kit. More likely, he has the significance to the story of a fly on the nose, while the desert is the true third party in this 'love triangle'. The desert is almost a transferance and personification of Port's desire to be close to the love of his life, Kit, and her intellectuality not withstanding, Kit's emptiness, her vacuousness that lies at the core of her intelligence, her veneer of intelligence, is consuming.Could not the 'sheltering sky' be like the veil of existence, or equally like the impenetrable mask of make-up that Western women apply to their faces, and which Kit obsessively does so often in the book, almost as if to keep up the barrier between what lies on the outside and what lies beneath?And what lies beneath can be almost like a seperate identity, another side to oneself that is indifferent to misery and happiness, that just exists like the blackness behind the sheltering sky. Neither good nor bad, but simply malleable in either direction. Port's mistress as the desert, is really his desire to understand himself and his relationship with Kit. He cannot fathom it. Kit, for her part, attempts to understand his fascination with the desert in order to learn the truth of both her existence and Port's, and what she learns makes her appear to everyone else as if she has been robbed of her sanity. But who truly knows?This novel is all about the unanswered and unanswerable questions of existence. More than just existential, it is a meditation on the meaning of life that refuses to give pat answers to the Hollywood crowd who wants a neat resolution in 120 minutes. Life is not like that, and neither is Bowles novel. This may deeply chagrin some who read it, and drive them to conclude that the novel is all pretention, while others like myself will read it and be bowled over by the frightening intensity with which Bowles holds the magnifying glass to the smoking insect of our lives...much as Kit does to a particular insect at a certain point in the novel. Need I mention that Bowles uses metaphor mercilessly. The glare of the sun on the truths of our lives is relentless, like the heat of the desert, and no amount of putting sheets over windows, or the locking of doors will ultimately be able to keep that out.Bowles is exceptional as a writer for his ability to make the reader see where the doorway is into understanding their own existence. This novel was never meant to be purely \\"entertainment\\" or escapism. It cruelly leads you off on that path, and then turns, when your water has all run out, and the camel is tired, and lets you see the edginess behind its pupils that you somehow seemed to miss upon first glance. Some people cut out early on the journey, as did Port, while others finish it to the bitter end. The question is, ultimately, is it really bitter? I think the enigmatic quality of the ending only points up that nothing is ever really writ in stone."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This novel centers around a married couple who are supremely selfish and emotionally defective.

But still, it was engaging to read particularly because I was encountering the locations, people, and environment that is showcased by The Sheltering Sky. The plot is not the most compelling one though. So, I am unsure if this book is something I would have enjoyed if I wasn't already there."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Nowhere close to Camus and a book with a slightly overrated image. Check out Sartre or Canetti for some real insights into the heart of this century."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A part of me hates to pass judgment upon a book I don't like or which doesn't interest me, because it reflects my own tastes and nothing else. And yet I write Amazon reviews to warn other people who might be like me and want to give new things (books, music, etc.) a try and I just want to give them my opinion on the item as a former newcomer to it.I am a Burroughs fan and Burroughs moved to Tangier, North Africa mostly because of Paul Bowles and his novels (all of which, I understand, are set in Tangier.) Burroughs had nothing but praise for Paul Bowles' novels. Intrigued after all these years of hearing the praise, I decided to finally give Bowles a try.I think that I may have likely made the wrong decision in buying & reading THE SHELTERING SKY first... His later novels, especially THE SPIDER'S HOUSE, have gotten more praise & acclaim (even from Burroughs) than this one. But still, I read a synopsis of the novel and it looked appealing: a writer in a strange land having estranged, strained relations with his wife. I felt right away that I could relate to such a situation and that it would be a good novel to read; as a young man in high school I felt like a stranger in a strange land and I had a serious, steady girlfriend of more than 4 years, and my meteoric rise as a young, compulsive writer of \\"autobiographical fiction\\" coincided with the disintegration of my relationship to this girl.But, alas, reading this book I felt no such empathy with any of the characters. Really, I am just not worldly, and this might be the reason. But in any case I simply could not relate to these expatriates of the '40s.But the main problem I have with the book has to be the writing itself; Burroughs has suggested that the aim of a writer is to \\"evoke clear images with his writing.\\" An obvious conclusion -- in my opinion THE DEFINITIVE GOAL OF WRITING -- but which I think Paul Bowles fails at in this novel; I had a hard time 'seeing' the action of the first 50 pages, which is as far as I got into it before I had to set it down for good in disinterest. Truth is the novel didn't really interest me from the start; the first page has some nice sentences, but other than those the book failed to capture my interest.Again, it may be my own fault as a reader for not getting into this book -- I'm not an avid reader of books these days and haven't been one for years now, mostly just going back and re-reading old favorites for kicks and to pass time -- but I sure hope his later novels are better than this one, or I am inclined to suggest the man's reputation as an excellent writer is unfounded.Because of THE SHELTERING SKY, I am extremely reluctant to read his later novels, and his short stories, etc. for fear of wasting more money."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Three profoundly annoying American expatriates wander around Saharan Africa as, to our great delight, increasingly horrible things happen to them.

Given the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I kept reading on, assuming that \\"this has got to take off soon.\\" It never did. Nothing led anywhere, nothing mattered, nothing happened. Maybe, as some previous reviewers suggested, that's the point: this book is about nothingness, and thereby makes a statement about the twentieth century soul. But if that's what I wanted, I could just have stared at a blank piece of paper for fifteen minutes. When I read a book, I want to engage with the book on some level, and I did not engage on any level whatsoever with this book.

I do not like being depressed and so my first impression was that I did not like this book. Then I read other reviews and decided that a book that can depress you is pretty powerful. On the whole, I got the impression that the Moresby's were procrastinating their life and merely subsisting. Bowles exposes their weaknesses in all areas, Kit's especially. Both the Moresby's lose their sanity at the end, if not more than that. I would give this book four stars except that it didn't give me the desire to read it again. Some passages were very hard to discern and some details seemed unnecessary.

It not only has a fantastic story line, but it is as psycolgically engaging and interesting as any I have ever read.Definitely a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is a novel of escape from the known environment and of pilgrilamge into the soul. Port and Kit, an American couple, and their &quot;friend&quot; Tunner arrive in the Sahara during WWII and travel around. At some point, Tunner goes his own way, and Port gets sick of tyfoidea, so the couple has to find refuge in a French military outpost. What follows next is a sunburned account of a descent into mental hell. Throughout the novel, time seems to stand still. The characters wander around beneath the hallucinating atmosphere of the Sahara, under the sheltering sky, so brilliantly blue you'll see it and feel the dry heat coming from the sun. The plot is not that important, since the main character is the desert: the sun, the sky, the sand and the transparent air. There's always a sense of strange and tense sensuality.No matter how much they travel, the characters are trapped in themselves. Kit will find out for the first time she's alive when she submerges in the cool waters of an oasis pond. She can't stand the idea of going back to New York.Bowles, who lives and writes in Morocco, has produced an original and ver visual novel. The reader gets lost in the desert as much as the characters, feeling and seeing the desert in its full, brutal and desolated beauty. An accomplishment of writing, this novel will leave you wanting to do your own spiritual search in a desert, hopefully with better results."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Pointless, convoluted soul searching by irritating characters who could have sorted their problems with a straightforward chat over a cup of coffee. I can only think that Bowles was exploring what happens when already deranged Americans arrive in a foreign land.The conversation is contrived. The thought processes near insane in their detachment from reality (were Port and Kit schitzophrenic?). The attempts to make the mundane seem mysterious irritating (the Lyles were just con artists and thieves - that's all).Certainly Kit's inexplicable behaviour at the death of Port and her subsequent Heart of Darkness like journey into a Saharan erotic mental and physical imprisonment suggests there was a serious mental instability already lurking.In short, they should have been seeking therapy in New York. They were too unbalanced and immature to take a train to Boston (let alone be married)."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"It's very difficult to get a read on why any of the characters do what they do.Kit getting raped by an Arab father son tag team, and thinking really nothing of it and in fact enjoying it, is bizarre. Sure she was in no position to complain but you'd think she'd be ever on the lookout to escape when she got to their home and town..... but instead her thinking is flaky and flat. She excepts everything as tho she knew no better. As tho her life before never happened. Plus how she got herself into this predicament was unbelievably crazy, she must be the weakest woman in the world. So I'm left to assume she was unstable to begin with. The only real thing we are told about her is that she is a person who is scared of everything, which doesn't jiv with her action of taking off alone into the desert on foot.I think Bowles was being intentionally shocking to sell his stories. This was published in 1949. Kit's husbands actions were just as incongruous and reckless. And the mom-son team, jeez!, I don't know how they even survived, they belonged in the loony-bin.Bowles writing is good it's just his story that's not engaging."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This book is too flawed for me to consider it \\"great.\\" It's a worthwhile book to read--unless you're a postmodernist--but Bowles' reach doesn't meet his grasp. When he pushes the narrative along, the book is effective and engrossing. When he strives for profundity, the reading becomes tedious. Some plot points seem ludicrous and factitious, and other points (and characters) are left unresolved. (Tobias Wolff overpraised this book using nonsense sentences like, \\"It has the inevitability of myth.\\") Eh...I recommend the book, but one must keep their expectations measured."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I *HATED* this book. There is nothing likeable about the characters, nothing to draw you in and care about what's going on in their heads. Rich, spoiled, selfish. Bah. I think Bowle's portrayal of Kit was shallow and unrealistic. He says she gets through her days balancing an internal dialog of omens and signs, yet after he mentions this, there's no evidence of her doing this. I think he got the female character way wrong, expecting her to validate her existence only if there was a man in the picture. And his portrayal of the \\"natives\\" of the various locales was incredibly unflattering. Why go deeper and deeper into the desert seeking a \\"real\\" experience if you're going to dis the people who live there? Alienation, existential angst, yadda yadda yadda. Yeah, we get it, but who cares with these people? I think this book is like The Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone talks about how great it is but in reality, it sucks."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"For a man who has spent decades living in Morocco, Paul Bowles does a poor job of bringing the Sahara Desert to life in his novel, The Sheltering Sky. After reading the book, I was honestly surprised to find that he lived in and around the Sahara for so many years. I had already forgiven this shortcoming of the author as a valiant attempt by a non-African when I was disappointed to find that the opposite was the case. Bowles' limited powers of description are not a result of his life experience.The Sheltering Sky lacks structure and character development, is rambling and at times supremely boring, and leaves many loose ends dangling in the desert wind. Many of the decisions made by the characters in the book leave the reader baffled because Bowles gives a minimum of background information on them. While this may be called Bowles' &quot;style&quot; by some, it is more likely that the true culprit is amateurism. This is the kind of book that you finish in hopes of a fantastic ending with a few plot twists, but Bowles disappoints and leaves you feeling as empty as the desert landscape. He really misses the opportunity to bring back some of the characters he loses along the way.I am amazed that there are plans to make a major motion picture out of this book. The Sahara Desert will surely provide a boring visual complement to an already boring story. Though there are some cheap sex scenes in the story (which will likely be over-dramatized for public interest) the movie will, and should, flop."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky aspires to be a sweeping, elegiac novel in which the protagonists' confrontations with the hostile, foreign elements of both nature and humankind provide a figurative structure from within which the author can make beautiful, momentous and pithy observations on our modern lives.Put it another way: there aren't many funny bits. The Sheltering Sky takes itself very seriously indeed.Alas, Paul Bowles' enterprise is completely undermined by the (actually fairly well observed) characters: the lead roles in this Saharan melodrama are played by a husband and wife who have fallen out of love with each other. If this were all, I think Bowles might have got away with it. But crucially, the couple - Port and Kit - are also two of the most dislikeable lead characters to be found anywhere in contemporary fiction.Port is selfish, unfaithful, rude and arrogant. Kit is hardly better: duplicitous, similarly unfaithful, hysterical, and given to an annoying irrationality which, towards the end of the book veers inexplicably towards sheer lunacy. Another reviewer has described them as \\"innocents abroad\\". That may be how they're regarded in the author's homeland; people in other parts of the world would recognise them as something rather different and, I'm bound to say, less appealing: \\"Americans abroad\\".Port and Kit have the most irritating, implausible conversations; the sort which could only be invented by an author trying to explore Important Things. Consider the following exchange:\\"\`Why don't you extend your good wishes to all humanity, while you're at it?' she demanded.\\"\`Humanity?' cried Port. \`What's that? Who is humanity? I'll tell you. Humanity is everyone but one's self. So of what interest can it be to anybody?'\\"Anyone conducting this conversation in real life is, I respectfully submit, asking to have their lights punched out.It is thus extremely hard to give a damn about either of the characters. And when an author has lost (or in this case, never really gained) his audience's sympathy for his protagonists, then any message that might be embedded in their experiences is likely to remain buried (because the reader can't be bothered to look for it) or worse, to be rejected altogether. Instead, one can take perverse pleasure from their misfortunes (which are many and varied) - but this can hardly have been what Paul Bowles intended.It is hard to understand what Bowles did intend, though: his writing at critical points is oblique enough to be completely meaningless. Again, take an example - a complete paragraph which arrives pretty much out of nowhere:\\"His cry went on through the final image: the spots of raw bright blood on the earth. Blood on excrement. The supreme moment, high above the desert, when two elements, blood and excrement, long kept apart, merge. A black star appears, a point of darkness in the night sky's clarity. Point of darkness and gateway to repose. Reach out, pierce the fine fabric of the sheltering sky, take repose.\\"If you know what on Earth that's all about, you've done better than me. And if you care, then this may be the book for you. If not, consider exchanging days of irritation for two short hours of it: rent Bartolucci's film version instead.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Above all this novel is a well written account of Americans with too much time and money travelling through post-WWII Africa. While reading this book I felt as if I was in the deserts of northern Africa. I could feel the scortching sun and see the endless dunes of sand. However, I could also feel the lethargy and boredom of the travellers. These well-to-do Americans seem to roam the continent with little purpose or insight. There is not enough background information given as to the motivation of the travellers. How I wish I could have the time and money to just travel the world at will! The biggest turnoff was the fact that given the exotic locales these characters did nothing more than sip tea at cafe's or lay in bed all day and night. The only reason I would reccomend this novel is that it is written so well that you can actually picture being exactly where the characters are, which is a place and culture very different than the United States."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"As I read more and more into the life of Jane Bowles, I thought I would benifit from reading some of her husband's work. It enrages me to think that he became the famous one, for he lacks all the wit and charm of his wife's writing. The only thing I feel I got out of this book was a small biographical view of his feelings for his wife (Kate/Jane, come on folks, it obvious). I you really are a fan of Paul, I recomend reading ' A Little Orginal Sin' the biography of Jane Bowles, just for a further understanding of him. A person always plays them self up, it is in through around him that was see who he truly was. He was a good man, but his story is not everything."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Admittedly, I only got through 2/3 of this book but having read many of the reviews on this site, I knew what to expect and decided to stop reading. First, this is a classic work in the vain of other Beat generation writers such as Kerouac. However, this book did not work for me, possibly because of my South Asian heritage. While Bowles makes a worthy effort at portraying middle east culture as alienating and disorienting to the average American, I just couldn't buy the \\"mysteriousness\\" of Moroccan culture. The world is a much smaller, more cosmopolitan place than it was in 1947, so it was hard for me to relate to crucial elements of Sheltering Sky's main character, the desert."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"slow start but the prose weaves a spell, powerfully creates the mystery of travelling in a truly foreign culture, important themes of life and death too, worth reading through and then immediately rereading"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"There's no other way to read Paul Bowles. Just tell the inner critic to shut up for a while, let yourself fall into his dark shadowy prose, and he will take you over..."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; pries into the mysteries of the Sahara using three American &quot;travelers&quot; (as opposed to &quot;tourists&quot;, they claim) as the focus of the story -- a married couple, Port and Kit Moresby, and their friend Tunner. Port and Kit's marriage is shaky, made more so by the sly presence of Tunner, who has his eye on Kit. (This love triangle is vaguely redolent of the trio of safari hunters in Hemingway's &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.&quot;) These three widely-traveled Americans are so bored with the refinement of their lives back home and the predictability of more popular tourist attractions that they feel an itinerary through the exotic, if often filthy and diseased, land of the Sahara will provide an exhilarating change of pace. What they find is that they cannot escape their own personal demons.The novel begins in Oran, Algeria, from which the trio plan to travel more or less aimlessly from city to city throughout northern Africa, by bus or train, seeing the sights and staying in the hotels. At a hotel bar, Port meets an odd and sneaky young English man named Eric Lyle who is traveling with his querulous, overbearing mother. As the Moresbys and Tunner arrive in different towns, the Lyles have a tendency to turn up again like a bad penny without much purpose to the plot or effect on the main characters. The Lyles offer a lot of interesting plot potential which Bowles unfortunately does not bother to explore.I was puzzled by the last third of the novel, which seems strangely detached from the preceding events. Port eventually comes down with a fever and dies, and Kit inexplicably runs off into the desert. She gets picked up by two native merchants traveling by camel, and continuing southward through the desert, they ravish her on a regular basis, which she does not entirely resist. One of the merchants takes her to his home and holds her captive in his harem. This descent into a symbolic hell seems to signal the end of her carefree life of innocence and luxury, a life to which she can no longer return.The book is beautifully written; Bowles depicts the Sahara's geography, people, and cultures with the kind of rich detail such a story deserves. I just wish Kit's motives at the end of the novel were a little more comprehensible."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky was an interesting novel with well-written descriptions that transport the reader to the vast desert of North Africa. Bowles also offers great psychological insight into the characters' personalities; however, I found the last section abrupt and somewhat confusing. After reading the description on the back of the book, I expected to see a gradual change in the characters, which was present, but most of the changes in Kit (one of the three main characters) seem to occur suddenly when there are about 60 pages left to read. I'm not sure that I got everything out of reading this novel that I was supposed to, but I will say that the three main characters were very interesting, and the mother and son who kept turning up everywhere were amusing. I would recommend this novel, but not if you are looking for a quick and/or easy read."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is without question one of the best books I have ever read. The story is interesting on it's face but the psychological development of the characters carries one away in thought and emotion. There is an ebb and flow between the characters, each taking the focus of the narrative at one point or another. Bowles fleshes out the interior life and indeed the growth or transformation of the characters as the story proceeds."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. Literary. Strange. Characters in the 1940s (I think this is the time period) travelling/living in North Africa. A young American couple (twenty-somethings). It's not really clear why they are there. Partly to get away from America, I think. The adventure of being in a foreign land? For a strange experience? Wanting to be expatriates? Was it fashionable to do this back in that era? They seem to be the equivalent of European backpackers who travel the world. Maybe they have more money than the typical European backpacker, or at least come from upper middle class backgrounds. They are mainly roughing it, staying in basic hotels, riding buses, having uncomfortable journeys. But the country is primitive, and they are going deep into the country, into outlying areas. They meet up with another pair of Americans, a young man and his mother. Funny, odd people who have been in the country for some time, world travelers who are phony in some way and who the couple distrust and are trying to rid themselves of, but then they meet up with them in another town. (I think they were trying to steal their money and passports, or maybe they did steal them). Really odd story. The desert and the country itself is an important main character. It is utterly strange and foreign,and poor, and this young couple are caught in the middle of it (and what are they supposed to be doing, what is their purpose?). They separate from each other in a remote part of the country (cannot remember if it was on purpose or by accident), and the story takes a change for the even stranger. It turns out, for one of the characters at least, that they ventured too deeply into the country. Intense and utterly odd story written by a literary artist."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"In terms of plot, The Sheltering Sky is principally about a collapsing marriage and the intrusion of \\"another man.\\" But at its heart the book is about the loneliness of the desert, which is also the loneliness of individual human hearts, and about our attempts to break through the sky into what lies beyond, and our failures to do so caused by fear.The plotting is simple and direct, but it's Bowles' insights into our fears and self-erected emotional barriers that drive the novel. The desert provides more than just imagery; it creates an atmosphere in which drama and tension thrive. The prose is beautiful throughout.Yet the novel completely falls apart in the final section, in which Kit undergoes an emotional exile and (false?) return. The competency Bowles displays earlier in the novel in depicting human emotions and motivations completely disappears; the plot becomes an extended male fantasy of sexual imprisonment that cheapens the quality of the novel as a whole. Such truths as Bowles reveals in this section of the book could have been given much more powerfully and simply without this absurd detour into Arab sexual adventurism."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Good book that focused on the main characters' thought, motivations, and situations in a travel setting. Port, Kit, and Tunner, had an open schedule and slowly traversed in and near Sub-Saharan Africa. Thoughts of life, dismay, the past and future, are all here. The desert and sun were constant and relevant characters in this book. One would likely appreciate these latter &quot;characters&quot; more if they had been the the region prior to reading &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;--so go there first. The prose and some of the wording is of the 1940s, when the book was published (1949). Tennessee Williams' review that appears in the beginning of the book is good but read it after reading the book--he gave too much away. The last part of the story takes on an intelligently gloomy quality and setting. Glimpses of Kit's and the others' neurosis and insecurity become evident as they are one of the few eccentrics lucky enough to live and go where they want to go, when they want to in general. She and her companions can stay in a particular town for a day, week, month, or the entire Winter if they choose. that is freedom. Freedom of the mind and physical environment. They develop relationships with the locals they come across, as well as some who are on the road, or Sand Dune as one might say. The only nit-pick is Bowles' frequent, although brief passages, of French and Arabic expressions that were not transliterated. It you like travel stories read this book."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Three Americans (a married couple and an acquaintance) wander around Northern Africa after the Second World War. They appear to have little emotional bond with each other and no connection to the exotic land and culture through which they move. Initially, I kept reading this book hoping for redemption - imagining that the alien environment in which the characters found themselves might somehow force them closer to each other.There is no redemption. There is no hope. As my sense of foreboding grew stronger, I was increasingly tempted to put the book down. It is testament, at least, to Paul Bowles writing that his story was engaging enough to keep me reading through to the desolate final pages. We all know that the sky cannot shelter - it exposes people. Bowles attempts to do this, delving at length into the inner thoughts of his main characters. Unfortunately, all of this wordy introspection makes the characters seem self obsessed. The reader desperately wishes that they would just, for a moment, turn their gazes away from their belly buttons and see the people around them. They lack any grip on reality. They appear to have nothing to fall back on - no relationships, no beliefs, no community, no truth. To them, Northern Africa is not a land of real people, food, culture and languages - it is merely the backdrop to their personal existential crises.The journey that Kit takes in the second half of the book does not ring true. It is perhaps too easy to attribute this to the fact that the author is a male, but I suspect it might be the case. Kit did not appear to want to be in Northern Africa. If anything could shake her out of her introspection and send her back to her homeland, surely it would be her husband's exit. Instead, she embarks on a journey alone into the desert that has consequences which for most females would be deeply traumatic, but which she seems to invite and at times even enjoy. It is deeply unsettling to read and ultimately I could not accept the way her character was crafted by Bowles. Perhaps this is what he wanted - seemingly happy to destroy the relationships between his characters and the characters themselves, perhaaps he is content also to break any bond with his readers."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This review contains spoilers.I found this novel underwhelming. The sense of place was wonderful (if a bit romanticized), and in places it read like a sort of travelogue. This was one most interesting parts of it for me. The people seem distant, aloof, and completely cut off from one another. Two of the main characters, Kit and Port, husband and wife, have presumably escaped post-World War II America to explore northern Africa. Tunner, a third wheel, awkwardly tags along, allowing for an additional romantic interest for Kit. The title is highly ironic: Africa has almost nothing to offer these three other than desolation, solitude, and loneliness. The weather is oppressive. It is hardly a wonder why so many people were reminded of Camus' Algeria in their reviews.Much of the novel consists of Kit, Port, and Tunner scurrying from one African city to another, in search of what even they probably do not know. Even though Kit loathes Tunner, they end up taking a train ride together to one of the cities during which they romantically bond (rather unrealistically, considering her contempt for him). In fact, romantic (or at least physical) connections, with the possible exception of the one between Port and Kit, were idealized. For example, early on, Port is led to the tent of a prostitute, Marnhia, whose decoy insists that she is not a prostitute. What seems to be a misunderstanding is really a cultural difference. Much like Nature herself, Marnhia is bleak, alluring, and ultimately incomprehensible.Halfway through the book, Port begins to show some portentous symptoms, including fever and hot and cold spells. Even though he shows no signs of getting any better, Kit has no qualms about leaving him in their hotel room. It will surprise few readers that in this land of exclusion, disconnectedness even from those next to you, and disorientation, Port dies. Just as unbelievable as the trysts between Tunner and Kit and then between Port and Marnhia, as soon as Port dies she leaves the hotel without pausing or grieving. The story of their marriage up to this point had me fairly convinced that they did care for one another, but reading this made me wonder whether Port's love was fully reciprocated.Port Moresby, the name of one of the protagonists, is also the name of Papua New Guinea's capital. I'm not sure whether this could be pure coincidence, but I would be eager to know what anyone else thought of it. Did anyone notice this? It popped right out at me, but I just saw it mentioned in one or two other reviews.Gore Vidal said that Bowles' short stories are \\"emblematic of the helplessness of an over-civilized sensibility when confronted with an alien culture.\\" Port also makes it clear that he's a traveller instead of a tourist. Those points are central to the book. The first of these will genuinely frustrate those who think that some sort of genuine connection can be made between people of different cultures, and maybe even those of the same culture. As someone who still holds hope, perhaps naively so, for this kind of communication, I found the characters proportionately unconvincing. Personally, I find myself much more oriented toward E. M. Forster's exhortation to \\"Only connect!\\" It is what informs all of my reading, my curiosity about the world, and my relationships with others. I realize that my choice is purely an aesthetic one, but Bowles' central message diverged so much from it that I found difficulty making the connection. However, as Forster might be the first to point out, even though I had trouble with its message and characters, this book offered still another opportunity to connect - one which, unfortunately, I'm a worse person for not being able to make."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I have to admit that I was somewhat intimidated by the glorious blurbs about \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" on its cover and its reviews.Anything this well-reviewed had to be dense and trying to read. But \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is far from that. It moves like its restless characters, driving deeper into the Sahara and desperately shaking off any heavy identity. Bowles writes about this couple's journey to oblivion with economy and authority. Every detail and observation about Africa rings true and you can tell that Bowles spent most of his life there (according to the notes in the version I read, he wrote this novel fairly early into his Moroccan residency).If you've seen the movie and it intrigued you, then definitely check out the book."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"THE SHELTERING SKY by Paul Bowles is one of Time magazine's 100 best novels in English since 1923. The novel focuses on a married couple, Port and Kit Moresby, who are rich enough not to work and have decided that rather than travel in Europe after WWII, they would see northern Africa. Along with their friend, Tunner, they tour Algeria for a time until the issues they brought with them separate them and the brutality of the Sahara does worse.Kit and Port clearly have an unhappy marriage. One of the first incidents of the novel involves Port finding a prostitute with the help of a local, using her and escaping without paying. Kit also sleeps with Tunner on a train when Port has gone ahead of the two of them to the next town with two other Americans with a car. Kit decides that she and Port should find a way to separate themselves from Tunner so that she won't feel \\"in the middle,\\" and they do, \\"ditching\\" him and going farther afield.The barren harshness of the Sahara is a good outward landscape for what is between Kit and Port as well as what is between them and others, and I won't go further into the plot, as I don't want to spoil the novel for others. This was Bowles first novel (he is a composer, as well) and the reader can tell that he lived in the Africa he writes about. The supporting characters -- the locals and French officials -- seem pitch perfect to this (ignorant) reader, and they populate the pages with a great deal of flavor and create real atmosphere. This is a short book (335 pages), but completely engaging and alluring. Bowles has a light hand with his story telling, and doesn't write explicitly about what has happened between Kit and Port, just including some of their thoughts about themselves, each other and their future as they progress through the story.\\"It's funny,\\" went on Miss Ferry. \\"The desert's a big place, but nothing ever really gets lost there\\" (p. 332). Kit and Port lose a great deal in their flirtation with the Sahara, a flirtation we get the impression is supposed to have deepened their relationship with each other. Bowles creates a startlingly keen emotional landscape with his tone, manner and the characters' interactions with a pitiless physical world as described by a deft author."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Quite a blend of madness, infidelity and travel guide! I read this book in the middle of a &quot;heat wave&quot; in the Midwest. Maybe reading in the dead of winter would have changed my perception of being in a dreamlike state when I finished this book (two days) but I am inclined to think this might not be the case. The book almost causes you to lose track of time like Kit does in the last half of the book. Each of the three sections seems almost to exist on its' own; yet the connections always remain. Each time you read this book (you WILL want to read it over and over) you will find that it almost seems as if you become the person experiencing Africa and the desert."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Several years ago, I picked this book up on a whim and within a day or two, Minnesota experienced a late spring heat wave (80s and 90s). I got sick with a fever, and it was under these perfect conditions I was transported by Paul Bowles to Northern Africa. I loved the book. The irrational decisions the characters chose made perfect sense to a reader with a high fever, and the desert landscape reflected my own parched state of mind. Someday I'll have to read it when I am in good health to see if it was really as good as my fevered mind thought."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Yes, a major motion picture, Mr. Albany. In fact, the movie was made a few years ago, and also stars John Malkovich. IMHO, it wasn't a very good film, but I read the book first, and it was a very good book.My humble opinion: skip the movie, READ THE BOOK. It's good and touching and scary and sad and thrilling."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"There's a haunting scene where the surviving characters gaze up at teh full moon over the desert, and think of how rarely they truly notice the moon . . . and begin to wonder how many full moons they have left in their lives. All of Bowles' works make you confront your mortality in ways that are, ultimately, liberating."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I spent two days consumed by this book. It is magical, spiritual, depressing, and enlightening. It is relatively simple story of three Americans, and the physical and psychological trauma that befalls them. The ending rather shocked me, and ended on a painful note, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are willing, able, and have the time, let this book take you on its journey."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"To my mind, the main character of this outstanding novel is the North African postwar desert. Three American &quot;travellers&quot; (not &quot;tourists&quot;) roam the desert whose starkness makes the psychological travail all the more dramatic. You can taste the sand. Great book."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A parable for the traveler. The greatest kif-induced writer in English delivers a beautiful nightmare of fools and nancies running around in North Africa. Their downfall is that of every traveler: the inability to see the \\"new\\" as anything but a comparison to the \\"old,\\" no matter how nonjudgmental, all-embracing, unperturbable, and tolerant one perceives oneself. These comparisons inevitably lead to the belief that one brings ones familiar surroundings along on a journey and can re-create them to some extent in an unfamiliar setting. Displayed by the stacks of parcels and trunks and by the jalopy rumbling around the Sahara, Bowles is warning us all. The ex-pat world of SUVs and global cells demonstrates that his words have yet to be heard. This idiocy calls into question the very purpose of traveling.It is truly staggering, therefore, that this is one of the most popular travel books around. To see backpacking sorority babes and fratboys lugging around designer packs and bitching about the price of a hostel (due to a pilsner-soaked incomprehension of exchange rates) or berating a tiny restaurant's owner for his town's lack of a McDonald's, and then to see a Bowles paperback jammed in next to their Lonely Planet bar guide... Father, forgive them, for they are clueless.Back to the novel. Direct, violent in its unwavering focus, and somewhat darkly funny, this quick read is a keeper."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Still a deeply disturbing book after all these years. Maybe even more so now with the clash of clutures going on due to increased globalization. Man's alienation from his fellow (and himself) seems to be heightened now and this timeless book emphasizes that. Bowles is so good at laying raw the dispair of his characters. One is left feeling hollow. Amazing."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"What a great read. It's not an uplifting saga, but the writing is engaging and the description of the Sahara region immediately after WWII was fascinating. Bowles is a great American author who should be included in any readers library of American fiction."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is a terrific book by a writer who is not nearly as celebrated as he should be--and I mean Nobel Prize worthy. It's not true that a book grips you--when it's as good as \\"The Sheltering Sky,\\" it's you that grips the book. That's what I literally found myself doing for big batches of pages at a time; the tension that Bowles creates is that intense. You take the story personally; like you're reading a letter about people you know.If you haven't read this book, read it. If you've seen a movie based upon it, forget you ever saw it and read the book.Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to ramble on a bit. You can stop reading here if you haven't got the time; I'm not really going to say anything more important than I've already said.For instance. In the brief (2-page) preface of the edition of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" that I read, Paul Bowles gives away what is the novel's most shocking turn--why, I can't imagine. Did he think everyone had seen the movie already (one with Debra Winger, apparently; thank God I missed it)? Did he think the novel was already so well-known that it was like revealing that the Greeks came out on top in \\"the Iliad\\" or that Ivan Illych dies in \\"the Death of Ivan Ilych\\"? Or was it just that he was 87 or so at the time and, like many 87 year-old people, figured he earned the right to do whatever the heck he felt like regardless of propriety?Well, whatever made him do it, I wish he hadn't--it was like watching a blonde in a shower scene in a Friday the 13th movie (any of them)--you know what's coming, the question is when--and how.That said, \\"the Sheltering Sky\\" is a fierce and uncompromising book that peels back a bit of what \\"shelters\\" us from the cold indifference of the cosmos. A husband and wife--Port and Kit--are on an extended and aimless tour of North Africa, traveling from one desert town to another in the company of their mutual friend, Tunner. Their marriage is on the rocks and the presence of Tunner, a man clearly not averse to pinch-hitting, isn't helping matters. Meanwhile, the relentless and pitiless desert is, if not a stage set in hell, then a room in Purgatory very close by.The food's bad, the heat oppressive, the insects voracious, diseases innumerable and nasty, the natives inscrutable, hostile, devious, or all three--why would anyone voluntarily come here?Why indeed?Kit and Port. It takes some time, I found, to get beyond these silly names. A little too precious, in an F. Scott Fitzgeraldy way. What's Port short for, anyway? Porter? Porthole?Well, you get the sense that Port--a rather misanthropic character, is attempting to shed his life of illusions--civilization, humanity, religion, science--all the shelters we hide under--and traveling towards some naked unadorned truth he hopes to find in the most stripped-down place there is on earth: the Sahara.In this alien, inhospitable, virtually anti-human place, he'll get a glimpse of what he's looking for and it'll be every bit as terrifying as that butcher knife that emerges from the plastic shower curtain. Because even if you're expecting it, just like death, when it comes it's shocking all the same.Paul Bowles is a great writer--easily one of the best American writers of the 20th century--perhaps because he removed himself from America altogether in mind and body. He writes with the concern for the deep philosophical concerns that usually seem to be the province of Europeans, especially the French. In his confrontations with the desert, Bowles, through his characters, confronts more than merely the social concerns--the \\"shelters,\\" if you will--of any particular class, race, or nation--but portrays the individual in extremis beyond all these...at the very edge of the abyss."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky is pretty dull. The action and events of the story are mostly angst-based, anxiety and uncertainty providing much of the motive force that get its characters through their adventures. After a wonderful start, complete with some passages of rather detailed psychological insight, we are taken along with these hardly exotic American strangers through lands that seem every bit as alien to us as they do to them. And the tension of being a stranger in strange lands crosses the boundries of fiction and somehow invades us in our homes.It is a slow to appreciate book (at least it was for me), with a desire for something to happen and a continuing frustration when nothing does. Near the end of the novel I began the see the power in this particular approach: to put the reader literally there with them, seeing that the character's romanticized delusions and high-minded ideas about themselves are a large part of the reason they are all so unsuccessful in their endeavours. And, what's worse, that the boredom we might experience when winding through the occasional meandering, exhaustive passages describing for pages on end the windswept sub-structures of the calcified desert sand is also what these characters are feeling, kind of a helplessness under the power of something they cannot comprehend, much less control.Here is a book about being pushed to the limits. It tells of the numerous personal failures a traveller might accomplish, of the ways in which they respond to crisis and of how ultimately futile all of this is if you're more interested in what a foreign land says about you than what it actually says about itself.Beautifully written and only slashed down to four stars (on the four-and-a-half I give it) because anything under five has to get rounded down. This was a book that I actually contemplated over when reaching this superficial decision, one that each of the main characters would no doubt have taken even longer to come to."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Beautifully-written novel about the cruelty of that which we do not know or understand. There were unbelievable descriptions of the filth and abject poverty in the some of the North African cities. At these times, it was difficult to see the beauty that the main traveler, Port, was searching for, and also laid to waste a lot of the glamor attached to the \\"world traveler\\" in third-world countries. The entire story was filled with poetic imagery of the desert, death, the sky, the sun and heat. Also many characters along the journey; the descriptions of the Lyles were incredible: A wonderful picture of such a disgusting and despicable pair. There were many other characters like the menacing Captain Broussard, the frightening yet intriguing Belqassim.For the first part of the book, we met Kit and Port, who supposedly went to North Africa to rekindle their marriage, although I didn't get that impression simply because a) Port invited his friend Tunner and b) Kit didn't seem to share Port's interest in North Africa and c) neither Port nor Kit seemed interested in each other once they got there. At some point, all three of them had cheated on each other, betraying each other's trust, friendship, and love, though the issue was never confronted by any of them. In fact, these characters' personalities and relationships to each other were the most bewildering issues of the book.There was a constant criss-crossing between a desperately strong sense of duty (without knowing why) to utter complacency and indifference between Kit and Port. They, along with Tunner, seemed rich, spoiled and ignorant. I couldn't understand their reactions to certain situations; such as Tunner's thoughts as to how his friends at home would interpret Port and Kit's disappearance, or Kit's reaction to Port's death, or Port's overreactions to Kit! Then again, the three of them were in an extreme environment. They wandered aimlessly in another world, void of Western reason, void of Western fairness, powerful, unyielding, and wholly unsympathetic.I loved Bowles' constant symbolism throughout the book; such as Marhnia's retelling of the story of the women who wished for tea in the sahara, for which they got more than they bargained. Then there was the train dream that was so important for Port to interpret: \\"one's hesitation was an involuntary decision to refuse participation\\" in life. I think that this sentence pretty much described Port, Kit and Tunner. Again, they drifted much of the time, making decisions very much on a whim, living moment to moment, refusing to face the feelings deep in their conscience: Guilt, regrets, fear, etc. Finally, Port's stolen passport was a wonderful symbolism of his inevitable erasure from existence.The last section of the novel was fantastic. Kit was forced to stop living according to omens in the sky, forced to stop living in fear. Up until this point, most of her living was vicarious through Port. Her journey with the men in the caravan was frightening and savage, yet it completely opened a long-hidden facet in her character. The irony was that it took her to the point of no return. Once she was \\"saved,\\" it was sadly clear that no Westerner could possibly understand what she experienced, so it seemed fitting that Kit would just disappear into her own madness, or was it even madness?Yes, I loved this novel--a gorgeous illustration of the cruel beauty of the desert and its culture. Such a seemingly benign environment was powerful enough to bring any arrogant Westerner physically and psychically, to his knees."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles' 1949 novel, \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is a phenomenal, terrifying, and exhilarating journey into the depths (or surfaces?) of human existence. That's a lot of work for a novel to do, but this one pulls it off. This is a novel that deals with three Americans on the run from themselves, from each other, and from preconceived notions of identity. Set in the aftermath of World War II, the novel exposes and disrupts firm ideas of national identities and international relationships - between the Americans, French colonials, Arabic African natives, and a wealth of other ethnic/national categories - and shows how they react to and resist each other.\\"The Sheltering Sky\\" begins with Porter and Katherine Moresby, a married couple who have never stayed in any place too long, in a North African city, with the intention to casually move from one place to the next, idealistically hoping to stay away from \\"the places which had been touched by the war.\\" Accompanied by their wholly annoying friend Tunner, they embark upon an unplanned meander southwards into the vast, forbidding Sahara. The remainder of the novel shows these characters' adventures in Africa, and the resulting changes to their highly individual, naively constructed ideas about being-in-the-world.Among other points of interest in \\"The Sheltering Sky,\\" one thing that particularly grabbed my attention was the omnipresence of the main characters' sense of cultural superiority. Despite Port's early insistence that he is a 'traveler' and not a 'tourist,' he and his companions soon discover that knowledge of maps, hastily gathered information about the next town on the route, and knowledge of the French language are insufficient to acclimate them to their surroundings and insure their comfort. The novel does an excellent job of disrupting cultural stereotypes, particularly of the region's Arabic inhabitants, as the travelers make their way south into the Sahara, further and further away from 'civilization' as they understand it. It also forces us as readers to take into account the perceptions of what we consider foreign from the point of view of 'foreigners' in their own element.The journey southward exposes the characters increasingly to peril - threats of thievery, disease, and existential despair - and the environment plays a large role in this. The sky itself, often characterized similarly to Ahab's 'pasteboard mask' in Melville's \\"Moby Dick,\\" as sheltering the characters from knowledge of the infinite, looms as a challenge to each of the characters. Continual encounters with sand, heat, hills, and the difficulties of transportation complicate the experiences of Port, Kit, and Tunner. The most independently mobile and problematic characters in the novel, the British/Australian Eric Lyle and his eternally irascible mother, provide an interesting counterpoint to the strictly-considered 'native' or inherently existing impediments to travel and stability.\\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is a very oppressive and depressing novel - but don't let that stop you from picking it up - sometimes oppression and depression are necessary to force us to reconsider our relationship to the world. The novel is as vital and 'timeless' now as it was in 1949, and perhaps even more important now. The philosophical, social, cultural, and geopolitical currents of Bowles' novel make \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" worth a careful read."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"It's very difficult to add something more to what has already been said in the previous reviews. The deep impression this novel gave me lies in the fact that all the characters of the novel are like puppets moved by odd forces they don't even know. Nature is showed as cruel, indifferent to human feelings and to human life at all. Nature has nothing to do with human misery, so the author expresses a desperate view of life as human beings can't get shelter anywhere. The sky is the only refuge, and that means there is no refuge at all. All the characters, and above all the marriage couple, act under the influence of strange needs, almost superstitious. From the beginning they seek something near to salvation far away from the Western civilization, so they venture deeper and deeper into the Sahara desert, and there they find death and insanity.The desert, the shuddering empty spaces, the anguish of an inhuman and amoral Nature fascinates the three Americans and envelopes them in a treacherous embrace. The desert is the place where there can be no humanity at all, no time, just a blind hideous empty space which also empties their minds and turns them into beings without soul. When they realize that they are finally lost, they don't care at all; they chose Nature in its purest form possible, but that implies that Nature has no soul. They finally lose their souls and become living ghosts.Love, death and insanity; there is no redemption, there is no salvation, Nature has no soul, Nature is nothingness, life is meaningless. There can be no shelter but the sky. Seeking answers, they get lost in themselves and experience the total dissolution of their beings."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The book begins in a rundown hotel on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. Port Moresby, an American and a self defined &quot;traveler&quot; as opposed to tourist, experiences a prophetic and metaphorical dream. Port has traveled to North Africa with his wife Kit and friend Tunner to experience new adventures and try to reestablish the emotional bond between himself and Kit. Finding themselves in a harsh and hostile environment, the trio must battle not only their situation but also conflicts within themselves. As the story draws to a close, one does not survive and one emerges forever changed by the brutal desert. The third, who did not venture into the Sahara, remains unchanged.The author has done an excellent job creating a Saharan setting throughout the book. Descriptions are rich and vivid. The story is both dramatic and suspenseful. My complaint of the story, however, is that I thought far too little was done with the Lyles, a supposed mother-son duo engulfed in suspicion. Had these characters been allowed to develop and their motives made more clear, I believe that it could have become a very interesting sub-plot.This book is an enjoyable and entertaining read about people in search of themselves and seeking to reconnect. Their journeys and struggles will remain etched in my memory for many years to come."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"One of the most neglected masters of words this century has seen, Paul Bowles takes the reader on a journey to North Africa during the post war years.

It is not only a journey into another world but also a story about life in general, about love, existing and self-realization.

And there is certainly more where this novel came from"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Read this to understand Sting's \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" reference for the first time, and to your very core. (We're all looking for the tallest sand dune--the place with the optimal vantage point--and we often lose our way in deserts of our own making.) What an amazing book. I'm so glad I believed Gore Vidal's cover blurb about Bowles' art far exceeding that of other contemporary American writers. Really, Vidal says it best: \\"Bowles has glimpsed what lies back of our sheltering sky...an endless flux of stars so like those atoms which make us up that we experience not only horror but likeness.\\"Beg, borrow, or buy at least a cheap paperback version: if you don't read The Sheltering Sky, you're missing out on greatness."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"There are few novels in English as bitterly ironic about the human condition as \\"The Sheltering Sky.\\" The title itself is a sick joke, for the relentless Sahara sun--at least as depicted by Paul Bowles--scorches and shrivels everything it touches. In prose of breathtaking, pellucid elegance, Bowles takes us on the tragicomic final journey of wealthy New Yorkers Port and Kit Moresby across French North Africa in the late 1940s. (Their names alone are deeply ironic; \\"Port Moresby\\" waves all sorts of danger signals for those who know their geography, while \\"Kit\\" implies a kitten, willful yet tragically dependent on the kindness of friends, strangers and enemies alike.) On one level, the novel can be read as a tale of two more stupid Americans imagining themselves as enlightened travelers and coming to grief because of their illusions. On another, it can be taken as a tract on the impossibility of dealing with the world as it truly is, and on the various defense mechanisms people create to ward off either death or insanity. (Bowles uses those mechanisms to create some unforgettable characters, especially the horrible Lyles--putatively mother and son--who resemble a grotesque, unholy experiment between P.G. Wodehouse and the Marquis de Sade.) Meanwhile, the Sahara, vast and arid, remains what it is, forever, as Bowles makes plain toward the end of the book: \\"The coming of day promises a change; it is only when the day has fully arrived that the watcher suspects it is the same day returned once again--the same day he has been living for a long time, over and over, still blindingly bright and untarnished by time.\\""},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A simple psychological story told in a large setting--the Sahara. The book jacket says it is about psychological terror, but it's really a comprehensive and morbidly interesting look at existentialism. I can't imagine it getting published today or any literary agent fronting it, and mean that more as a criticism of our page-turning culture. I recommend it to readers of literature."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The scope of Paul Bowles' *The Sheltering Sky* is two-fold: on the outside it is the tale of three young Americans traveling around North Africa after the World War. In a deeper level it is really a terrifying, exhilarating journey into the depth of human existence. Kit and Port Moresby's marriage was jeopardized. They came to the desert to escape from civilization, to escape from one another. The couple had never settled down in any one place, but rather they casually intended to move from one place to another in Africa in order to avoid places that had been touched by wars. The couple was also joined by a mutual friend Tunner and with whom emarked on a journey into the forbidden Sahara. What this book strikes me the most is the way Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture (as well as alien land). The very same apprehension at the end in a sense destroyed these Americans. As they emarked on their journey, further and further away from civilization, we can see how the cultural superiority of these fellow Americans dominate their thoughts-how they not trust the locals, the Arabs, the porters of town, the butler at inns. The journey forced these Americans to push the limits of human life. Each one of them was touched by the unspeakableemptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert. I don't want to give away the ending of the tale but this is definitely not a page-turner as you, the reader, will have to emark yourself on this journey and think about the limits of human reason and intelligence, about the powerlessness in controlling our fate. Beautiful prose, challenging reading. 4.2 stars."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I picked up this book by accident and found it surprisingly dark, deep, and intriguing. Recommended."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"An unsatisfying book, recounting an implausible story of sheer fantasy with no/little pretensions of reality. I chose the book expecting to glean cultural insight of places (Algeria in this case) that I'll never visit, based on book-cover and online write-ups with remarks such as \\"devastatingly imaginative observer of the West's encounter with the East\\" and \\"Paul Bowles examines the ways in which Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures leads to the ultimate destruction of those cultures.\\" The book attained none of this, it dwelled for pages on sheer fantasy, highly implausible events, characters of dubious sanity, and offered no cultural insights beyond recounting the heat and grit of African life, with both of which I'm already familiar."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I give out copies of this book on halloween. The Sheltering Sky is beautiful."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The book is well written in that I felt I was traveling in the hot, humid desert to the mysterious North African cities with the 3 American characters, and was able to get into the interior of their minds and how they comprehended being in an alien culture. The beginning was slow but once you get going into the book the more interesting the journey becomes. The three American's are not very sympathetic people in the book, except maybe Port who seems to want to try to understand the native people and have relationships with them such as Marhnia, but her story of having Tea in the Sahara is as imcomprehensible as her and frusturating because I wanted to connect to Marhnia and understand her story like Port but could not. I also like the way the author writes about the minds of other people like the Lieutenant d'Armagnac;&quot;His overt attitude toward the people of Bou Noura was that they were an acessible part of a great tribe from whom the French could learn a great deal if they would only take the trouble.&quot; What's interesting about Lieutenant d-Armagnac is that he wanted to communicate and understand the local's but also failed to do so despite his best intentions. Overall The Sheltering Sky is an excellent story about how Three American travelers are tragically link to a culture that they, like most travelers do not know very much about in that they failed to take in the realities such as the heat, food, disease, and the native people intil it was too late. Maybe being just a tourist is not such a bad idea after all."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Really outstanding. I was speechless by the end."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Saharan travelogue and the descriptive language were entertaining. Katherine sees a mirage, and Porter hallucinates even when he's not in a fever. Unfortunately, the plot was desultory, the theme did not capture my interest, and the characters were implausibly silly.I liked the uncultured, \\"not comfortable with ideas,\\" Tunner much more than the two oh-so intellectual protagonists. This is one of my pet peeves. I don't like to see a character written as a straw man, to be mocked by the author. Characters have rights, too.Speaking of rights, the latter half of the story is devoted to Katherine, who is basically a blowup doll in a khaki skirt. Try to count the scenes in which she is seduced, raped, bullied, beaten, or enslaved - yes, enslaved. It's offensive, and monotonous.People say this is the style. The modern novel is meant to be chic and clever - not engaging or sympathetic. Compared with, say, Steinbeck ,this just means the author didn't put in much effort. Maugham gives a fine critique of modernism in his preface to Ashenden. Maugham and Steinbeck are roughly contemporary with Bowles. Read them instead."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"When I read a book, I generally try not to read any summaries of its contents so the experience can be new. Thus I picked up 'The Sheltering Sky' without any idea what it was about. I struggled through about half of its horrible content before deciding to flip it over and read the blurb to see if anything would ever develop. And according to the jacket blurb, this is a book about \\"Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures\\" and how that \\"leads to the ultimate destruction of those cultures\\". And right there you have, in one pretentious, smug sentence, a summation of the stupidity of this novel.First, that is decidedly not what the book is about. The American characters are not the only non-natives in the novel, and they certainly aren't the most uncomprehending. The only non-native characters in the book are the main characters (three Americans), a pair of horrible traveling English people, and the colonial locals. And of this set, the American characters - while incredibly self-absorbed and tiresome - definitely come out the best. They are even the most admired in the story. We are repeatedly told how local characters enjoy their company or find them fascinating or are attracted to them.Second, the actions of the main characters have aboslutely no cultural impact, because they're just shallow nobodies. They stumble about and whine about the horrible conditions and engage in pedantic bits of juvenile philosophical dialog and monolog, but they affect nobody around them.Third, the journey they take and Bowles' interminable description of their journeys and inner thoughts are completely unremarkable, except in the stunning tone-deafness of the prose and bizarrely inhuman ways in which the characters act and react. The end of the novel in particular is quite laughable; to accept it as plausible one has to have the most ridiculous, early-20th-century chauvinistic 'literary' preconception of a female.So what is the story really about? In a nutshell: three Americans decide to slum around Saharan Africa. Two of them, Port and Kit, pretend to be married (many claim they are actually married but this is not specifically stated, and it is repeatedly hinted that they are simply saying they are married to avoid any questions about cohabitation). The other, Tunner, is their caddish friend who secretly wants to conquer Kit. Incidentally, the ridiculous names should perhaps be a hint as to what's in store. They travel together for a while and have empty conversations. Then Tunner seduces Kit while she's drunk. Kit doesn't tell Port, but they work together to divert Tunner so Port and Kit can be alone. Then Port's passport is stolen (by one of the English couple) and Port gets typhoid. It takes him forever to die. Tunner comes to meet them right as Port dies, and Kit goes insane and walks off into the desert. Tunner waits for her to return. The last third of the novel describes Kit being abducted by desert nomads and repeatedly sexually assaulted until she can escape.And that's it. It's nothing like the back summary (which sounds like the kind of thing book club members say to each other while nodding approvingly). In fact, if anything it's exactly the opposite: Bowles' entire point seemed to be that the desert, and its people, are permanent and enduring; those who come to conquer or even partake of its beauty go unnoticed and may not make it out alive. It's hubristic to think our mere existence is 'destroying cultures'. Unfortunately even this point is presented in such an incompetent fashion that it's just not worth the trouble.There is precisely one good quote from the book, and Brandon Lee knew it by heart. Just search for that, save yourself the trouble of reading it."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A novel in the tradition of dissolute sojourns by privileged but dissatisfied figures, Bowles attempts to beautify desolate landscapes and repressive Saharan locales, but for this reader he fails. None of the characters are sympathetic, they are merely foils of the ugliest sort: ugly Americans, thieving and conniving Brits, scoffing French officers, amorphous Arab and African stereotypes. Read and enjoy this if you are or like alcoholic and licentious blue-bloods and enjoy suffering in yourself and others, because suffer you will as you read the painful travails of Kit, Port, Tunner, and the others. I can sympathize more with protagonists from Henry Miller, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, and even Fitzgerald, much more so than Bowles' agonists. The best book about being trapped in a sandy hell hole is Abe's \\"The Woman in the Dunes.\\""},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The title of this book gives one a sense of security. I fought my way through this book. Along the way several times I thought that it was a waste. The grit it left behind after reading it subdued any appreciation.

I thought of their lack of communication versus mine. The frustration of the characters was the frustration we all feel"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"A superb read and a fascinating study of the industrialized world as seen from the other side. When I say &quot;the other side&quot; I'm speaking of the desert. For in the end, it is that haunting landscape which shapes the lives of everyone in the novel. The Arabs and the native peoples have long been shaped by it, but the travelers who have come from America (the most hyper-industrialized nation on earth)do not have the advantage of customs and bodies which have been conditioned over thousands of years to cope with such a harsh environment. Bowles is at his strongest when he delves into the description of settings. Few writers after WWII have even come close. I'm reminded of Thomas Hardy's dexterity, but Hardy was of a different time, when you could afford to spend one whole page describing the shape of a wagon wheel. Bowles does not have this luxury because his readers simply do not have the patience to wade through such dense prose. Perhaps this is part of the reason he excels when describing the Sahara's alien splendor: it is of itself a sparing place, unforgiving and brutal. As a young, ambitious writer, Bowles asked Gertrude Stein where he should go to write and she suggested Morroco. Of course, Bowles was followed by a great many other writers; he and Jane staked out the territory and Burroughs, Ginsberg, etc, etc. followed. It's certainly understandable why. How could any writer in the 1950s stay away after reading a masterpiece like The Sheltering Sky? At the time, it was the antithesis of all things Industrial--a bastion of the ancient world. Even today, while Hemingway's style becomes more and more tiresome, Bowles keeps growing in both popularity and critical acclaim. You can see how he and Hemingway came from the same era, but Bowles chose the road less traveled, moving to Africa instead of a war-torn Europe. Even today, his style and subject matter remain fresh in the disturbing clarity of his vision. Indeed, the face of a sand dune may change from day to day, but its expression remains essentially the same. After reading The Sheltering Sky, you will never look at the desert in quite the same way again.Kirk Edward Sigurdson edsig@OPEN.org"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"There's never been a better time to read a story about Americans confronting the strangeness of the arab world than now .... particularly when that book is' The Sheltering Sky', surely the most underappreciated masterpiece to come out of America in the 20th century. Bowles, unlike the people running US foreign policy today, has learned to understand and appreciate an alternative culture to his own, which is part of what gives the book its power. The Morroccans that people sheltering sky are not merely scenery. Their view of life is compelling contrasted with those of Kit and Port, the couple at the heart of the book. In fact it's so well drawn that when kit chooses to vanish into this newly discovered world, rather return to the comfort of the eastern seaboard, we can well understand her rejection of her own culture."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Like some other reviewers, I read \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" while in Morocco. Specifically, I read it while serving in Peace Corps on the border of Morocco and Algeria at the onset of another blistering Saharan summer. Having experienced a near-death illness that confined me to a mat on the floor in a sweltering concrete room the previous summer not far from the setting of the book, I identified strongly with the main character's predicament. It also sent me into a mental funk for the next few days dreading the coming months of 105+ heat in what was essentially a concrete oven of an apartment. That is just how impressive Paul Bowles' book is. Bowles spent the last half of his life in Morocco and captures North Africa skillfully. His description of a man spiraling down into his self-inflicted hell and a woman driven mad by the process is gripping. Though my own personal experience intensified the book's impact, it is quite accessible to anyone who has ever felt the urge of damn-it-all-to-hell self-destruction. If you are bothered by seemingly rational characters making irrational decisions, stay away. However, if you can't help but watch what happens when people push themselves to the edge, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Written in the early post-World War II years and published in 1949, Paul Bowles' THE SHELTERING SKY carries with it the full bouquet of aimless, nihilistic despair that characterized much of the work of the so-called \\"Lost Generation\\" writers (Dos Passos, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, etc.) after World War I. Cynicism, ennui, disillusionment, and rejection of (or at least indifference toward) prevailing moral standards come in full dosage in Bowles' story of three young Americans traveling in post-war north and central Africa. Unfortunately, this attitude toward life no longer shocks. Indeed, lines like, \\"The soul is the weariest part of the body,\\"come across as rather quaint and somewhat cloying, literary forerunners of everything from National Lampoon magazine and TV's whining \\"Thirty-Something\\" series a few years ago to David Letterman, Steven Colbert, and \\"The Office\\" today.Notwithstanding the sense of datedness in the characters' life philosophies, THE SHELTERING SKY offers an interesting perspective on American attitudes toward non-Western, and especially Arabic, cultures. The main characters are Porter and Kit Moresby, a too-well-off young couple from New York traveling more or less randomly around Northwest Africa, sseemingly in search of a reason to be traveling more or less randomly around Northwest Africa. The two are ostensibly married, although through much of the book they sleep in separate rooms and behave far more like brother and sister than husband and wife. Porter and Kit are loosely accompanied by another American, Tunner, who prances around Kit like a hyperventilating puppy dog begging for attention while she barely deigns to kick him away. Occasionally intersecting their journeys are the Lyles, mother and son. They form a truly abhorrent American pair, she demanding and dismissive of all non-Americans and he unctuous and unsavory even as he accepts the leash by which his mother holds him. Filling the gaps are a variety of hospitable, French-speaking Arabs, local gendarmes, and an aggressively possessive camel driver named Belqassim.Each of Bowles' American characters represents a distinct attitude toward the newly emergent Third World - Porter as inveterate romanticizer, Kit as losing her identity in it (\\"going native,\\" as it were), Tunner as the classically grounded, glad-handing, culture-sampling tourist, Mrs. Lyles as domineering and condescending, and young Lyles as the weasely, self-interested schemer who moves without the least interest in his people and culture around him. Porter fails to discover the Africa he has so naively romanticized and Kit fails to establish herself as an individual with a backbone. In different ways, both main characters sublimate themselves to a greater, amorphous entity called Africa that might as easily be called global culture.Desert and sky also operate as characters in Bowles' novel. The desert is at once congenial partner and threatening horizontal abyss, both land and sea with its undulating waves of sand. The sky is, as the title suggests, and even greater presence, sometimes a blinding, blue-white, cloudless dome, other times a \\"violent blue\\" presence, as unforgiving as it is undifferentiated. Sun, moon, stars, day, night, dawn, dusk, light, darkness - all mark Porter and Kit by their presences. Yet at the same time, especially for Porter, the sky is also a shelter of sorts, a barrier between the confines and earth and the dark, limitless void of space. \\"A black star appears, a point of darkness in the night sky's clarity. Point of darkness and gateway to repose. Reach out, pierce the fine fabric of the sheltering sky, take repose.\\" And each in his and her own way, both Porter and Kit do find their respective means of repose at last."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles' masterpiece The Sheltering Sky,\\" is enjoying a literary resurgence, and well it should since it embodies much that defines excellence in literary fiction. Bowles' descriptions of foreign environments are exquisite in terms of telling detail and psychological intent. His dialogue is sophisticated and profound, leaving the reader with the impression of human complexity, even if his protagonists lack emotional depth. The plot, slow in parts, and elaborate in attempt, moves like a caravan through the vast regions of the diaspora with a subtlety that resonates, suggesting the wayward, crippling tendencies of people who lack faith in the world or themselves. Drifting aimlessly in search of diversion from anxiety and propelled into the outer reaches of civilization by a sense of personal emptiness and desire for novelty, Kit and Port Moresby are incapable of human intimacy. These are despairing, damaged people whose intelligence and education have convinced them of their superiority. Yet Bowles is quick to point out that their existential dilemma is the inevitable fate of all who cannot, for whatever reason, shoulder their fates in the modern world. Thus are Bowles' protagonists destined to wreak discord among their compatriots because they lack the psychological tools to understand their fellow man. They retreat from relationships rather than grow through them. There are no heroes in Bowles' book, no caring, empathic people on whom one would pin his hopes for civilization and humanity; there are only parasites of a disillusioned modernity, yet the less civilized natives dwelling in the extremities of the Sahara also exhibit little understanding of their fellow man.The book centers on Kit and Port, a young, bored couple of means who ostensibly set off for Africa to divert themselves from the stalemate of their marriage. They book separate rooms, treat each other with civility and feigned concern, but neither cherishes the other or is particularly affectionate or caring. Instead each attempts to reassure himself/herself that the other is worthy of allegiance. Kit has an affair and then is remorseful, Port lapses into sexual indulgence with a woman procured for him on one of his many excursions without his wife. While Kit sees Port as her safe harbor (\\"port\\"), she cannot love him; meanwhile he is forever seeking her approval, as if her respect defines his identity. Both are critical of others, particularly their friend Tunner, who has accompanied them on the trip - a man of singularly simple motives and predictability. They scorn him as they do another couple they befriend, for a lack of intellectuality and seeming vulgarity. Yet these people have somehow accommodated the world into a schematic from which they can make their lives work, whereas Kit and Port cannot \\"squeeze the universe into a ball\\" and assume the responsibility necessary to function in a world where choices and action are required, not escape and endless brooding. Because they cannot fall back on any beliefs that justify their tired lives, they continue to wallow in their despair until their poor choices and lack of action result in self-destruction. Port, for one, seems to harbor a death wish: In a particularly depressive incident, he dreams of \\"blood\\" and \\"excrement\\" and concludes that he must \\"reach out, pierce the fine fabric of the sheltering sky, take repose.\\" At that defining moment, he realizes that he is relieved to acknowledge a lack of meaning in life and love. The interminable choices no longer have to be made if one gives up caring and submits to his fate.The book is about boredom. The couple is bored with their marriage. They are bored with their lives and what each sees as his own failed choices. Kit focuses on her stylish clothes and the mask of her carefully made up face and superficial beauty. Port takes refuge in a Hemingway notion of manhood by taking care of their travel arrangements and seeking out voyeuristic thrills in the creepy outbacks of the Arab world, flirting with danger which allows him some refuge from his doubts about his masculinity. Yet when he returns from his adventures, he seeks out his wife for reassurance. Port is a fearful man, one who would be a hero or at least a man of art and literature, but he is ridden with a million little fears, fears about what he really is in the enigma of life. It is this failure to understand life, despite his constant pondering, that not only dooms him, but increases his anxieties to the point that they dominate his vision. No one understands life, but some have faith that it has some kind of coherence, like the Arab couple to whom Kit eventually turns for refuge.Thematically, what is most important in this book is implied in the title's metaphor and evident in the plot. Although as one reviewer pointed out, the characters are not definitively revealed, it is their very lack of development that not only relegates them to lives of entitlement, complacency and superficiality, but also makes apparent the reasons for the malaise of much of contemporary society. Whether you view their underlying anxiety and its concomitant traits of escapism, voyeurism, and mindless chauvinism as pathology or merely the unavoidable existential angst of modern life, you still have here two people unable to cope with the challenges inherent in an immense and impenetrable universe, symbolized by the \\"sheltering\\" sky. One presumes that wrestling with the absurdity of life would be, as it is for them, fruitless and demoralizing unless one had some kind of certainty to fall back on. For some of us this is the love of family and friends or the absolutes of religion, at least some governing passion by which we build lives of meaning that fortify us in the face of despair. Alas, for Kit and Port, such insight does not occur. Instead they look inward at the chaos of their own fearful minds, seeking reassurance in each other to mitigate their nihilistic leanings. Yes, life is ultimately absurd; it does not make sense, even in the most predictable circumstances. Still, most of us forge on, endowing our lives with meaning by the decisions we make. Underlying those is a sense of who we are, a knowledge that evades Kit and Port, although both of them are self-absorbed enough that were they to connect emotionally with anyone, they might grow to the point where they not only understand themselves somewhat, but find enough meaning in life with which to sustain something close to satisfaction.Instead Port more or less gives up, and Kit submits to the dark forces of her own untethered fears. Her downward spiral reflects an emptiness beyond despair. She lacks imagination and the capacity to empathize, among other traits. Alas, it is no wonder that she sinks into degradation, seeking in her victimhood compensatory punishment for her disloyalty to her husband as well as her own vacuity. Her insanity is her final self-inflicted retribution for a life led without principle and direction. She is at the last pathetic in her unwillingness to be present, to be seen for what she is: an irresponsible reprobate that has buried herself so deeply in her own abyss that there is no hope for her because she cannot acknowledge responsibility for what she is. She wallows in masochism. In her denial,her subjugation is not her fault; in this vein she avoids responsibility for her behavior and still experiences the decadence her need for novelty has driven her to. She is the classic existential character or she is a pathetic, superficial, uncaring woman. You decide. I choose the latter. Ironically it was Port whom she clung to for refuge; when he could no longer protect her from her nameless fears and propensities, she slid into the oblivion of mental illness as easily as did he submit to illness.The desert metaphor is powerful and incisive. The heat, the light, the aridity, the alien culture, the predatory flies, the filthy dust, the dark horizons and alleyways, all are images that stay with you because Bowles weaves them into his rich tapestry of African life. One is reminded of \\"The English Patient\\" in the images of limitless sand and incomprehensible people, languages, customs and the omnipresent shadows and looming dangers of the Sahara. The important theme here is the idea of how strong a person must be to meet life head on without fear. Such strength is not attained through education, imagination, money or entitlement. Instead it is acquired through the daily struggle for self-betterment and commitment to others, goals neither Kit nor Port can embrace. Without marriage, intimacy or empathy, the challenges of life can suggest an overwhelming unfathomability both the uncertain and fearful may yield to. This is spiritual defeat, and this is the stuff of Bowles. He portrays these lost and drifting individuals with great insight, illustrating how bereft life is when one's relationships are shallow. Like his predecessor, Joseph Conrad, Bowles penetrates the heart of darkness in people who for whatever reason have grasped the full horror of life and been unable to cope with its lurid truths, the same terrible epiphanies that occupy every man's psychological abyss. Yet sooner or later, this is human fodder, and so man must confront those fears with courage and equanimity. Drifting around the world and from each other simply won't do it, as Kit and Port ultimately realize. Nor will intellectuality ameliorate the darkness of life.For the most part, the book is well realized, if repetitious in parts and even if the triviality of moment by moment experiences is dwelt on rather than minimized. The characters are well drawn and the themes of alienation, fear, marital unhappiness, and the shadowy uncertainty of life are well developed and universal. The book is polished in style and believable in most aspects. At the same time, it is a rough ride into the dark and mysterious realms of the tormented psyche. The book is full of extended internal monologues where a character's mind confronts the enigmas of life, only to arrive at the same paralyzing fears of death and the stark recognition of the insignificance or insubstantiality, not to mention the infinite \\"unknowingness\\" of life. For the sky does not shelter; its limitless, infinitely perplexing image arouses doubt, confusion and malaise -- what many would term the \\"existential dilemma.\\" As Port notes upon waking from one of his most anxious dreams, \\"The soul is the weariest part of the body.\\" And so it is with man that he both yearns for and fears death, but the survivor is the person capable of coping with fears that always reside beneath the surface of life, challenging the true seeker. Thus, it turns out that Kit was right when she explained to Tunner, \\"I was never meant to live.\\" Alas, she didn't know how...Marjorie MeyerleColorado WriterAuthor: \\"Bread of Shame\\""},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I just read this book for the second time. It's greatness, beauty, intelligence and wisdom took me by surprise, again. I think it stands equal to anything Joyce, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald or Camus ever wrote."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This book is reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The characters are presumably smart, independent travelers, but they are not equiped to go into the desert. With each hardship, pieces of their lives and identities peel away. They are searching and hungering in a land where sheep fat is the main course. Bowles creates shocking and vulgar circumstances through imagery inspired by the shifting sands and unforgiving sun. His brilliant pacing seems to move the characers along like the cycles of an addict-from daze to frenzy. The writing is clean and honest, to the point of being edgy. Despite it all, Bowles is optimistic. Unlike Conrad's characters, these characters still have options. It is a pleasure to read a book of this caliber, I savored every page."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I'm really wondering if I read the same book as everyone else here. I found the story ridiculous and the characters way too shallow to have the \\"deep thoughts\\" Bowles tries to cram into their heads. While it's clear Kit, Port and Tunner don't understand or much appreciate the native culture, the book really doesn't show how they impact it. We see it slightly through the ancillary characters but not with any great insight. We have no idea why Kit and Port have become estranged, but if they're too stupid to even think it through very clearly how is it they're going to analyze the meaning of life in the desert? Frankly, it's hard to really care about them at all. The blurbs and reviews paint the Lyles as some threatening presence that hangs over the story -- they're con artists who drop in and out of the book and are far less threatening than any of the various diseases our heroes decide to ignore. Even considering the post-WWII context, the story stumbles along in a way that is so totally unrealistic that the reader is wondering just what the point is. In the end, Port is dead, Kit appears to have become a nymphomaniac, and the sheltering sky continues to beat down on the timeless sands."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is really two books bound into one - and appropriately it is made into one novel.It starts out like Hemingway or Fitzgerald. The first half of the story line plays out like a Hemingway analysis of the Americans engaging with other Americans in a very foreign land. Or, like Fitzgerald, the main characters Kit, Port and Tunner are three adventurous Americans who have the wonderful ability of being young and wealthy as they dive into the depths of the Sahara to vacation for months among the Arabs.Then the tide turns. Things are not so great. Unpleasantries erupt. And, Kit's life becomes a living hell. Typhoid, kidnaping, multiple rape, and theft. This half of the book is introspective, and unlike Fitzgerald or Hemingway we read not so much about the American in a foreign land, but learn about the foreigner in the foreign land. And, as I had a horrible flu and was bedridden when I read this book, I can well attest to his vivid detail of the pains of typhoid - it may have kept me in bed for an extra day as I truly had a hard time stomaching his details.Bowles lived in Morocco and knew its Arabs well. And, this book is based upon his living in Morocco. This book's less-than-complimentary depiction of the Arab male's character is either a manifestation of his knowledge of the Arab male or a creation of a bias he acquired from living there. Probably the former.Kit, in her twenties, learns in this book that she was a stranger in a very strange land. She was out of her element. It was a \\"jungle\\" out there. She ends up broke and broken. \\"There is something repulsive about an American without money in his pocket.\\" But, she lived through the entire horror. Her survival is testimonial to her animal instincts. She persevered like a wild animal of the jungle.This is not light reading. In fact, it is very heavy reading. Take your time in reading this prose. It is very rich and could be underappreciated."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky was published two years after Under the Volcano, and while Malcolm Lowry remained a prisoner of the style of the time -- stopping the action to laboriously take us through the biography of Hugh Firmin in the notorious Chapter 6, stopping the action again during the bullfight scene to laboriously take us through the biography of Yvonne -- Bowles sails right through the novel without bothering to give us any biography at all. Just the hint that Port and Kit come from New York, that Port has a mother in New York. In this sense The Sheltering Sky is more modern than the Volcano.Port and Kit have every bit as much reality as Jacques Laruelle, Hugh Firmin, Yvonne (but perhaps not the Consul, one of the great characters of literature). But is Bowles as deep as Lowry? Deeper? Less deep? That is in the eye of the reader.Bowles' cold, clinical style is worlds away from the convoluted, often affected writing of Lowry. Comparisons could be made between the alcoholic who intentionally brings about his own death and the sophisticated white woman who allows herself to become the harem slave of an Arab trader.These are two novels about disintegration as a function of human personality, and are both very modern. Each is repellent to a certain kind of reader, fascinating and addictive to another kind of reader."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"For Kerouac and the Beats, frenetic, directionless travel was proof of life - could even be held to &quot;create&quot; life. Bowles, in this slyly subversive book, reverses that. The three Americans who start out on this largely pointless journey into the North African desert, hope the mere fact of movement will resolve their deep spiritual lethargy - or at least delay their having to face it. They imagine themselves sophisticated, wearing their cynicism as a talisman in a cultural landscape of troubling strangeness. But they are simply unaware. Faced with an elemental vastness that cares nothing for their conceits, they dis-integrate. Only one survives and she is so utterly changed - physically and in spirit - that she can no longer recognise herself, nor see a future for herself in the world she formally inhabited. Although the prime characters are fundamentally unpleasant - at least for most of the book - the lasting impression is of an eerie, spectral beauty. It is a quiet masterpiece; I know of few books that are more subtly teasing - that more wisely poke at our arrogance in imagining that we know anything."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"In Paul Bowles' The Sheltering Sky, three still-young Americans travel to the post WWII North African desert in search of themselves and new experiences.Port and Kit Moresby, in the tenth year of marriage, have become both sexually and emotionally estranged, and Port hopes their sojourn into the desert will bring them closer together and restore the love they once shared. Kit, not so keen on either the desert or Port, has nevertheless agreed to Port's wishes, albeit reluctantly. The third person in their party, their friend, George Tunner, accompanies them more on a whim than anything else.Seeking the exotic, the trio really doesn't know what to do with it when they find it. The sun is too bright, the labyrinth of city streets too dark, the excess of sensual delights a surfeit that imprisons rather than frees.Becoming more and more dissatisfied with both themselves and with those around them, they decide to leave the restrictiveness of the city behind and venture farther south, into the wild, harsh, dazzling beauty of the Sahara. They meet the Lyles, ostensibly mother and son, who claim to be writing a travel book but whose real business appears to be far more sinister, much like the duo's own obsessive Freudian tangles.Port, who at first, found himself drawn inexorably to the beauty and remoteness of the Sahara, soon becomes violently ill and dies, and Kit, grateful to be rescued by a passing, enigmatic Arab, finds that things are not always as they seem. Her rescuer becomes her imprisoner, and as the sun grows ever brighter, the shadows grow deeper. The bizarre eventually becomes so real that Kit gradually and terrifyingly loses what fragile grip on reality she once possessed.Although The Sheltering Sky may, on the surface, seem like a lurid and melodramatic tale, it is anything but. A masterpiece of understatement, plot is always secondary to theme in Bowles' writing; the real changes take place in the minds of the characters who must face an immensity of experience they cannot even hope to understand much less prepare themselves for.The indifference of nature and the unforgiving quality of the desert also play a huge part in this story. The book could be a metaphor for the meaninglessness of most 20th century relationships. Port and Kit's journey into the heart of the Sahara mirrors our own journey into the depths of the soul and we either come back altered forever (Kit) or we don't come back at all (Port). It is significant that Tunner, more superficial in both his outlook and psychological makeup, fails to make the journey into the depths of the desert and, as such, he remains untouched by it. He emerges essentially the same as he was when the story began.The Sheltering Sky could have been a character study, but Bowles wisely eschews this venue. Although we gain flashes of insight into each character, we really don't get to know them in-depth. An existential novel, the characters in The Sheltering Sky are more symbolic than fully-formed, fleshed-out people. In a highly thematic book, however, this is exactly as it should be, and Bowles never fails to manipulate his characters with anything less than sheer perfection.The inner emptiness of the characters is emphasized by the incompleteness of their emotional experiences. Every time Port or Kit seem to be on the verge of discovering a deeper connection, to themselves or to each other, Bowles pulls the chair out from under the reader. The scene that best typifies this lack of depth is Kit's as she spends her final moments with Port following his death: &quot;Softly she laid her cheek on the pillow and stroked his hair. No tears flowed, it was a silent leave-taking. A strangely intense buzzing in front of her made her open her eyes. She watched fascinated while two flies made their brief, frantic love on his lower lip.&quot;Although The Sheltering Sky is, for the most part, written in beautifully understated prose (the vivid place descriptions are the exception), there is nothing subtle about its message. And, while one emerges from this strange and complex novel as if from a dream, a little reflection makes it clear that our dreams can so easily become our nightmares.The real setting of The Sheltering Sky is not the vast, uncharted Sahara, but the vast, uncharted reaches of the modern soul. Like Bowles' characters, we won't find the journey to the depths an easy one, but if we are going to do more than live on the periphery of life we should, however, find the journey necessary.Polished to perfection in every way, The Sheltering Sky is the strangest, and most strangely familiar, book I've read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"With the death of Paul Bowles the world has lost one of its great authors. This book allows us to hold on to some of that greatness. As a rumination on the existential impact of place and space, the book opens up horizons of thought one may have never considered. When Port tells Kit his thoughts on the 'sheltering sky' one is asked to consider the implications of realizing - always and ceaselessly knowing - that the &quot;sky&quot; is a fiction that protects us from our very insignificance. In one short passage, Bowles has ripped the lid off our world as surely as he casts Kit into the desert, another grain of sand among countless others. This book is about more than an encounter with the Sahara, it is about - and is itself - an encounter with human existence."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles' classic novel of the Sahara, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, is perhaps the closest to perfect a book can attain. The characters are absolutely real, and Bowles digs so deep into the American psyche with them the effect is, at times, horrifying. In this book of three American travelers who journey through North Africa, Bowles shows us, with gripping yet subtle tones, how rigid is our comprehension of foreign culture, and how incomplete is our knowledge of ourselves. It is a novel for the mind. As the journeyers separate, first from each other then from their own sanity, we undestand how delicate our grip on reality is, especially when faced with the awesome spectacle of untouched nature. As dialogue and plot imperceptibly give way to long, lush interior landscapes, Bowles charts a course to the heart of human evil for us, much as Conrad did in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, but this time with more depth and more passion. There is no mistaking this book or a potboiler, and it is not an easy read, but once begun it is not easily ended, even when the last page is read. It echoes. It will echo one hundred years from now. Pick it up and begin a journey into yourself you will never forget"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky is a book that has everything--passion, love, disillusionment, pathos--you name and it's there. I hate to use the word, &quot;masterpiece,&quot; but in this case, it applies. Bowles has done a perfect job in showing us the psychological depths of people who are deeply in love, yet lose their connections to and need for each other. The power of their plight is only reinforced by the unrelenting bleakness of the vast Sahara. It is a dark and often depressing book but one that is more than satisfying and memorable."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Shortly after Paul Bowles arrived in Morocco in July, 1947, he began writing &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; in the stuffy air of a claustrophobic hotel room in Fez. &quot;The first page had to be part of the airless little hotel room where I was lying.&quot; From this inauspicious, but atmospheric, beginning, Bowles created one of the most profound works of Twentieth Century American literature, a deeply disturbing exploration of interiority and the world, of the relationship between mind and culture.&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; tells the story of three Americans traveling in the Sahara following the Second World War. Port and Kit Moresby, husband and wife, and their friend, Tunner, are &quot;travelers,&quot; not &quot;tourists,&quot; as Port says early in the narrative. &quot;The difference is partly one of time . . . Whereas the tourist generally hurries back home at the end of a few weeks or months, the traveler, belonging no more to one place than to the next, moves slowly, over periods of years, from one part of the earth to another.&quot; Like travelers, Port, Kit and Tunner seem to have little in the way of an itinerary, their days languourously slipping by, one day into the next, without purpose, marked only by a palpable psychic discomfort.But there is another important difference between the tourist and the traveler. As Port relates, &quot;the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking.&quot; In doing this, however, the traveler runs the risk, if the degree of cultural separation is too great, if the foreign culture is too extreme, that he will become completely untethered from reality. As Bowles once said in a 1981 Paris Review interview: &quot;Everyone is isolated from everyone else. The concept of society is like a cushion to protect us from the knowledge of that isolation. A fiction that serves as an anaesthetic.&quot;It is, ultimately, the removal of this anaesthetic, the removal of societal and cultural moorings, which drives the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;and determines the fate of Port and Kit and Tunner. One does not survive; another will never be the same again. Disturbances of the interior landscape, the landscape of the psyche, become the catalyst of this psychologically discomforting novel. And this stunning mingling of interior landscape with the landscape of the Sahara-the sands, the sky, the maze-like passages of the cities, the alien culture-brilliantly unfies and completes the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, marking it as a profound and compelling work of genius."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"My introduction to this novel is kind of strange: One rainy day, many years ago, I went to the cinema to see what was on and there was this movie called 'The Sheltering Sky'. I walked out a few hours later, liking it alot, but kind of feeling alot went unexplained and so I immediately got hold of the novel...That novel seriously changed my life. I was in my young twenties and desperately trying to find some meaning to life at the time. Well, to make a long story short, Bowles confronted me with all those sweet & scarey existential things about life that I had suspected. Life at the time seemed amazing and full of joy and promise, but also really terrifying and tragic, too. I guess I become a bone fide signed up member to Existentialism because of this book.I am now in my mid thirties and whilst my rabid Existenitalism is now tempered by practical realities. The Sheltering Sky has become something of a bible of sorts to me. Here is why:First of all, it's style of writing. Cold and clinical. It looks at the psychologies of these people like they are ants under a microscope (and in a sense they are, three people in a huge empty wide space (the desert = the world) under a, not so much merciless, but rather a 'benignly indifferent' (to borrow from Camus) 'Sheltering Sky. To me, these people in a strange land are really a metaphor/analogy for our place in the universe: How we are 'thrown' into existence with no objective reference. How we almost find ourselves in the world (surely a strange place at the best of times) and how we desperately try to connect with others (sometimes successful, sometimes not).Anyway, it is a book that I read atleast once a year.These are merely my subjective feelings - I'm certainly not going to say 'it is the best book ever', or something to that effect. But it is certainly my favourite book. Mostly because it demonstrated to me how another humans artistic endeavour can inform and help someone else to find their own answers.

Some elements are quite similar: both detail the interpersonal connections among a triangle of protagonists consisting of two men and one woman, who is married to one of the men. Both tell of the horrifying last days of an expatriate in an alien civilization: the consulate Firman in UTV, and Port Moresby in TSS.Both books describe the effects of the lack of, or the loss of, spiritualism on the protagonists as they make their way in a strange environment with a bewildering culture. UTV focuses more on Firman's personal inadequacy as the cause for his undoing while TSS focuses more on universal reasons, which is why the book is usually referred to as a work of existentialist fiction.One reviewer noted an odd sense of humor in TSS. I would agree that some of the situations that the protagonists find themselves in are so alien to their own cultural experience that humor emerges out of the sheer incongruency. For example, I couldn't help but chuckle at the image of Port running like a scared boy from his first encounter with the Arab prostitute Marhnia. Still, instances of humor in TSS are rare, and usually the incongruency between the protagonists and the culture they find themselves in produces a sense of horror or discomfort. Another element of humor is the portrayal of the Lyles. The book reaches for and achieves a subtle satire of this travelling couple, but ultimately there is little to laugh at even there. There is something mysterious and menacing in the character of Eric Lyle that cuts one's laughter short. At best it's a nervous laughterMuch has been written about TSS as a seminal work of beat literature. I find it more philosophical and more profound than beat lit usually achieves. It has more in common with the novels of Camus than with Kerouac's. War ravaged Europe produced Camus, Sartre, and Becket. America produced Kerouac, Mailer, and Bellow. If TSS is any example, Bowles had more in common with the Europeans.I give TSS a five-star rating because it's a coherent piece of work, with all the symbols working together to produce feelings of alienation, confusion, and discomfort. The main symbolic motif, that of the burning white light of the sky, gets an unusual treatment. Light, when used as a metaphor, usually suggests knowledge or spiritual enlightenment. But in TSS, the light is used symbolically to the contrary: it is oppressive, torturing, and relentless, suggesting that what enlightenment is possible will be painful and the darkness is preferable to light."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Someone gave me the book to read and I sort of read it on a whim not having any clue what it was about or who Paul Bowles is. Since that time this book has ignited a passion in me for Morocco and the Saraha desert as well as Paul Bowles' short stories that I have never know about anything else. I like what Gore Vidal had to say about the book &quot;...Bowles has glimpsed what lies back of our sheltering sky...an endless flux of stars so like those atoms which make us up that in our apprehension of this terrible infinity, we experience not only horror but likeness.&quot; It is not an easy book to read and unless you are willing to spend time digging through the layers you probably will not find it that rewarding. The book challenges you in much the same way the desert challenges Kit and Port. It is not a product of the American pop culture meant to be consumed.

I truly found a new vigor and understanding for life upon completing this novel after experiencing what Kit and Port go through."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The beginning of this book moves quite slowly, and when it picks up in pace, it picks up only a little. I even found the writing tedious at first, though it became quite wonderful by the end. It isn't a page turner for sure, but still I found myself slowly moving from bored to being very interested in the characters to being completely swallowed by the story and unaware of the world outside the novel.The book is about a couple, Port and Kit, and their friend Tunner. They are travelling in the Sahara Desert, far from their familiar culture. Things happen to them which compose the story, but the novel is great because it captures the tension in the relationships between people. Nobody seems to be able to understand the others, and each of the three characters are in some ways as foreign to each other as they are to their surroundings. Eventually, Kit emerges as the main character, unable to comprehend her identity in a place that has stripped her of the sureness of her existence. In a sense, she loses her post-War American psychological angst, and becomes immersed in the more basic anguish of fear and surrender.

This isn't a book that can be described in a brief synopsis; this is a book that must be absorbed from cover to cover. I found this book so enchanting and compelling, I couldn't put it down until I finished."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is a book that is set in the physical landscape of North Africa but actually occurs within the minds of the main characters - three self-obsessed Americans on a journey to self-discovery that leads nowhere.No European writer could have written such a work as he would have been tempted to take sides and see life through the eyes of the \\"natives\\" or the representatives of the imperialist/colonial power as Somerset Maugham, Anthony Burgess and William Boyd definitely and, perhaps Albert Camus, would.However, as Americans of Bowles' generation still regarded colonialism as a quaint habit that they had not acquired, they were free to use the (exotic) background as they wished. This book was first published in 1949 and was a precursor of the hippyism that erupted about 20 years later.Bowles and his compatriots were lucky as they were able to use the natives and the imperialists as fair game whether they were Arabs, French, black Africans or English, as occurs here.Now that my sermon is over, I would say this is a very good book that is probably less pretentious than my introduction would imply.It is not a work to be seen in terms of realism but it is also not obscure and the physical description of the heat, cold, sand, grit, squalor, filth, cruelty and backwardness of life in North Africa is well done.The reader - especially the modern female reader - might find the portrayal of the main female character offensive - just as the politically correct modern reader, of either sex, will probably not approve of how the Arabs and blacks are portrayed.The general reader will find himself in a book that presents one of the main characters in a way that - without revealing the plot - is captivating and daring and must have been a great challenge for the writer.He might also feel - like me - that the ending is just too contrived."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"An excellent read.

The character Kit, for example, observes: \\"Other people rule my life.\\" Early in his narration, Bowles adds: \\"The terror was already there inside her ready to take command.\\"Meanwhile, Port, despite his charms, is a sadly isolated person. Bowles says: \\"Although it was the basis of his unhappiness, this glacial deadness, he would cling to it always, because it was also the core of his being; he had built the being around it.\\"Early in TSS, these concept-driven characters have experiences that seeem slightly bogus, with the insightful Bowles explaining the interaction between characters but not really bringing them to life. Kit and Port, in other words, just don't ring true as people.But then Bowles takes his characters and puts them on a bus on a heedless journey into the Sahara. And, their adventure, a truly riveting tale, is the perfect vehicle to explore the wacko personalities that Bowles has defined. \\"Book Two, The Earth's Sharp Edge,\\" starts in Bou Noura, a desolate outpost where the European influence is negligible.

Normally, I have great trouble getting into a novel if I can't feel some sympathy for and interest in at least a few of the characters, but that's not the way \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" worked. The story is hypnotic, a journey further and further into the Sahara, and further and further away from the normal markers of identity. The language is very beautiful, painfully precise in its descriptions of people, lyric in discussing scenery, and hallucinatory when we enter into the minds of the characters. Reminds me of modernist French poetry in the combination of precision and hallucination. Those two things, the story and the language, kept me reading until I had finished the book, in one session. But all the while I wondered why I was reading about these people -- rich Americans drifting aimlessly about, from emptiness to more emptiness (why can't they get jobs, or have children, or do something USEFUL??)

The story of three Westerners trying to find their metaphysical way against the exotic (and ultimately horrifying) backdrop of Morocco reduces North Africa to a kind of movie set for the \\"real\\" characters--the American couple Kit and Port, along with their friend Tunner--to explore the nature of existence. Bowles is good at describing the trash, poverty, bad food, and illness his characters discover in Africa. Instead of sweeping that under the rug, he makes it a key part of the story: it's through learning to accept the third-world filth that Kit and Port free themselves of Western convention, and come to embrace the emptiness behind the sheltering sky. But I think the real force of the novel isn't so much in its philosophy--a fashionable \`50s existentialism--or its spare descriptions of the East, where Arabs aren't much more than talking landscape, but in its portrait of Paul and Jane Bowles, the glamorous writers in fashionable exile in Tangier. I get the impression Bowles was trying to deliver great scary truths, but what I enjoyed most about the novel was its fantasy of privileged escape from modern ennui.P.S. Does anyone else find that \\"P.S.\\" marketing insert in Harper Perennial editions as annoying as I do?"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Bowles has a strange kind of status in America among the literate and illiterate, chiefly because his life style represents a little bit of everything for identity freaks. That he hung out in the Third World, had a lesbian wife, took drugs, liked his boys young and brown, all this and more contributes to his celebrity status and explains why his books rank high among the Tower Record set. \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is his premier novel. It is well-worth a read and even deserves a close second read. It is in many ways a haunting book, because of its message which subverts expectation and undermines the popular desire for a happy ending, on a personal and on a cultural level. Kit is a wayward creature, a spoiled bohemian adventuress, who could easily be written off were it not for her final decision to return to the casbah, no doubt to serve out her time on this plane as a sexual object, a slave or a prostitute. We understand that she would prefer this to a life of leisure back in New York, with Tunner and his crowd back in the Village, or the Hamptons or wherever. Curiously, I don't believe feminists have embraced this text, although I can't say why. It serves as a radical denunciation of the leisure class, its pretensions and its hypocrisy. Kit is not terribly interesting, but then again neither was her now dead husband. She inherits from him her inability to make sense of life. There really is nothing for her to do. She cares about nothing. This is Bowles' radical vision of life in the West. The book has to be read; Bertolucci's film version is very thin and ultimately fails to capture this disorientating aspect of the book."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles's first novel, The Sheltering Sky, published in 1949, is a fascinating work that depicts existential confrontations with the self, and cultural confrontations between Westerners and Arabs in French West Africa in the late colonial period of the mid-twentieth-century. Though the novel may be dated in the sense that Bowles is depicting the colonial enterprise in a varieties of contexts and thus presents the North African world as an almost endless expanse of mystery and otherness--\\"darkest Africa\\" in the Sahara--one may interpret the novel almost on an allegorical level, pertaining to an individual's psychological quest for meaning, thus transcending the limitations of the novel's historical milieu. The fluid prose aids in this sense of constant psychological movement toward some goal--which the main characters are desparate to find. While reading this novel, the reader may also sense this restleness arising within himself or herself, as we all must find meaning in our own worlds--desert or fruitful plain."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Hypnotic work.

The third person omniscient view point was used differently than most novels imbibing it with an anomalous feeling akin to the 1900s north African desert landscape portrayed. The prose wasn't particularly vivid, the plot not entirely engrossing, the author certainly didn't write the characters to be genial. Symbolism abounds, though, and through the machinations of fate's crucible like focus love and regret are finally brought to the forefront.It brought back the feeling of being a stranger, alone, in 3rd world countries and knowing that with some disputable choices one could easily end up conjoined with these somnolent characters: A left turn here; two rights; a little less common sense; sprinkle in some pride and you've arrived at this story's vertiginous awaking.Throughout it all you wonder, will they solve their problems before they run out of time?

It is a sweeping adventure that takes a long look at life, travel, adventure, trying to get away from it all, getting lost in the unknown, and more. I thoroughly enjoyed not only the characters (Port, Kit, Tunner) but also the descriptions of Morocco and the Sahara, where you can really feel that you are there. Bowles perfectly captures the time and the place-as he lived in Tangier for 50 years. I will definitely be looking for more of his books to read."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"its only days later after finishing this book yet somehow i keep ging back to it in my mind. The desolution in the desert and the sheer force bowles thrusts these characters upon you- love or hate them they are all there, so honest and intriguing in their personal journeys. this book is unlike any other i have read. pg 186 when kit and port sit beneath the maple trees is my favorite part in the book where port shares his philosophy on death and how we take it for granted how fragile life is. \\"Because we dont know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustable well\\"... this scene and book makes me appreciate life more. rest easy mr. bowles and thank you."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"With an air of smug narcissism, a trio of post-war Americans seek the exotic in North Africa. A love triangle develops, which progresses into a story about jealousy and betrayal, though without any traces of melodrama. Bowles' famous novel is beautifully composed; the vibrancy of the landscape is reminiscent of early Hemingway. In a way, the Sheltering Sky is a rewriting of the Sun Also Rises, though it is an inversion. We are faced with the inevitability of understanding and compassion, and the only natural consequent is destruction. This is a powerful and consuming novel written in elegant and lyrical prose. It is now something of a forgotten classic."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Port, Kit and Tunner are supposed to be friends that decide to take a trip to North Africa to explore the desert, know more about the culture, and drink tea with the locals...Port and Kit (the couple) decide to separate from Tunner since he is trying to get Kit's attenion which get's on Port's nerves. So they do, and do their own travelling.Port and Kit live the real experiences crossing the desert, they have the chance to mix with the locals, and get to learn more on the desert, and the challenges in belonging their.

Re-reading it reminded me how many scenes had become part of my unconscious thinking (conversations between the main characters; descriptions of the desert; the odd mannerisms of some characters, especially the mother-son American expatriots; and especially the last section of the book which simultaneously departs from reality yet intensifies the reality that was established throughout the novel). The sense of how two people can be deeply in love, with a profound and needy connection, and yet be unable to form words for their closeness until one of them is lost, are painfully poignant in this novel. Adding to this poignancy is the idea of how war can drive people to a place like the Sahara--a place far away from the society where those wars were begun and fought--and yet take away your voice for expressing the horror that drove you there, even with your partner, who travelled to this far-off place with you for the same reasons. In this sense, the desert becomes a metaphor for a place we can all end up in, where we feel passionately, but where our &quot;tongue turns to stone,&quot; as W.B. Yeats once wrote. In this book, the desert is a landscape where there are both infinite possibilities, yet a great inability to move with energy in any direction. Conrad's phrase, &quot;We live, as we dream, alone,&quot; comes to mind repeatedly as you read this book."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky...the title lures you in with the promise of a reading experience both surreal and sensual. The book delivers on its promise.Bowles' description of Northern Africa and the goings-on therein is atmospheric, haunting and it manages to frazzle the nerves. We see this exotic locale through the eyes of the psychologically involving characters Kit and Port. Even Tunner, who is unmistakably Kit and Port's inferior, isn't given short shrift. He's considered in his entirety and is not a caricature.This book takes the reader to another place. Not to Northern Africa necessarily. It takes the reader into the inner recesses of complicated characters' psyches. The sojourn to this nebulous terrain is both terrifying and magnificent.The effect of this trip is not that we love, loathe or even identify with Kit and Port. We become them. Although such a statement sounds nonsensical, I have no other way of describing the curious, powerful feeling aroused by reading &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The first chapter of this book is, in my opinion, one of the great pieces of twentieth century writing. It is no more than a couple of pages but it is so overwhelming that I had to put the book down after reading it. This book is gripping, terrifying and unsettling. It is unequalled in its portrayal of alienation and, indeed, depression. It is extraordinary its intuition. Paul Bowles should be recognised as one of the great writers in English and, I believe, in time he will be."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"The Sheltering Sky may be the best book I ever read that nearly failed my 50-page rule. That's the rule I made up that allots a book that many pages to convince me to continue. If it fails to do so, it's back to the shelf or into a box -- sometimes to never be heard from again.The Sheltering Sky is a good book, but it starts slow and never manages to evolve into any kind of a page-turner. But something I can't put my finger on wouldn't let me push it aside after those 50 pages, something I'm now very glad for.The general premise of the story is simple: three Americans travel to Morocco in the wake of the Second World War to escape civilization and to find themselves. But the story is really an exploration into the way people react in a crisis and especially the way Americans interact with unfamiliar cultures.It makes for a memorable if not effortless read, one of the popular 20th century books that deserve the label &quot;classic&quot; and that will compel you to confront your own morality, ethics, arrogance and pathos.Though the book is dense and serious, it is not without a few subtle jokes: the two rival French army commanders, one of whom drinks only cognac and the other named d'Armagnac; the pathetic and entertaining Lyles; the unintentionally comic diplomat who tries to help Kit over the book's final pages.I'll conclude with a tip: once you've finished The Sheltering Sky, go back and re-read the first chapter. It's beautifully written, but some of its insights are clear only in retrospect."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Paul Bowles was a genius. Along Maurice Ravel, Saint-Exupery, Debussy and Bu&ntilde;uel...Bowles is a distinguished memeber of The Club. The sky above us is like a shelter which protect us from what is beyond...the obscurity of the universe, the obscurity of the soul. It happens in the same place where the plane of Saint-Exupery failed and was forced to land to find the little prince. But The Sheltering Sky is the total treaty of the soul. The face to face stand with fate and fortune -at once- when we discover that loosing our companions can lead us to the point of no return, the point which Bowles understood from Kafka, the poin to be reached, where the streetcar makes a wide turn...the end of the line, when we realize that our lives will never be the same it used to be a minute ago. Until we can avoid or cheat destiny we tend to believe life as an endless, limitless well, but here comes the powerful point of Bowles: how many more times we'll see the fullmoon rise? Perhaps quite few -surely very few as a matter of fact- and folishly we think life will never ends!Bowles himself gave a sublime review to this matter: our soul is the weariest part of our being. No special stock collection of the soul is compleate without this masterpice. Get it, you will not regret the cost, it will be surely an invesment with the great return of deeply apreciated knowledge."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Besides being a really great read in its own right, The Sheltering Sky inspired great discussion in our reading group... more opinionated response than anything we've read in the previous twelve months.Part of the reason for this is surely the depth with which Paul Bowles exposes the psyche of his two principle characters, Port and Kit Moresby. Yet the brilliance of his writing is that much is left hidden from view, there is almost infinite speculation (interpretation) as to the motives and inner thoughts of his characters. This American husband and wife, together with their friend Tunner, set off on the ultimate existentialist journey through post World War II Morocco. Individually, it will change, ruin, and even kill them. They experience the harshness of the Sahara desert, and a clash with Arab culture that goes beyond anything they were expecting.It is Port's vision that initially spurs them on, a vision borne of his desire for \\"solitude and the proximity to infinite things\\" and a disdain for Western culture. But soon Kit and Tunner are forced to endure the uncaring Sahara on their own, and the novel focuses in on Kit's own spiritual disintegration. Her understandable inability to cope with a profound crisis and loss.The fullness of awayness.Adriftness.Lostness... in a sea of sand and unfamiliarity.These three well-intentioned though hapless expatriates find themselves propelled out into a very real world where romantic ideas perish, and where, if the sky is your only shelter, you may well be burnt to a crisp by the unrelenting sun.Highly recommended as a reading-group selection."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; is ostensibly a book about the sojourn of three American travellers (Port, Kit &amp; Tunner) in the Sahara desert. As alienation and a growing sense of incomprehension take hold of and tighten their grip on the travellers' psyche, they fall victim to the strange cruelty of the desert which takes on the role of the antagonist in this travellers' tale. It is tempting to imagine that the all-enveloping and terrifying vastness of the Sahara is the root cause of their troubled psychological state. If this reflects the conventional reading of the novel, I beg to differ. I found all three principal characters cold, edgy, unhappy and ultimately selfish. There is no genuine communication in their human contact. A pervading sense of alienation clouds their private thoughts and deliberation. The condescending attitude of the colonialists (including the Lyles and the French officials) towards the natives and outsiders is all the more ironical when it becomes apparant that the latter (eg, the old Jewish couple) is capable of basic human kindness which the colonialists cannot even begin to comprehend. Despite the long descriptive passages and occasional denseness of Bowles' prose, I found the novel a mesmerising read. It is a clearly a literary landmark and one that deserves to be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Kit and her husband Port Moresby (sic) have turned their backs on the futility of an idle New York life to embark on a journey without an end in North Africa, still French-owned at the time this is set. The couple is troubled, and finding an aim amid the sandy waste is also expected to solve their sexual problems. But what can be expected from a journey to nowhere, except that it should lead into the void?Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky differs in all respects from the movie. Bowles's Sahara isn't that of Bertolucci's technicolor photo; it is cruel, unforgiving, dirty; it is full of flies, of petty colonial officials and impenetrable locals, a stark and treacherous place. Port and Kit aren't a romantic and courageous couple, at least not initially, more a spoilt pair, self-centred, sometimes mean. Kit only comes into her own later, and Port never does, though the typhoid scene is beautifully written (the same in the movie must be Malkovich's worst piece of acting).Indeed, that's just the thing: Bowles's novel is convincing; it feels real. At the same time, this is a philosophical as well as a psychological piece. Two characters search for meaning in a vast, bleak, empty landscape where they can only hope to get lost; life's quest must end in death, and all meaning can only be incidental, such as the devotion to Port Kit rediscovers in herself when it is too late. The strength of The Sheltering Sky is that it does not lecture, however; it is never blatant or pompous. Only the ending is dubious; here the philosophical point takes over, perhaps, at the expense of psychological likelihood. Bowles himself is supposed to have declared later, in an interview, that it was \`idiotic'. More equivoque and provocation? You will have to judge for yourself."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I first read \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" years ago, and was shocked and mesmerized by the beautiful, languid prose. Bowles insights into human psychology are almost peerless. The only two writers I can think of who are his equal are Rachel Ingalls and Patricia Highsmith. The book is not an easy one--people are petty or indifferent or merely desperate, and Nature is huge and impersonal. I admire Bowles' work enormously, and \\"The Sheltering Sky,\\" is his best. Absolutely one of the greatest novels I have ever had the privilege of reading."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"THE SHELTERING SKY invites you to drown yourself much like good music...a blissful suicide. If you romanticize &quot;the abyss&quot; and get a kick out of the dissolution of the ego, then do not hesitate to read this novel. And to maximize the experience, choose an appropriate setting: an empty beach, maybe some secluded spot in Montana, the desert (of course)...anywhere vast will do so that when you look up from the page, your head full, the environment surrounding you will swallow your state of mind and throw you for a whirl. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I disliked the characters so much that at one point I wanted them to all die. Nothing really happens in the story.

It's a rare book that can do that."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"I read \\"Sheltering Sky\\" after seeing the movie by Bernardo Bertolucci. Usually I see a film AFTER reading the book, but this film, in a Bertolucci retrospective, was intriguing and left me with many questions about the characters that I thought might be resolved in the novel. The novel was unfulfilling in terms of understanding the main character's motivations, particularly those of Kit and Porte. Nonetheless, the first half of the book, set in North Africa, probably Algeria, was compelling. However, in my opinion \\"Sheltering Sky\\" deteriorated as the story focuses on Kit. Without giving the plot away, I'll say only that her behavior turns incomprehensible and disturbing. Sheltering Sky unexpectedly degenerates into a kind of gothic novel -- which is not the genre I wanted to read."},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"Purchased the book for Literature class...

It has all the things the other reviewers suggest--Bowles captures vividly the ultimate strangeness of a culture so different that one might as well be on another planet. The descriptions of the dark streets, the monochromatic beige--grey--white of the desert and cities, the filth and poverty, the sand--all perfectly drawn. The author's picture of a terrible death from the point of view of the person experiencing it was truly frightening--he depicts death as an experience of the mind rather than the body. The section depicting life inside the home of the Arab who takes Kit across the desert was intriguing. But ultimately I was frustrated by the characters--I suspect this all has to do with the postwar existentialist view of the world. I closed this book with far too many unanswered questions--why are these people in North Africa to begin with? Money seems to be no object--why aren't they being driven around in a Mercedes? Port and Kit are estranged but each longs to make a connection with the other, and they subconsciously conspire to dump Tunner sothey can be alone. But we have no idea how they came to be this way--although their inability to reach out to each other is real enough. Who is Tunner anyway? These characters seem to deliberately create a hell for themselves in order to reinforce the view that life is meaningless, we are all alone in the end, etc., etc. This is not a funny book, but after arriving at a hotel strewn with garbage and diseased babies (lying on the garbage pile no less!), finding vermin in the beds, and eating soup laden with weevils and a disgusting stew with pieces of fur floating in it, Kit exclaims &quot;I wish we had gone to Italy!&quot;--I had to laugh!"},{"Title":"The sheltering sky","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lines on the Land: Writers, Art, and the National Parks (Under the Sign of Nature)","review":"Herring's book is in inquisitive and thorough examination of the literature regarding America's national parks. His work analyzes the literature of writers who saw the good, the bad, and the ugly concerning national parks. While some writers saw parks as a necessity, others saw them as something to be feared and loathed. What was to initially preserve and inspire became nothing more than Disneyland.In speaking with the author, who taught a few classes I took, he told me that this work would normally be reviewed in literary journals and digests, not in commercial circles, which is understandable. Works about literature have a far more limited readership range than literature itself. But hey, I purchased the book immediately when it was released and after reading it, thought I would provide my $0.02. I was curious to see his work. He spoke about Yellowstone on occasion, and had an interesting approach to teaching-- making pop culture references to literature and so forth.

The author is a Jungian therapist: he is not dogmatic in the least, though he obviously endorses the Jungian agenda. At this point I cannot embrace the Jungian project, since to do so would require more readings and more research into this psychoanalytical school. I am both fascinated and repelled by some concepts found in the book. For instance, I recoil from what Jung called the \\"active imagination\\" (see the Appendix at the end of the book), namely addressing with words or in writing one's anima. I also am not comfortable with Jung's opposition to what he called the \\"monotheism of consciousness,\\" (a better term would have been \\"monism of consciousness\\") namely the idea that there are several autonomous centers of consciousness in one's personality. However, I do not have problems with the idea promoted throughout the book, namely the importance and value of the unification of one's personality by developing BOTH animus and anima (masculine and feminine elements). Even though I am still more interested in Julius Evola's (\\"The Metaphysics of Sex\\") insight that a man should strive to promote one's masculinity and a woman her femininity, I will timidly try not to neglect my anima, since I intuitively (there I go!) agree with the author's caveat that to do so invites complications in one's inner life.All in all the book offers plenty of food for thought! Also, I did end up ordering a book recommended by the author, \\"The Symbolic Quest\\" in an attempt to further my understanding of my inner life."},{"Title":"The Invisible Partners: How the Male and Female in Each of Us Affects Our Relationships","review":"This book primarily addresses the Jungian concept of the contra-sexual in which men have a feminine archetype (called the anima) in their psyches, and women have a corresponding masculine archetype (called the animus) in their psyches. These unconscious forces have profound effects upon our lives, especially upon our relationships with persons of the opposite sex. This short book, while written some time ago, is still applicable today. It covers a lot of ground in a short space so it can be a bit difficult or even dense in places, especially if the reader is not intimate with Jungian psychology. Nevertheless, the concepts (or model, if you will) are valuable and useful in everyday life-not just with romantic relationships, but also with interpersonal communications and understanding.In order to get the most out of this book, it is necessary to keep an open mind. This can be challenging; as stated on page 9: \\"Even the most elemental knowledge of oneself is something that most people resist with the greatest determination. Usually it is only when we are in a state of great pain or confusion, and only self-knowledge offers a way out, that we are willing to risk our cherished ideas of what we are like in a confrontation with the truth, and even then many people prefer to live a meaningless life rather than to go through the often disagreeable process of coming to know themselves.\\"Thus, recognition of animus/anima interplay can result in \\"being in love\\" which we resist analyzing and bringing into the everyday world. From pages 18-19: \\"Relationship founded exclusively on the being-in-love state can never last...being in love is a matter for the gods, not for human beings...it can endure only in a fantasy world where the relationship is not tested in the everyday stress of real life...To the extent that a relationship is founded on projection, the element of human love is lacking. To be in love with someone we do not know as a person, but are attracted to because they reflect back to us the image of the god or goddess in our soul, is in a sense, to be in love with oneself not with the other person...Real love begins only when one person comes to know another for who he or she really is as a human being, and begins to like and care for that human being.\\"Projection is not, however, a totally negative process because per page 20: \\"Each time projection occurs there is another opportunity for us to know our inner Invisible Partners, and that is a way of knowing our own souls.\\" Thus, for example, on pages 53-4: \\"In learning to relate to a woman, a man also has to come to terms with the little boy in himself...We have no free choice unless we are psychologically conscious persons,\\" and on page 55: \\"Of the choices every man and woman makes of his or her partner in life; in some way the partner represents something we need to understand about ourselves.\\"But it's not a bowl of roses either because per page. 83: \\"Projections can never be withdrawn completely, for they are out of our conscious control; nor can we ever become so conscious of the inner images of the anima and animus that projections do not occur. Withdrawing projections does not mean that they no longer occur, but that we understand them as images within ourselves when they do.\\" But, (page 124) \\"We get well in direct proportion to the energy we put into our psychological development.\\"For additional reading on unconscious forces, see: George Weinberg \\"Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear that Drives Them\\" Plume NY 1993 and Loren E.

And a wonderful outline of a positive and workable approach to dealing with projections and what their purpose is (in a nutshell, first to break through the barrier that exists between to people and secondly and more often than not just a way of your unconscious to tell you what you have to work on with yourself {if you have strong bigger-than-life-women projections --&gt; get in touch with your inner female/emotions.

It is dense in places, and required a second read of parts of chapter 2.It's interesting how important turning points in life can be traced back to seemingly inconsequential encounters. I dated a girl just once, and we never saw each other again. While we were discussing self-help books that had been important to us, she mentioned The Invisible Partners. Later I ordered the book from Amazon and it proved to be revolutionary. Finally, I have answers. I understand why/how I'd experienced certain disorienting emotional phenomena since I was a young man. And now I have ways to &quot;right myself&quot;. The answers and tools didn't come directly from the text, but indirectly from doing the work suggested in the appendix. (I think the appendix is worth the price of the book.)If you're open to Jungian thought and have found therapy helpful but maybe unable to answer some key questions, do yourself a favor and read The Invisible Partners.

I consider Jungian psychology an area of strong interest and I have read many books in this genre. Many of them are listed among my other reviews or listmania lists.This specific author has a unique gift for presenting Jungian ideas and making them applicable to real life. He does not say too much... and he also doesn't cheat the reader on depth. In addition, he has a gift for explaining sometimes difficult concepts in very simple language. For me, this was a two sitting book and I couldn't put it down.With respect to content, many reviewers have covered Jung's notion of the inner feminine in a male and inner masculine in a female. What the other does with this notion is demonstrate how these contrasexual images get projected or acted out in relationship. This is unconscious, but being aware of what's happening, why it's happening and how it all ties together is curative.If you look at relationship through the lens of this book, you will understand how in any relationship their is really an anima to animus, an ego to animus, an ego to anima and an ego to ego dynamic. Being aware of these additional layers helps one avoid many pitfalls.For example, many men have a mother-complex that they are trying to overcome. This theme occurs in many myths and fairy tales in the form of slaying the dragon. The whole notion here is that to have the maiden (embrace the anima/interior feminine) one must first differentiate from the mother complex (dragon). In short, a male must embrace his feminine side and make it conscious before he can relate to a woman as a human being rather than as a carrier of a projection. A similar dynamic occurs in females and that is what this book is all about.I unreservedly recommend this book to laymen, psychologists and therapists. It is very complimentary to the other self-help literature and extremely practical. I also recommendA General Theory of LoveandJung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction. The latter of these two books is the Cliff's Notes of Jung's concepts explained simply from an extremely credible source. If you get Intimate Partners, I urge you to pick this book up as well. It will serve to deepen your relationship inquiry and make Intimate Partners more meaningful."},{"Title":"The Invisible Partners: How the Male and Female in Each of Us Affects Our Relationships","review":"Excellent explanation of Jung's ideas about the \\"anima\\" and \\"animus\\".

This is quite possibly the most frightful, troubling and dreaded word in our language. And for good cause. Cancer kills and maims and, truth be known, the current, \\"accepted\\" reatments---chemo and radiation--- haven't done much for survival.The Cancer Handbook: What's Really Working discusses the possible causes of cancer: family history, contraceptives, environment, drugs, stress and nutrition. We then learn about the current detection methods. Ms. McTaggart offers us enlightenment in today's conventional treatments--- chemo, radiation, light therapy, immunotherapy and, of course, surgery...all of which have had extremely limited success in offering a cure.The vital point that The Cancer Handbook makes is that there are alternative cancer treatments available to us IF the orthodox medical community would be willing to try them. \\"Despite this climate of suppression, a number of alternative treatments have been the subject of some properly designed laboratory and clinical research. Although all would benefit from further study, they certainly appear more promising than most of the tools of orthodox medicine\\".Doesn't it make sense to strengthen our own immunity and therefore our ability to destroy cancer cells, instead of using invasive chemo, radiation and surgery? How this can be accomplished is detailed in The Cancer Handbook. This eye-opener offers valuable, indeed lifesaving information about therapies like immuno-augmentative, peptide, Govallo, Gerson, Coley's, Kelley's, and macrobiotics, as well as diet and upplements.This reviewer has lost both parents and a daughter to the scourge called cancer. So, when I learned about The Cancer Handbook, I jumped at the opportunity to make you aware of these alternatives. Lynne McTaggart has done us all a great service by increasing our chances to live longer and healthier lives!"},{"Title":"The Cancer Handbook : What's","review":"Lynne McTaggart is one of my favorite medical writers ever since I read her excellent book \\"What Doctors Don't Tell You.\\" This book is equally good, and even more interesting given its narrower focus on the word we all dread: cancer.Invariably, her books trigger very strong reactions among reviewers. Some of those are negative. They treat her of being hysterical relying on flawed sources. But, this is not so. Just about every single statement she makes is supported by studies from leading medical journals such as The Lancet, American Journal of Epidemiology, International Journal of Cancer, and many others.This book conveys facts ignored by conventional medicine. Cancer screening does not work because it is inaccurate as it generates many false positives. Mammography and PSA testing are case in point. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are dreadful treatments as the cure is often worse than the disease. Surgery has a mixed record. In some cases, it is necessary but in many it turns out harmful as it causes an in situ cancer to spread. There are many non-invasive alternative treatments with higher success rates and no side effects.Near the end, she gives you a practical check sheet on how to prevent or treat cancer. And, also in the last pages she gives you the necessary contacts to follow through if you care to further research or implement certain alternative therapies. For my part, I feel the author fully delivered on the expectation the title of her book conveyed to readers."},{"Title":"The Cancer Handbook : What's","review":"Her skepticism on what is not working is right on, but it's nonsense to add \\"what doctors don't tell you\\" to the title.

I bought it thinking it would have beneficial alternatives to radiation therapy, and chemo, which it borders on, but the author is so hysterical in her findings and beliefs, that her &quot;facts&quot; seem unrealistic. It's almost as if she pulled every &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;statistic&quot; from the JAMA, more like from one article, and rewrote it in her own freaked out voice. I suffer from sarcoma (soft tissue cancer) and this book is not very calming...it's insane. Eat right, take care of yourself, and get second and third opinions...end of story, no need for theatrics or books bordering upon medical conspiracy theories..boooooo. I want my money back. This book wasn't worth the paper it was printed on."},{"Title":"The Pill Book, Twelfth Edition","review":"An awsome book to have to know what kinds of meds that you're on and what kind of uses it's for"},{"Title":"States of Injury","review":"In the first half of States of Injury, Wendy Brown's critique of traditional feminism and more broadly identity politics as a whole was based upon the principle that the \\"I am\\" clause used by many marginalized groups should be avoided because of its universalizing and finalizing nature. In its place, such groups should focus on the \\"What I want for us\\" clause, because of its potential fluidity and room for political action. In the second half of the book, Brown addresses, among other things, the question of what should be desired from a gendered postmodern perspective.Brown's scathing critique of classical liberalism begins to take shape as she attacks the litigious nature of modern state politics, and more specifically, she builds her case against a rights-based discourse for feminism. Rights require cultural and historical context, and without those important brushstrokes, their picture cannot be painted because of their amorphous or perhaps even polymorphous nature. Brown insists that rights must not be confused with equality and that they \\"are more likely to become sites of the production of identity as injury than vehicles of emancipation\\" (Brown 1995, 134). Rights then should be avoided as a political goal, but they should not be avoided altogether. Rights may well serve as a means to an end, their usefulness should not be overlooked as a step in realizing larger goals, but once again, Brown has demonstrated that focusing on rights, like focusing on identity, is a finalizing process; a rights discourse ends the conversation. What happens once rights are granted? If a woman's rights are violated it is then up to the state to uphold those rights as they have been written into law. Protection is then institutionalized, creating a female dependence on state power. There is no discussion of transcending the existing patterns of male dominance within the masculinist state because women have been granted equality under law. The liberal philosophy of writing rights into law thus entrenches and subjugates women into the existing systems of traditional subordination, allowing no real way out of the cycle of dependency, protection and regulation. As much as I was hoping for Brown to articulate some sort of policy prescriptions, or a potential way out of this structure of dominance, I did not see it. Brown herself admits that the final essay develops more than answers the questions that she raises and \\"it does not build toward policy recommendations or a specified political program\\" (173). If rights must be seen as a means and not an end, what is the end? It seems that Brown's critical analysis is arguing for a radical transformation or complete transcension of the late modern political structures found in the liberal state. Is the best hope for feminism to be found in the private sphere, away from the state? What is the way out for Brown's structural-historical analysis of feminine subordination? Is her answer to be found in the last sentence of the book? Here she suggests that \\"feminists can both exploit and subvert, but only by deeply comprehending in order to strategically outmaneuver its contemporary masculinist ruses\\" (196). It is great to understand, and it may be the first step to political action, but comprehending is not action in itself."},{"Title":"States of Injury","review":"This book looks at how gender and the political theories of our time (liberalism, theories of the state, Foucault, etc.) intersect. I have only read three of the chapters so far, which are self-contained, and I enjoyed them very much. Brown's response to Catherine MacKinnon is especially well-argued and helpful: she draws out how Marxism influences MacKinnon's thought, and then shows how Mackinnon's thought demonstrates the extent to which freedom for women can be incompatible with freedom in general. The prose could be better."},{"Title":"Affect Regulation, Mentalization, and the Development of Self","review":"Fonagy, et al present a thorough and careful reconsideration of the nature and etiology of psychological symptoms and syndromes.

Also, I know who \\"Sarge\\" is and also the woman who is the star in the pornographic film. I found it incomprehensible why a writer would do this.

And the nostaliga that I feel when I go back home is just as strong.

As an ex-patriate of Shamokin I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read. The people and places ring true and the fictional storyline of drugs and corruption provides some real excitement.Anyone who has grown up in a small town with ethnic communities will &quot;get&quot; this book. It's characters are universal. I've had the pleasure of meeting Jim(and his lovely wife Marie). Proving it's a small world we have both landed in Atlanta GA and live just a few miles from each other.

Likewise his book which, although it takes place in the fictional town of Lenape, is really about Shamokin, where I have lived for the past 27 years. It is quite well written, and a great part of the fun for me was trying to decipher the people and places he disguises. Most of the places were fairly simple, and I was even able to puzzle out a few of the characters, although their fictional personas are not necessarily those of them in reality. As a lawyer, I laughed out loud at the characterization of Myron, who is a gentleman I know quite well, and who is nothing, except in honesty, like his character. Thankfully, the drug and porno problems in Lenape that fuel the plot are absent from Shamokin, but the author needed something upon which to hang his story. He is also well read, I suspect, for like John O'Hara before him, he disguises the town of Pottsville as \\"Gibbsville\\". I look forward to reading further works by this new and talented writer, and I hope they will include more stories from the Coal Regions."},{"Title":"Coal Cracker Blues","review":"DRAGNET... four stars...........That was my impression after a couple chapters. Old Steve Zajac ( how much more ethnic can you get ) laments over what has happened to his old town.

A sadness, much like Zajac's dying mother in Intensive Care.... Just get it over with...

Puerile sentence structure, one-dimensional characters, and perhaps the most inane dialogue I've had the misfortune of forcing myself to digest are among this novel's glaring weaknesses.However, my chief complaint is his attitude toward the Coal Region. My mother, her parents, and almost all of her family are from Shamokin (or its neighbor, Kulpmont), and I spent many a weekend on Montgomery Street visiting with them. Of course the area is poor; it's true of any area that once produced coal. And, contrary to the rather naive comment made by Mr. Konopka (see his reivew), Shamokin is indeed riddled with urban decay, violence, and drug abuse (the latter is truthfully nothing short of an epidemic). However, the author's denigrating his roots with aspersions cast on those who chose to remain in Northumberland County and whining about the golden days of yesteryear are hardly appreciated by this reader.You're an old man, Mr. Stevens, and things change. Get over it.And if you're so disgusted by what's become of the Region, stay out of it."},{"Title":"Coal Cracker Blues","review":"I believe anyone who lived in a small town in the Eastern United States during the 1950's will be able to identify with this nostalgic, bitter-sweet journey. It is told in the form of a mystery that unlocks a yearning for an innocent time when Rock and Roll was naughty and swimming nude in the juggy hole was quite daring and it reveals a present which makes one shudder. It has a universality that transcends the Coal Regions, but if are lucky enough to be from the strong stock this region produced, you will identify with the story even more. Above all, I liked the flow of the narrative and the sharp dialogue that kept the story moving between past and present. It is a page turner and it is not boring. I liked the bits of nostalgia, especially the description of the cars in the 50's. I would have liked to see more subtle treatments to underscore negative aspects of his characters and of the town, but I think the gift of subtely will come as Stevens matures as a novelist. If he sticks to the themes of the joys and sorrows of small-town life, he may well be our next John O'Hara. ..."},{"Title":"Coal Cracker Blues","review":"Bravo!

However, after only a few pages, I realized that the author was not celebrating the traditions of a small town but denigrating those who chose to continue to live there.According to the author, apparently there are no people still living in the town under the age of sixty-five that have any redeeming qualities. We are all portrayed as having no interests other than quzzling huge quantities of beer, eating fattening foods and playing bingo. No mention is made of the close ties between family and friends. Comments are continually made implying that earning large amounts of money is the only thing that matters when measuring a person's success.Due to the lack of industry, many people have been forced to leave the area. The town has unfortunately decayed and faces its share of problems. However, the main premise of this book appears to be to downgrade the town and the people who stayed.

I found myself drifting back in time to a more simpler but harder life that our grandparents lived. As immigrants they had limited job opportunities and survived based upon a value system of hard work, and no nonsense. Women served one purpose to keep their men happy and the coal crackers found solace in their beer and whiskey.What they produced were young men and women that hoped for a better life and were raised with a value system of working hard and respecting others.Steve Zajac's family lived a hard life (comapred to today's standards) but one that was rich with wonderful childhood experiences. The simple act of having a meaningful converstaion with his father while sorting through coal was very poignant. How many of today's parents that have much greater wealth really talk to their kids?Steve's doggedness to uncover the truth about his friends deaths drew upon his value system of pursuing justice at any cost. In a small town you tend to make friends for life versus the suburbs of Atlanta where wealth and prestige are the monikers of success.I found myself both crying and laughing at various points throughout the story. Mr. Stevens has a wondferful gift of keeping the reader engaged as you look forward to turning the next page.

The author's profound understanding of the child's unspoiled imagination shines through these collected reflections on the art of inventing stories. The book includes dozens of exercises designed to inspire the creation of stories and, ultimately, to foster a love for language and storytelling. Rodari shows teachers how to stir young imaginations by building on simple words, phrases, and rhymes; juxtaposing seemingly unrelated words and images; creating &quot;what if&quot; scenarios; rewriting popular folk tales; speculating on &quot;what happens next&quot;; using toys and puppets as props; drawing comic books; and so on. Analyzing the essential nature of stories, jokes, riddles, and poetry, Rodari delves deep into the mysterious heart of the creative process and vividly illuminates it for the reader. This book is a must-read for teachers of literature and for anyone who has ever marveled at the art of the storyteller."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Fantasy: An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories","review":"I wish every teacher would try to exercise their imagination and art of fantasy.

Like all great works of philosophy, it is as relevant today as it has ever been, as it transcends space and time. Don't let the abolitionist nature mislead you: this book is not merely about abolition and slavery. Rather, it is about Man Against the State, individuality, and Thoreau's philosophy of how one man can stand up to government and society, driven by his own convictions of right and wrong, as summarized by the timeless quote \\"Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already\\".Thoreau's main point is that the best - and many times, the only - method for fighting injustice is through passive disobedience. By refusing to cooperate with the machinery of injustice, the individual can become the friction that stops the machine. Active resistance is bound for failure, as the machine (the State, society, etc.) is too formidable for the individual to fight. But, by refusing to cooperate, justice can be achieved and injustice toppled.If you are looking for a marvelous primer on individuality and the fight for justice, start with this book."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"In \\"Civil Disobedience\\" Thoreau presents political theories in which he dissects democracy and the interaction between citizens and their government.Understandably, Thoreau was deeply concerned about injustices he witnessed during his life, such as enslavement of one sixth of the population and the invasion of Mexico by the United States.Thoreau does not oppose the institution of government; he believes that when a government becomes \\"abused and perverted\\", it ceases to represent the will of the people. When a government makes decisions that promulgate harm and injustice, it is the duty of its citizens to rebel and break those chains of injustices.Arguably, the strongest idea Thoreau presents, is the notion of individualism. Thoreau encourages skepticism of the government and rejects blind loyalty to it. Thoreau perceives citizens, who give blind loyalty to their government's decisions without questioning them, as participants in every injustice committed by that government. Whether this point of view is correct or not, it is worth debating, especially in view of the horrific injustices that are extant in today's world and the way the masses so easily accept them without considering the negative impact on others."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"This is a thoroughly American view on political theory given the emphasis on the individual coupled with the call for civil disobedience.

Today's bloated government would literally drive him mad. I've also read \\"Walden\\" and it expresses similar sentiments.This short pamphlet should be read by everyone.

It's well known to liberals but not well read. It is worth the reading and would likely surprise liberals and non-liberals alike - as it did me. Sure, it's anti-war and anti-slavery, but it's also a lot more. The confused hodgepodge of modern isms that dominate current political thought could use the purity, consistency, and clarity that were second nature to thinkers nearer the American Revolution.Consider, for example, Thoreau's political philosophy:\\"I heartily accept the motto, - \\"That government is best which governs least;\\" and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.\\"Or his take on government aid to societal improvement:\\"Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of the way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way.\\"Thoreau on economic policy:\\"Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India-rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way.\\"1848 was also the year of another seminal work, the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Where Thoreau looked back to the 18th century, Marx looked forward to the 20th . Where Thoreau recognized that the power of the state will not easily be compartmentalized, that power to do one thing will infect all things, Marx looked to the state to solve every problem. Where Thoreau knew that state power does not peacefully or voluntarily diminish, Marx justified his appeal for total state power - the dictatorship of the proletariat - with the nave expectation that government would dissolve away into a stateless utopian paradise.Thoreau, I expect, would have no trouble explaining why Americans who protest wars but advocate government intervention in the economy, get wars; or why Americans who advocate nonintervention in the economy, small taxes, and small government but support a worldwide military presence, get controlled markets, high taxes, and large government.It has been pointed out that the structural deficits which have finally brought U.S. governmental finances to the point of crisis, got their start in the Vietnam War and Great Society. Us moderns tend to blame/praise conservatives for the wars and liberals for the social programs, but Thoreau knew wars and social programs are joined at the hip. We can have both or neither but not one or the other. Conservatives and liberals share equal responsibility. Civil Disobedience points to the solution."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"I give it 5 stars because Civil Disobedience is a masterful bit of writing.

But, of course, we SHOULD discuss about State's authority, as well its limits...Thoreau's own natural life was his inspiration, and (as we can see in his texts) he loved nature, and he spent a lot of time of his life around it.

So keep in mind that this was written in the mid 19th century, still years before the emancipation proclamation, a very young nation still. Having said that, let us take a quick look at some of Thoreau's ideas. Most of his relevant subject matter was in regards to slavery, the war in Mexico, and American Imperialism in general. Thoreau felt a moral obligation to stop such things which he deemed unworthy, and being a citizen he felt it was his duty to make a stand in the name of all citizens. The idea was that if you were a just citizen being controlled by an unjust government, then it would be better to go to jail than to pay that government taxes, which it would in turn use to kill people in Mexico or support slavery with. He knew that a single man would not bring much change and it certainly seems that his broader goal was to influence, with his writings and speeches, others to do the same as him, with enough people resisting, the government would lose strength. And as he famously wrote, \\"That government is best which governs least.\\".In retrospect I think his ideas might have been too aggressive for a nation such as ours. He seems to always be looking for a path to revolution instead of putting trust in evolution. The republic did free the slaves a few years after he wrote this paper, and it was of course the very government which he distrusted that made that happen. I could see his ideas being quite effective in certain situations and in certain locations, but not so much in America. I feel pretty strongly that we eventually get things right here. There's no doubt that we often make many wrong choices along the way, but with the living Constitution under us and a Democratic representation, I feel that the need for Civil Disobedience as a tool has not and is still not the best strategy for change in our nation... It is instead, to simply vote."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Thoreau's writing on \\"Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" is brilliant!

His focus is on the primacy of the individual - and he disagrees that the individual should \\"serve\\" the State, especially when the state is unjust.Some of his memorable quotes include:-- The mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.-- (The state) is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced.-- When I meet a government which says to me, \\"Your money or your life,\\" why should I be in haste to give it my money?Ironic as it seems, what was written by Thoreau about the Congress in 1849 is still true today:\\"Our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free trade and of freed, of union, and of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and manufactures and agriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank among the nations.\\"Thoreau concludes that \\"there will never be a free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.\\"This could serve as a primer for the Tea Party Movement!Dr. B Leland Baker, author of Tea Party Revival, The Conscience of a Conservative RebornTea Party Revival - The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Henry David Thoreau, &lt;strong>Civil Disobedience&lt;/strong> (CreateSpace, 1849)I have put off releasing my best reads of 2011 list for all these months because I still haven't quite figured out how to review &lt;em>Civil Disobedience&lt;/em>, which is #3 on it. You see, the problem is I've always kind of hated Thoreau, who is widely held responsible for the foundation of the modern ecological movement (I'm a diehard pave-the-earth guy and have been for decades). Because of that, I spent my reading time avoiding the guy, but when I picked up a Kobo, with its 100 pre-loaded classic titles, I figured I'd start working my way through them. And thus I found myself reading &lt;em>Civil Disobedience&lt;/em>, since it seemed like it would be preferable to &lt;em>Walden&lt;/em>. My jaw hit the floor with the very first sentence, which contains one of my favorite quotes (\\"I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.\\"), and I kept being stunned as I kept reading. This is fantastic stuff. No wonder it's considered dangerous (Joseph McCarty proposed banning it, and even the study aid SparkNotes mentions that Thoreau's ideas would be \\"dangerous if universalized\\").It's also even more relevant today than it was smack in the middle of the nineteenth century. \\"All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or inefficiency are great and unendurable.\\" Indeed, during the early years of America, all men &lt;em>did&lt;/em>; it is, in fact, one of the founding principles of the United States. But I'd be willing to bet that if you showed that quote, stripped of its attribution, to a hundred random Americans, more than half would disagree with it. (Show it to a hundred random elected officials and you might find yourself in jail.) This is one of those books, along with John Stuart Mill's &lt;em>On Liberty&lt;/em> (also considered dangerous by the right; it made Human Events' list of the top ten most harmful books of the past two centuries), that needs to be read by every American, so that we can understand where we come from--and how many of those who try to tell us these days where they think we come from lie, lie, and lie some more. After all, as Thoreau himself tells us, \\"No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America.\\" (I would quibble with the word \\"appeared\\", since we did at one point host Alexis de Tocqueville...)And when you're ready to dismiss all this and blunder and nonsense and go back to thinking that there's really a difference in America's two ruling parties, remember once again that it has traditionally been the &lt;em>right&lt;/em> (or those who call themselves that) who have attacked this book, and then read this lovely passage:\\"There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, form which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State at last which can afford to be just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor....A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious State, which I have also imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.\\"That's &lt;em>true&lt;/em> right-wing thinking there, kids. (And note that Thoreau's \\"more perfect and glorious State\\" is peaceful anarchy, which is the end product of both post-State socialism and post-State libertarianism--mention THAT fact to a neocon and watch his head explode!) But the way the current \\"right\\" attacks it, I can't imagine most liberals would have a problem with it, either. In other words, it doesn't matter who you are. Read this. You may hate it, you may love it, but you will come away from it with a better understanding of how things have changed in this country in the past 150 years, and how terrifying those changes are, and that cannot be a bad thing. *****"},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"Civil Disobedience....A short book I found interesting only because I wanted to know what people thought before my time.

Even more remarkably, it is undeniable proof that great literature can have a real effect on the world even long after it is written and ignored. The essay is world famous as the founding text of civil disobedience, i.e., non-violent protest, and its effect on such luminaries as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King was profound, thus sealing its immortality. This alone makes it essential for all.However, it is easy to forget that the essay is a masterpiece in itself. Essentially Thoreau's highly individual expression of his mentor Emerson's self-reliance doctrine applied to government, it has a wealth of depth and nuance despite its brevity. The words are few but the implications endless; it has enough food for proverbial thought to last a lifetime. The gist is very clear, but the implications have spoken very differently to many different people. The work's nature - and Thoreau's generally - is such that it and he are championed by everyone from neocons to libertarians to liberals, and the truly notable thing is that all are justified. This underscores the importance of reading the essay for ourselves.Its main query is \\"What does the individual owe the state?,\\" the answer being a resounding \\"Nothing.\\" Thoreau takes the maxim that the government that governs least governs best to its logical conclusion by wishing for one that governs not at all - a brave wish very few have seriously dared to make or even conceive. He makes a highly principled stand for individual rights and autonomy, arguing very persuasively that people should be able to go about their business without interference. This of course sounds very much like current libertarians, and their position has indeed hardly ever been better argued. Many related and implied issues - protests against taxation, conscription, etc. - also seem to support them. However, it is important to remember that the essay's crux and most famous section - Thoreau's account of a night spent in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because he did not want to support war or slavery - was and is immensely liberal. Few issues can be more central to current liberalism than an anti-war stance, and slavery was the era's great liberal cause. All this must be kept firmly in mind amid the many attempts to reduce Thoreau to a current party platform. He was at once too simple and too complex for this and would not have suffered himself to be thus reduced; nor does the essay justify it.Integral as all this is, the work's core point is arguably a new self-reliance argument above and beyond immediate practical considerations. Thoreau certainly had a practical, political streak, especially compared to relative idealists like Emerson, but he thought individuality more sacred than anything. He articulated this more fully elsewhere, but it is very present here. His work is thus in many ways the best kind of self-help material - and, unlike the mass of current self-help tripe littering bookshelves, is intellectually and even aesthetically pleasing. Thoreau was the most thoroughly local writer that can be imagined, but his willingness to look deep inside himself for the eternal truths present in all people has made him an inspiration to millions and millions of people from across the political spectrum and indeed the world. This essay is a major part of his legacy and thus one of the very few works that literally everyone should read. Few can be the same afterward, and it will change many lives; it is nothing less than one of the most important documents ever written, and its value simply cannot be exaggerated. It is an excellent primer for those new to Thoreau, and those who have not already done so should open their minds to him immediately - and once done, they will never be closed again."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"This book is just as good and relevent today as it was when it was published.

They should certainly be teaching this in high school civics classes (as soon as they restore the practice of teaching civics in public school.)Thoreau wrote this in opposition to slavery and the Mexican War but it is full of parallels and lessons for us today. Most especially useful and relevant is his tracing of the responsibility, that those who vote, share for the atrocities committed by those they vote for.If you vote in a corrupt society, Thoreau makes you a murderer, a rapist, a thief. I could not agree more and was happy to find this herein. He does not simply advocate a boycotting of the vote, however, but calls for the revolutionary overthrow of corrupt society, through the direct action and resistance of those who are just.There is no \\"lesser evil\\" or middle ground in Thoreau's worldview. You are just, and you are actively working to overthrow the system, or you are evil.I cannot recommend this book enough.

Amazon's electronic transmission is instant!"},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"In Civil Disobedience, first published in 1849, Henry David Thoreau asserts that when a government acts in a way contrary to the conscience of one of its individual subjects, that individual has a duty to deny any allegiance to that government by ceasing to pay taxes and refusing to obey unjust laws. While Thoreau was focused on the issues of slavery and the Mexican-American War, much of the rhetoric in Civil Disobedience is broad enough that it can be used as an inspirational rallying cry for dissenters of every stripe, from anarchists to Tea Partiers. By today's standards, Thoreau's own political thought was a fiercely individualistic mix of liberalism and libertarianism. He was a staunch pacifist, anti-military, and critical of the judicial and penal systems, yet he was also against big government, trade regulation, and taxation. In Thoreau's view, all governments are inherently corrupt. Just because democracy is based on majority rule doesn't make it any less corrupt, because the approval of the majority is no guarantee of justice and right. Instead of waiting for their government to become just, citizens should behave justly, even if that means breaking the law.Civil Disobedience amounts to about thirty pages in printed form, and takes about an hour to read, depending on how much time you want to spend dissecting Thoreau's antiquated grammar and syntax. From the perspective of the language alone, this is a more difficult, less accessible read than his best-known work, Walden. More effort is required to decipher Thoreau's prose in order to extract the kernel of his message. The Kindle file that's available for free on Amazon was created by Project Gutenberg. The text was typed rather than scanned, but doesn't seem to have been proofread, as it still contains several typographical errors. The file includes only the text of Thoreau's essay, with no introduction or notes. In this case, notes can be helpful in clarifying some of Thoreau's historical references, so a well-edited paperback edition may provide a more helpful reading experience for first-time readers. For those familiar with Thoreau and this great work, however, a digital, highlightable copy makes for a welcome addition to your portable e-book library."},{"Title":"On the duty of civil disobedience","review":"This book is a classic.

I believe we as citizens should be given the choice of which taxes to support and which to not have to pay. Case in point I pay property taxes through the money that I give to my landlord for the schools in my area but yet I have no children those in a community should be given the option to say no to a portion of their property taxes if they do not have children in school and also those that chose to send their children to private school should be given the same option.

A perfect length, the introduction provides the kind of information that makes one eager to get to the stories, yet it is not so detailed that, as too often happens with the more long-winded variety, it is skipped. Don't skip it, for it serves as an important guide to the stories, noting Andersen's adult concerns and anxieties imbedded beneath the surface of the tales, which remain wonderful out-loud reading for small fry.The stories themselves are a revelation--dispelling the prejudices engendered by Danny Kaye and Disney. Stories taken for granted are new and impeccably rendered in this translation. (Even the notes are great--and should be read before the stories, filled as they are with fascinating information. Also, they're conveniently placed at the end of each story, yet the pages are not sullied by superscript numbers.)This is a perfect gift, but be sure to keep one for yourself."},{"Title":"The Stories of Hans Christian Andersen: A New Translation from the Danish","review":"Having recently visited Odense, Denmark, with a tour guide who is a true Andersen expert, I was eager to take her suggestion that I find a more authentic translation of Andersen's work than is generally available.

Andersen accurately, according to what I learned about him in Denmark, & the stories themselves are not \\"cleaned up\\" but are direct translations.

A number of other Pilates books for pregnancy do not focus on important aspects of abdominal muscle integrity and the effects of hormones like relaxin on your body during pregnancy and after delivery. The exercise focus during and immediately after pregnancy should be on proper breathing, aiding your posture and stability, rather than &quot;working out&quot;. This is a time to develop greater body awareness and breathing techniques, not to try for major fitness goals. Some Pilates exercises simply should not be pursued after the 20th week of pregnancy. Michael King's book will allow you to assess your pre-natal and post-partum condition and evaluate which exercises will be safe for you to perform, as well as beneficial for your body.

This book is excellent: well written, with many good photos accompanied by clear instruction. The exercises are modified for each of the 3 trimesters and for 3 levels of experience with Pilates, from beginner to experienced. There is a complete section on postnatal conditioning as well. There are sufficient exercises for a good program, neither too long nor too short. The exercises are designed with extensive consideration for avoiding long- and short-term pregnancy and postnatal damage. This book DOES lay flat and will be appreciated by those who don't always want to work out in front of a video or as a more complete adjunct to a video. I do not know, however, whether a beginner can learn Pilates only from a book, without the feedback from an instructor. Women should also not expect an aerobic workout from Pilates; instead, you will strengthen and condition your core more in the style of yoga, tai chi, or weight training."},{"Title":"Pilates Workbook for Pregnancy: Illustrated Step-by-Step Matwork Techniques","review":"This book is is wonderfully presented with great informations, but a can leave you a bit hungry.

We became transported backwards through time hundreds of years, straight into Martha (Patty) Jefferson's expert housewifery, motherhood---even boudoir---into her heart full of joys and misfortune. Thomas Jefferson's feminine &quot;other half&quot; makes it plainly clear to us how precious and pivotal was their mortal life behind the scenes.

Through Kelly's painstakingly detailed research, intuition, and clairvoyance, not to mention her memories of love for Thomas, she has retraced Martha's life, and earned the respect of her fellow Jefferson historians. Martha's life was not always joyful and she struggled with her health.

This is the book. William Clayton was a personal scribe to Joseph Smith. He was converted in England, sailed accross the Atlantic, and almost instantly became an insider, and confidant to Joseph Smith once he arrived in Nauvoo.He is very detailed in his journal, yet it almost reads like a story. The highlights include: Doing missionary work with some of the early church leaders including Brigham Young in England. His trip to America is tragic, with sickness and disease killing some of the passengers. The mormon voyagers join in \\"faith\\" with the belief they can \\"hold on\\" to those who are dying if they just can believe strong enough... they end up dissappointed. You get a real sense of the stength of their belief and the conviction of those willing to leave England for Zion. Upon arriving in Nauvoo he describes his conversations with Joseph Smith. He alludes to his early introduction to polygamy, when most in the church did not know it was being practiced. He marries a number of wives, and mentions many of Joseph's plural marraiges. The political issues facing the Saints are discussed, as well as the efforts to go West. He describes the sacrifice in preparing the Nauvoo temple, and has a month or more dedicated to describing the endowment of the Saints before leaving West. He gives a description of the organization of the pioneers when going west, and his own journey accross the plains. What I found very funny was the popularity of the mormon band as they travelled. Cities would pay the Mormon band (of which Clayton was a member) to play for them, and this helped fund the trip. I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to delve into the details of the early church practice and belief. What is so fun about history is seeing the world through someone else's eyes. His life was great and I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton","review":"Clayton was the Prophet's meticulous secretary and confidant. Reading this book has given me fresh new insight into the ingenious mind of Joseph Smith as well as to the very turbulent times of the Saints during the 1840's in Nauvoo. Furthermore, Clayton documents early missionary work in Lancashire, England and the difficult voyage across to America with newly converted Latter Day saint families. It's very interesting reading and surely an important reference book for any Mormon History scholar."},{"Title":"An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton","review":"This book is exactly what the title says, an intimate chronicle.

But this follow-up novel is plausible enough. The story behind the tapestries was interesting and I had not known how they were made--I'd thought that women wove them in palaces. Maybe they did, two or four hundred years earlier.Nicholas is the complete artist-as-rogue, who pays lip service to religion and bows to nobility because of its power. He's also a fairly heartless womanizer who deserves the beating he gets. But he still gets to have various women, and he is no respecter of what was so vital for a woman's social safety, her virginity. So he's a weird guy, a malcontent figure without a philosophy to back it up. He seems to live his life without a plan, too. He's completely the creature of impulse.I also have to question the amorality, the grasping sexuality, if you will, of the women. All of whom knew darn well that they should have nothing to do with Nicholas or with sex outside of marriage. But they did it--they even connived and risked to do it--anyway. Were women really like this? Claude only needed to wait until she married and bore a few children, and then she could have taken lovers. Her mother did not, but she could have. So, why the white-hot lust? It's hard to imagine that young girls feel it so strongly, because it is so easy to socialize and scare it right out of them. Also, the chaperonage was imperfect, which leaves one wondering, too. On the other hand, I'm probably being naive about teenage girls.This book was plausible, it was colorful, and it left me with a lot of questions."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"An interesting storyline about tapestries but not a book I feel compelled to own-- not a 'keeper' in my opinion, but certainly not a waste of time to have read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book -- didn't think it was nearly as good as Pearl Earring.

It is nothing but a cheap romance novel that tries to drag these fantastic pieces of art and symbolism down with it. If you are truly interested in the tapestries, read one of the marvelous interpretations of their possible meanings. Some interpretations are sexual, others religious, all better stories than this one. I wish I could erase her version of the story from my head.If Tracy Chevalier wants to write yet another story about an artist's seduction of a maid, perhaps she can stick with a minor work and not one so rich in meaning."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book was fantastic. I enjoyed every page. I was surprised to find that the book was believable! I found the characters to have been painted so vividly that you really feel a connection. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is rare to find a piece of historical fiction that is likeable to as large a group of readers as I feel this piece to be. It is perfect without dwelling too much on details like the time, geography, etc. This book is really a colorful telling of the tapestries and the story itself is almost as fascinating as the tapestries themselves!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I don't normally read books of this sort, but I thought I could try to get into it. This was a tedious book, predictable at every turn. After struggling to read the blahty blah and flowery wordiness, I got to one of the most disappointing endings. The author does use great imagery, but the characters are week and hold no power or connection with the reader. I was seriously disappointed, and unfortunately this experience will more than likely keep me away adventuring outside of my preferred genre. Sorry... two stars."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"What on earth did everyone else read?!?....this book isn't even worth 0.1 of a star. It's terrible! I'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel. I'm not really a fan of historical fiction, but it was given to me as a present so I felt I had to read it. The 'plot' is terrible. None of the characters have any depth or any real storyline.Our protagonist, if you can call him that; Nicolas, only has one trick up his sleeve to \\"plough\\" his girls...a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure. He then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12. There's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries...but I think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book. The story is complete nonsense and VERY poorly expressed and to be honest with you, I cannot believe it ever got published, let alone sold and read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I wouldn't say this was a horrible book. Actually, I couldn't really say much about this book because nothing really happened. Chevalier was clearly trying to show the political/anit-feminism/caste issues during the Renaissance and how they effected life therefore art. Unfortunately she did this using unimaginative characters and lackluster events.Overall, I've got to say I left this book learning nothing and really was disappointed that Chevalier didn't do more with such a broad subject. If you want to read a Tracy Chevalier book, I recommend picking up one of her others, which are all pretty good."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"If I were a fan of shoddily crafted pornos that one might find in the check-out line at CVS, I'd be pissed. ONE measly, grotesque sex scene? And, alright, he feels up a 14-year-old girl as well. How grossly unsatisfying. Having to read this schlock with a critical eye (it was a school assignment) was mildly entertaining, only because it might be one of the worst pieces of writing I have ever encountered. I was overjoyed that the book was a quick read; spending more than two days on this dreck is nothing short of masochistic. With every passing page, rife with overly simple language, inappropriate or anachronistic similes, and the same voice for every character, I found myself less and less engaged with the story. The depth of the characters and plot is that of a puddle. This book was so abysmal that during a trip to Paris soon after reading it, I refused to enter the Cluny, free of admission, to see the tapestries. It shames me to no end knowing that the author and I both grew up in the same place. Money spent on this novel could be put to better use by hurling it off a bridge."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I was thrilled to hear that Chevalier had written another book. I really enjoyed Pearl Earring, Falling Down and Virgin Blue. I was very disappointed with this story. It lacked plot and my honest opinion is that although the writing was exemplary, the story was not much different than a trashy romance novel - except that there was no romance at all really.... everything seemed motivated by lust, desire and conquest for Nicholas, the main character.As I examine all of Chevaliers books, (except Pearl Earring, which is probably the best book I have ever read), together, I am noticing a common theme - raw, selfish sex. There is a blandness and lack of theme to them. If I wanted to really expose myself to these themes, one needs only to turn on TV nowadays. I expected more from her..... perhaps it is my own fault for being so expecting....Those are my thoughts. I would not waste your time or money on this book if you are looking for excitement, plot, intrigue, or a real good read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I had a hard time feeling for any one of the characters in \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" because the narrative flip flops among them made it difficult to follow. At first, I thought that Nicolas des Innocents was the protagonist but I found I disliked him greatly. He is a womanizer of the first degree and will bed any woman who offers herself to him. He is also an artist who is commissioned to create a series tapestries for a noble French family. Set in the Middle Ages, \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is a fictional account of the story behind the famous French tapestries of the same name.Nicolas des Innocents is an arrogant, ambitious young artist who knows how to smooth talk nobles and beautiful women alike. When he is commissioned by the distinguished Le Viste family to paint a series of tapestries to hang in their salon, he manages to bed a young servant of the Le Viste's and then moves on to Le Viste's daughter, Claude. He is thwarted at every turn by her mother, Genvieve de Nanterre who utilizes the help of her lady-in-waiting to keep 14 year-old Claude out of his clutches. Claude is a foolish young girl who is more than willing to give herself up to Nicolas, but doesn't realize that her mother is a force to be reckoned with.Nicolas' disgrace sends him to Brussels, away from Paris and Claude. He is now to oversee the weaving of the tapestries themselves and befriends the Chapelle family who happen to have a beautiful 19 year old daughter, Alienor. Alienor is kind, gentle and blind. Although she cannot appreciate the art that Nicolas' hands have made, she creates beauty of her own through the care of her garden and the many tasks that she has learned to prove herself useful to her family. Unfortunately, her family has designs to marry her off to a stinky wool dyer for purely selfish reasons and because they figure no one else will have a blind woman. This book definitely reminded me how little woman were thought of back then except for how handy they came as pawns in forming business partnerships through marriage. Alienor, however, has plans of her own and utilizes the help of Nicolas to get her out of her dilemma. Not the way I was expecting it to go, but it worked.Most of Tracy Chevalier's works deal with the story behind the artwork. Her best work to date is \\"Girl With the Pearl Earring\\". This one wasn't my favorite of her stories but I enjoyed it better than \\"The Virgin Blue\\" which felt less wrapped up. A good read in general."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"It's been a year or so since I read this so I can't give specifics. But this is probably my favorite Tracy Chevalier novel.

The reader is taken back in time to 15th century Belgium and allowed to witness the creation of the The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries . We are introduced to the materials needed to create such beauty and come to know the people involved with their creation - the weavers, painters, dyers, etc ... , and their families. I found this to be a light and carefree read. This would be a perfect beach read or one where you could escape from reality (at least, for a few hours)."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I liked this book because of the setting of medieval times and the ways and mores of the people is well-described. Interesting characters, especially the cocky artist and the way he beds women left, right and center. A little bit disappointing in that he never changes, but hey, he is French, after all. The blind character is great, and I loved the descriptions of the romances of the main characters. Medieval love triangles, beatings, mis-placed hostilities, damsels in distress, rich folk, haughty know-it-alls. This book has all those characters. I liked this book a lot. The ending was a little disappointing, but it did have to end somewhere. It seemed like a pat, rushed ending to me."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Like she did with Girl with a Pearl Earring, Chevalier once again takes a real work of art (this time a series of tapestries) and creates a story about their creation that shows how it MIGHT have happened.Nicholas des Innocents is a handsome womanizer and the artist who is commissioned to design a series of tapestries for the thoroughly unlikable nobleman, Jean Le Viste. Le Viste cares nothing for art or love and is only concerned with raising his social status.Nicholas meets the Le Viste's young daughter and she is immediately love-struck.

A commissioned set of paintings ties the noble's family to the family of a Brussel's tapestry weaver. Women are used as bartering chips to make family alliances; guilds set the standards for employment, quality, and imitation; the church plays a role in dictating the conduct of women; and servants' lives are often at the whim of their employers. This is a fun story with the reader wondering whether the tapestry foretells any of the plot. Perhaps the tapestry lion prefigures the artist who has the chin of the cat???"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I think I have now read all of Tracy Chevalier's novels and this one kept me as wrapped up in the characters as all of the rest. At first I wasn't sure I would like a novel about tapestry weaving but I was deeply wound up in every aspect of the skill. I, too, kept looking at the cover of the book as I was reading to examine the tapestry as the story depicted on it unfolded. The characters were all interesting and woven into the tapestry/story in such a way that even the &quot;bad guys&quot; had a good side. Although I thought I knew how each &quot;scene&quot; would play out Ms. Chevalier wrote in some twists that made me not want to put the book down. I have to see if there are any other books she has written that I may have missed. Great summer read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The sheer amount of talent that Chevalier has is staggering. Her fame could have rested solely on GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, and if she had written nothing else she would probably be remembered as a great writer. But given the enormous out put she's produced, it's fair to say she'll be around for quite a while. THE LADY AND THE UNICORN is my second Chevalier book, and while it wasn't as perfect as &quot;Girl,&quot; it does come in a close second. Stellar writing and a great plot make this wonderfully constructed piece well worh the money. Would also recommend two other book which I thoroughly enjoyed: BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and BIRTH OF VENUS. Both are great reads and on the same level as Chevalier's works."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Disregard any thoughts that a novel about creating a tapestry will be a painstaking, tedious read! The use of multiple-voice, first person narratives propel the plot in a frenzy of themes (eg, politics, sex, power and religion) that dispel the typical profile of a \\"historical novel.\\"Each character's motive is critical to the ultimate creation, the tapestry now known as \\"The Lady and The Unicorn.\\" The most intriguing question: Who is the hero of -The Lady and The Unicorn-? Or is every soul we meet a hero? Like a piece of magnificent tapestry, the author has fashioned literary threads that fascinate long after the last page has been read.Chevalier most ingeniously uses the backdrop of commissioning + creating a tapestry in 1490s Paris and Belgium to plunge the reader into a non-stop, page-turning novel. Beautifully written with curious period detail + charismatic character development to entrace her audience, this is a piece of art not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Once again, Tracy Chevalier, author of a number of well-written works of historical fiction, lets her imagination run wild, weaving her story around another actual work of art.

No that the novel doesn't have plenty of information, but that there are so many interesting things that we always want more and more. The first thing that any reader will want is to see the tapestries are so often mentioned in the novel -- actually they are the subject of the novel. The six of them hang in Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen Age (aka Cluny Museum) in Paris. And if you are not fortunate enough to be in Paris when you read this book, you can rely on the internet.But it is not necessary to spend too much time researching. Chevalier's website has almost infinite information of the tapestries, the Le Viste family, medieval tapestries so on. That's why her website is the right place to go while reading her book -- actually it is good to go there for any of her books.In this fashion, Chevalier is one of our contemporary writers who can make the best use of his/her personal website. More than being the means of advertising her work, or a place for exhibitionism, this writer brings new and useful background information about her books. It turns out to be essential to the understanding and enjoyment of her historical prose.\\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is named after a series of French tapestries made in the XV Century. They are the link between the lives of a family of nobles and family of weavers. The only people who can transit the two poles (the nobles -- the working family) are the artist Nicolas des Innocents and the merchant L&eacute;on Le Vieux.Nicolas was hired by Jean La Viste to draw a series of tapestries. They are supposed to be about war -- however, La Viste's wife persuade the artist to talk her husband into making them about the story of a lady seducing an unicorn. At the same time, Nicolas, who is a kind of conquistador, seduces the La Vistes' eldest daughter. The concerned mother tries to separate the couple.In the next segment, Nicolas goes to Brussels to work with a weaver in his workshop in order to produce the tapestries. Transiting between these two poles, Chevalier is able to draw portraits of both the nobles and the working class who are both related to the tapestries -- the ones who own them, and the ones who make them.Using the same device Chevalier used in \\"Falling Angels\\", each chapter is narrated by one different character. The writer is talented enough to make each one a distinguished voice, what makes each one of her narrators/characters very believable.Just like Chevalier's previous novels, \\"The Lady and the unicorn\\" is a fast and entertaining reading -- filled with beauty and interesting background. Her characters are lively and the story is sexy in an old fashioned way -- or sometimes in a very modern one. A book that won't disappoint her fans or debutant readers."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This was just a great book. I read it after Tracy's Girl with a Pearl Earring. In this book, there are a cast of characters that all have a chapter or chapters told from their perspective, thus it is not all told by one person in GWAPE. I found parts of this book very romantic and sexual. I could clearly envision these characters and the places in my mind based on Tracy's descriptions. An absolutely fantastic book!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I agree with Claire Guthrie as I feel she is right on the mark. This is the weakest of Chevalier's novels. Yes it's a fast read (the faster the read the less style and substance?) - and yes it talks about the tapestries and tapestry making - but it really did have a lot of unnecessary soft-core porn. Actually of all the Vermeer books that came out at the time of Girl with Pearl Earring I really thought Girl in Hyacinth Blue the best of the lot. But even her second book was VERY LACKING. Once these authors make it big with one book - why do they have to grind them out? Why do they begin to aim for the lowest common denominator instead of striving toward excellence. Or are they all really just one-book writers?"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I was thrilled when I heard that Chevalier was taking on a work of art I knew well. The tapestry of the woman with unicorn in the Cluny Museum in Paris is stunning, and it has been reproduced so many times that its colorful patterns and subjects now represent the intricate society of the Middle Ages. The best part of the book, however, is its cover; I have the hardback edition with the tapestry detailed under the jacket. While I learned much about tapestry making and the daily life of weavers and artists, the plot left much to be desired. And Chevalier reuses characters from Girl with the Pearl Earring -- maids and masters who are either wicked and cunning or sweet and sympathetic. Pearl Earring is richer and deeper; its emotional center grows out of the main character and her perspective. In Unicorn, we get too many perspectives from characters that fail to rise off the pages of the book. Chevalier's concoction of the story of the tapestry is intriguing, yes, and probably worth reading, but I cared about some of the characters too late in the game to give the novel my full support."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" was an extraordinary novel, with its simplicity and subtlety and intriguing characters. \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" is its opposite, with shallow characters, a silly plot, and an unengaging, elementary writing style. The overabundant references to sex and the raunchy sexual encounters are nauseating. I've read all of Chevalier's books, and while none are even in the same league as \\"Earring,\\" at least the others were readable. The fact that this book revolves around a beautiful piece of art is immaterial; it belongs in the dime-store novel genre."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"In 1490, having purchased his way into the aristocracy, French nobleman Jean Le Viste, feeling self-important, tries to further impress the King and his court on how worthy a person he is. He commissions artist Nicholas des Innocents to design tapestries for Le Viste. Jean's disappointing spouse, a failure for begetting three girls and no male heirs, wants unicorns as the starsHowever Nicholas finds his patron's daughter Claude as the inspiration for the work as he and she fall in love. However, her social climbing father would never allow his daughter to have anything to do with an artisan. Jean takes the drawings to Brussels where the drawings are converted into six lush six tapestries depicting a Lady and the Unicorn.On the surface THE LADY AND THE UNICORN seems like a repeat of the invigorating GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING that used a masterpiece to tell the story of the model that posed for the painting, but that is not really the case here. Though Tracy Chevalier uses the real tapestries hanging in the Museum of the Middle Ages in Paris, she paints a different story. This time a fabulous romance for the ages serves as a backdrop to an in-depth look at life in Paris and Brussels for the aristocracy and especially the artisans and a delightful look at the fifteenth century tapestry industry struggling to meet a tight time line with a quality product as Ms. Chevalier has done with her pioneering of a historical sub-genre that does to the arts what Stoppard did to Hamlet."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier has a solid formula for success--choose a period, populate it with both familiar and fictional characters, and tell a story that mixes historical fact with a fictional narrative that is, nonetheless, meticulously researched (the bibliographies in the backs of her books are extensive). The formula worked beautifully in Girl With a Pearl Earring, and perhaps even better in Falling Angels, but not so well in The Virgin Blue, where you can sort of feel her finding her footing. The Lady and the Unicorn, though, remains my favorite of all of her books. It might not be as heartbreaking as Falling Angels or as subtle as Girl With a Pearl Earring, but it's deliciously naughty, contains rich period detail (who knew 15th century tapestry weaving could be so fascinating?), and is full of complex characters that you can't help rooting for, even when they behave despicably. I still find myself re-reading it occasionally. And, as with the famous painting she based her other book on, I won't ever look at the unicorn tapestries in quite the same way again."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"When Tracy Chevalier writes (or perhaps a better word is \\"composes\\") one of her novels, her extensive research into the period lets her deliver a story that is impeccably accurate in terms of the feel of the era, from the grandest down to the most intimate and trivial of matters. That's what Tracy Chevalier does best. Where she slides a bit in her plotlines is in her capacity to really maintain a full head of steam from start to finish, and every time I've read her books, I've found it an effort to get through certain chapters, even as I greatly enjoyed others.The Lady and the Unicorn is Chevalier's imaginative, historically-sound re-telling of the creation of the lovely fifteenth-century \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" tapestries that today hang in Paris' Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen-Age. Creating a back-story to replace the great unknown behind this most glorious of late-Medieval textile art, Chevalier tells us of the lusty, womanizing artist, ironically named Nicolas Des Innocents, hired by the callous social climber Jean Le Viste to design for his home a tapestry of the brutal Battle of Nancy, in which the French triumphed over the forces of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. However Le Viste's wife, the would-be nun, Genevieve de Nanterre, persuades the artist that a more fitting subject might be one that depicted the classic Medieval ideal, a virgin seducing (to its death) a unicorn.The novel shifts through Nicolas' design for the tapestry, followed by its painstaking creation by a family of Flemish weavers. During the two years of this massive artwork's creation, the reader follows the lives of a half-dozen central characters, from Nicolas and Genevieve, to the blind daughter of a master Brussels weaver, to the vibrantly beautiful Le Viste daughter, Claude, whom Innocents' portrait in cloth depicts for us to this very day. Chevalier does a fine job of explaining how the great tapestries of the era were produced, and she is to be congratulated for her unflinchingly realistic take on Medieval sexual morality, which was far different in so many ways from that of our own times: in some ways more restrictive, in others shockingly licentious, with children being at times a far from treasured \\"consequence\\" of momentary passion.Overall The Lady and the Unicorn is a well-told story set in the carefully-realized world of northwestern Europe at the end of the Middle Ages. It has a number of memorable scenes and moments, and wraps up nicely with a hint of irony and black humor amid all the celebratory relief at the collective accomplishments of so many. Where Chevalier went wrong was in not reproducing the tapestries for us to see either in an appendix or as a centerpiece in her book. Seeing what she was describing would have made a difference in following which figure appeared in which panel. Still, photographs of the tapestries may be found online, at the author's website, as well as several other places, and I'd recommend a reader seek them there.All in all, this is a book worth reading, and one which should do Tracy Chevalier proud."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"There are things about this novel I both liked and disliked. Chevalier's descriptions of the tapestries and the weavers' work reflects their exceptional craft. She wove (pun intended) a beautiful tale of societal expectations and hardships. Based on the epilogue, I assume that she extrapolated the story on loose historical facts, also very well done.Chevalier did an great job of moving the story along through several different character's perspectives. The story is interesting; Chevalier creates a believable, common-everyday life story of her characters. However, each is predicable and lack depth. I had hoped for a twist or two."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This story is more than just a fanciful historical romance, because Chevalier achieves greatness by tying her tale into the historical record through art. This is a rich literary tapestry that explains the story behind a masterpiece of art, the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries. There are both likeable and unlikeable characters within the novel, but they all come together in the historical record of the artwork. At the end of the novel, Chevalier explains which parts of the book are historically accurate and which are her embellishments for narrative purposes.Overall, this is no comparison to Girl With a Pearl Earring, which is an absolute literary masterpiece, but it is still a great read. First-time Chevalier readers should try Girl with a Pearl Earring first."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier's style again entertains beautifully, although I will admit to liking Girl With A Pearl Earring better. That, however, does not diminish a great work here. The lead character, Nicholas, was a little harder to like so it didn't catch me as quickly as I'd like. The generous assortment of other characters certainly added to a complex cadre that developed beautifully. The second half of the book was compelling not to put down. The subject matter was fascinating. Well worth your time to read this gem."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I was expecting just a good book, having heard Tracy Chevalier's name more than once in book buzz, but I got an excellent book! Being the first book of hers that I have read, I was surprised and delighted throughout how she was able to create this masterpiece out of something most people wouldn't look twice at; a piece of art from the 15th century has no immediate place in today's world as far as most are concerned. But besides making me never think the same about the work of art itself (which you can catch glimpses of in unexpected places!), it was the characters that really made the book. It was extraordinary how she created characters that were clearly a product of their time and place and circumstances, but also made them more than characters into people that I, at least, felt towards. Do yourself a favor and treat their lives as reality; you will be amazed at how a work of art is simultaneously created by and a creating force of humanity. I cannot wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Chevalier writes much better female characters than men. Still, this book is a great read. While I liked &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; slightly better, this book comes in second place to that. The book has a somewhat unusual form in that each chapter is told by a different person. Highly recommended.Also recommended: &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; &quot;Water Music,&quot; and &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"What the Girl With the Pearl Earring was to painting, The Lady and the Unicorn is to weaving. Beautifully told, through the varying viewpoints of the main characters. The libertine artist, the blind daughter of the weaver,the servant girl,and the nobleman's daughter,all are woven into a tapestry.Chevalier definitely knows how to research. She brings to life the art of weaving tapestries, the woad dyer,(and his smell of sheep's urine,) with color and vitality. We see the importance of the Guilds, and the Church in the daily lives of the people. Arranged marriages, and a stay in a convent all help to support the way it really was. Chevalier brings the characters to life, and adds the sights, smells, sounds, and feelings of the period.It will almost make you believe in the healing powers of the Unicorn. Great read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"_The Lady and the Unicorn_ treads on familiar territory. Like Chevalier's celebrated _Girl with a Pearl Earring_, the novel takes a well-known piece of art and creates an elaborate story around it. This novel focuses on the famous Lady and the Unicorn tapestries in the Cluny Museum in Paris. Chevalier researched their history, as well as the history of tapestry production for the book, and the reader is granted with the great opporunity to learn more about this lost art.Chevalier's story is narrated by seven different characters at different stages in the tapestries' production. The painter, and designer of the tapestries, Nicholas des Innocents, plays the prominent role in the narratives because he is the link between the patrons, in Paris, whom the tapestry is being made for, and the weavers in Brussels, who work tirelessly to produce the panels. The patrons are a wealthy noble family who commission the tapestry to celebrate their daughter's betrothal. The weaver family in Brussels are working-class laborers who are very skilled in their craft. Each character plays an important role, and therefore becomes part of the tapestry and its methaphorical story. Chevalier takes special care with each of her characters and exposes their thoughts, feelings and desires."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Long a fan of anything medieval, (and being familiar with Chevalier's mastery of writing in Girl With a Pearl Earring, and the first-person voice per chapter device utilized to good effect in Falling Angels) and also being well aware of the mystique surrounding the unicorn tapestries, I delved into this work with a surfeit of enthusiasm. Given the bawdiness of the plot, the comical nature of the main protagonist (the ironically named des Innocents) and the sheer wealth of atmosphere, I can honestly say I was not disappointed. It wouldn't, however, be out of place to say that there was a dearth of likeable characters in the novel, with a couple of notable exceptions. This fact, however, did not detract from its readability. Rather it was a compelling reason to see what detestable, morally questionable things they may try to pull next. Two characters in particular, (I will refrain from saying whom) seem well-suited adversaries suffering from a comparable paucity of ethics, and they both get their appropriate comeuppance in the end. Chevalier strains to create as realistic a setting as possible, although the actions and attitudes of the characters (as fun as they are to meet) stretch the bounds of credulity at times. If one takes the book instead as more of a sex farce with threads (pun intended) of artistic sensibility thrown in, rather than a straight historical novel, the reader will not be let down. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"After Tracy Chevalier's stunning success with \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is a disappointment. Shifting from the viewpoints of Nicholas des Innocents--the artist--and the women who appear in the famous Unicorn Tapestries, Chevalier tries to offer a touching, sad, sexy insight into the lives of these women. But she fails.There are too many characters and they are not very well-developed. Our hero, Nicholas, is a haughty genius who \\"ploughs\\" (has sex with) a bunch of women, including the 14-year-old daughter of his commissioner. She's another poor character. Always anachronistically promiscuous for no apparent reason, Claude's defining characteristic seems to be her silliness and eagerness to go to bed with the 30s-ish artist. WHY?Then we come to the blind girl at the weaver's home. She can tell colors apart by their touch (?). Red is oily, blue is smooth...it is totally unrealistic. She doesn't have much personality either.The love and sexual tension that was so subtle in \\"Girl with a Pearl\\" doesn't work here. Juggling too many characters weakens whatever development there might have been.The writing style remains the same--blah, mid-length sentences--for all the personae in the book. By the end all the female characters blur together into one annoying, confusing mass of whiny women. The beauty and sense of \\"rightness\\" that made \\"Girl with a Pearl\\" so well-loved are absent here.Although well-researched, this book flopped.Try again, Ms. Chevalier."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Chevalier delivers again. She has a very distinct niche and doesn't waver much from book to book (though Falling Angels was a bit different than the rest and I didn't enjoy it as much). For creatures of habit like me, that's a good thing. I enjoyed reading about the making of tapestries, which I knew nothing about beforehand so I cannot really comment on the accuracy. She also does a wonderful job with the character depictions. My only gripe is that I didn't relate to most of the characters, which made the reading a bit tedious at times."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Wonderful book from beginning to end ... I especially loved the ending because everything ended up as it should for every, single character!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier uses the same idea she had in &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot;, of taking a famous painting and imagining the story behind it's creation. A series of woven tapestries that hangs today in a museum in Paris, she blends the stories of the various weavers, artists, and noblemen who all are connected in one way or another to the art. Having not read &quot;Pearl Earring&quot; I found the book creative and refreshing. What essentially amounts to threaded short stories are compelling pieces with interesting characters, as well as a side bar education in a near forgotten art form."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"As a Chevalier fan this book was not a letdown. It was almost on par with Girl with a Pearl Earring. The characters were well developed. You grow to like and the good guys and hate such characters as LeBoeuf. The idea of the story in the tapestry and the people behind making it is fabulous. I wanted to delve further in the family of weavers. This is about change in our lives. Wonderful. A great piece of &quot;historical&quot; fiction."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"So much plowing! It's all the male character talks about! This becomes a very tiring sexual metaphor after about twenty pages. I continued to read, hoping (in vain) that the story would take off and there would be a reason for the endless plowing references. I thought, perhaps the author wants us to really dislike this guy. But he seems to be the &quot;hero&quot; of the story. Why?I must say I was very surprised and disappointed, having recently read &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.&quot; Don't know what happened with this one. A major and annoying waste of time."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I, too, enjoyed \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" as well as \\"Falling Angels.\\" But this was an altogether waste of time. The characters are unbelievable and, frankly, annoying. The storyline was dull and didn't seem to do justice to the actual paintings. I expected more from Chevalier than this cheap, romantic rubbish."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I've read Girl with the Pearl Earring and absolutely loved the book (the movie wasn't bad either), so I had hopes that this one would be just as good. Though not as good as the other book, The Lady and the Unicorn is a pretty decent read. All the historical information on how tapestries were made and the long process was actually quite interesting. The narrator of the story switches each chaper which I really liked since it let you see the tale from different views. The story seemed to drag out a bit towards the end, but overall not a bad book to check out."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It is written in a different style than \\"Girl With a Pearl Earing\\", but still has her unique characterization and love of details. It is a romantic book, but the romance to me only seemed to be on the surface. There are a lot of layers to this novel, and the romance was only one of them.The characters of this book are maticulously woven together, as are the tapestries at the center of this story. We know the fibers that make up both the people and the weavings by the last page. She also helps us see that behind all great art is the hand of a human being, which is a reminder that art is less lofty and untouchable as it can appear in books and museums.The one chapter about the blind girl in the garden blew me away. That was fabulous."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I have enjoyed all of Tracy Chevaleir's novels, but I have a nit to pick on this one. The sex between the blind virgin and the artist is so unrealistic I felt I was reading a \\"bodice ripper\\" from the 1970s. Why be so attuned to historical detail in the rest of the story, and then romanticize first time sex (without foreplay even!) so sappily?"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I adored this book! It is so well done, with so much going on...my only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. Not that things aren't fleshed out, or that the story doesn't come full circle, just that I enjoyed it so much, that I wish there was more..."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I so enjoyed this story about the French tapestry.After viewing these tapestries in Paris this summer I was very excited to know that there was a story about them. Historical Fiction is a lovey way to think about \\"how history might of happened\\". I recommend going to see these wonderful tapestries in Paris and then reading the book...great plan...now go do it!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I had heard of the tapestry a long time ago and saw photos of it in art books as a child. When in Paris a few years ago, I saw the restored original in a museum. That sparked my interest even more. The book gave detailed information about the making of tapestries. All the steps, from concept to finished tapestry, were fascinating to me."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Good enough, but lacking in comparison to Girl with a Pearl Earring. I had hoped for more since Chevalier had done so well."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"My book club read The Lady and the Unicorn by Tracy Chevalier. It was an enjoyable read and the discussion was lively. We discussed the role of women during that time period, the social classes, did we believe the events could have happened, etc., and we especially liked that we learned about making tapestries. My Kindle version didn't have photos, but the leader found a good picture of the tapestry that was the center of the story and more background information. It surprises me how many related topics I have noticed since reading the book, for example, the making of dyes, the weaving process, and rules of the Weaving Guild."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I never thught I'd enjoy a book about tapestry making set around 1492 but I did. Of course, I enjoyed a book on the plague written by Geraldine Brooks so I guess I am up for anything. Anyway, this was a fascinating look into life at that time and the actual work of tapestry making. I love when I learn about words we use now adays so reading about cartoonists and what they did then was a plus. I loved the characters and the use of an unlikeable, immoral man as the central character was inspired. I loved this book and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I love Ms. Chevalier's work and this novel is a great example of how she is able to carry the reader's attention to the very last page. I appreciated the unusual twist of events ((but I won't give it away!)) that didn't allow for a \\"cookie cutter\\" ending. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book is a fictional account of the commission, design and manufacture of five now-famous tapestries, going from character to character in the tale of their making and the personal story behind each picture. Like all of Chevalier's work, it is rich in accurate detail of the times.Tracy Chevalier took a risk when she started her story in the viewpoint of an unlikable character: vain, self-centered, and careless of having gotten a girl \`in trouble'. She followed it with a second viewpoint, this of a teenaged spoiled brat with nothing on her mind but defying her mother and getting laid, no matter the consequences. If I had not read Girl with a Pearl Earring and found it decently written, I might not have continued beyond the second chapter.But in the artistic theme of the lady's seduction of the unicorn and the arrogant Nicholas' use of that metaphor in his well-used one-liner for the ladies, I could see the germ of a redemptive theme, so I kept reading. Chevalier shortly switched to more sympathetic viewpoints, that of the long-suffering wife and mother who must manage the brat, and from there to the household of tapestry-weavers in Brussels and their blind daughter.As the story weaves back and forth between the pressures of a noble household, the business of a middle-class one, and the harsh realities of life for the serving class. Chevalier also portrayed the pervasiveness of the church in people's daily lives. Although that part seemed a little clinical, like an alien commenting on the strange doings of earth people with no idea what might drive them to behave so. Perhaps that is only her style; at times she described the sex act with the same detachment.The interdependence of people on each other in the renaissance world was used to good effect to create the story: the supplier of woad is a boor, but he can lay a claim on the hand of the weaver's daughter because they need the blue he manufactures to complete the project. The wife can weave just as well as her husband, but the guild would fine them if she was discovered to be working. No work is allowed before a certain time in the morning or after another in the evening to protect the weavers, but there is no protection from the threats of a client who demands his tapestry early.Ms. Chevalier braids in one well-researched thread after another to make the multiple people and their dilemmas come alive. The story was not a sweeping one that should be surveyed from a distance, but a minuscule collection of details, best viewed with a magnifying glass. This is why the collection of first-person viewpoints works so well in this case.The end is not surprising, but does wind things up very believably. A nice satisfying read, and great for research and atmosphere, although not really a page turner."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I liked this book but didn't love it. It had some moments. I found the characters hard to get close to. The writing seemed to lack the kind of flow that keeps you reading, when you're not suppose to. Perhaps that is due to the different points of view every chapter. This book is about relationships with ones self, God and Family as well as trade. Although throughout, I remained apathetic to the outcome. It felt like a combination of genre's were used. Romance, Bodice Ripper, mystery, historical, which I don't mind, but still I felt there was no pay off in the end. I have not read any of this Authors other books and as they have been so highly recommended, I may pick one up at some point, but when I am crazy about an Author, I have to have all their books, immediately. I don't feel that way now."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I have now read all the books that I know of by this author and loved all but one of them. This was one of the ones that I loved. I read most of it the first night, staying up as late as possible to try to finish it, and finished it up as soon as I woke the next morning. Looking forward to Chevalier's next book!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is a delightful read: more historical and artistic substance than the average romance novel, but lightly and deftly done. Chevalier's proven research abilities shine in her portrayal of the various walks of life available to fifteenth-century women. She's not nearly as convincing with her male characters -- not even the priapic and archly-named Nicolas des Innocents (remember that St. Nicholas is the patron saint of thieves, and you'll figure out what Nicolas' favorite activity is). Still, the novel displays enormous affection for the Cluny tapestries and sweetly imagines them as a series of portraits of the women in Nicolas' life. The symbolism and circular plotting might seem too on-the-nose for modern readers, but it's certainly true to the time period in which it's set. Read it as an allegory, with extra sex, and you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I loved this book from page one. The way Tracy Chevalier writes, I felt like I was back in time. I love how she writes from the point of view of the different characters. Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read this book in one sitting, on a plane ride to Europe, and couldn't put it down. History has always fascinated me, and the story of Claude, nobleman's daughter. I found it amazing how Tracy Chevalier was able to take one tapestry and create an entire story about it. She builds upon what is already known to create a piece of fiction that seems almost real unto itself. I always marvel at Chevalier's works, as her language is descriptive to a fault, and doesn't assume an air of modernity which can be found in many historical novels written in the present time.Although The Lady and the Unicorn is, indeed, very similar to Chevalier's earlier novels, Falling Angels and Girl With a Pearl Earring, there are several things which make this novel stand apart from the rest. Chevalier perfects her art with each book she writes. The Lady and the Unicorn is historically more accurate, and extends beyond the artwork or historical milieu. Often it is tempting to wonder about something that is not known, and Chevalier toys with her subject (the tapestry and the people involved) to create a masterpiece.In all, this is a highly enjoyable, exciting piece of literature that shouldn't be missed. Tracy Chevalier supassed my expectations of her."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"A beautifully written book. I finished the tale in one long sitting and was so immeresed in the book, I felt like I was one of the characters. After reading this, I felt like traveling across the ocean to go see the tapestries. There was only one element in which I was dissappointed -- the story of Nicolas and Claude. Besides that though, a really wonderful read!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is the second book I've read by Miss Chevalier, after the Girl with a Pearl Earring, and I found this one just as good. Hearing the \\"story\\" behind the masterpiece is very fascinating and gripping. I loved hearing from more than one characters perspective, making the tale interesting. Hearing about the tapestries really awed me, so much that I had to look up the images and gaze upon their beauty. I wish my hard cover had had the pictures of most of the tapestries like there are in the soft cover. This is a great story, bringing the time and place to life, as well as the people who created the tapestries. Pick up a copy and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Capitalizing on the immense success of her Vermeer novel, Chevalier applies the same formula to a medieval tapestry. She creates a cast of characters -- the painter, the family that commissioned the work, the family of weavers that actually manufacture it -- and weaves a set of interlocking stories around them.It's hard for me to criticize this book because I did enjoy it. I finished it in a couple of hours and at the end I'd learned quite a bit about tapestries and how they were made and about the lives of the people who made them. It's an easy read -- maybe a bit too easy. If I give it only three stars, it's because I closed the last page with the feeling that I'd just consumed a somewhat insubstantial meal. I was never fully engaged with the characters and I never really cared what became of them."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Far raunchier than The Girl with the Pearl Earring...with the key character in the book being a Parisian artist whose main hobby is seducing women (or should that be farming?!) ;-)Chevalier tells a good story though and I enjoyed the way each character had their own chapters where we heard their take on things.Chevalier's particular talent is for bringing the sights and smells of her settings alive to the reader, therefore she was the ideal author to describe a tapestry relating to the five senses. I felt I could see and smell the places described, from the fragrant lily of the valley in Ali&eacute;nor's garden to the early warning smell of Jacques Le Boeuf!!In addition, the colour plates depicting the tapestry were very useful to refer to throughout the story.I found this book interesting historically, artistically and in the very human way we conduct our relationships. The author has surely suceeded in making us look at the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries with new eyes and a little romance."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is my favorite kind of book. One to pick up, savor each word and never want to put down. Chevalier has a rich imagination, basing this historical fiction on an existing series of fine tapestries with questionable (undocumented) history, and telling the story through (nearly) all involved in their creation.We begin with the painter, Nicolas des Innocents, who conceptualizes the stories and major symbolisms of the work. A womanizer, he's brash and vain, yet his charm wins the day with the ladies and the reader. He learns much through his experience with the women he depicts as the tapestries take form. One can't help but fall in love with him. He calls the women he wishes to seduce, \\"Beauty,\\" and offers to tell them the story of the unicorn's horn.Through the words of Nicolas' true object of desire, Claude, the daughter of the nobleman commissioning the work, we learn much about the place of women in Paris society at the end of the fifteenth century. In fact, this is also true about all the ladies featured in the story and ultimately in the tapestry: Claude's long-suffering mother, Genevieve de Nanterre, the blind daughter of the weaver, Alienor, and her mother, Christine, who longs to be a weaver although the Brussel's weaver's guild forbids it.Other unforgettable characters include the lady-in-waiting, Beatrice, and the servant Marie-Celeste.Chevalier has clearly done her research, and in doing so, allows the reader to experience this story with all five senses. In taking admitted liberties with the language, it is an utterly readable tale and I give it my highest recommendation.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Unfortunately, The Lady and the Unicorn resembles more to me a shallow romance novel with its implausible situations and frequent trysts and flirtations, than a first-rate historical narrative. Each of the characters have their share of unhappiness for one reason or another but most have only one thing on their mind. There is little character development and what little plot there is, seems a bit contrived to weave a story around the historical tapestries. Of course, perhaps the book's weakness is an accurate reflection of the small-mindedness of medieval society but it nevertheless fails to give the reader a sense of satisfaction in its conclusion. Despite these shortcomings, however, the book flows easily enough and makes its meandering plot interesting enough to propel the reader to the conclusion. Moreover, the book's depiction of medieval life and the art of tapestry weaving strikes me as realistic and informative. If you have an interest in the art of medieval tapestry weaving, The Lady and the Unicorn will bring the process to life for you from design conception to tapestry hanging, as well as familiarize you with the famous Unicorn Tapestries."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Once again, Tracy Chevalier, author of a number of well-written works of historical fiction, lets her imagination run wild, weaving her story around another actual work of art. In this book, the author builds her story around the series of medieval tapestries known as \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", currently hanging in a museum in France, creating a work of historical fiction that is somewhat interesting and moderately enjoyable. Although not as well written as her best selling novel, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\", or even her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\", those who like their historical fiction with some romantic overtones will be pleased with the author's efforts.Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a talented, handsome, and cocky painter, Nicolas des Innocents, is commissioned to design and paint scenes depicting the Battle of Nancy for a series of tapestries. His paintings would then be enlarged in preparation for having the images woven into tapestries by a master weaver in Brussels. The commission is given to Nicholas by a prominent French nobleman, Jean Le Viste, a cold man who is given to self-importance and wishes to memorialize his status, as his star in on the ascendancy in the Royal Court.Nicolas soon discovers, however, that it was Jean Le Viste's wife, Genevieve de Nanterre, who suggested him for the commission. She lets him know, however, that she does not wish for the tapestries to depict the Battle of Nancy but, rather, scenes of a lady and a unicorn. Genevieve de Nanterre, a pious and unhappily married woman, leaves it to him to convince her husband that this new idea should replace the Battle of Nancy as the subject of the tapestries. Nicolas manages to do this, and so it begins.Nicolas is not only a fine painter but also a confirmed lothario who falls for Le Viste's daughter, a beautiful teenager named Claude. Of course, Nicholas has already dallied with Marie-Celeste, one of the household's maids with the usual, not unexpected, result, a fact that will eventually lead to some serious personal consequences for him. Meanwhile, Genevieve de Nanterre, who would rather be a nun than married to Jean Le Viste, discovers that her daughter reciprocates the painter's passion. Claude is ultimately shipped off to a nunnery to repent for her sins and to remain chaste until a suitable betrothal may be made for her. Genevieve's motives in doing so, however, are not wholly altruistic.Eventually, Nicholas travels to the workshop of master weaver Georges de la Chappelle, who has been selected to convert the paintings to tapestries. Nicholas meets with cartoonist, Philippe de la Tour, to ensure that the tapestries stay true to his paintings and that the process of enlarging them does not substantively change his seductive design. Of course, his stay in Brussels is made more pleasant by the fact that Georges de la Chappelle has a lovely daughter named Alienor, who is ripe for the picking. Unfortunately, her father, for business reasons, wishes to marry her off to the local tanner, a smelly brute whose noxious scent is a result of an expected occupational hazard. Unbeknownst to them all, however, Alienor has a secret admirer, whose love will eventually make right all that goes wrong.This is a mildly entertaining novel in which the underlying theme is seduction. The tale is told from the perspectives of each of the main characters through individual first person narratives. The lives of some of them become intertwined, because Nicolas des Innocents has come into contact with them. The story describes their lives and loves, as well as the impact that their lives have on the actual tapestries. The novel also gives a good deal of interesting information on the weavers' guild of the time and its practices, as well as information on the painstaking art of weaving high quality tapestries, such as that of \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\"."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"\\"The Lady in the Unicorn\\" is Tracy Chevalier's fourth novel. She is the author of the best selling (and recently a major motion picture) \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". Tracy Chevalier seems to write the same sort of novel each time, but because the subjects are different, the ways the novels play out are different. The technique that Chevalier uses is that she takes a painting that I presume she likes (or is just interested in). She learns as much of the backstory of the painting as possible and then writes a fictional novel about how this painting came about and who the artist and subjects are. In the two Chevalier novels I have read now, this has turned out to be much more interesting than it may at first sound.The story in \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is set in 15th Century Paris and Brussels. Nicolas des Innocents has been commissioned to create a set of tapestries for a minor member of the French nobility Jean Le Viste. This seems simple enough: Commission, Paint, Weave, Complete. What sets this novel apart is in the telling. Nicolas is a talented artist, but rather arrogant about his art. He mainly paints miniatures in great detail and has never had to design a tapestry (it takes a different sort of skill to design a tapestry). But Nicolas is also a lusty man. Months prior he had impregnated a maid at Le Viste's estate and this time he has his eye on a young woman named Claude. It also seems that Claude has her eye on Nicolas. There wouldn't be any trouble (or much) if it didn't turn out that Claude is Jean Le Viste's eldest daughter and heir to the estate. Now any tryst must be secret, but Claude's mother knows something is afoot so she works to keep them apart so Claude may keep her virginity and be an eligible bride with the estate as a dowry.The scene later shifts to the weavers who will actually make the tapestries. Nicolas defies all custom and is personally involved in nearly all aspects of the making of the tapestries. He is no less lusty now that he is away from Claude, but we get to see more of his character as this section of the novel progresses. Throughout the novel we see how Nicolas's inspiration for the tapestry evolves and why he is creating the tapestries quite the way that he is. We get glimpses into the lives of the weavers, Nicolas, as well as Claude. This novel is told with multiple narrators in such a way that the shift in narration feels appropriate and smooth and these shifts serve to better advance the story and keep it moving along.The opening of \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" felt a little crude with Nicolas's crass sexual interest in Claude, but as the novel wore on there became fewer crass lines and everything felt natural. For a novel about tapestries (but really about relationships), this one was fairly fast paced. Considering the quality of both \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", I think I'm going to have to give Chevalier's other two novels a try. This one was well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The plot of this book is well-described above so I won't repeat it here. The high points of this novel are the rich period detail -- the differences between how members of various social classes lived, the role of women in France and Belgium during the Renaissance, the interaction between art and politics, and, most of all, the creation of art, especially tapestries and how they differ from painting. The characters are particularly well-developed and it is very easy to care for them. I especially liked the blind daughter of the weaver and how Chevalier got into how she perceived the world and how the world of her day perceived her and her \\"flaw.\\" It is extremely easy to empathize with the Lady Genvieve, stuck in a loveless marriage with nothing but her religion to cling to, her daughter Claude and her importance to her father solely as a means to his social-climbing, and the family of weavers whose work on the series of tapestries of the book's title will either make them or break them, and somehow ends up doing both.I bought this book on audio, and there are two shortcomings that keep me from giving it a higher rating, one inherent in the book itself, the other having to do with the audio reading. The first problem I have with the book is that it often reads like a bad romance novel, especially when dealing with the sexual awakening of Claude. Yes, she is a 14 year-old girl and we are hearing or reading, as the case may be, her point of view, but everytime I heard these passages I kept imagining a paperback with Fabio on the cover. I almost got into an accident driving and listening to this book as I was giggling pretty hard in places. The book is also quite repetitive and felt rather short, more like a padded novella.The issue I had with the audio version had to do with Robert Blumenfeld's reading of some of the male roles. The protagonist of the book, Nicolas des Innocents is supposed to be arrogant and conceited, especially in his attitude toward women and non-Parisians. But Blumenfeld reads Nicolas' passages in such an oozingly snobby and condescending voice, that is hard to imagine him seducing any woman, let alone the many of this book. The general snobby quality of his voice also comes through with some of the other characters and doesn't always suit them so well, although he does better with the secondary characters. It is especially noticable because Terry Donnelly, who reads the female voices, does such a marvelous job. She sounds like a girl on the brink of womanhood when reading Claude's thoughts, she sounds like a weary middle-aged noblewoman when reading the passages narrated by Claude's mother, Genivieve, and she sounds like a wise working-class woman when reading as the weaver's wife. It's such a wonderful performance that Blumenfeld's just doesn't hold up to it, especially since the sound quality on his parts isn't as good.In short, this a great book for someone interested in Renaissance art and life and is basically good. If you are interested in women in the middle ages and the Renaissance in Europe and want to listen on audio, I'd recommend instead Barnes and Noble's series of audio tapes of books by Alison Weir, including her book on Eleanor of Acquitaine and the Six Wives of Henry the Eighth. They are extremely well-written and wonderfully narrated. Had I not heard these series, I might have enjoyed \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" audio book more, but having heard great books about the era, I can only rate this one as merely good."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Ms. Chevalier's &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; was a deftly woven tapestry of words that tied together several different individuals via one character named Nicolas des Innocents a very talented but vain artist.This story is told from the view point of several of the characters (each chapter is a character in the story) on the design and creation of a very important tapestry which depicted the seduction of the Unicorn by a lady. From the birth of the design by Nicolas for a very important partron in Paris to the weaving of the design by a family of weavers in Brussels this story covers the life of Nicolas and how his randy self effects everyone that he comes into contact with.This was a well told tale that kept me glued to the pages. Ms. Chevalier is a very talented author who chooses her inspiration for her stories from vivid works of art. This story will grab you from the very beginning and you will be drawn to the very interesting and at times funny characters that inhabit this little make belive world. I highly recommend this book as an entertaining way to pass an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I didn't like Tracy Chevalier's book, \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,\\" and I didn't read the other two, so I was a little reluctant to buy this book. I love the Lady and Unicorn tapestries in the Cluny Museum in Paris so much, though, that I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't.Chevalier's writing is still spare and straightforward and I was happy to see that, but her sense of character and the richness she adds to her plot strands has increased many times over.This is a lovely book, filled with fully-realized characters and a beautifully-woven plot...almost as beautiful as the tapestries in the Cluny. Chevalier has certainly used her imagination well in giving us a story about how these beautiful tapestries might have come about. I felt like I was really transported back to France (and Brussels) during the fifteenth century. Chevalier hasn't skimped on the details and it's the details that make this book so lovely.I enjoyed this book and, although not an artist, I am a lover of art. I think anyone who loves art, France, tapestries or beautifully-told romantic tales will love \\"The Lady and the Unicorn.\\" I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read this novel on my vacation in Paris and on the day I finished it I went to the Cluny Museum to see the Tapestries for myself. I'd seen them ten years ago, but seeing them again, after reading Tracy Chevalier's book brought them to life in a way that was utterly magical.As she did with The Girl With the Pearl Earring, (but even better this time since she has matured as a writer) the author takes a classic work of art and artfully spins a tale inspired by the original which becomes an original itself.That the actual art work exists adds to the magic. The magic adds to the actual art work.Chevalier's imagination, her grasp of history, her attention to the senses, to details, to the soul of both artists, artisans and lovers are all as lovely as the tapestries.Not a stich is missing, not a word is extraneous or misplaced. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"For me, Lady and the Unicorn was every bit as good as Girl with a Pearl Earring. I felt utterly transported to the middle ages and immersed in a rollicking good tale, immaculately told."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier once again demonstrates her ability to write about a famous work of art while making its history come alive. In &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; she provides a fictionalized account of the creation of a series of famous medieval tapestries which currently are on display in a museum in Paris. Although the origin of the tapestries is unknown, including who commissioned them, when they were created, or who crafted them, the author does an excellent job of weaving together whatever facts are known, along with some supposition and a generous thread of imagination, to create an entertaining tale.Artist Nicolas des Innocents, a womanizer who usually paints miniatures and coats of arms, is commissioned by the nobleman Jean Le Viste to design some tapestries to glorify the family's status at Court. He is originally asked to create a battle scene, but the design evolves into the story of a lady seducing a unicorn. Although Nicolas is the protagonist around whom the action pivots, the first-person narrative continually shifts between Nicolas, the Le Viste family, and the family of the weaver that produces the tapestries. Because of the profusion of characters and subplots, this novel is not as focused as &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; but it is still fascinating.The story contains many facts about how tapestries were made. Beneath the book's paper jacket, one of the actual tapestries is displayed across the front and back cover. I found myself continually peering under the jacket to study its details as I read about the use of color, weaving techniques, plants and animals, and symbolism. The story also provides an interesting description of life in late 15th century Paris and Brussels, including class distinctions and role of women in medieval society. I recommend it for both art lovers and fans of historical fiction.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is one of the most delightful books I've read in the past few years. Yes, yes, we know it's about a set of medieval tapestries being woven and about the people who get caught up in each others' lives as a result. Put like that, it sounds dusty and worthy perhaps. Nothing could be further from the truth. For me, Lady and the Unicorn bubbled along, filled with both fun and pathos. I found myself caring deeply not only about the characters but also the tapestries themselves. I also found myself referring frequently to the designs underneath the dust-jacket and even poking around among the rugs in the basement to see whether there was a unicorn rug down there."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier charmed and intrigued audiences with &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;Falling Angels.&quot; She continues her winning ways with &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn,&quot; a fascinating part fact, part imaginative account of one of the world's masterpieces.She attributes her interest in this particular work of art to an early interest in unicorns. She called it a &quot;teenage craze&quot; saying, &quot;I had books, posters, stickers, jewelry.......In one of the books were illustrations of the six Lady and the Unicorn tapestries that hang in the Museum of the Middle Ages (aka Cluny Museum) in Paris. I thought they were very beautiful, and made sure to see them when I visited Paris at the age of 20. After that I forgot about them.&quot;Fortunately for the world she was reminded of them when she read an article in 1999. Her curiosity about their origins was piqued, and she set to work. Inspiration, as most creative artists know, can be a blessing or a devilment. Ms. Chevalier is blessed, and we are the beneficiaries.We are also the beneficiaries of superb performances by two gifted vocal artist on both Unabridged versions of this story. Seen on television in The Equalizer, As The World Turns, and Sesame Street, accomplished stage actor Robert Blumenfeld brings characters, especially the willful Nicholas, to vibrant life. An apt partner for him is Terry Donnelly who has performed at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and on the New York stage.For those unfamiliar with the tapestries they present what appears to be a woman seducing a unicorn. While these works have long been admired, virtually nothing is known of their provenance. Enter the fecund imagination of Ms. Chevalier who recreates Paris in 1490 where lives a rather haughty French nobleman with his family. To underscore his importance at court the nobleman retains the talented, lascivious artist Nicholas de Innocents to design six extravagant tapestries.The nobleman's household is never the same once Nicholas arrives. He uses the noble's wife, Genevieve, and lovely daughter, Claude, as models. Almost upon seeing Claude he falls madly in love but his suit is hopeless.Once his paintings are completed he takes them to Brussels and master-weaver George de la Chapelle demanding perfection in every stitch.Tracy Chevalier is a magician who seamlessly blends fact and fiction into colorful, romantic, compelling stories. &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; is one more.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"A series of six tapestries depicting a lady seducing a unicorn now hang in the Musee National du Moyen Age in Paris. Although these tapestries --- created in the late fifteenth century --- are some of the most famous in the world, very little is known about their creation or their history. Tracy Chevalier, the novelist best known for writing the perennial book club favorite (and new feature film) GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, has used her rich imagination to weave together romance, humor and art history in THE LADY AND THE UNICORN.Chevalier starts with one of the few facts that is actually known about the tapestries: they were created for the nobleman Jean Le Viste, whose family coat of arms features prominently in their design. In Chevalier's portrayal, Le Viste is a power-hungry nobleman with close ties to the king. He wants tapestries depicting the glories of war, but the artist, Nicolas des Innocents --- who specializes in portraits of noblewomen --- convinces Le Viste that a series of tapestries about courtly love will still bring glory to the Le Viste name.Nicolas himself is a womanizer --- the novel opens from his point of view, and we quickly learn that his amorous sights are set on Le Viste's teenage daughter, Claude. Much to the reader's surprise (and delight), when Claude narrates the next section of the novel we learn that she is just as lustful as Nicolas, and her prose just as bawdy. Needless to say, when Claude's family discovers their flirtation, her mother (who wants to be a nun) must concoct a plan to keep the would-be lovers apart. Claude is banished to a convent and Nicolas is sent to Brussels to supervise the weaving of the tapestries there.This development helps highlight one of the key themes of the novel, which is the juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane. Chevalier's novel is at turns raunchy and rapturous, and this contrast applies not only to the tapestries themselves and to the characters involved in their creation, but also to the whole culture of late-medieval France.In Brussels, Nicolas once again becomes woven up in a family drama, this time in the industrious Chapelle family of weavers. Their daughter Alienor is beautiful but blind, and they fear she must marry the rude and odiferous wool dyer, whom she can't stand. Nicolas and Alienor concoct a plan to save her from her fate while allowing Nicolas to do what he does best.In addition to being a hugely entertaining romp through art history and medieval sexual politics, THE LADY AND THE UNICORN also includes a number of interesting details about the art of weaving. By the end of this book, you'll have not only a clear picture of medieval weaving equipment and techniques, but also a greater understanding of and appreciation for the tapestries themselves, and for the weavers whose stories were lost to history --- until Chevalier creatively brought them back to life.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Based on the description on the back of this book, I expected an elegantly written, cozy, sophisticated, intriguing, engrossing Medievalish fantasy. What I got was a badly written, tawdry romance filled with cheesy innuendos that entirely lacked depth. I don't mind a tawdry romance, but 1) it was completely at odds with how this book is touted so I wasn't prepared for it and 2) even the least sophisticated romance I've read has never come close to this level of groan-worthy, eye-rolling text. To this day I am still not sure what the author was trying to accomplish, aside from making me guffaw."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"call me just an \\"average Jane\\" but I like reading stories where at LEAST one character has some redeeming feature that endears the story to me, the reader.In The Lady And The Unicorn I would have been happy to see every character fall off a cliff. From the horrid, rutting painter, to his vain, selfish \\"true\\" love, her miserable and misery making mother and all the rest are only worthy of a long walk off a short pier. The only recommendation worthy parts of the story were about the tapestry weaving, which were interesting and informative.If your idea of a \\"a fun evening reading\\" is to sink five feet in dark, depressing and selfish machinations, then this may be the book for you.2 stars for making even unicorns cringe worthy."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Engrossing from the start, The Lady and the Unicorn is told from multiple perspectives. While this devise might seem gimmicky in the hands of lesser author, Tracy Chevalier is able to switch narrators each chapter with consummate ease. Some readers may find it to be fairly superficial; it is true she does not delve into any serious themes. Yet, others may find, as I have, that this allows the reader to simply experience Belgium and France in the 14h century, glimpsing the real lives people lived in the time period. Chevalier brings her own obvious interest in the tapestry (the book's namesake) into every page of the story. Teaching without preaching, she intrigues the reader, enhancing the artwork for layman and expert alike. This book is interesting from beginning to end, fun and as always, well researched. If you are interested in historical fiction at all, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is my first Tracy Chevalier novel, and, at best, it was an entertaining read on a transatlantic flight. It's a superficial book, I think, with a slight plot and only too forgettable characters. I have spent hours with the Unicorn tapestries at the Cluny, and the book not only failed to add depth or increase my wonderment, but it failed to make me want to look at them more closely. I was never bored, but I was never completely absorbed, either."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"What a wonderful book. I actually enjoyed this more than \\"Girl with Perl Earring\\". This is the story not only of the making of the six beautiful and famous tapestries, but of several people.The major players are Nicolas des Innocents the artist who designed the tapestries, Jean La Viste the man who had the tapestries commissioned, Claude La Viste the daughter of Jean, Genivieve La Viste Jean's wife and Claude's mother, Georges de LaChappelle the weaver of the tapestries, Christine Georges's wife and Alienor, Georges's blind daughter.Ms. Chevalier tells her story in a series of chapters that are narrated by each of the characters. Although the view point of the story changes with each chapter, the story does not suffer from the changes of view, but flows wonderfully. She masterfully weaves a story not only of how the tapestries are created, but a story of Claude's sexual awakenings and her desire for a man that she cannot have, a story of Alienor and how she does what she must so that she does not have to marry a man distasteful to her, Genivieve's life as a dutiful wife and mother despite the fact that she wants to become a nun, Georges struggle to complete the tapestries on time, and Christine's joy at being able to help weave the tapestries. It is truly amazing that she manages to pack so many plots and sub-plots into a book without totally confusing the reader, but she succeeds.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"After reading \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" last year and loving it, I decided I should check out more of the author's vivid writing style. This novel did not disappoint. Much like \\"Girl...\\" the book revolves around the creation of a great work of art, this time the famous Lady and the Unicorn cycle tapestries. (Which my copy of the book only had small cutouts in the front cover in which to view tapestries.) The rotating viewpoints (which I loved and wished they had touched on a few other characters as well) tell the story of Nicolas des Innocents who has been commissioned by the Parisian nobleman Jean Le Viste to design a series of large tapestries for his great hall. Nicolas ends up falling for Le Viste's young daughter, which only causes more problems. We follow the tapestries and the fascinating stories of the people creating them from Paris to Brussels and back. Good historical fiction recommendation."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I enjoyed learning about the process of weaving a tapestry and the many steps and time involved. The story was a little too much in the &#34;romantic genre&#34; for me."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The author cleverly combines history with fiction to create a fascinating story. She is very blunt when it comes to one character's desires, thoughts and activities. The story is told by several characters, each one taking a turn (or a few turns) describing the happenings from his or her viewpoint as the story progresses. At first I wasn't sure this method would work, but the author pulls it off magnificently. Not only does the story flow, but the reader is treated to intimate knowledge of each of these characters."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This novel had a few entertaining parts, but all in all I found it to be average. No, I wouild not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is a fascinating story that educates the reader about how a lissier - a tapestry weaver - works. It makes learning something fun, and brings a beautiful work of art to life with a nice story."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"One of the advantages of a reading circle is departing from one's normal reading matter. Hence I came to read my first (and definitely last) Tracy Chevalier novel. I know nothing of the Pearl Earring book or film. The poor imagery conjured up by the author does nothing to nourish the reader's soul. Many good reviews seem to mention the book's link with a real tapestry - just because a book has a real (art) artefact for inspiration does not make it a good work of fiction.In short, life is too short to waste it on prose such as this."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I enjoyed listening to this book very much! There is a male and a female narrator...unusual to have 2 narrators and it worked very well. I am not particularly knowledgeable about art, but found it extremely enjoyable to feel a part of the design and weaving process. The characters were fascinating. I would also enjoy reading this, but the audiobook really transported me."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I am an admirer of Chevalier's work and was most impressed in the past with her \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring.\\" Here, again she delves into the mysteries and possibilities brought to mind by a beautiful piece of art; in this case, a series of tapestries. Well-written and intriguing, with multiple-character narration and an amazing scheme of imagery, this is my new favorite Chevalier novel. Enjoy :-)"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier has made a living by weaving stories around famous legends or pieces of artwork. In \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", she continues this trend with a novel about a set of six tapestries created in France in the 15th century.The book follows the tapestries - and the lives they touch - from their creation to their completion, through Paris and Rome. Nicolas des Innocents is a Parisian artist obessessed wtih the legend of the unicorn's horn - and often lets his lust get the best of him. Claude Le Viste, the daughter of the nobleman commissioning the artworks, is a fourteen-year old girl who hasn't yet learned to walk the fine line between lust and duty. And Alienor De La Chappelle, a young Brussels weaver, is torn between obsession and duty.The tapestries take over the lives of these three individuals and everyone they meet, and Chevalier weaves their tales as seamlessly as the tapestries themselves are woven, in a beautiful tale of lust, obsession, and duty."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read THE LADY AND THE UNICORN in one sitting, on a plane ride to Europe, and couldn't put it down. History has always fascinated me, and the story of Claude, nobleman's daughter. I found it amazing how Tracy Chevalier was able to take one tapestry and create an entire story about it. She builds upon what is already known to create a piece of fiction that seems almost real unto itself. I always marvel at Chevalier's works, as her language is descriptive to a fault, and doesn't assume an air of modernity which can be found in many historical novels written in the present time. I thought this was a well crafted book, the way McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD is, or perhaps the novel GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. The writing is first-rate and right on the money. Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Another great book by Tracy Chevalier!!! I read Girl With the Pearl Earring a few months ago and loved it. I just had to read another book by Ms. Chevalier. This book was awesome! I can't wait to read another book by this author."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Lady and the Unicorn. I thought I might be disappointed after reading Girl with a Pearl Earring, as I was with Fallen Angels. The characters were interesting and the plot was a page-turner. I did not rate this book a 5 only because it was not as thought-provoking upon completion as I had anticipated. A good story - more of a great summer beach read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Boy, I wasn't ready for this one! Tracy Chevalier's tale of an artist and his dallying with the servants is a subtle study in power plays, moray of the past, and sexy and imaginative romps. First we have Nicholas who gets a commission to draw the sketches for tapestries. He's to do this for a nobleman and ends up falling in love with the nobelman's daughter. Then there's the housemaid who Nicholas can't keep his hands (and other body parts) off and out of. A compelling story with just enough spice, the excellent writing will remind you of \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" or possibly some of McCrae's books (think \\"Bark of the Dogwood). If you liked \\"Girl\\" you'll love this one. This books makes for a great escape on a cold autumn night.Also recommended: Any of the other Chevalier books and the novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This is a really well-written, beautifully descriptive, accurate, and exciting novel. Don't be put off by the fact that it's about a tapestry, because it's not a technical, boring book. It's all about the people that help create the tapestry.It takes place in 1490, in Paris, when a nobleman commissions Nicholas des Innocents to draw the designs for a tapestry. Nicholas is a bit of a womanizer; and after realizing on the 2nd page that the maid he slept with last time is pregnant, he turns around and falls in love with the nobleman's daughter, Claude. Claude can't marry him, so she is sent to a convent temporarily while Nicholas goes to Brussels to see the tapestry being made. Nicholas meets the weaver and his family, and falls in love with the weaver's blind daughter, Alienor. Although it sounds like a shallow love story, it is not. Each chapter is written by a different character; of course Nicholas, Claude, and Alienor have their chapters, but the weaver, the nobleman, and Claude's mother all have their own chapters that tell their stories and problems. Since Tracy Chevalier is such a skilled author, the chapters flow very well, even though the character voice shifts. The ending is spectacular; it ties up all of the loose ends very neatly, but doesn't give a cheesy, predictable ending.The descriptions in the book are gorgeous; you can immediately visualize the setting of late-medieval/early renaissance Europe. They are never too detailed that they slow the plot down. One word of caution: since the descriptions go into so much detail, that means that the love scenes are rather graphic. It seems like a fairly innocent book, but don't be fooled. It's definitely not porn or even close, but there are some scenes that can be a bit shocking if you're not expecting them. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, since this is an adult book, but in case you were thinking about it for a teen, you might want to choose a different book. It's a fabulous book, though, and I would recommend it to almost anyone, whether you like history or not."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The form of this book was what was most unique about it--each chapter is told by a different character. But aside from that, the writing also stood out. Tracy Chevalier is one of the most human and heart-felt authors I've come across in a long time. This story is funny, quirky, and well-told. Would also recommend the Life of Pi, Bark of the Dogwood, and Red Azalea."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Having seen the exquisite series of tapestries of La Dame et la licorne at the Cluny Museum in Paris, I thought this theme held great promise. What a huge disappointment! What trash! Here is an actual passage (and I am not making this up!): \\"Luckily Nicolas didn't have to answer, as he couldn't have spoken. I had placed my hand on his bulge, which was as hard as a tree branch. I had never touched one before.\\" And much more along the same lines, ad nauseum. I can't believe reviewers have given this 5 stars! Or any stars at all!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read several customer reviews before picking up this book. They weren't entirely complimentary, but I decided to read \\"the lady and the unicorn\\" anyway because lots of the negative reviewers loved chevalier's \\"girl with a pearl earring\\" and I didn't because of Griet's lackluster character. I thought this book was a better effort from Chevalier: the unicorn tapestries she chose as the subject of this novel were relatively unknown and interesting to hear about. The characters were a bit cliche, but I felt that they were more interesting to read about than Griet was. The worst character in the novel would probably have to have been Alienor. I thought it was ridiculous that she had an affair with Nicolas and wasn't even grateful to Philippe for saving her from her fate of marrying Jacques le Boeuf. She was cold and reminded me a bit of Griet. Many reviewers of this novel have said that the book is confusing because it is written from the perspectives of many characters in alternating chapters, but I didn't have any difficulty following the story. This was also a quick read, great for an airplane trip or something fairly light to read at the beach."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"While the title of this novel relates directly to the tapestries, this story was as much about who these characters are and how they change, as it is about the making of the tapestries. We are first introduced to Nicolas, the artist who is to make the designs for the tapestries. He is one of those types of people who like to surround himself with those who are better than he is. He becomes the go-between in this story between the Le Viste family (who the tapestries are being made for) and the Chapelle family (the weavers who are making the tapestry). These two worlds couldn't be more different. The Le Viste's live in France and are wealthy, while the Chapelle's live in Brussels and are artisans (though their shop does pretty well). One thing that the author did well was to illustrate the differences between these two classes of people.A decent amount of time is spent in describing what the tapestries look like, what they represent, and the process of making them. I have never made a tapestry before, nor have I seen one made, so this was a very interesting portion of the book. For a stretch of time the tapestries become almost another character. I definitely recommend taking a look at them online before or during reading this as the visual will really enhance the reading experience.Each chapter in this novel is narrated by a different character (from both families). Sometimes you would be able to see the same event from the perspective of the different characters - which enabled there to be a well rounded view of the events that transpired. I found myself being more interested in the chapters that we narrated by the female characters. I found the main character, Nicolas, to be whiney and mostly just chasing after the young girls. The female chapters just seemed to have more energy put into them by the author and felt more real.Overall, I thought this book was good, not excellent like A Girl With a Pearl Earring. There was a very different energy to this book, and I felt that it moved a lot slower. I can't even say that it was because it was more focused on the characters, because Pearl Earring was very focused on the development of the characters. I can't exactly put my finger on why but I just wasn't as thrilled with the story - it didn't leave me dying to get back to the book the next time I was in the car. I think that I am still going to read some of her other books, but this one doesn't exactly land on the top of my list."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Typically I love this author, but I did not care for this book. I didn't enjoy the characters nor connect with the plot, and I have loved reading about historical fiction for a long time. The way it was written from each characters' point of view did not appeal to me. I thought there were too many characters. This is my personal opinion. I would recommend Girl with a Pearl Earring, Fallen Angels, or The Virgin Blue over this one."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"My initial assessment of The Lady and the Unicorn remained true throughout the rest of the book: It was alright, but not the good piece of historical fiction I was expecting. The best parts were when we're taken to Brussels (home of the lissier and his family) and get inside the heads of the people who live there. Alienor was my favorite character, she's charming, stubborn, sympathetic, and independant. She makes her own future to save herself from a dismal life with a man she cannot stand. She is the true central part of this book, but she doesn't emerge until a third of the way through. If it had been more about her and her family, I think I would have liked it better.We're intially introduced to Jean Le Viste and his family; his daughter Claude is one of the main characters in the beginning, but a) she's not very likeable, and b) she disappears for the whole middle section of the book and only surfaces briefly once before the very end. Additionally, the character of Nicolas has some motivational problems. On one hand, he's an arogant, cheap womanizer who seduces anything with breasts and can't wait to \\"plow\\" Claude in her fathers house. On the other, he's a likeable, charming, struggling painter who saves Alienor from a life of misery. Make up your mind, fellow.I felt that the language was a little too obnoxious at parts, especially with the times of prayers and the holidays. Sext, May Day, Ascension Day, Candlemas? These mean nothing to me so it's hard to tell what the real passing of time is. I understand they're part of the language, so I got over it, but toward the end they resurfaced a lot. And the characters voices and language when they were talking to each other also seemed unrealistic at times.There's a clear plot device (petite Claude) that is meant to shock the reader; but we're not stupid and it falls flat. Overall, I wasn't a fan, nor was I wholly disappointed with this book. It wouldn't be the first one I'd recommed, but I've read worse. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The Lady and the Unicorn takes the few known facts about the famous tapestry series housed in the Musee Nationale du Moyen Age (Cluny) in Paris and from there imagines the people and events involved in their creation. If you have had the good fortune to see these tapestries yourself (not just the half-baked reproductions on cushion covers and coffee mugs), you know they are extraordinary. Tracy Chevalier's engaging, fast-paced story does them justice. The characters all have surprising depth for such a short book. Her use of shifting first-person narrative is highly suited to a tale about weaving. She skillfully incorporates a great deal of historical information about medieval life--tapestry weaving techniques and materials, marriage as a business arrangement, the role of women, craft guilds, attitudes about Jews and other outsiders, the snobbishness of the French towards the Belgians that persists to this day, class distinctions, and the predominance of the pre-Reformation church in society--without ever seeming didactic or slowing the pace of the narrative. The history, the characters and the plot fit together beautifully.Nicolas des Innocents, a handsome, conceited, talented artist who designs the unicorn tapestries, and his journey toward a degree of compassion and maturity, are at the center of the book. When he's introduced, he's focused on drink, women and having a good time, without any commitment to anyone or anything other than his art. He has no compunction over tossing a few coins at a maid he has impregnated and having nothing further to do with her. He becomes emotionally involved with four of the story's female characters and works them into the center of his tapestry designs: Genevieve, the bitter wife of the cold-hearted French nobleman who commissions the tapestries, rejected by her husband for bearing only daughters and finding comfort only in her church; Claude, Genevieve's passionate eldest daughter and the heiress of the family's fortune whose virginity must be preserved for her future husband at all costs; Alienor, the blind daughter of the owner of the Brussels workshop where the tapestries are woven; and Christine, Alienor's mother. Claude's family wants her to marry into a suitably noble family to preserve their fortune and improve their position in the court of the French king. Alienor's parents, who have a loving marriage themselves, reluctantly agree to marry Alienor to a vile-smelling brutal woad dyer she despises. (Woad dyers reek because they use fermented sheep's urine to fix blue dye in wool used by tapestry weavers.) They fear nobody other than a woad dyer will take a blind girl and they will get cheaper blue wool for their workshop. Nicolas finds a way to help Alienor out of her trouble and into a decent marriage, but as much as he and Claude want each other, and much as he hates to see her imprisoned in a loveless marriage, the difference in their social strata make it impossible for him to have her or help her.The story of Nicolas and the women he comes to care about is set against the backdrop of the weaving of the tapestries in the Brussels workshop. Chevalier makes this process fascinating and exciting in the way she combines historical and technical detail with a race against an almost impossible deadline.Chevalier is not writing in or about Victorian England. Some of the material is quite graphic, and may not be to all tastes.Chevalier's writing is clear and simple, but not simplistic. She shows remarkable insight into all of her narrators' characters and traits. Her portrayal of the blind Alienor's ways of perceiving and functioning in her world is particularly masterful. Sometimes a great deal of detail in a book can seem like the author showing off or talking for the joy of hearing herself and have the reader skipping on to where something happens. Not so with this book. Chevalier's details all show us something interesting about the characters' personalities, passions, lives and work. On a few occasions I was annoyed because she ended a sentence with a preposition when doing so was not necessary or used other unorthodox grammar, but that's a minor quibble. As the unicorn tapestries create a richly textured world for the viewer, Chevalier creates a richly textured world for the reader. Well done, and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I love historic fiction and needlework, and this is a super read for anyone who enjoys either one. I purchased it as a gift for a friend who enjoys medieval reenactment and also weaves, and she just LOVED it!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book was interesting, I really enjoyed how the author wove (no pun intended) her fiction of the characters around the tapestries - I especially loved the color plates in the center which I went back to examine over and over again throughout my reading. I also thought it was really clever having each chapter be from a different character's first person view. My favorite character's chapters were those of Alienor. This mechanism really tied the story together and I think deepened the reader's affection for some characters that were not too well-developed.However, a criticism I have of this book was of Nicholas des Innocents ridiculously insatiable libido. First of all, the author does not describe him as a particularly attractive, personable or intelligent man. However, the women are ready to throw themselves at him with little more than a word from him (and in Claude's case, sight unseen!!!) It seems a tad improbable.....Also, I understand that some bawdy language needed to be used to fully describe some of the encounters and thoughts that Nicholas had, but honestly, some parts ended up downright raunchy! Ultimately, these descriptions seemed out of place with the rest of the language of this novel. It felt like the author was trying too hard, purposely going out of her way to use profanity and overly explicit phrases to prove a point....I think she made the point, but went too far. She should have been more discreet and left more to the imagination...In the end, I'm happy to have read this work and will read more by this author, I think her imaginitive story lines are a breath of fresh air in the current books of the times...."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book had me hooked. I couldn't put it down and even when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to reading it. I had never heard of these tapestries before and reading this book got me researching them to get a good look. No one really knows much about them, but Chevalier has been inspired to write this amazing story using them as her inspiration. I wish there had been pictures of them in the book so I could've referenced them as she described them. Chevalier told the story by using each character's perspective. The \\"artist's\\", the \\"weaver\\", the \\"weaver's daughter\\", etc. They all had depth to them that made you at least interested in them even if you loved or hated them. It would be intriguing to know the true story about these tapestries, but Chevalier did a great job imagining her own."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I must have looked at the inserted reproductions of the tapestries at least a hundred times while reading the book. Afterwards, I looked them up on the Internet to see if I could find out more. I like a book that inspires me to read other things. Just like Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, I appreciate the imagination laced with reality. There is a plethora of intriguing art that could benefit from such a treatment; I hope Chevalier keeps up the good work."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"After indulging myself in the highly acclaimed Girl With a Pearl Earring, I thought it my duty to pick up another Tracy Chevalier book. I got my hands on \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\".This book is a must read and awakens the long lost romantic in you. A tale of forbidden romance, true desires, intrigue, and chosen paths, \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" beautifully weaves together a unique tapestry of its own, with threads of art, history, and luminous fiction that combine.\\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is a masterpiece. The characters' emotions are rich and their point of views are expressed extraordinarily.Story plot is A + with delicious suspense and intrigue all its own. The book was a page turner and Chevalier succeeds in the reader putting themselves in the character's places-and not wanting to leave. The story was realistic but mixed with a fantasy found in classics such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. A sexy, passionate fairy-tale- \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" dazzles.Awakening longings and passions, the book is unique and one-of-a kind just like Chevalier's talents. Tracy Chevalier, you are a star. The book is a product of pure romantic genius.If you want to know the high points in this book, there are quite a few. To name, every word is worth reading. Unlike most books, in which we do occassionally skip a few words here and there and rush to the climaxes, \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", has surprises lingering in every corner and moments that take your breath away on every page. Tracy Chevalier creates beautiful words and knows how to write story that never dulls. Another high point is that the story itself is a work of art. It floats in your head days after you have finished and you cannot wait to read it again. But what really stands out in this tale is how complex the characters are. Chevalier writes as if she knew these people or if she was one of them; every single one of the characters are surprisingly life-like.If they don't make a film out of this remarkable tale, they are crazy. It is truly a modern fairy tale.~A Look Inside Its Pages~In the heart of 15th century Paris, dwelled a handsome artist, Nicolas des Innocents who was often praised for capturing the simple yet breath taking beauty of women. However, he was notorious for his acid charm and luring women with a quite naughty story about unicorns. When summoned to do a tapestry of a war for the wealthy, ornery noble Jean le Viste, he comes across his eldest daughter Claude le Viste, who to him was the most beautiful girl he had ever laid eyes on. Seducing her with his story of the unicorn, Claude also falls in love with him. But their is love is forbidden because Claude is promised to another wealthy noble rather than a foolish artist. Caught rendez-vousing under the table, Claude's mother: the somber, pious Genevieve de Nanterre banished Claude from the household to a convent-kept far from the infamous Nicolas des Innocents.Nicolas, not knowing the first thing about war, persuaded Jean le Viste with the permission of his wife to draw unicorns instead. The reason to draw unicorns was Claude being the heir had something to enjoy rather than a bloody war.Since the tapestries indeed had to be weaved, Nicolas insisted on \\"chaperoning\\" the cartoonist who blows up his drawing to a decent size, Nicolas being the rather cocky one. Nicolas stays with the Chapelles, a family of weavers and not before long their blind yet gifted daughter Alienor de la Chapelle catches his interests.In contrast to the spoiled, flirty, and rebellious Claude, Alienor was a shy, reserved young woman whose life was now in jeapordy when promised to Jaques le Beouf. Alienor disocovers a whole new world with Nicolas where she can feel and enjoy something in which she does not need her eyes.These aren't the only characters in the book. There are many including Genevieve, Alienor's parents, and more and the story is told in all of their amazingly rich, descriptive point of views."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"A subtle blend of fact and fiction, &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; is an exquisitely written and cleverly plotted book about the creation of the six bewitching and fascinating Le Viste tapestries. And although &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; may not be quite as lyrical as &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; nor anywhere as dark as &quot;The Virgin Blue,&quot; &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; still does make for compelling and engrossing reading -- I simply had to finish it in one sitting.In 1490, Jean Le Viste, a powerful and rich man who has the King of France's confidence but who more or less bought his way into the aristocracy with money and a good marriage, has decided to commission a set of tapestries in order to proclaim his wealth and power. Nicholas des Innocents, a talented, arrogant and rakish young man, is the artist that has been chosen to do the paintings upon which the tapestries would be based. Jean le Viste would like them to be of battle scenes from the Battle of Nancy. A quiet talk with the lady of the house, Genevieve de Nanterre, however gives Nicholas the idea of making the tapestries tell, instead, the story of the Lady and the unicorn. What follows is how Nicholas and the weavers in Belgium work together on the details that will make these tapestries a magical work of art; how Nicholas affects the lives of the men (and in particular) the women around him (like Genevieve de Nanterre, her beautiful and lively daughter, Claude; Christine du Sablon, the weaver's wife and her daughter, Alienor); and how the drive to realize the full magic of these tapestries will affect them all...Tracy Chevalier is one of those rare authours who is able to tell a tale in a rich and vivid manner and yet not use a prose style that is either overly florid or flamboyant. Her prose style is actually quite sparse and stark, and yet, in spite of this, she is able to capture completely how busy and colourful life and the cities of Paris and Brussels must have been in the late fifteenth century. The plot for &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; was well paced and carefully constructed; but one of the high points of this novel (for me anyway) was the brilliant manner in which she was able to bring the various characters in her book to life in spite of the fact that much of her character portrayals were merely thumbnail sketches at times. But best of all was &quot;watching&quot; how the legend of the lady and the unicorn was being played out again in the interactions between Nicholas and his various ladies, and &quot;seeing&quot; how the six tapestry portrayals of the lady corresponded with what was going on in actuality. Intriguing and enthralling, &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; is a read not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I didn't think Tracy Chevalier could top herself after Girl With a Pearl Earring, but I was wrong. The Lady and the Unicorn was every bit as exhilarating, and for me, even more indulgent. I loved every second of this book from beginning to end and can't wait to see what else Chevalier has in store.The Lady and the Unicorn tells the story of six real medieval tapestries that presently hang in a museum in Paris. Chevalier has created a fictional account of how these tapestries came to be -- who commissioned, designed and weaved them, and what is the meaning behind them. Opening the book with the designer, Nicolas des Innocents, a randy bloke with a roving eye, Chevalier's story begins with a mighty leap.Each chapter is told by a different character which allows the reader to see the story from all sides. However, there is more to this novel than the six famous tapestries -- Chevalier has weaved one of her own, one that was entertaining and full-of-life. I will read this book again!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I loved Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but this book is not as well-written or enjoyable. The main problem is that the central characters are not likable. Who can sympathize with either a randy, pompous artist or a silly, unthinking girl, or an art patron who can't even see his wife's face in paintings? In Pearl Earring, both Griet and Vermeer are appealing and likable, and we care what happens to them. Plus, in Pearl Earring, the sexual tension is palpable, and I as a reader wanted to know what happened between them. Here, the sex is in-your-face and I didn't care what happened to these characters. Chevalier can do better!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I just read The Lady and The Unicorn for the second time, and was so enchanted I had to review it.Readers of the Girl with a pearl earring will be delighted, the book is much in the same vein, but with multiple points of view instead of just one (still all in first person of course.) It's about the creation of the famous lady and the unicorn tapestries, which to be honest, I never heard of before reading this book.I finally tacked down what I like so much about Tracy Chevalier while reading this book. And that is this: everything she writes about is ordinary. None of her characters are star crossed lovers (though they may be in love) or great heroines. They are real ordinary people who are truly living in the time period she placed them (The weaver even thought he had never seen a unicorn, but then they lived in the east with elephants!) Because of this her books are immensely comforting to read...like, reading about old friends.A lot of people give this book bad reviews because of the romantic aspects. I think everyone who is critical of this book should read it and not judge it, once through. If you still don't like it then you can complain. But really, I love it, and think others will too. It's a simply written little masterpiece.My only complaint is that in the tapestries pictures in the middle of the book the whole of each tapestry isn't shown-you can only see the ladies and the unicorn, which I suppose is appropriate."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book was very good and different. I loved the idea of the story and was totally taken away to a very different time in history. It really was a very sensual story. I was captivated and kept looking at the inside cover at the tapestry. I would definatly recommend this quick read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Having read The Girl with the Pearl Earring, I couldn't wait to read another one of Tracy Chevalier's wonderful novels. She writes with such beautiful prose, and her stories based on famous paintings are wonderful. The Lady and the Unicorn is another tour de force by this author. This novel is based on a series of large tapestries known as The Lady and the Unicorn (currently on display in Paris's Cluny Museum). Parisian aristocrat Jean Le Viste hires artist Nicolas des Innocents to design the tapestries for his large hall. No sooner does Nicolas begin work than he meets Jean Le Viste's beautiful daughter. Intense passion ensues between the two, but their class differences keep them apart. It is through the tapestries that they express their feelings for one another. There are various clever moments and beautifully crafted fourteenth century references throughout the novel.This is one of the most beautiful novels I have read. Chevalier mixes historical references and forbidden romance with a compelling story. The love story between Nicolas and Claude enthralled me from beginning to end. Chevalier is a truly creative author. I learned some very interesting things about the famous tapestries and got a wonderful story to boot. I loved Girl with a Pearl Earring, but The Lady and the Unicorn showcases Chevalier's writing talent to full advantage. I recommend this beautiful novel. For I think it is a marvelous piece of art all its own."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier's latest novel, The Lady and the Unicorn tells the story of a set of tapestries, from the conception of the idea to the display of the finished work. Interwoven with these tapestries emerges the stories of several people, all involved in some way with the story of the Lady and the Unicorn and the tapestries that depict it.The novel is both well-written and well-told, using the first person narration, while changing narrators back and forth with each chapter. This could have been a clunky method, but Chevalier has made each transition seamless and easy to follow.Though I won't say this is my favorite Chevalier novel (Girl with a Pearl Earring holds that place) it is a wonderful novel, both in plot and writing. Chevalier continues to write with an easy, reader-friendly style, though I can see subtle changes that speak of a maturing writer. I highly recommend The Lady and the Unicorn, as well as other three novels."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier loves the arts and history and has presented another volume of very readable fiction, as told by the characters themselves. This is Chevalier's finesse, 1st person narrative, and getting involved with Nicolas des Innocents, the miniaturist who becomes the originating artist for this famous tapestry series, is an intimate way to learn what Chevalier imagines to be their story.I especially enjoy 1st person stories and as Chevalier alternates characters and their individual version, she once again weaves a good tale. There is a marvelous sense of the world of commissioned art, art for propaganda's sake. And Jean Le Viste, the powerful right hand man of the King of France, represents all the power brokers of history who seek further self-glorification by the display of their \\"priceless things\\".It was fascinating living among the Brussels weavers and coming to understand the magnitude of their task. One almost feels their physical discomfort and certainly the realities of a labor intensive craft. Having studied the importance of weavers throughout history, I was especially pleased to see Chevalier's casting of the guild system that controlled the work of Georges, Christine, their son, and workers, as well as their blind daughter, Alienor.The cad that Nicolas appears to be mellows within a short time, but his impact on all the lives of those who implement the lady tapestries is fascinating. There are lovely ironies in all the secrets that Nicolas causes to finally be exposed. Especially nice is Chevalier's epilogue which ties up the loose ends, just as the weavers finished off their work.Very clever, this Chevalier woman. Wonder which historical period she will novelize next? I shall be waiting with her other fans.The hardback edition of this book is simply beautiful with its blue dust jacket that cuts away to reveal tapestry glimpses, when just under it lies the glory of a full color display. What a special delivery! It makes a lovely presentation worthy of the value of the original works themselves."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I loved 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' and was excited to see that Chevalier had a new book out. I bought it on the spot without even giving it a second thought. My instincts were not wrong. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Each chapter is devoted to the point of view of a different character, yet the story flows in a sequential order and is easy to follow. I love anything written in the first person narrative and enjoyed having each character tell me their own story so that I could &quot;meet&quot; each one individually. Definitely, an interesting style of storytelling. The text, itself, was easy and quick to read. Can easily be read in a couple of days. I am eagerly looking forward to Ms. Chevalier's next endeavor."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read this book a few months back and I still think of it, meaning it left an impression.Like Girl with the Pearl Earring, the prose are absolutely tight and seemless, with very few snags to jar the reading.Honestly, I find it irritating when a book changes between characters, because I get wrapped up in one. This book was an exception. Each character had a distinct voice and each wove into the others' lives, like, what else? A tapestry.I felt for all of the characters and, like Girl with the Pearl Earring, this story created in me the feeling that there was some underlying power at work, something bigger than the characters. Nice."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I loved the idea of The Lady and the Unicorn--the time period, the changing points of view, a fiction inspired by a real work of art--and I have enjoyed previous novels by Tracy Chevalier.But Chevalier's writing is getting pretty sloppy. She overwrites and tells the reader what she means instead of showing the reader. For example, she feels the need to tell the reader reapeatedly and explicitly how obsessed the daughter of the nobleman is with the painter, when she could have shown it with the actions of the characters to much better and more subtle effect. It is as if she does not trust her reader to figure it out.Her writing in this novel has also begun to verge on soft porn--meant to excite but not really exciting, perhaps just a ploy to reel in readers. The almost soft porn might be okay, except that it is not believable--I do not believe that some of these characters in these times would do such things so quickly and easily, without a second thought."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"As all her books, The Lady and the Unicorn, was a very light and enjoyable read. I like her characters and the historic setting. It is a perfect book if you want something in between some heavier or more challenging books."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The Lady and the Unicorn reminded me of the bawdy stories in the Decameron and the Canterbury Tales translated into a novel about the creation of the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries. With each chapter the narrator shifts so you get a better sense of each character's personality and history.The book has two remarkable strengths that were not sustained throughout. First, the book opens with constant surprises. Each chapter quickly takes you off in a new direction that makes the book's development a delight. Second, you receive a nice briefing on how tapestries were conceived, commissioned, designed and executed. If the book had continued its focus on these elements, this would have been a remarkably good book. But, alas, the story bogged down into too much detail about the fictional lives of the tapestry makers and the commissioner's family. Those shifts turned an intriguing book into a soap-opera like story line. Ultimately, the book resolves its tensions in ways that few will find pleasing or very interesting. So you go from a five star opening to about a two star ending. But the beginning is so brilliant that you should read the book. For happiest reading, you can stop after page 126.Every good novel has at least one arresting character. In The Lady and the Unicorn that character is Alienor de la Chapelle. I won't say more because you should read about her to form your own opinions. But do be on the lookout when she appears in the book.Nicolas des Innocents, the artist, on the other hand is a pig. I would have enjoyed the story more if he had been a spiritually uplifted character rather than a rou&eacute;.Find beauty all around you!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"It's easy to imagine that &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; sounded better as a proposal to Ms. Chevalier's publishers than it actually turned out. After all, Tracy Chevalier scored a fabulous hole-in-one with her &quot;Girl with A Pearl Earring&quot;, an interesting look at the obscure painter Vermeer through the eyes of his servant girl.Once again, the author has picked a piece of famous art familar to anyone who ever took a college art history class and come up with a background story about how it might have been created. Almost nothing is known about the &quot;Unicorn&quot; tapestries, except the name of the family that commissioned them in the late 15th century, so there was little to restrict the direction of the story.But this is a choppy and boring tale, with many anachronisms that are jarring. Unable to focus in on a particular character (like Griet in &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring), Ms. Chevalier jumps between six different characters, making it hard to follow. There is little the writing to distinguish which of the characters is &quot;speaking&quot; and I found I had to continually skip back to see whose chapter it was (the typesetting could have included headers with the names of the characters, which would have been very helpful, but alas not). The main character SEEMS to be Nicolas Des Innocentes, a Renaissance painter of miniatures who designs the tapestries and who is a notorious womanizer, but he is drawn so vapidly that I couldn't even figure out how old he was supposed to be -- young horndog or middle-aged lecher?There is a family of weavers, including a blind young girl who improbably is able to WEAVE and distinguish colors by feel (I have a hard time accepting this) and a noblewoman and her 14-year old daughter. There is a feeling throughout the book that the author wants to show how lustful the female characters are -- to counterbalance the seductiveness of Nicholas -- but this comes off as much too contemporary. The book fails to address the sheltered, deeply religious society that existed in the 1400s and also fails to deal with the serious ramifications of illegitmacy. Because we accept female sexuality today and happily embrace children born out of wedlock, that does NOT mean this was the case hundreds of years ago. Political correctness does not make for a good or convincing historical novel.The least I would have wanted from &quot;Lady and the Unicorn&quot; would have been a detailed introduction to the intricacies of tapestry weaving and the lives of the people who did this incredibly detailed work, day in and day out, for generations. But the book falls flat on this account...the description of the actual weaving is so vague that I wondered if the author was describing WEAVING or embroidery.There are about dozen too many references to the sexual iconography of the Unicorn (his &quot;horn&quot; being a symbolic penis) and the euphemism &quot; to plow&quot; is used far too often to describe sexual intercourse. I didn't find the book as coarse as some other reviewers did -- I thought the actual love scenes were pretty tame stuff -- but they are emphasized over and above character development or even the story of the making of the tapestry.I think one flaw as compared to the far better &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is that Vermeer, for all his mystery, was a real person. Nicholas Des Innocents is an obvious, one-note invention. As a real human being, Vermeer had a home, wife, children...not just his paintings. Nicholas doesn't convince us as a painter or artist, and doesn't seem multi-faceted enough to keep us intrigued in his story. He's like a caricature of the artist as a horny reprobate, a social outsider without ties to the larger community. Actually, that is another pretty modern concept -- the artist as outsider -- and not particularly true in the Renaissance, when an artist was as likely to be married and have a family as a carpenter or other craftsman.The worst flaw that just kept nagging at me though was this -- the young noblewoman, Claude (who is so sexually precocious you'd think she was from Beverly Hills and not 15th century France) refers to her pet bird as a &quot;parakeet&quot;. Parakeets are indigenous to Australia. I am pretty certain they did not exist in Europe until the 19th century. This is an annoying piece of very poor research on the author's part, and indicative of the poor scholarship and historical feel of the whole book.In conclusion: not recommended...there are much better historical books about this period out there."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This novel is a colorful, good, uncomplicated, well thought out and feisty read. Although it is not Earth shaking, it has all the elements that would make a good movie. The bottom line is that I enjoyed it, particular the fact the story is developed and interwoven from the perspective of its main characters; each one coloring the story-line with individual insights.The story is indeed about the art of tapestry weaving and takes place in medieval France and Belgium. In this respect the novel is very informative and presents a vivid picture of the work involved in tapestry weaving and the believable life styles of the novel's characters at this period of history.Some of the male character's development in the novel was a little labored to my thinking, with some common exaggerated male crudery thrown in from time to time for effect. And yet, in contrast, and I could be wrong, I also felt a too light a touch from a feminine hand in this respect in the writing.As I said, this novels is a good read and I would recommend it for a relaxed, uncomplicated weekend."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"\\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is the second Tracy Chevalier novel that I've read, and I wasn't all that impressed with it. The story centers around Nicolas des Innocents, a 15th-century painter of ill repute who is commissioned to design a series of tapestries for a weathly Parisian nobleman, Jean Le Viste. Nicholas immediately finds himself drawn to Le Viste's daughter, Claude. The couple's passion is forbidden, and Chevalier then branches out by dividing the narration of the book between a handful of characters who are all struggling with their own unrecognized desires.This is an interesting story, but I wasn't nearly as wrapped up in it as I was with \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring.\\" The characters are all rather forgettable and the main protagonist is very unlikeable, so it was difficult to really get excited about the story. If readers pick up \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" with the expectation that it will be as good as other Chevalier books they've read, then they'll be in for a disappointment.I need to comment on the physical attributes of the book itself. The hardcover edition of \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is a beautiful book to LOOK AT. When you remove the book jacket, you'll discover that the glossy cover of the book depicts several scenes from the actual Lady and the Unicorn tapestries that are currently on display in a Paris museum. The paper also has an old-fashioned quality to it, making this a beautiful book to add to your collection. The best thing about the book is its actual design...I wish I could say more about the story itself!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"THE LADY AND THE UNICORN is another very imaginative story by Tracy Chevalier who also wrote GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Chevalier consistently writes very unique stories. This book has a sense of realism that made me feel as if I was seeing a glimpse into the Middle Ages.The author has woven her story around the very real Lady and the Unicorn Tapestries that are presently in a Paris museum. The artisans and artist who created them are unknown. Chevalier creates the artist in the form of Nicholas des Innocents, a talented and handsome man. He's commissioned by a wealthy Parisian nobleman to design tapestries for his great hall. Before he leaves France, Nicholas falls in love with the nobleman's daughter. When Nicholas goes to Brussels we're introduced to the family of weavers who do the actual work in the creation of the tapestries. There the artist meets another young girl, this time, the weaver's daughter. Some characters seem to become intertwined into the work of the tapestries.A very interesting part of the story was the influence and power that the weaver's guild had over the lives of their workmen. In fact, women were not allowed to do any of the actual weaving. This is a rich and haunting story."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Ahhhhh, this book is sooooo good. I loved it and gobbled it up so quickly, I was sad when I finished. It is romantic and gentle and violent and crazy all at the same time and its about tapestries! Who'd have thought it could be so funny and sad and surprising all at the same time. I definitely recommend this book, it is a great summer read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Like Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, which draws its story from a Vermeer painting, THE LADY AND THE UNICORN draws its story from another piece of art, this time a medieval tapestry. The story is set in 15th century Brussels and Paris, but to call it a merely a historical novel does it a disservice. It is much more a history lesson. The story is rich in characterization illustrating the contrasts of the social class system in place at that time. Artist Nicolas des Innocents is commissioned by a rich patron to design a set of six tapestries. The story moves between the noble household in Paris and the merchant-class household of a master-weaver in Brussels. Nicolas ends up changing every life with which he has contact including his own. Much of the story is immortalized in the tapestries."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I was looking forward to the next Chevalier offering; of course, having read all of her former books,THE VIRGIN BLUE,FALLING ANGELS,and the haunting GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING.So? What did I delve into? A short book with anti-heroes/heroines.....thoroughly unlikeable main characters; a tedious recounting of how a tapestry is woven; and a plot so unbelievable that I, a life-long student and teacher of European history could hardly countenance the odd twists and turns. A sexual encounter under a table? Profligate violations of Guild rules? And happenstance pregnancies that presume to add to the story line? It was too much to swallow. Bottom line is that this author is grasping at a momentary glimpse of fame and she had better get her act together before she publishes, or is published, again. Sorry I bought it; and it's a give-a-way to anyone who wants it! Any takers?"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Chevalier is an author with an inventive eye for historical detail, choosing themes from the past, always with a connection to art, imbuing them with the lively interactions and complexities that bring history to life. In The Lady and the Unicorn, the author selects a set of 15th century tapestries created for a nobleman, Jean LeViste, who at first plans to adorn the walls of his elegant Parisian home with scenes of the Battle of Nancy.However, the cooler vision of his wife prevails and LeViste commissions the artist Nicolas des Innocents to render a scene of a lady seducing a unicorn; later the paintings are adapted by a lissier and his staff in a Brussels studio, featuring the popular design of the times, the millefleurs, tiny flowers woven into the background, creating a field of color. Nicolas experiences some trepidation at his new commission, but is finally seduced by the promise of work and the beauty of one of LeViste's daughter's, Claude, a woman far above his social standing.In alternating chapters over a period of two years, from the first paintings to the weaver's workshop in Brussels, the story is told in a variety of voices, the protagonists: Nicolas des Innocents, the artist hopelessly enamored of the betrothed noblewoman, Claude LeViste; the lady herself; the family of weavers, Georges de LaChappelle, his wife and blind, but beautiful daughter, Alienor; and the man who has loved Alienor since their childhood, Philippe de LaTour.Two love stories unfold as the artist's paintings are transformed into the lush tapestries that capture the admiration of Parisian nobility. From the larger-than-life architecture of Paris to the small Brussels studio where the tapestries are meticulously woven and the isolated convent where a young woman's virginity is protected from the intrusions of the world, Chevalier once again turns art into life, her characters brimming with the exuberance of love, tempered by the strict social mores of a highly structured society. The pieces depicting the lady's seduction of the unicorn become a vehicle for the thwarted passions of those fated to fall in love, weaving yet another contextual layer into an already magnificent work of art, threads that connect the lovers and bind them forever.Chevalier's m&eacute;tier is historical fiction, her deft prose juxtaposing believable characters with artistic endeavor. The author's vivid imagery is impressive, the scenes authentic and fine-tuned, the novel a small jewel that reawakens the past, restoring all to life before fading once more into the pages of history. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"In this, another novel revolving around the story behind a famous work of art, Chevalier sets her spotlight on the famed 14th century \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" tapestries on display in the Cluny Museum in Paris. She does an admirable job, creating a cast of characters that inspire, conceive and successfully execute these beautiful weavings to perfection.Behind it all is Nicolas des Innocentes, a woman's court minaturist with more than a lustful eyes for the ladies. Commissioned to create a battle scene, he convinces his patron to approve of a series of panels depicting the famed story of a woman seducing a unicorn. For Nicholas, the story is one he tells often in baudy double entendre meant to seduce the daughter of the house of his patron. Claude, the intended victim, falls precariously to his charms, but before Nicholas has the opportunity to sow this one wild oat, Genevieve, Claude's mother, finds a way to move Claude safely out of Nicholas' sights.Instead Nicholas finds himself in Brussels, where the second cast of characters, the family of Georges de la Chappelle, explains their part in the creation of the tapestries and the influence the appearance of Nicholas des Innocentes has on all their lives.I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel and found the performances to be admirable. Chevalier uses different characters to narrate different chapters so a more valid story is revealed rather than one told by only one point of view. The actual process necessary to create tapestry from painting is related in fascinating detail.Although by no means as compelling a masterpiece as \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring, \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" nevertheless successfully weaves a set of interesting \\"What-ifs\\" that are reminiscent in their no-holes-barred bawdiness of the Canterbury Tales in content and depiction of the age. As little is known about the tapestries, I can only commend Ms Chevalier on her inventiveness and ask her to conceive and write quickly as her ever increasing fan base increases with each art conception novel she writes."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I have never had any interest in tapestries. Having read all the great reviews, I was curious if I'd find The Lady and the Unicorn interesting at all, or if I would be ground into sleep with boredom over the topic.I needn't have worried. The author's writing style is excellent, and as she switches from the point of view of one character after another, describing the process of creating an elaborate tapestry, the suspense builds. How can a book about tapestry have you on the edge of your seat? Hard to say. Amazingly, it did, and I finished the book in a couple of days.Then I went to Google to see if I could find an image of the tapestry described in the book.The book starts from the point of view of a painter who was commissioned by a wealthy nobleman to create a tapestry. He's a scoundrel, and the first thing we learned is that he already impregnated one of this nobleman's servants during an earlier visit. He can't recall her name.He's smitten with the nobleman's daughter, and she with him, and throughout the book a good part of the story involves the daughter's family going to great lengths to keep them apart.We shift to the family of the weaver in Brussels who was commissioned to weave the tapestry. The drama there is in the short deadline he's been given, the fact that he's being ruined by the cost of creating the tapestry versus not being paid enough for it, and his blind daughter who is (unbeknownst to her) betrothed to a man with a stench she can smell days before he arrives.The scoundrel painter intermingles with the weaver and his family, who doesn't want him near their daughter any more than the nobleman wanted the painter near his. In his own way, that painter saves the day for the blind daughter, and gets his comeuppence at the end of the book.Sigh. Great story, very satisfying ending, and how did the author do it?At any rate, I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"It's tough to follow a novel like \\"Girl With the Pearl Earring.\\" I imagine it was Chevalier's hope to be able to weave as rich a tale with the art of tapestry making as she did with making a world-famous painting come vibrantly alive. The tapestry-based tale is only a mildly successful attempt at weaving families, politics, artisans and a class system.It's interesting to learn how tapestries were made, what went into them both thematically, materials and labor wise. However, there just wasn't enough story to produce the envisioned results...tapestries that both adorn the walls of the wealthy and that are also representative of and intertwined with myth, characters, skills and history.Instead we get artist on the make (non-stop); young maidens on various socio-economic levels who succumb to his charms; artisans operating on the whims and commissions of the monied and the mid-level managers who do the bidding of the wealthy.There were a few redeeming parts of the story however. One being Nicholas des Innocents somehow coming off his high horse and recognizing the natural beauty of some of the women around him. An \\"aha moment\\", one presumes, results in Nicholas'changing his original paintings so that the eventual tapestries reflecting his artwork would capture the more common women's beauty rather than that of the two higher born ladies who would have originally graced the tapestries.This much-anticipated novel was a disappointment. \\"Girl With the Pearl...\\" and \\"Fallen Angels\\" were far more successful. This seemed like a tepid attempt to return to a more successful, a tried and true, mode of telling a story. Interesting process (tapestry making); not so interesting tale."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Another great book by Tracy Chevalier. The story telling is different in this book in that the story is told from several different character's view points which makes it even more fun to read. In that sense reminded me of Orhan Pamuk's &quot;My Name is REd&quot; which is very similar. If you like historical fiction Chevalier is incredible. It is definitely a very quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"As she did so successfully in &#65533;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&#65533; Chevalier contemplates a work of art and imagines the story behind its creation. For this novel, she has chosen the famous medieval tapestries, which appear to show a lady&#65533;s seduction of a unicorn (now hanging in a Paris museum).The story opens in 1490 Paris. Nicolas des Innocents, a talented, arrogant artist, receives a commission for bloody battle tapestries from Jean le Viste, a nouveau aristocrat, rich and important at court, but a man of little taste. Glad for the work, but uninspired by the subject, Nicolas welcomes the distraction of a beautiful young girl summoning him to le Viste&#65533;s wife.Assuming the girl to be a maid, Nicolas embarks on his usual seduction (one le Viste maid is already big with his child), which involves a suggestive unicorn story. The girl responds encouragingly until her mother &#65533; le Viste&#65533;s wife, Genevieve - interrupts them. Nicolas blanches at his mistake &#65533; the girl, Claude, could ruin him &#65533; but the mother, in her own way, soon enthralls him.A sad beauty, unhappy in her marriage, longing for a nun&#65533;s life, Genevieve subtly points out that battle tapestries are unsuitable in the hall of a man who has never been to war. She suggests a lady and a unicorn theme instead. Had she heard him with Claude? She seems pleased with herself and leaves it to him to convince her husband. Which he knows he must.Nicolas flatters le Viste into agreement and leaves, but the damage is done. Claude, already chafing at her restricted life, becomes obsessed with the artist &#65533; and he with her. Not that that prevents him from trying his luck with the blind daughter of the Brussels weaver commissioned to transform his gorgeous paintings of Claude and Genevieve with the unicorn.Chevalier moves the narrative between sophisticated Paris and provincial Brussels, from weaver&#65533;s workshop to Paris boudoir to cloistered convent. The narration switches among the characters, allowing them to reveal themselves and their views of the others.The weaving sections are particularly textural, giving a vivid feel for the Guild-structured workshop, the intricacy and pride of the work, and the tension as pressure in the workshop mounts. Details of social conventions &#65533; clothing, the conventions of servants, women, Jews, merchants, nobles &#65533; are fresh and immediate. And the story is steeped in sexual tension. Chevalier has another winner."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This book tells Tracy Chevalier's made up story of a very real set of tapestries featuring several ladies and a unicorn that now sit at the Musee National du Moyen-Age Thermes de Cluny in Paris. The novel is set in Paris during the Middle Ages, takes us through the creation of the tapestries and the lives they effect, beginning with Nicolas des Innocents, who is anything but, and the women in his life. The story is woven as the tapestries and the lives of the characters.The tale is skillfully and artfully told. The writing is beautiful as the millefiore described in the art. The historical details are fascinating as is the journey through making the tapestries. This book is hard to put down. I loved this one almost as much as Girl with the Pearl Earring, and that is saying a lot because it is one of my all time favorite books.My book club also loved it."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I've come across three books recently that I absolutely loved: The Life of Pi, Bark of the Dogwood, and this book--The Lady and the Unicorn.Of all these, &quot;Lady&quot; is my favorite. It may be soft-porn, but it does not fail to please. Tracy Chevalier is remarkable. All the characters in &quot;Lady&quot; are deftly drawn with subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences. And the entire work really is &quot;woven&quot; together.Also recommended: McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries are a series of six pieces, each depicting the unicorn becoming more comfortable in the lady's prescence. This novel explores the possible conception and completion of those tapestries. That which interested me more than anything were the descriptions of weaving techniques and weavers' guild rules and regulations(no weaving by women permitted!!). What took place between Nicholas and Claude can hardly be called a love affair; a brief fling under the dining room table does not an affair make. The time that Nicholas spends in Brussles with the weaver and his family makes up for anything lacking elsewhere in the book. All in all, the tale is woven as neatly as the tapestries themselves."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I absolutely love this author, but I would not say this is one of my favorite books she has written. At times, you loose touch with the characters. If you have never read any of her books, I would suggest The Girl with the Pearl Earring or The Virgin Blue. However, I did enjoy this book, and it is worth a read."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier is the kind of author who could easily be criticized, and easily adored all at the same time. Her stories and plots and general characters seem to be repeated in all of her books, save Girl With A Pearl Earring. Pear Earring is on such a higher pedestal than the others, I cannot bring myself to compare them. However, I personally enjoy Chevalier's style very very much, but I understand completely why not all share my appreciation of her work. Lady and the Unicorn follows a similar pattern to her other stories, but is still unique. All in all, it is a somewhat fluffy story. Good for a fun read only. Being a teenaged girl, I enjoyed reading about the characters near my age. The seductive Nicolas des Innocents was a fun character also, but there was nothing fascinating, triumphant or touching about him, or any of the other people in the story. It was merely a nice read. I still treasure it along with the rest of my Tracy Chevalier collection though, as my last book of hers to read until the next comes out. I suggest EVERYONE reading this review right now to go out and read Girl With a Pearl Earring and one other of Chevalier's books, because once you've read one, you've read them all."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Tracy Chevalier was able to win my admiration once again for her ability to choose a subject, thoroughly research it and then weave a detailed human tale around the historical and anthropological facts. This careful background research makes this book (as her previous &quot;Girl with Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;Falling Angels&quot;) educating as well as entertaining. The book is a very easy read and the different narrating voices add to its appeal and to the reader's ability to feel for the characters. The book cover (in the copy I hold) is splendid, portraying a detail of &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; attributed to Domenico Ghirlanaio and a detail of the &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestry, both of which are so wonderful to look at, that for me it added yet another important layer to the reading. &quot;Portrait of a girl&quot; especially comes to mind in the beginning pages when we meet Claude Le Viste through Nicolas eyes. It should be noted however, that although Tracy Chevalier does present an interesting, captivating tale, it sometimes withdraws into a too romantic, soap opera kind of novel. This reader was willing to accept such writing as there is a solid substance behind it and the writer knows where she wants to take you. Nevertheless, I did not feel that the feministic messages were in place (re Christine Du Sablon and other female characters) and not always appropriate to the period's thinking. Same criticism can be said about the fact that the author feels the need to &quot;resolve&quot; the problems/issues of every character and even gives us an epilogue with details about the future of each figure. Although this is &quot;nice to have&quot; I did not feel it was really necessary and in a way lowered the perception of this book as a more serious work."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"The Lady and the Unicorn is Tracy Chevalier's fourth historical fiction. The Girl with a Pearl Earring remains my favorite, but this one runs a close second. Brussels and Paris are the two cities where the artists and tapestry weavers work for years in producing these six fine tapestries on display today at the Musee Cluny. The lady and maiden in the original paintings age and the author weaves a plot of fascinating contrasts with rich and poor. Tapestry history and characters laboring 24/7 to meet deadlines are conveyed in all their complexities. The sixth tapestry remains a mystery and makes one want to reread and look again at its beauty."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"This, the fourth novel by Tracy Cheavalier, is a pleasant excursion into art history. Set in fifteen century Paris and Brussells, it tells the author's imagined backstory to the creation of the famous Unicorn tapestries now in the Cluny Museum. Beginning in the household of the socially striving noble who commissions the pieces, the author soon shifts to the household of the weaver who will execute them. Linking both families together is the artist Nicholas, talented in both portraiture and seduction. His interactions with the females of both households and how they affect the shape of the final tapestry form the core of the story. Included in the story proper is some fascinating material on the techniques used by the weavers, the hidden meaning of the Unicorn Tapestry's images, and on life in the period.Chevalier tells her story through the alternating perspectives of the major characters. This seems to be her standard operating procedure, since she's used it in her previous novels. Although it presents an occasional problem of keeping the characters straight, it's an effective method in Chevalier's hands. By alternating narrators, she's able to give more rounded pictures of her characters and to describe events through one character that other characters don't yet know.Chevalier writes strong characters who occasionally act in unexpected ways. Nicholas, for example, is a first rate cad, but through his actions provides the means by which another character escapes from an unwanted marriage. Claude, the headstrong older daughter and heir of the Parisian noble, ends up exacting a special kind of revenge on the artist. At 250 pages, this is not a long book, but the author's characters are well limned.\\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is by no means a great masterpiece, but it is a very worthwhile read. It goes quickly, but there's more depth than meets the eye. Plot twists, the lore of the unicorn, and Chevalier's strong characters made this one memorable for me."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I love historical fiction and I just love this book. I do have to confess that it took me awhile to get into the story lines ~~ but once I got more into the book, the stories woven together managed to draw me into the lives of the characters. There is Nicolas, the artist, who gets a commission to draw the paintings for the tapesteries for an upcoming noble man. There he falls in love with the nobleman's daughter, Claude. There is the relationship, strained as it is, between Claude and her mother. There is the housemaid who Nicolas impregnated. There is Beatrice, waiting lady first to the mother then to the daughter. There is the family in Brussels, whose lives are forever changed once Nicolas entered it. All of these stories are woven together in a span of a couple of years ~~ and little do they know that their actions influence each other whether they are in Brussels or in Paris.It is a compelling look into history as well ~~ and a wonderful story of those who make their living off the looms. It is a mixture of nobility and merchant class that have come together in this novel. Once you pick up this book, you will not be able to put it down. All of the stories draw you into the characters' lives and dreams.I enjoyed \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" immensely ~~ read it long before it became a top seller. I enjoy this one just as well ~~ and wished I had picked it up sooner. It's a great book to escape into ~~ the descriptions of the Lady and the Unicorn are just wonderful that I can see it in my own mind. This book is another must-read for those who like art and history.10-15-04"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and loved it; so I thought I'd try another of her novels. This is, unfortunately, not the same caliber. It reads like the trashy romance novels I try to avoid. The character development revolves around sex, which can be pulled off (think Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\"), but it just wasn't in this case. The interaction between various societies, classes, and the art which binds them all is fascinating, but I would have prefered the novel to revolve more around that than some randy artists desire for the various female characters. So, I would definitely recommend \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" but I would not recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"While the story was nice and the characters interesting. I really resented the fact that the historical details were really off base. I study gothic tapestries and have written many papers on them, and I worry that people who read this book might think it was real.1. the tapestry was woven between 1480 and 1490 which means brussels would not have been the center of tapestry weaving at this time. The prevailing expert theory is that this tapestry was woven in Arras, which has given its name to big tapestries which is why you sometimes hear them referred to Arras in England.2. the earliest recorded evidence of a low warp loom was 1501 before that they use high warp looms or Haute Lisse. Low warp looms were referred to as Basse Lisse. Which means that the tapestery would have been woven on a high warp loom or vertical loom, not a low warp loom, or horizontal loom. this means a couple of things. First there would have been no pedals and second at any time the weaver would have been able to walk around the loom and look at the weaving instead of only seeing 4 inches at a time.3. Lisse means warp in french in known of my studies have I ever seen reference to the master weaver as Lisse. Why would anyone say the master weaver was warped. The master weaver would have been referred to as a \\"tapessier\\" or even a \\"weaver of arras\\" and probably in the shop master. Though the use of this word did give an exotic flare it was an innappropriate use of the word.4. the tappesier guild was in full bloom and in all likelihood did object to women working, but they weren't the tyrants that are portrayed in the book until well into the 16th century.I must commend the author in making up a weaver because at that time the artisan seldom took credit for the work. The credit was taken by the donor or the one that commissioned the work. So that was an interesting realistic touch.I worry about the holes because holes like that have a tendency to become \\"fact\\" in the minds of those that read the book. ONce you are aware of the holes you can enjoy the story and not many people study the creation of Gothic Tapestries. And the Gothic era is considered the high point of tapestry weaving.Enjoy the story but don't believe the historical aspects of it. It just doesn't fit in."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"I read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down! The plot is constantly interesting and the arrangement of narration makes the book unique and clever. If, however, you are looking for beautiful prose, this book lacks lavish descriptions (the reason for my four stars instead of five). However, it does capture the time period beautifully and if you like art history it's a very fun quick read!"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"As I was reading this book I kept thinking- it's just about this guy who is super horny! It's about his escapades bedding women and flirting with them. However, he's not a stick around type of guy.I did for the most part enjoy this book, however I got the feeling the author is continually trying to recreate the success of the Girl with the Pearl earring and she's struggling to find originality and something worth writing about. This book was so simple, you can boil it down to a man & his sexual adventures. There's a little focus on the womens lives and the families he comes in contact with, but nothing that could make it if it was the stand-alone story. i enjoy when there is more than one strong story in a book...Never the less, it kept me reading, the 250 pages goes by quickly.Also, the cover of the book I read did show some of the tapestry that was being written about, so that was nice. As for a recommendation- if you enjoy Chevalier's writing, you'll probably enjoy this one, just don't have too high of expectations."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Unicorn","review":"Well, Chevalier has done it again: she has taken a piece of art and woven a story into it like the threads of the tapestry are woven together. She seems to have a knack for writing gentle reads, books that you read to take your mind off your troubles, and that are relaxing. The characters are fun, the first-person narrative makes for great insight into the book, and the scenes in the book are vivid and easy to imagine.

This perspective gives Sedlmayr's account immense explanatory power. Tracing the evolution of the arts from the Baroque to the Modern era, Sedlmayr shows how the movements of today diagnose a profound crisis in Man's relationship with the divine. The Baroque produced composite works of art that expressed an essentially unitary vision of Man as a creature of God. The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries saw the separation of reason and heart and the development of increasingly isolated and specialized forms, an architecture governed by the cold laws of geometry rather than human needs, styles of 'pure' drawing that incorporated the techniques of draughtsmanship, purist attempts in painting to capture perception without contamination from mental constructs (e.g. C&eacute;zanne). The movement is thus inexorably toward a denial of God and an exaltation of human autonomy that ultimately denies the integrity and inviolability of the human person, as borne out by the emergence of movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism in the Twentieth Century. I would recommend reading this in conjunction with Philip Rieff's Sacred Order/Social Order trilogy."},{"Title":"Soil Nutrient Bioavailability: a Mechanistic Approach","review":"It is refreshing to read work with content and information that is useful for those interested in going beyond the surface.

There are a copule of problems I have with the book. There is index or for that matter any organization to the collection. It would be much better if the quotes and saying were organized under some general category. If you read something you like, it is next to impossible to find it again.I believe the book would be much more effective it there were less quotes or saying and more commentary on the quote or saying. For example, instead of a almost two thousand sayings, in my opinion, it would be better to have 100 of the best quotes that apply to child custody with an essay on each of those quotes. The problem with short quotes is most people do not give the quote enough thought.If you are looking for a great little pocket book to leaf through when you are waiting, this is fairly good.

The first fifth of the book passes through a dream-like state while sweeping and surreptitious changes take place in the police forces, the national government, the propaganda movements, the press, the ministries, the military. This book presents things about Germany that are normally not considered. Most Americans probably think that Germany was an idealistic war machine in the 1940s: with one mind, one head, one purpose. Not so. The author begins in 1933 as a new attache in the newly-formed Gestapo. Immediately things begin to go awry. New changes come down, rumors abound, mistrust fosters mistrust. In his own building and everyday workplace, his own boss tells him to take the staircase at the wall-side rather than near the railing, as this would expose him to sniper fire from a vantage point higher in the stairwell. No one walks across the hall to clean his face without phoning a colleague on such a &quot;dangerous enterprise.&quot; After these initial scenes, the author travels &quot;outside&quot; of government circles but remains in close contact with the major players plotting to overthrow the Fuehrer. He recounts across the years how the church was subdued, how the German people were &quot;assisted&quot; in imagining that things were working out, that propaganda helped to pave the way for even greater excesses, even how the generals were quailed (these last were long thought to be the last hope). The book is terrific in that it follows an agent in actual work, sifting through facts, talking clandestinely with associates, plotting an important life-or-death struggle to overthrow the Monster. Never knowing who to trust, never knowing what is coming next, never knowing when the bullet will come -- these are momentous and continuing features with which we have to deal. That the author survived as early as 1934 is remarkable. That he lived through the failed assassination attempt and the subsequent purges is incredible. A must read for WWII buffs, this highly readable text is a testament to those Germans working for sound government, healthy industry and a stable German society. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"To get top of the heap, and to start a war, and to institute Death Camps for Jews and other undesirables, Hitler had to leave many corpses. Among this carnage are the dead bodies of some of Germany's Finest People. If there was any GOOD person more knowledgeable about where the corpses were buried, it was SS Agent H.B. Gisivius, who was also an insider in the tragically unsucessful attempts to get rid of Hitler. Agent Gisivius also distinguished himself as a witness at Nuremberg with his testimony that enraged Herman Goering, the same Goering that was able to frustrate Supreme Court Justice Jackson's prosecution efforts. Gisivius goes though several adventures, from the Nazi Regime's bloody beginnings, to his transfer to the Abwehr [German Military Intelligence] under Canaris, to the frustrating attempts to get rid of Hitler, often interrupted by the major events of the war, and the lawless antics of Nazi Functionaries (including the embarrassing trials that took place for the Reichstagg Fire). Gisivius was a Witness, and like Historian Procopius, who tried to do GOOD in the Midst of EVIL, and He lived to tell about it!Firstly, Hitler was a constitutional scholar, not in the sense that Thomas Jefferson was, but in the same sense that Houdini was a Locksmith. Hitler reasoned that the Law of the Land was what the Police enforced. His partners, Goering, Frick, Bormann, Hess, Rohm, and later Himmler, proceeded to build the Gestapo, which they eventually integrated into the Police. The SA acted independantly, starting their own private concentration camps. A power struggle broke out for control of the Police which Gisivius describes in detail with black humor. The result was the Night of the Long Knives, where SA Chief Rohm perished and Himmler gets control of the Gestapo. Meanwhile,Goering uses his special units to end the SA private concentration camps with his own special purge (Goering wanted no competition). In its first months, the Nazi Regime has already shot a Mountain of Corpses.It was frustrating work to bring about the end of the Nazi Regime. Hitler, when he was in the deepest of doodoo (as in the Reichstagg Fire Trial) was able to pull off some magic trick to put himself back into a favorable light, be it the Annexation of Austria, the Occupation of the Rhineland (where he narrowly missed being declared insane), the annexation of Czechoslocakia, Poland, and the Russian Front. Hitler, had he passed from the scene during his pinicle after the Annexation of Czechoslavakia, would have been known as the Greatest german Statesman of All Time, and would have been the Supreme Proof that &quot;Character DOES NOT Matter&quot;. Instead, Hitler stayed on and things turned sour by degrees, and it took till 1944 before things got bad enough for Assassination Atempts to become sufficiently daring to recieve notice. (Granted, the March 1943 attempt happened, but those in the know did not talk about it. It was so secret, even Hitler did not know!). Hitler was certainly protected by his own Guardian Devil!The Big Day approaches! We must get rid of Hitler. The German Resistance meets for one last time before it happens. (The German Resistance were certainly a cut above the average Resistance Movement. In the French Resistance, you only had to worry about an interrogation [you did your duty if you lasted 24 hours] and a speedy execution, with some hope of release. The German Resistance, on the other hand, had secrets that had to be kept for months! No quick execution by pistol either! These guys died by long messy execution by piano wire at the end of a Meat Hook! Look up Fritz Nova's book for the biographys of the July 20th Martyrs to get into the details.) They argue and dissent! Stauffenberg delays and delays, with the hope of getting Hitler, Himmler, and Goering in one fell swoop. Leber has been arrested and is about to be shot, whom Stauffenberg wishes to save as a consequence of his tyrannicide. Staufenberg can delay no longer and the bomb goes off!The Abwehr acts with Operation Valkyrie, or does it? When Gisivius sees that the dawdling that ensues will come to naught, he looks up his friend, Police President von Heldorf and attempts to abscound. Tragicommically, his attempts to leave the country are frustrated. The Good News is that Gisivius'es hous has been bombed, making it an excellent hiding place for the duration of the war. Finally, the Allies escort him out of Germany as Germany perishes in flames.This is not a book for the weak of stomach! It is a study of Tyranny. Fritz von Hayek's Road to Serfdom had already been published in 1944, but doubtless, had Gisivius and Hayek had ever met, the von Hayek chapters on German and Austrian History would have been thicker. This book deserves to be a contender for the top 100 Great Books of All Times, and is Certainly worth the trouble to read."},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"&quot;To The Bitter End&quot; is a profoundly important book about the rise of the Nazi movement in Germany. Gisevius comes from the interesting perspective of having been one of the early members of the Nazi party, where he functioned for many years as a high-ranking bureaucrat. Eventually becoming disillusioned, he was involved with several plots to overthrow Hitler's regime, including the eventual bombing in 1944(?). Gisevius was also an instrumental prosecution witness at the Nurenberg trials."},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"Before buying the English-language edition I bought the German-language edition (BIS ZUM BITTEREN ENDE) and struggled mightily to read Gisevius' memoir in his mother-tongue until I figured-out I could fathom very little in German. Gisevius writes in the \\"first person\\" about events which most writers spin from secondary sources. Moreover, Gisevious treats ideologic, political and even (dare I say?) \\"abstract\\" considerations which are hard to capture in any language, be it in the original or in translation. I was absolutely in thrall by Gisevius' recollections of what it was like to be inside (the belly of) the German beast from 1933 until 1945. Action-only historiography is \\"einfaeltig\\", i.e., single-faceted, while Gisevius succeeded always to contextualize elements of action in an unfolding plot. Gisevius not so much ignored violence of the period so much as he pointed-out the cross-currents, the players & their ambitiousness, the cultural & historical backdrop, the feints and manoeuvering among competitors who vied for political influence, and the decisions taken at the helm of the German State which resulted in an inexorable slide into ... the bitter end. The preface/foreward to the edition which I read advised readers to treat Gisevius' memoir as \\"self-serving\\" and \\"selective\\" in his recollections. Yes, Gisevius wanted to serve in German political office after WWII, and, yes, we appreciate he penned much of his memoir for his minders in the Allied war effort while he was in exile in Switzerland before the Second War had ended. I don't know when I have ever read a political memoir which brought so alive an inside look at the mind-set of those who made political decisions at the top echelon of the German state in that awful period. I used the adjective \\"cross-currents\\" because Gisevius himself had to navigate the ever-changing rapids as an insider and civil bureaucrat not only to keep his various position/s of employment but indeed to keep from becoming a desaparecido, i.e., from being \\"disappeared\\", that is, to stay alive. My sense is Gisevius is someone whom we might call a man of conscience, who unlike many of his peers (say, for example, Dietrich Bonhoeffer) barely escaped with his life to tell the tale. And what a tale it is. I was transfixed, and I believed most every word of his memoir (however \\"selective\\" Gisevius' memory might have been.)"},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"\\"To The Bitter End\\" is book that any student of the period should read. It should be read along with many other books about the Nazi regime and it will add to the knowledge. Hans Gisevius was there in the midst of the rise of the Nazi tyranny and he was there when July 20th failed. Should you criticize and be wary of some of his claims? Of course, you should. Yet, there are few witness accounts of what he writes about and this makes his book invaluable."},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"All the same, while this is in fact a thrilling book, readers should bear in mind that Gisevius was not completely beyond reproach, and that around the time Diels ws \\"deposed\\" Gisevius was deputized to go in and forcefully remove him. That there was little choice or that is was a natural progression for him to become an assessor in the security police after the finishing the bar is perhaps true; but while I wouldn't go so far as to deem him a whited sepulchre, he did have dubious designs once in the regime, notwithstanding his later heroism."},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"An interesting account by someone who was on or close to the stage.Such testimonies become more rare as the time passes.Many details of the epoch come alive with a present day quality.I would recommend the book to those interested in the era."},{"Title":"To The Bitter End","review":"The book is rather lengthy and too detaild, but alot was going on with this famous unknown in the conspiracies to kill Hitler.

I wonder how Skorzheny figured into the conspiracy of 20th July '44?"},{"Title":"New Hampshire folk tales,","review":"New Hampshire Folk Tales was first published in 1932 and was a compilation of legends and stories handed down from mother to daughter.They were published so that they would not be forgotten or lost. The \\"Story of the Linden Tree\\" recounts how the real Josiah Bartlett, yes there was one before television, brought an inverted cone-shaped tree to his hometown of Kingston after signing The Declaration of Independence. Bartlett was the last President and first Governor of New Hampshire. The tree is situated in front of the Bartlett residence. There are tales of witches, ghost, encounters with Indians, tales that grandmothers told of pioneer life, all done without gruesome detail, but one's imagination can wander can't it?"},{"Title":"New Hampshire folk tales,","review":"I bought this because my mother had Volume II, which I inherited and read.

The narratives are all by slaves, some expressing their content and others their discontent. As a Liberian, it was funny to find one of the major complaints was lack of bread, only rice and cassada (cassava as spelled in this writing), our favorite staple foods. Other aspects of life complained about were (which we consider parts of everyday life) : driver ants, palm oil, jiggers, and yes a freed slave in 1853 complains about a skin disease called craw-craw.The two most interesting points in this book for me: One content slave pointed out that he left America because he knew in his heart there had to be somewhere on this earth where the black man could be free. Another discontent slave, who hustled his way back to America, said he would rather be a slave in America than live in Liberia without any hope.In life there are leaders and followers, some saw an opportunity for a new beginning and others saw too much work ahead of them when leaving a country where everything was already established. Regardless of who we identify with, I am grateful to have come upon this work which provided me some insight into the history of my country."},{"Title":"The Dungeon Master Guide, No. 2100, 2nd Edition (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","review":"Sadly this was TSR's last real edition, with the purchase of TSR by Wizards of the Coast in 1997 the game took on a entirely different direction with the inception of 3rd edition in 2000. For many of us that have and still do play AD&D;, 2nd edition is the best, it cleaned up some of the short comings of it's predecessor, while adding new dimensions to game play and simplifying some of the more frustrating aspects of game play. This is the Gem of Dungeons and Dragons evolution, the following editions were in many ways overly simplified, or dumbed down to better fit WotC's target audience. You know the Magic the Gathering, and other collectible card game crowds, in other words largely 8 year olds..2nd edition introduced one of the greatest abundance of variety into AD&D; with the Al-Qadim, Birthright, Dark Sun, Ravenloft, and Spelljammer campaign settings becoming available, and the expansion of The Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and Dragonlance settings, into the form we most of us think of and are most familiar with due to the writings of various authors such as Margret Weiss, and R.A. Salvatore. All in all 2nd edition offers more pre-made variety and resources than any edition prior or since, multiple campaign settings, well thought out classes, monsters, magics, and races, an almost endless supply of supplemental books such as the The Complete Book of Elves, and the Complete Clerics Handbook which aren't ,necessary but provided expanded possibility, you just can't go wrong with skipping the current incarnation and going with AD&D; 2nd Edition.For those wishing to experience Dungeons an Dragons at it's finest you'll want this book along with at least the Players Handbook and the Monstrous Manual. Add in a creative personality, some good friends and you've got an endless supply of fun and adventure all waiting for you or your friends to throw 3d6 and start building a character."},{"Title":"The Dungeon Master Guide, No. 2100, 2nd Edition (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","review":"I wrote a long review about the AD&D; Player's Handbook that discuss the feel of AD&D; a little bit so for this review I'm just going to cover this, the Dungeons Master's Handbook. The DM's Handbook is an extremely useful tool...for some things. You in no way NEED it to play AD&D.; The DM's Handbook is for your DM only and is a guide to how to DM basically. It gives you examples of how to set up encounters, how to build a dungeon, and how to make a campaign or quest. For me there are only two areas that I find extremely useful. One is that the DM's Handbook gives you your saving throw tables to see if a character is affected by a spell or poison or what have you. The other is that this book contains a list of tons of magical items and other useful/rare items that your characters could find.Now, you may wonder why I feel this book is still not completely needed. The reason is that if you are a more experienced DM or you just like doing everything yourself then you don't need this book. Things like saving throws can be completely story based for example. If your story needs a character to survive or fall then you just say it happens without rolling for it. If you want the currant battle to end quickly then you just say it does. Inside of the AD&D; world the DM is the absolute controller of all so you shape the story as you like, with the players cause fun and trouble along the way. The magical items are nice to have but if you like to create then you can just make up your own items that better fit your campaign. In the end this book is great for new DMs or times when you need a quick encounter or item to throw at the party."},{"Title":"The Dungeon Master Guide, No. 2100, 2nd Edition (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","review":"The 2nd Ed. of AD&D; greatly expanded the classic game, and this book is a must for playing 2nd edition. However, when TSR published the revised, 2nd edition books, they added material to the classic rules, lifted, and copied them into new volumes. Some things were not copied, unfortunately, and they are buried, and scattered, throughout the books, both PHB, and DMG. I keep my 1st Ed. books stacked with my 2nd Ed. books, and between the two, I have everything I need.I almost did not purchase the 2nd Ed. books, when they came out -- I had been playing for 7+ years, and I had not even scratched the surface of what is possible within the game. Why would I want to buy this new edition -- what did I need it for? I purchased the PHB first, and after scanning the new ideas on character sub-classes, and specialized priests, I was sold! I loaned my PHB to two of my players, and that was all it took -- my entire group switched from 1st, to 2nd, and we never looked back!Third Edition never intrigued me. Fourth Edition seems to be more focused on miniature gaming, which I enjoy as a separate, but closely related, hobby. Neither 3rd, nor 4th has interested me enough to even buy a single book to check them out... I am a die-hard fan of 2nd Ed., and I doubt I will change my interests, no matter what. This is one of the core volumes of 2nd Ed. games, and I highly recommend it, as part of the definitive edition of D&D;, bar none. If you prefer role-playing, to rules-playing, and miniatures gaming is not the forefront of your RPG desires, then 2nd Ed. AD&D; is precisely what you are looking for.There are many, many books, from 2nd Ed. rules, which are still available. This edition of AD&D; came out in 1989. It is now 2011, 22 years later, and the game is still quite popular, it is still being played, in spite of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0! It is, in my opinion, the very best of the true role-playing, fantasy games. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Dungeon Master Guide, No. 2100, 2nd Edition (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","review":"If you're into D&D already, you probably know what this is.

I have found them very helpful in sifting through the hype regarding makeup and skin care products. Her makeup preferences do come through in her reviews, however. Her aversion to shimmer/sparkle and preference for matte lipstick are evident, so you have to overlook those comments if you don't share her taste. (I sort of like shimmer and sparkle myself.)As far as my experience goes, I've found her skin care advice to be spot on. I can see where some devotees to pricier dept store lines might get defensive; she makes it very clear that you can buy products with equal or superior quality at the drugstore. If you are looking for justification for spending a large amount of money on cosmetics, you won't find that justification in this book.As others have mentioned, she does rate her own line highly. She even mentions in the intro to the section on her line that she can't be completely objective. I have used (and still use) some of her skin care products and have had good results with them.In all, I don't agree with every makeup review she writes, and I don't think she expects me to. For example, she is critical of mineral makeup, which I love, but I buy what works for me. I do agree with her skin care advice, and I particularly like the ingredients dictionary found in the back of the book.Finally, on a personal note: I DID go to the cosmetics counter (actually the drugstore)without her a few days ago, and I regretted it. Rather, my husband did. I bought a skin care product for him from a line that is usually highly recommended. The product irritated his skin...badly. Lo and behold, when I looked up the product in DGTTCCWM, there in print, was Paula's frowny face and negative review, mainly because the product contains a few harsh, irritating ingredients.

Not any more! Paula's no-nonsense approach to product review is straight-forward and easy to read, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who uses makeup or other skin care products.

Whether you are faithful to a particular cosmetics line or you like to switch from season to season, this book is THE guide. In addition to reviewing just about any cosmetic and skin care product available in North America, it addresses other concerns as well, such as which companies test their ingredients and/or products on animals. Begoun also gives information on the simplest way to care for your face, AHAs, sunscreens, acne products...For the conscious consumer!!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is a really great book that everyone who uses cosmetics should read.

A real eye opener"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I was blown away by the number of reviews for this book. And that was an ultimate reason I decided to buy it. Unfortunately I feel that I have wasted my money hoping to see some unbiased reliable information, but what this book is, is simply put self promoting tool. I have heard about Paula before and totally respect her, but what she did here is disservice to herself. I do appreciate all the time and effort she's put into it, but in reality each of her review represents nothing more than bashing of other companies in some way. Each review contains smiley or not-so-smiley face next to it, depending on what she thinks of that product. I have found a number of products that I like and use having non-smiley face next to them, just because of the price and, according to Paula, irritating ingredients in them. Seriously? Lavender irritating?? Since when? Lavender is one of a few oils that is very beneficial and can be used undiluted on the skin. I've never had any irritating issues with it rubbing it on burns. Going over her reviews, she appears to have a lot of issues with natural ingredients. While more and more companies turn to natural alternatives, Paula warns us about them as potentially irritating (at any concentration I guess). Most of the reviews contain generic statements like this \\"This product needs more antioxidants, but still contains a few beneficial plant oils and a few good water-binding agents\\". What the hell does that mean?? I probably can say THAT about every single product on the market, without conducting ANY research or even seeing the packaging. Some red flags started rising in my head before I flipped the pages to see her own line of products. Oh man, what do we see there..... All her products received ALL smiley faces as being PERFECT in every way. After that I just closed the book and tossed it in the garbage.How can you trust opinion of someone who so openly tries to promote her own chemically ridden skin care line. You don't really need to read any of the bs she wrote. You can just visit EWG site and research yourself, and make your own informed decisions instead of blindly trusting someone who desperately tries to sound like an expert. Now, look up her line on EWG[...] and see for yourself how \\"good\\" her products are. She even used Hydroquinone (skin lightening ingredient), which is a known poison rated 10 by EWG and actually, I believe, banned in some States. Shockingly, her book mentioned nothing about how toxic it is. It's all jolly good there.I regret wasting my money on this piece of work. But congrats Paula, you probably made more money selling this book vs. selling your cosmetics. I guess it was a desperate measure to survive."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is very helpful in reviewing products for skin care needs. However, I would like to see more definitive information about the ingredients she recommends. Also, I would like to see a section with chapters organized around various skin types, rather than having to read through all the product reviews to find recommendations which may or may not work for me. There is a section at the end of the book briefly summarizing recommendations for best products to use with various skin types, but to my mind, it is rudimentary at best and sometimes misleading with regard to skin type.Admittedly, I have not read the book from cover to cover, but as far as I can tell, the author has lumped care for aging skin in with various recommendations for dry skin, which is not quite the same thing. Although I have found occasional references to products related to skin care for older women, it would be very helpful if she had a chapter relating to post-menopausal skin problems. Needless to say, this was not an issue for me when I read the earlier edition!Finally, the author spends a lot of time hyping her own products as well as products available at the drugstore containing all the great ingredients she touts for use in preventing the skin from aging (too late for me!). I've tried a number of the products she recommends, and truly, my skin has improved. However, if I want to get dolled up to go out dancing, none of these great products seems to work well under makeup."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me) (Paperback)GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I've read almost everything Begoun has published.

In fact it should be required reading. This book is about so much more than blue eyshadow, or shiny blush (which she does say is OK for night time; who wants to walk around with shiny cheeks in the daytime?), it is about properly taking care of your skin. I have seen a dramatic improvement since taking her advice, and understand how and why products work. Information is power, and it seems to me women could use some clear advice on how and where to spend their money. Paula does this and does it well."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I stumbled upon the 4th edition of this book entirely by accident. I wasn't looking for a makeup book, and I happened upon it one day in a used bookstore. After flipping through some select product lines that I either use currently or have used in the past, I realized that I agreed with about 95% of her assessments and proceeded to buy the book. It has been very helpful to me thusfar, and now I can't wait to buy the new edition - there are a lot of new products out there that I'm dying to find out about.I've read some of the other reviews, and I hear the complaints that people don't agree with her about everything. Neither do I. But then again, what critic of any kind - movies, music, books - has 100% of the population in total agreement? None. Of course this book reflects her opinions and experiences, so they should be taken for just that. Advice from a friend who has been there. That doesn't mean you'll always agree. As an example, I have been a loyal Mary Kay user for a number of years, using almost exclusively Mary Kay products. Paula is pretty hard on Mary Kay on a number of topics. However, she also gives them credit in a number of areas as well, and I agree with most of what she has to say. I have not completely abandoned Mary Kay because there are products from that line that I'm quite fond of (one of which earned an unhappy face in her book). However, for those things that I'm not happy with, I now have a resource to help me find a good replacement.To the point about Paula having her own product line, who cares? Is she biased? Of course! And she states as much in the introduction to her product line. She also doesn't rate her products with happy or unhappy faces because she knows she can't be that objective. But if you look in the Best Products chapter, there are several sections for which her products DON'T make the list. So she acknowledges other products as superior to her own, and that tells me she is making her best attempt to be objective.This book won't give you all the answers, and you'll likely disagree on occasion. But overall, if you're looking for a resource to help you work your way through the mazes of cosmetic counters and at least point you in a direction - whether drug store, department store, or boutique - this is a very valuable reference to have.Keep up the good work, Paula!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paul Begoun is the only person out there providing unbiased information about the cosmetics industry. She does have some of her own biases, but she always explains why she holds these. Her information is based on research, not hype. I have all four editions of this book and have found all of them to be useful. She has definitely saved me money on products I buy, and I don't end up with many totally wasted products. I use her books as a handy reference. Without her books, one is out there on her own, listening to the department store sales associates' information or totally on her own at a drugstore. I do not always 100% agree with everything she says, (I can't get eye makeup off without slight help from eye makeup removers), but overall her advice is the only advice out there. She's always the first to say that if something she recommends does or does not work for you, stay with what is working. This book is a worthwhile addition to any woman's library as a handy reference. My daughter also finds this a handy reference book, and she's 27 years younger than I, so I'd recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have been fascinated by and researched cosmetics for years (I haunt Sephora), so I was eager to sit down with this and leaf through it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to the point of being irate, so have waited for a while before writing in the heat of the moment.My primary objection is with Ms. Begoun's strong bias against products based on natural ingredients. If one was to believe her, then botanical by-products and extracts are the bane of all skin care, and every one to be considered as dangerous as poison ivy. Taking it a step further, she poo-poos one CEO's assertion as to the danger of petrochemicals (so prevalent in cheaper cosmetics especially), wondering sarcastically if this person does not drive a car, fly a plane, live in a heated home etc. The obvious argument here of course being that one hopefully does not apply toxins like petroleum, gasoline, etc. to their skin on a daily basis, where it is absorbed directly into the system. Remember why &quot;patch&quot; medications work. It is naive to assume that our body is not on some level absorbing/consuming what we put on our skin.Her prejudice also comes through in which studies she chooses to play up (to her convenience), and which are dismissed as though they were conducted in someone's kitchen sink. Either her research is thoroughly lacking, or she only researched tests and studies that support her premise of what's safe and of good quality, and what's not.Despite the well-known concerns of sodium lauryl and laureth sulfates, published by a number of independent groups, she insists these are nothing objectionable. Even if the suspected carcinogenic traits are never proven, it's doubtful that anything that has raised such a question (or even furor) is safe period, cancer-causing or not. Bear in mind, SLS concerns have been noted for decades; this is not a fad, hyped by some company in an effort to elevate their own products. She has a cynical, even snide attitude, for any company with a holistic approach. No, actually she's snide about at least some products in almost every skin care line out there.Predictably, the only skincare line which meets her approval with its every product is...her own. I put the book back on the shelf with the distinct impression that I had stumbled upon a 1000+ page advertisement. Advertisements of course are not to be confused with reference materials, which one figures would be more objective."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I'm a huge fan of the work of Paula Begoun. I have bought all her books but she has quit revising her guide to cosmetics buying. Cosmetics companies regularly change their products, at least the names, so this book won't be of much help in shopping. However, she has a newsletter you can subscribe to and a website. She does her research and will save you lots of money - I now buy most of my cosmetics at the drugstore rather than at dept stores and could not be happier with them."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I love this book. I have only had it for a week, and I can tell that it will be an invaluable resource. I don't see myself agreeing with her always (I like shiny make-up -- and even blue eyeshadow) but if I hadn't read her review of my sunscreen, I would have no way of knowing that it did not contain any of the top 3 ingredients used to block UVA rays.The people who probably don't like her book the most are likely those who love the products she trashes -- or those who really believe Chanel is worth the price it costs. Me, I see this book as not being the final word on any given product or item, but as a really helpful resource to find out about skin care and make-up before spend the money. I definately recommend it to those make-up junkies everywhere, as it is easy to read, and reviews every single product found in boutiques, department stores, and drugstores alike."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book has saved me a lot of money. I don't always agree with Begoun's assessment of a particular product (although I think she is usually right on the mark). But overall, Begoun has changed the way I shop for cosmetics. I used to be intimidated by the salespeople at fancy department store counters. Not any more! I now approach the cosmetics counter with confidence, armed with some knowledge and a healthy does of scepticism. Some reviewers have complained of Begoun having her own line. Granted, it is a bit problematic for a reviewer to have her own line of products. But she does not shamelessly hawk her own line, and recommends all kinds of other brands that her own products are competing against. All things being equal, I would rather support a woman entrepreneur than a huge company. But her stuff is not only equal to but even better than many of the big names. Her product line really _is_ impressive: this is department store quality at drugstore prices (no, I don't work for her!). I have been using her skin care line for a few months, and with great results: I will not go back to overpriced products with inflated claims."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun openly admits that she isn't a scientist, doctor, or someone with an impressive slew of letters after her name. She does, however have extensive experience from being a makeup artist since 1974, testing and comparing expensive and inexpensive products for ingredients. This alone makes her opinion worth reading. After all, there's no sense paying over twenty bucks for a tube of department store mascara when Maybelline Great Lash (for less than 6 bucks) not only does the trick, but works even better.Paula has covered everything (and I mean everything) from blackheads to spider veins, the ever growing market for wrinkle reducing cream (Paula's take: there's no such thing) and every cosmetic company from A-Z (over 100 in all, including Target's Sonia Kashuk and BeneFit, one of my faves). Beware, though- Paula poo-poos moisturizing; in fact, she claims it's the biggest travesty committed by the cosmetics/skin care conglomerate. She doesn't think much about most company's products (accept her own, of course), especially those sold through 5S skincare, Adrien Arpel (is she still around??), Almay skin care products, and doesn't seem too impressed with Clinique's line of skincare products. Paula is also anti-shiny eyeshadow under any/all circumstances. So as you can see, some of this is her opinion (she hawks her own line of products an awful lot), but most of it gives you useful information to compare products before buying. Definitly a book you'll want to check out before shelling big bucks out at the Estee Lauder counter (BTW, did you know EL owns Clinque and Origins?) There's also a helpful appendix in the back to define all those strange sounding ingredients listed on the labels of over 30,000 products. If nothing else, read the &quot;Best Prodcuts Summary&quot; (located in the back, of course), which breaks products down by best cleansers (for each skin type), makeup removers, toners, exfolients, suncreens, facial masks, self tanners (hallelujah!), concealers, powders, eyeshadows, brow shapers, etc. You name it, it's here."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun is a great researcher.

For a very long time I suffered severe cystic acne. Due to that I have developed an intense interest in all things beauty-related and read just about every bit of information on products that I can get my hands on, always thinking I could see through the beauty industry hype. I guess I was wrong...I first saw this book a couple of years ago but didn't buy it. I looked through it in the shop and checked out her reviews for products that I was using. She had horrible reviews on just about all of them. I was thinking 'How can she say this about my skin care? These are good brands!?! WTF!'In December, my local library had a copy of Paula Begouns 'The Original Beauty Bible: Skin Care Facts For Ageless Beauty' on the new arrivals. So I figured I may as well borrow it, it's free after all...Having now read the Original Beauty Bible I now understand why she criticises certain #most# items. And these criticisims are for such obvious faults that you wonder why you never gave certain things much of a thought - air tight packaging over jars, alcohol free products, ingredients proven to work not just fad ingredients, whether a study on an ingredient or product has been done independently.As a former sceptic of this book, I am glad I gave it a second chance. I love this book and now refer to it every time I buy a new product. While I fully take into consideration her opinions when it comes to ingredients, formula and packaging I still use my own views to decide if I want to purchase items or not. As I am using up my current skincare I am moving onto things that are her recommendations and so far, she is soooooo right with her product picks.

Before I found this book, all I had to go on were advertising claims which are just about useless, claims made by commissioned salespeople which are even more useless, and my own very limited understanding of what the ingredient list meant. Since I certainly don't have the money or the time to try out product after product and test them all myself, I feel that her ratings are a good place for me to start. EVERY product that I have tried that she recommends I have really liked. After reading her book, I also have a better understanding of what various cosmetics ingredients (such as stearic acid and tea lauryl sulfate and butylparaben) do and don't do. Although I don't think she is 100% objective, she is a better source of information than advertising and magazine articles (which are written to please the advertisers).Personally, I thought that she showed great restraint in hawking her own line in this book. The references to her own line are very infrequent, and she gives recommendations for MANY products from other lines with as much enthusiasm as for her own line.You will like this book if you are: * a bargain hunter * skeptical about advertising claims but want to find the best products * have oily or acne-prone skin (Because this is her skin type, I think there is a little more emphasis on this skin type in the book than on others.)You will not like this book if you are already brand-loyal to a particular line already, because she has negative things to say about every line. You will also not like this book if you are the type that wants to go to some kind of a beauty expert, and be told exactly which products to buy. Her list of recommended products is too extensive for that. You also will not like this book if you are already buying expensive cosmetics and believe that you are getting better products than women who buy less expensive cosmetics. A theme of the book is that many of the low and moderate priced products are equal quality to the expensive ones."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have been reading the books and using the products of Paula Begoun for 5 years now and find her to be the most informative source of unbiased information available. ...I'm disappointed by some of the posts that claim her advice to be inaccurate. I can only say that I haven't found it to be so. ...I don't work in the cosmetics industry, I work in the pharmaceutical industry. I can attest to the accuracy of her analysis of chemical components and their effects on the skin. I have gone so far as to research her sources of information on dermatological processes and chemical compounds and found them to be respected scientific sources.I've tried her skin care line and found it to be excellent. My dermatologist has never recommended that I change the products I use. Her products are certainly for budget-minded people. They are in plain bottles and have no scent (which is healthier, if not as decadent). I've saved a lot of money by switching from my former Lancome skin care routine to her products.For those of you who want to spend $$$ on La Prairie moisturizer: it's your money, spend it as you like (I have tried it and agree that it's very nice), but you are not the target consumer of this book.For those of you wishing to lower your cosmetics' budget, this is a wise investment."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought this book one year ago, I have read it thoroughly and I have referred to it often and followed her advice on skin care - so this review reflects 1 year's PERSONAL consideration of the book's content. Also, before writing this review I thoroughly read every review on Amazon, and I will repeat comments made by other reviewers, I am doing so because it bears repeating.This book is basically written for gullible consumers, consumer's who believe the grandiose claims and are swayed by product labeling. For example, Lancome recently marketed a product that claimed to repair or sooth \\"derma-creases\\", if you believe that \\"derma-creases\\" is an actual scientific term, than you definitely should read this book, because all it means are \\"wrinkles on the surface of the skin\\" (that is my own anecdote - not Paula's). Or if you think that a word that is conjugated so that it is French makes it better, than you should also read this book.But, if you do read this book you need to realize that this the only thing it teaches you - that you are being manipulated by packaging and pseudo scientific claims. Now I am not that gullible, and I know many smart women who aren't that gullible. Many Americans are bombarded by marketing and advertising campaigns on a daily basis, so this is nothing new nor is Paula's almost communistic view of big business anything new either. Unfortunately, when I purchased this book I expected more than that simplistic message.If you are a smart woman than you may find that Paula Begoun's tone throughout the book is condescending, it is also redundant and most reviews are negative. What makes it especially condescending is that she is not a chemist, nor a dermatologist, and her sources of information come primarily from a few selected sources:1) The FDA (the government, the same agency that approved Vioxx only to have people die from it),2) Several published medical articles written by dermatologists, and if you know anything about scientific research, there is always a scientist who can poke holes in another's research and hypothesis. Therefore, one can always find a published article to support the claim they wish to make, and use that exclusively.3) The beauty companies themselves.I do not consider any of those sources objective, not even when combined.Finally, she writes that beauty companies withhold their research or the methods behind them, which is why we shouldn't believe them. Yet, she doesn't hold herself up to the same standards as she admits that her own rating process is more challenging than she can explain or is based \\"opinion\\". Sorry, Paula but this does not give me ample reason to believe you.The book is comprised of reviews for 99% of the skin care and makeup on the market. The reviews are based on the following:Skin Care: based upon the ingredients, the formulations and whether than may irritate the skin.Makeup: subjectively (her word - not mine) based upon the texture and color range of the product.Let's start with her makeup reviews. You don't need someone to tell you if the color ranges are small or vast. One can go to a store or an online store for that. She admits she dislikes iridescent makeup and this is peppered throughout her reviews. Her personal dislike of shiny eye shadow has nothing to do with a product review and is waste of text and the reader's time. And since makeup is such a personal thing, colors are relative to skin tone, age and personal style, and formulations are relative to skin condition and texture - I HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT HER MAKEUP REVIEWS ARE MEANINGLESS. They would have meaning if she reviewed them according to the key ingredients and why they make a product last longer, go on more smoothly etc. - But she doesn't.But what about her reviews of skin care? They are redundant and she dislikes MOST products (with the exception of her own Paula's Choice line which gets A+).Another reviewer mentioned that Paula's ingredient list was not complete. They were right, it isn't - there are many ingredients missing from that list. You can test this yourself, take a few products, read the labels and see if every ingredient can be found in Paula's book, you won't find it.Her reviews are terribly redundant, if you read most of the reviews they are the same: the product is \\"standard\\", \\"ordinary\\", \\"possibly irritating\\" and doesn't contain sufficient amounts of the key ingredient to make a difference.When I purchased this book a year ago, I agreed with Paula. I already knew that most products contain the same fundamental emollients, humectants and preservatives. Then, I started experimenting with the products and skin care advice she gave, including purchasing her own line of products (guess I am guillible). After a year, I can say I don't agree with a single review of skin care products coming from Paula.She adores Cetaphil, and recommends it for all skin types (there are versions for oily skin and dry skin). I decided to try Cetaphil for six months and my skin broke out horribly. Withing a week, my 41 year old skin was covered in pimples on my hair and jawline. I found a site called Makeupally.com and discovered that many women had the same reaction.In addition to trying Cetaphil, I followed her advice for the blemish prone, I even tried her own products - which were so irritating my skin was a red, raw mess, that putting water on it BURNED - AND YES I FOLLOWED HER REGIMEN EXACTLY. I couldn't believe that while her skin care product reviews frequently mention the potential for irritation, she herself advises women with blemish prone skin to use a combination of retinoids, disinfectants and BHA's. That is just too much exfoliation for even oily skin. I had to conclude that her advice cannot be counted on.This book is interesting, it is great if you are interested in trying a new line and want to know the background of the company. However if you chose to purchase this book you need to know ahead of time that the makeup reviews are subjective and her that her research into skin care and ingredients is not complete. Much of her tone throughout the book can lead women to feel stupid and guilty for wanted to splurge on high-end brands or for liking fragrance in their products. And finally, if you are looking for new products to try good luck, because there isn't much out there that Paula likes. Most products are \\"ordinary\\", \\"standard\\", \\"with the key ingredients too minimum to make a difference\\", and \\"potentially irritating\\".After having this book for a year, I feel that Paul's words apply to herself as well: her book is \\"ordinary\\", \\"standard\\", with \\"key ingredients too minimum to make a difference\\" and \\"potentially irritating\\"."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I had been very excited about buying this book, but time after time I found it so useless and in fact wrong on so many things that I finally gave it away. I really wanted to like it, but it seems that Ms. Begoun and my opinions just never jibed. Almost every product I love and have been using for years, she trashes. And I have tried many of the products she loves, and not once have I been satisfied. On a more specific level, here are my gripes:1) She is stuck in 1992 matte neutral makeup. She is totally disdainfully of anything even remotely \\"shiny\\" as she refers to it. Wake up Paula, dewy slightly shimmery sheerly colorful fresh and glowing makeup is what's in in the 21st century - and looks great on most everyone. Her photo says it all - totally outdated cakey mattey makeup.2) Her descriptions are useless: \\"This works as well as most\\" What does that mean?3) She hates fragrance - what's wrong with a little fragrance as long as it doesn't irritate?4) She will say \\"This product has good anti-oxidants and water biding agents\\" - but doesn't tell you what those are so you know what to look for. I guess you are just supposed to take her word for it.5) Her cosmetics dictionary is incomplete - lots of ingredients I see on labels are simply not there.6) She is always critical of other people's prices, and in some cases I agree there are certain lines that are priced astronomically (cle de peu, la prairie) probably for no good reason. But women pay department store prices for service and packaging (yes packaging) and the ability to try things. I know there are lots of good drugstore products out there, and if you have acess to testers maybe its worth it. But when I buy them and the colors don't work (and they never seem to) I've just wasted money.6) As agreed with some other readers, she really has no credentials that actually matter and the overall tone of the book is too personally anecdotal and self-serving.6) And finally, and mostly YOU DO NOT GET TO CALL YOURSELF THE COSMETICS COP AND THEN PEDDLE YOUR OWN LINE!!!!!!. I went to her website, www.cosmeticscop.com, hoping to find information, and found that it was mostly a sales site for her cosmetics. When I bought this book I had no idea she had a cosmetics line. I am pretty offended that this woman doesn't pay for advertising, she actually charges people for it because the book is ultimately is advertisement for her makeup. And while I'm sure she has some good products, I find it hard to believe that everything in her line is \\"perfect\\" as she professes. If Clinique and Estee Lauder and Lancome don't produce all perfect producers, why would she?So, take the $27 dollars you would spend on the book and buy an \\"overpriced\\" (Paul's words, not mine-- I think Chanel is worth every penny!) Chanel lipstick. I think you will get much more pleasure!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said that Paula Begoun is biased and only out to sell her own line of cosmetics and skin-care products. True, she does have her own line of such products, but those are hardly the only ones she recommends. If you look throughout the book, you will find positive (even glowing) reviews of some other companies' products too. To say that she gives bad reviews to all companies except her own is simply not true. In fact, in the back of the book, she has extensive lists of the &quot;best&quot; products in each category (moisturizer, cleanser, foundation, etc). Many of these lists include dozens of products. Nowhere in the book does Paula say that her products are the only good ones. Rather, they are just another option out of many, for women looking for quality products. She does include an entry in the book for her own products, which includes descriptions, but not ratings since she didn't feel she could be *that* objective about her own products. I do use some of Paula's products myself. For example, I buy Paula's moisturizer for oily skin because I've had a lot of trouble finding a good moisturizer that works for me. I do not buy Paula's cleanser because I decided to use another cleanser that she recommended in this book, which I buy at the drugstore, and I've found that it works well for me.I believe that every woman who uses cosmetics should read this book, as well as _The Beauty Bible_ in order to learn about the myths, lies, and half-truths used in the cosmetics industry. These two books will teach you to be smart consumers, to analyze the ridiculous, impossible claims made by some of these products, and to save time and money."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The fifth edition of Paula Begoun's \\"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\" is the third that I have bought. Despite this, I am far from the biggest fan of her work. Why do I continue to buy Ms Begoun's books? They provide an extensive overview of what products are available. There is no one else out there who covers as fully what is happening in the cosmetic industry.This fifth edition is huge, weighing in at a hefty 1083 pages. Several fairly new lines, including Chantecaille, Anna Sui, Cargo and Awake are reviewed in this edition. It also contains an 83-page opening section on the skin-care gospel according to Paula. There are baby and men's skin reviews near the back of the book, which were not in the earlier editions.Cons:I have a real problem with her research methods. As in her earlier works, in this new edition, she doesn't ask anything close to a representative cross-section for their opinions on products. In her books, you get Paula's opinions and Paula's opinion only. She still drags her own personal preferences into her work. (Though her rabid hatred and fear of anything she even perceives as shiny is sort of funny.)More importantly, though, her own, ever-expanding skin care and cosmetics line also presents an uneniable conflict of interest. I believe it is unethical for her to shilling for her own makeup line while telling consumers not to buy products from other lines. Also, while she doesn't give a rating to her own products in the product-by-product, she does recommend most, if not all, of them in the \\"best of category\\" section in the back of the month. That is all the evidence that I personally need that she has gone over the line in a case of clear conflict of interest.Readers of earlier editions of \\"Don't Go the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\" books may recognize entire phrases quoted verbatim from her earlier books. The books are a much more useful reference when they are newly released since products, and indeed entire lines, are constantly being released to and withdrawn from the market. Some of the information, just weeks after the book is released, is already out of date.Pros:The \\"Don't Go the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\" books always contain useful information which should be more easily available to the consumer but isn't. For example, there is information on which sunscreens are considered to be full-spectrum and which aren't. Ms. Begoun also lets her readers know which glycolic acid products have a pH that allows the product to work effectively as an exfoliant. She also warns of potential irritants in products, which is especially important to people with sensitive skin.There are other areas in which she has improved. In past editions of her book, she judged all salespeople for a line by the way she was treated by one salesperson at one particular counter. The unfairness of this has apparently been called to her attention because there is none of this in the new edition of her book.The bottom line:There is some useful information to be found in this new edition of \\"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me.\\" It is truly a useful and unique reference and she has made some improvements from earlier editions. As a bona-fide cosmetics junkie, I wish there were a better researched, truly unbiased book covering the same ground. Consider her opinion along with a host of other factors when making cosmetics-buying decisions. I would advise against taking her word as canon. I just wouldn't let Ms. Begoun be the final word. Take her reviews with a grain of salt and remember she is just a shill with something to sell just like any other."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is one of the smartest advertisements I've ever seen. Paula rips apart every skincare product (even the products that get an 'approval' from her still have a \\"but\\" or \\"however\\" following their praise.) The only skincare line that gets her full backing and lavish review? Her own.If you want reviews on a product, do your own homework. Look for reviews from people that don't have their own agenda. You can google most skincare ingredients and learn their pro's and con's."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I liked this book, Paula Begoun sheds light on things you may never have known otherwise. I have read the book cover to over, and have seen why she's so mad. I have had the experience of dealing with skincare &quot;professionals&quot;, and let me tell you, most of them know less than I do. I have studied the art of makeup for three years, and I found Paula's ideas on makeup to be extremely closed-minded and conservative, she can hardly call herself an artist. HOWEVER, this book is a great read for those of you shopping for good, low-cost skincare products. I really don't mind her advertising her own products in the book, she was very subtle about it. I highly recommend this book to any woman who needs to know the basics of skin care, and which cosmetics can cause breakouts or irritation. The book was easy to understand and use, and has information you can't find anywhere else, unless you want to spend years doing research. While her attitude gets to me, I certainly respect her for being one of the first women to really help the consumer."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"For two decades Paula Begoun has called cosmetics companies on their sensational claims while emphasizing that a ton of bad apples do not spoil the whole bunch in terms of skincare and cosmetics.In the 8th edition of her cosmetic opus Begoun's catalog of bad and beautiful products is expanded once more. Although her reviews are not always perfect, she is human after all and she makes it clear that her reviews are her opinions after culling current research, overall Begoun's work is second to none. You show me another book that goes as far as Begoun's does and I'll eat my shoes.Begoun is also clear about her own line of cosmetics and skincare and I feel that she never pushes her own products, she recommends so many competitors products I feel any criticism directed to her in that regard is simply sour grapes.Essentially, I feel that Begoun's book is required reading for anyone who wants to protect their skin and age as well as possible. As far as I'm concerned if you go to the cosmetics counter having not read Paula Begoun's book you're simply asking to do damage to your skin and that's just not pretty."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The main problem with this book is that Paula uses too many different reviewing criteria per product, and then arrives at one single conclusion based on all of them. To wit:1) Product efficacy based on ingredient list. Paula goes through the ingredient list and identifies those that are useful, those that may be irritating, those that are useless, etc. Although she does not present this dispassionately, as a more professional reviewer would, this is the most useful part of her critique.2) Value. Paula rates the value of the product based on 1), above vs. the amount of product and its retail price.3) Her taste. Veering far off the track of a balanced reviewer, Paul routinely lambasts any cosmetic which does not fit her aesthetic taste. She disdains anything sparkly, shiny, or glittery, and products with those characteristics suffer.So, what do you wind up with in this book? Individual reviews that may be useful if you know how to weed through her biases, but &quot;best of&quot; ranking lists that are utterly worthless because of her confusing her criteria with each other so as to make any rankings meaningless. For instance, she may review a product as chemically sound, but it drops in rank because of being expensive. Another product may be chemically sound and dirt cheap, but does not rank well because it adds shine or sparkle.Her rhetoric abounds, review by review, and she tries to force you to agree with her idea of &quot;appropriate&quot; color palettes, but there is some good general information about cosmetic ingredients. Additionally, as many Amazon reviewers have noted, the fact that she now has her own product line calls her objectivity as a reviewer into serious question."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book contains outstanding information on dozens of cosmetic lines. It tells you the active ingredients and how they are likely to affect your skin. This book needs to be read in conjunction with a book like &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Beautiful Skin,&quot; written by Dr. Marsha Gordon, that provides factual and medical information on how to take care of your skin. Once you know what your skin needs are, then you can find the cosmetics that best fit your needs in the price range that you want. While Paula's opinion on what constitutes a good product may differ from that of the reader, personal differences are to be expected in such a subjective area as cosmetics. What makes this such a good book is that it gives objective information on the ingredients used in the various cosmetic lines and creates an informed starting point when you go in search of the perfect skin care and cosmetics products for your own skin. Because cosmetic lines bring out new products constantly, this book should be viewed as a reference book that needs to be replaced with each new edition."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I've purchased every edition of this book so I'm familiar with Paula's work and research. Alas, this is the last one she'll be writing. For more up-to-date information, check her web site or subscribe to her newsletter -- well worth the price. Anyway, Paula repeats, often, that her book offers reviews of beauty products, and she is NOT able to personally test every single item. So if you think that is the case, you're mistaken. She has a certain type of skin and is only one person, which makes it impossible to test everything herself. Furthermore, she makes it very clear, over and over again, that she is offering reviews based on what the cosmetic companies state for their products, what the ingredients' efficacy are -- based on the purported advertised claims, if those ingredients are today's state-of-the-art in cosmetic chemistry, and the products' prices vs. the ingredients and performance. Paula tells us that if you don't like her rating or review of a specific product, fine, but her writing is based on hard scientific research, interviews with experts and chemists, scientifically documented studies, and her long experience and expertise in the business of beauty. She is trying to inform and educate us about the cost and claims of cosmetics vs. their performance. You can be allergic or exhibit a reaction or sensitivity to ANY substance that goes on your skin, so your personal skin sensitivities have nothing to do with what Paula's reviews say about a product, other than her warnings about certain substances that are KNOWN to cause such irritations and reactions. With more than 1300 pages of beauty products listed, you might find cosmetics that don't agree with your skin or hair. Fine, don't buy them, but don't shoot the messenger! You can disagree with what Paula recommends, vs. what pleases you, but those are personal choices and preferences. I have tried a few cosmetics she gives a happy face and check mark to, and I didn't care for them, but those were simply personal dislikes. Her science IS solid, her knowledge IS extensive, and this book was a godsend three years ago. However, cosmetics come and go very quickly, so this may not be a good investment three years after initial publication. I suggest you check her web site, subscribe to her newsletter, and you'll be informed of current products and updates. I still refer to this book but about half the cosmetics I check for are no longer made.For those of you who are appalled at Paula \\"cashing in\\" by including her own products in her book -- you need to understand the history of that. Paula was a professional makeup artist for about 20 years. Then her writing career began with researching and reviewing beauty products. She had no line of her own. By popular demand, she developed a very few skin care products based on her own knowledge of cosmetics and what should be avoided, what was scientifically useful to help skin. The line grew and grew, based on further customer demand, so now it is quite extensive and includes makeup and other body products. That doesn't mean you have to buy them -- ignore her reviews of her products if it offends you, especially since she avoids rating her own line. I think Paula has bent over backward to be fair about her own products. There is also no guarantee against stupid misuse of her products either, so if you don't know how to use and apply any cosmetic or skin care product, you could have a reaction. That's not limited to Paula's line, it's universally true. She does have a 60 day unconditional money back guarantee with anything you purchase.Update on 9/2007: Paula will soon be publishing a new version of this book. Yay! Stay tuned and watch for it here on Amazon."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I think this is a great book because it gives you an opinion about the products. It also provides potential irritating ingredients for people with sensitive skin. However, use with caution. I agree with many of the product reviews. But I have also tried many of the products that Paula recommends. The result: I ended up with burns on my face and very chapped lips. She likes matte lipsticks, silicone based moisturizers, and benzoyl peroxide to treate blemishes. These are not good choices for someone with dry/sensitive skin that has a couple of blemishes. I think this book will be great for someone with tough, oily skin!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"As others have mentioned, the section on ingredients is the most useful portion of this book.Her reviews, otoh, are completely biased. Paula likes matte finishes and &quot;natural&quot; colors, and she lets you know it. I bought the book on the recommendation of an acquaintance, and at first glance, the heft of this book seemed impressive: over 1000 pages and she gives a nice overview of each brand, which is interesting as well as educational.Two things irritated me:1) Inconsistency-- some other reviewer had noted this before; how in the intro section, she advocated &quot;always put on sunscreen last&quot; as part of your daily skincare routine, while in other portions, she recommends putting on sunscreen underneath foundation. Okay, this didn't resonate with me at first, until I actually got the book and found the inconsistency on page 337. Hello, blatant contradiction. Now, this wouldn't bother me quite as much, except...2) This book purports to be &quot;scientific&quot; (i.e. backed up by research) and therefore objective. As far as I can tell, Paula's certainly done her homework on the ingredients listed, no question, but as far as her reviews go, it seems like she takes a few basic sound principles (like, alcohol is drying) and just runs with it, using them to justify her favorites and pan her nonfavs...For example, she pans the whole Shiseido line, and claims that antioxidants (like arbutin) found in their skincare line either don't work or are present in too minute quantities to work... Okay, Shiseido is the largest cosmetics company in Japan and has a fantastic research and development team of scientists... am I supposed to trust Paula's opinions on arbutin ? If you read through her reviews on the line, I think you will get more of the sense that basically, she simply dislikes Shiseido's advertising and image.That's not the only reason I found her book unscientific. Given the format of the book and this (holier-than-thou) tone of objectivity she uses, I expected that products which consistently received low marks would get poor reviews from her... wrong. Okay, if 100 users consistently pan a product for its gloppy consistency, etc... I would expect a tome of this kind to reflect that viewpoint-- I mean, what exactly is the point, otherwise?Bottomline:What this book really is, is one educated woman's opinion of a bunch of products. if you share Paula's tastes and you are interested in matte, creamy makeup in &quot;natural&quot;-looking colors, then go get this book. You will probably find her recommendations useful and her reviews are definitely a good way to find new products to try out. However, don't expect this book to be the &quot;beauty encyclopedia&quot; of products that it purports to be... nor is her research all that relevant when it comes to actual product reviews... they are colored too much by her biases.Actually, I think a more &quot;scientific&quot; way to go about it, is via consensus... if 100 people consistently offer up raves on one product, isn't it likely that you will like it as well? I would rather pick out new products that way rather than trust the judgement of one woman (who gives high marks to Estee Lauder's goopy lip glosses while panning Shiseido's eyeshadows ??)... that makes a lot more sense to me. And for that, thankfully I've found:http://www.makeupalley.comReviews from your peers on most of the beauty products available out there. And, since it's ongoing, it won't ever become out of date... unlike Paula's tome."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book cuts through the marketing hype and gives the lowdown on skin care, hair, and make-up products. You learn about basic ingredients and how many products overhype their effects. Not everyone will agree with her reviews, but at least there is scientific research associated with the views. You can't depend on counter clerks and marketing brochures to know what the cosmetics can and cannot do. The printed book does get outdated fast since everyone reformulates frequently. I would suggest at the very least checking out her website and think about subscribing to her newsletter. This is a good way to keep up with up-to-date reviews of new products. For example there are a lot of peels and scrubs touted by companies as being as good as salon services. They do some good but Paula talks about their limitations. At the very least educate yourself about the basics so you don't spend too much on water, mineral oil, alcohol, and fragrance."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This consumer textbook is extensive with the truth behind all sorts of marketing claims. Women are brainwashed by advertising and trick fashion photography from adolescence on the magical power of cosmetics. Begoun does a real public service in compiling an analysis of the real deal behind the most pricey and popular of brand names. At the end of the day ... paying more does not mean a cream or mascara will deliver more. Be wise and realize that buying beauty is never a right choice - for your bank account and even your health. I recommend this without reservation before any kind of purchase of a beauty item anywhere!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Some people think that the more expensive a product is, the better the product is. Paula's book proves otherwise. I love the way she bashes cosmetics brands that sells overly expensive beauty products (La Mer) that aren't neccessarily better than cheaper products (Cetaphil- still pretty expensive but as the book says it is non-irritant and saves your skin) . The book suggests cheaper products and ingrediants that can also be good as any other widely- know brand beauty products.As for being biased, I don't think so. Paula's line of product was not evaluated but just listed.I admire that she could help us, cosmetic junkies, save money and become more sensible when buying a product."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Reading reviews and hearing her advice on different products is almost as fun as actually getting out there and buying makeup.

I don't wear much makeup, but I still buy this book every time a new edition comes out, and I subscribe to her bi-monthly magazine. I also use some of her products, that she concocted herself after being frustrated with the lack of quality and low price of some essential makeup products (like sunscreen)this book is worth every penny, but you might want to buy two, because everyone you know will want to \\"borrow\\" it...."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have the previous edition of this book, and although I found it a bit helpful in rating and outlining the ingredients of particular cosmetics, her recommendations were limited to products that would look good on middle-aged and older women. I was about 18 when I purchased her book, and was interested in finding products that had more natural ingredients...it didn't help with that too much. I was also very much interested in finding sparkly makeup in fun colors that can complement a person's skin and eyes and hair (which, in my opinion can look terrific on younger women) that were of good quality, but Ms. Begoun would dismiss anything of an \\"unnatural\\" color or what she perceived as being \\"too shiny.\\" Most of her comments warned against products that will accentuate wrinkles. But what if you don't have any wrinkles and want something beautiful and fun?!?! I tried many of her recommendations like the Almay eyeshadows, which I think are good (now that I am older), but back then, and to some degree now, I thought the matte textures and colors looked bland and boring on a fresh, young face. Paula, I know that your findings were the result of using yourself as a guinea pig for these products, and I appreciate the fact that you provide an alternate source of information on cosmetics, but I suggest that you hire \\"younger\\" employees to test and evaluate products too. Everybody is different."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have this book in front of me now and I'm frustrated. Her criteria for recommending a product makes no sense. For those of you unfamiliar with her books, she alphabetically lists each product line, with that lines individual products randomly listed after each (frustrating - why not alphabetize). She uses little faces to rate a product. The face is smiling or neutral or frowning, depending on her opinion. If she really likes a product, she adds a check mark to the smiley face. I'm researching concealers by using her &quot;Best Products Summary&quot; in the back of the book. Wouldn't you think a Best Products Summary would be just that? Get ready to thumb through the book multiple times, researching what she recommends because it doesn't always make sense. For instance, here's what she says about a concealer she recommends with a smiley face and a check mark - &quot;It does provide opaque coverage and can be a problem if you want to hide, instead of accentuate, lines under the eyes.\\" What about this product deserves a smiley face and a check mark? In the past, one of her pet peeves is the price of skin care products, yet this time she has lots of them listed with check marks. One of them is $250 an ounce. How can she recommend that? Based on price alone she should give it a neutral face and says it's too expensive. This can be a useful book, but expect to research each smiley face/check marked product to see if you agree.

I've spent years hunting down water-resistant sunscreens with an SPF of 15+ and suitable UVA blockers (the ones that Paula claimed were approved by the FDA: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and avobenzone (called Parsol 1789)).Well, in a fit of consumerism last week I bought a glitter sunscreen from Sungirl without looking at the ingredients. It's a fabulous sunscreen as far as water-resistance and UVB protection - my very pale son Alex shows no sign of burn or tan after 2 weeks of using it - but when I later looked at it, I noticed that none of the so-called by Paula \\"approved by the FDA\\" UVA blockers were on there. I wanted to write to the Sungirl makers and ask them to include one of these ingredients, but thought I'd better get an exact FDA web page to quote. Paula merely directs people to the FDA website, not providing any specific web page to look at.Lo and behold - the \\"FDA has approved a few products containing Parsol 1789 for screening UVA light. The agency is evaluating the UVA light protection provided by other sunscreens, including oxybenzone and titanium dioxide, two of the ingredients approved for screening UVB light. Oxybenzone screens out only part of the UVA light that reaches the Earth's surface and, therefore, its effectiveness in preventing UVA skin damage is debatable. Titanium dioxide, on the other hand, reflects all light and is probably effective in preventing UVA induced skin damage.\\" (Originally I had the exact URL in this review but Amazon deleted it. But believe me, that is the exact text.)I spent more than six hours poking around the FDA website to find this information, and there is no clear list or indication of ingredients that are more \\"approved\\" than this. There is a long list of approved active ingredients for sunscreens, but it does not state their UVA-protectability versus their UVB protectability.Having found this, which is sort of a weak version of what Paula has been maintaining, it worries me that other information she touts as \\"mandatory\\" is just her interpretation of other skin care \\"rules.\\" I'm not going to use this book any more, based on this inconsistency.There are also some situations where I've been very, very happy with certain moisturizers for my very dry skin and Paula gives them rather bad reviews.

The website is now free and has the most up to date reviews. So why would you buy the book? I think she did this in order to reach a wider audience in order to market her own line, Paula's Choice. I highly recommend you check out her site. Even though I already knew a lot about skin care, Paula has taught me so much! What's great about her is that she not only recommends her products, but also recommends other cosmetics line's products. Who else does that?!

The downfall to this is it will take a little time looking for specifics - I would recommend this book with knowledge that it is not a fast read rather a resource book (think encyclopedia)"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I reviewed this book several years ago, but when I saw that Paula is still putting out this stuff, I couldn't help myself. As other reviewers wrote, all of the \\"reviews\\" in this book are based strictly on her opinion and nothing else. Oh sure, she gives (rather general) ingredient lists on occasion, and talks ad naseum about shiny eye shadow and frangranced moisturizers. But, the bottom line is: Every skin is different, and just because Paula did not like something does not mean it is garbage.The ultimate insult to any woman (or man) who purchases her book--or listens to anything she has to say--is the fact that she has her OWN LINE OF COSMETICS. How can Paula really expect to be taken seriously as an objective, unbiased cosmetic reviewer when she has her own line of products? (Hmm, I wonder which cosmetic line is her favorite and most recommended?) What is worse is, most of the information covered in her book and website are all over the internet--for FREE. Why are people continuing to pay money JUST to hear her opinion on something--especially when they already know what her opinion is going to be?I read the first edition of her book from cover to cover--and found so many contradictions, that it was almost laughable. For one thing, she said that serums were a waste of money, since they were nothing more than moisturizers--and it shouldn't be necessary to buy more than one product to moisturize one's face. Basically, according to Paula, serums were just another way for cosmetics companies to force the consumer to buy another product. Therefore, I do find it quite interesting to learn that Paula's line of cosmetics now offers a serum. Why is Paula offering something that, according to her first book, is a waste of money?Of course, when I was about halfway through her book, I realized it was not physically possible that she had actually tried all (or even half) of all the products she was reviewing. In many cases, her only criteria for her \\"reviews\\" was the ingredients list. It really is not fair to base opinions--and that is all they are--strictly on ingredient listings. That is like hearing a list of ingredients required to bake a certain pie, and then deciding whether you will like it or not--before even tasting it. Formulating cosmetics is a little more scientific than just having chemists throwing a little of this, and a little of that into a giant vat. If it were that simple, cosmetics companies would not be spending millions of dollars on research every year.The bottom line is, the fact that Paula has her own cosmetics line--and yet continues to do cosmetic reviews (and charge money for them) is the ultimate insult to the consumer. It is a never-ending commercial for her products--and YOU are the ones paying for the commercial. I learned my lesson after buying the first book. Wake up, people."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Great book, very informative. I have all of her books and buy all the new editions that come out. I also use most of her products and subscribe to the newsletter.However, the purpose of the book is to educate consumers not tell you what to buy. Only you can figure out what will work for you.

I think that if I was uneducated in the area of cosmetics, I'd find them to be slightly useful. But let the READER beware! I found the information on certain ingredients which aren't understood by most people to be useful. However, I lost a little respect when she made a comment to 'avoid' particular shades of foundations from one of the lines she reviewed in her book. Her reason was because they've got pink in them..or orange...etc. Now how does the person who swears by those shades feel? Anyone who knows anything about their skin, is well aware that your undertones are composed of several different pigments. some people HAVE more pink then yellow...or more orange than green, etc... Basically what she's saying is that because the shade didn't match 'her' skin, it's not any good. After reading that portion of her reviews, I thought, hmm, suppose every single one of these products she talks about are just not working for HER? Again, there is some useful information in the book, but try to use your better judgment before considering her the martyr for all us, 'clueless' cosmetic junkies."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I love this book.

I feel armed with information so I can be a savvy consumer. Never again will I feel like I HAVE to spend $40 on a 1 oz jar of moisturizer in order to know it's working. Paula set me straight. Oh, and I gave out the book as bridesmaid's gifts...what a big hit!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in getting the most bank out of their cosmetic buck - however, like many of the readers below I wondered what does Paula like? I totally agree with and understand Paula's anger at cosmetic marketers who promise miracles and creams that reverse aging. Nothing does that. Thanks to Paula, I'm now a real sceptic about marketing claims. Given the cut-throat competition in the industry, , I doubt the hype will disappear. And I totally agree with Paula that sunscreen is the most important anti-aging product you can use. However, alcohol and witch hazel are not always irritating to everyone and Paula does not discuss how various companies process the ingredients that go into their products, and this does make a difference. Also, I've tried inexpensive brands of make-up but they contain less pigment and don't last a day. Cheap blushers turn orange on me over the course of a day and you couldn't get me to use Maybelline mascara for a zillion bucks because it makes my eyelashes fall out. As for natural ingredients, I never had a problem with the Aveda line. I realize botanicals are being over-hyped but does that mean they don't work? Obviously, Paula thinks they don't but I'm not sure on what she bases this opinion. And for the record, I've read reviews of Paula's line and they were less than glowing. I am also confused by her reviews of L'Oreal and Lancome - she says L'Oreal is similar to Lancome but gives frowns to most of their products while giving smiley faces to similar Lancome products. I also disagree that eye creams and standard moisturizers do the same - most moisturizes are not emollient enough to protect the delicate eye area. And no, I don't work for the cosmetic industry. I've been using cosmetics as long as Begoun, though, and know what works for me. This book is a good place to go for basic information on ingredients and a list of good, inexpensive cosmetics. Start with the less expensive brands Paula recommends and if they work for you don't waste money on the high priced items. Be skeptical of industry claims. Know what ingredients are harsh for your skin and avoid those. Don't feel guilty if you like the smell and feel of a high priced item that Paula hates (I love Estee Lauder's ReNutrive throat cream - so what if it's just another moisturizer? I feel like the Queen of Sheba when I put it on). And use sunscreen."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"After reading and enjoying Begoun's other book (Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me) I finally got around to checking out The Beauty Bible. As a cosmetics editor, I found most of the information on choosing and applying cosmetics to be a compilation of the best beauty tips I've come across over the years on the web, in magazines, other books, etc. While I disagree with a few of her tidbits (for example, she says not to 'blush' your chin and cheeks and I find that a little well-placed blusher adds a nice glow), she does have good advice for teens wanting to start wearing makeup and for shaping eyebrows, among other topics. I also find the color photos of her step-by-step makeup application more than a little scary-looking; I'm not sure if it's the lighting or what, but she looks much better on the book's cover.I found the chapters on skincare to be the most helpful, since I've learned that it's easier to learn makeup application than to learn how to take care of your skin correctly, and because skin care products seems to be the area in which most women fall for false claims and spend too much money. Her advice on BHAs and cleansers (combined with her recommendations in 'Don't Go') have resulted in improved skin for myself and my husband. I do think she needs to revise the section on skin types, as I don't fit into any of the categories she mentioned (her definition of combination skin is the typical 'oily t-zone, dry cheeks and jaw'; I have an oily jawline and cheeks and dry skin everywhere else)."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is very helpful. I love it and live by it. She is unafiliated with any one company, so her reviews are totally impartial. She knows what she's talking about and so I trust her advice. She'll tell you if she thinks a product is too expensive, or if it will work well for you etc. She'll tell you why certain ingredients work or don't work, despite what the company says. After reading this, and choosing the products that you want to use, you'll never believe these big companies again who swear that their products will turn back the aging clock on your skin. Get this, and save yourself time and money.

There is also so much information about ingredients and what helps and what hurts skin that the book is still worth every penny.

I think it's great that she has a product line and since she has loads of ingredient knowledge, she most likely has some great products which also appear to be affordably priced."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Although the book is too heavy to lug to the cosmetics counter, it is loaded with insightful, practical information on almost every product line out there. Some pricey products are actually worth their hefty tag, while others are not and there are less expensive and often more effective products available at the drug store.You'll find out here. I mainly bought it out of concern for harmful ingredients,I have sensitive skin and I do not want anything with parabens and pgb's and other potentially harmful chemicals in them.

(I mean really! Does anyone actually NEED $300 skin cream?!?)Paula is like the girlfriend that everyone needs. She walks you through what all of the products do, so if you don't know why people buy toner, she explains it to you. And she tells you what to look for when you do decide to buy the stuff.It doesn't feel like she's plugging any specific line of products (except for her own brand, but what do you expect?) and you are given good options in every price range. So, if you are dying to spend $300 on a product, go ahead. If you want to know what the $9.99 equivalent is, she tells you that too.As a self-confessed lip-balm addict, this was the section that I found most helpful. She explained what ingredients you should make sure are NOT in your lipbalm, as certain ingredients actually make your lips worse! This segment alone made the whole book a worthwhile purchase for me.Highly, highly recommended, for everyone from your grandmother, to any young teen girls just entering the land of cosmetics.

THE FOUNDATIONS ARE WAY TO LIGHT. I WOUND UP LOOKING LIKE A GHOST. I HAVE TO TAKE VARIOUS SHADES AND MIX THEM. MOST OF THE BLUSHERS LOOK AWFUL.

Paula's list of products not tested on animals from NAVS isn't great. When I looked up Paula's Choice Cosmetics (Paula Begoun's own line)on the NAVS web site, the line was rated \\"Questionable\\" with regard to animal testing. Paula's list of cruelty-free brands doesn't resemble PETA's at all. I see PETA as the gold standard for cruelty-free product info. So...

Has she ever used La Prairie for a substantial period of time &amp; had a cosmetologist say, &quot;I don't know what you're doing to your face, but keep it up.

Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store.

She does say that these are her opinions. A person's opinions mean very little to me because like rear ends everyone has one. And in Paula's case, her opinions mean nil. I tried some of the products from her line and found them to be quite blah. She really needs to tell people in her book not to buy the garbage she sells. The only way to find out if a product works for you or not is to get some samples and try it out. There is no mass recipe for skin care, it is trial and error. All skin is different and no two people are alike. Just because something works for a friend, doesn't mean it will work for you.

For instance, I had suffered with acne for 15 years had tried every over the counter acne treatment(even had doctors sticking needles in my face) until I found Serious Skin Care. I wish she could look at my before and after pictures and tell me where did the acne,dark spots(I'm african-American),dry ugly peeling uneven skin went? My skin is even,clear,smooth and it feels good. I did my own comparison with the SSC cleanser vs Neutrogena acne cream wash (which is a little simular) and the Neutrogena made my skin itch so bad. And what is she talking about when she says that oily skin does not need a moisturizer? Is she crazy!! Acne skin in the winter wind without any protection on your skin! She also picks on Proactive Solution which I know several people who use that product and are satisfied with the results. The bottom line is if products did not work for the indiviual who uses them, I doubt that Serious Skin Care would be the largest auto-ship beauty line on TV and the people that us Proactive also have their product come to them by auto-ship. Sure I know that there is alot of hype when it comes to alot of products but to acne suffers when we find something that works, we stick to it no matter whats in it. Next time she should interview some people who use acne lines,people who suffered with the terrible cystic acne,large pores,oily skin,red bumps,whiteheads where over the counter treatments did not work.

I may not agree with everything she says, but I can respect what she says and the position she takes and I have learnt more than a few things from the book.

To an extent, you have to know your own skin and coloring for this to work (for example, I know that every foundation except Ivory in the Jane line is too dark for me!) Of course, the very fact that this book is pretty objective about an industry like this one does bring up some thoughts. What on earth are we doing spending forty-five million dollars PER YEAR on this? How many battered women's shelters could that fund? How many abused children could it help? Do you honestly think men would ever be hypnotized into spending their money this way??? But then, there's the fact that some women have jobs where they MUST wear makeup. A lot of us are just too used to it to change our ways now. And yes, it can even be fun. I certainly still wear makeup sometimes. And it's not as if the forty-five million dollars are probably going to go to better causes anyway.

Eventhough it is clear Ms. Begoun did a heck of alot of research to support her conclusions, I felt cheated when I realized she has her own product line. It bothered me that in one breath, the author would advise the reader to try products for herself, yet later she would emphatically state that a certain product was &quot;a waste of time&quot;. Perhaps another researching ingenue should test Ms. Begoun's cosmetics and give an equally honest critique.The information I found most helpful was the explanation of what actually goes into some of the popular products used today. I was also impressed that the author stressed the importance of sunscreen.

It was fairly obvious that she had many biases-- several of them unfounded-- that heavily colored her reviews. Most importantly, from the sheer number of reviews it is simply impossible that she has tried all of the products that she is reviewing. I imagine that she read the ingredient lists and jumped to conclusions based on those.This is a shame, because several of the themes I saw in her reviews (doesn't acknowledge the efficacy of essential oils as skin treatments; still thinks SLS is harmful topically in miniscule amounts despite mountains of scientific evidence to the contrary) had her panning entire lines of products that I know, as a skincare professional, are safe and effective.Not everything works for everyone, and that is precisely why it is important to road-test each product before reviewing it, and to test it on several different people. What works miracles for one person may not work at all on another. I, for example, had tried almost every line that she seems to \\"endorse\\" with no results, and ended up getting fantastic results from one of the brands she obviously hates. I expect that, in her career, she has had similar experiences with different skincare components and brands. The difference is that I am not using my personal experience as a basis upon which to make blanket recommendations for other people.My advice? Get a cosmetic ingredients dictionary, read the labels of what you buy, and make deductions from there.

I took it out from the library first, then when the latest edition came out, I snapped it up. Every friend and family member I've shown it to winds up buying it for themselves!! The recommendations are honest and straightforward. I can't even count how much money I've saved since I got this book....no more wasting time and cash on products that don't work, or worse, ones that clog your skin. My skin has improved dramatically since reading this book and following Paula's advice. Buy it and you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I got Paula's 2003 edition in 2006, but was sorry that it was rather outdated and in that edition she said she wouldn't be doing another one. So I was happily surprised to find a brand new edition in Barnes & Noble, and after perusing it I plan to order it from Amazon. A few comments: Some reviewers claim Paula gives negative reviews to most product so she can push her own line. I don't agree with that. In fact, in the 2003 edition which I have, she includes descriptions of her products but decided not to even rate them. I think in the new edition she DOES rate them finally. As someone who has really been a makeup junkie, particularly with trying out skin care products, I found her descriptions and evaluations extremely useful. I have tried cheap products and very expensive ones, and have found things I loved in both categories. One thing I DO believe is that the highly expensive products cannot really justify the high price tags. My own experience has shown that more expensive is not necessarily better. And cheap isn't necessarily bad. My own favorite cleanser, discovered by accident many years ago, is Cetaphil, and Paula rates that one highly. I just ordered a bunch of Paula's own product samples, and from what I can tell from small samples, I like them a lot, particularly her concealers. None of them irritated my skin. I've had a lot of trouble with sensitivity and skin scrubs, so I'm anxious to try her AHA gels instead of using granular type scrubs. By the way, the information on her website is useful and her lectures are interesting. Paula knows a lot and she has been studying and evaluating skin care for a long time. This book represents an enormous compilation of work, and there is nothing else like it out there. You may not agree with all of her opinions (for example, although I had hoped I wouldn't like it, I really do like Creme de la Mer despite its outrageous price, and I've found it soothing to my skin when it is in a reddish, upset state. I'd like to find a cheap clone of it, but thus far have not found one). The point is, you can use her reviews as a starting place for your cosmetics purchases. The fact is, cosmetics companies really do take advantage of us all and our desire to look good. I think we'd all admit that there are some truly outrageous prices out there, and after years of trying things, I have to admit I haven't found any miracles yet. It's a full circle, and I'm back to the point of trying to find products to cleanse and moisturize without irritating my skin. Nothing fancy is really needed. One interesting thing Paula provides is information where there is huge product overlap (example: all Olay's lines, with older ones now being cheaper and the newest ones costing quite a bit more. Yet, considering their ingredients, there is no real difference between them....you just pay more for the newer ones!!). All the beauty magazines feature various products (obviously \\"paid\\" by cosmetic companies to do so), and it's nice to find out more details about what these \\"really\\" are. In short, this is a great and very useful book if you approach it with the right attitude. For products I like, it's nice to learn exactly what component of the products creates the effect I like, too."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I was searching the web one day for facial products and saw a web site to Paula's Choice. I was curious as I had not heard of her products let alone of her book. I ended up ordering many samples of her products. I was very impressed with many of her items and wanted to know more about other products she writes in her book.I am impressed with her book as well. I took her recommendations on some of the products she mentioned in her book and found her to be on the mark (they were not her products). I also found it very dismaying the many companies that still use animals for testing. I check her book now and will not buy products from any of those companies.I have showed my book to many of my family members and friends that have been in my home and they found the book to be very informative. I have not let anyone borrow it as I feel I won't get it back. I use it quite often when checking on a product I might want to get.I just recently made an order from Paula's Choice as it has been wonderful to my face and with fantastic results.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"To those who complain that the book is a rip-off because Paula sells her own line of products - hello? Have you read any of her books? She makes it clear repeatedly that hers are not the only decent products out there. Of course she thinks her own products are good, and I have been satisfied with most that I have tried (and she does offer a money-back guarantee).She has recommended Cetaphil as a gentle cleanser and baking soda as a gentle facial scrub, much milder on skin than almost anything on the market. She must be making a ton of money off of those suggestions. (That's sarcasm, for those of you who don't get it.) Personally, I prefer her cleanser to Cetaphil, but I tried the latter first because she said it was good.The whole point of these books is to provide information - and yes, sometimes it is overkill, but it's not made to read in one or two sittings.Her experience in sales, which one reviewer denigrated, was not that she wasn't any good at it, but that she wanted to work with what was best for the customer. If the products her company carried didn't have what was best, she wanted to be able to recommend another company's product. You can imagine how well it would go over with Estee Lauder if they suggested going to the Clinique counter.Paula's express purpose it to provide information; after that, you make your own choices. Personally, I am happy to have the choice of her color-free and fragrance-free products, which are extremely difficult to find anywhere else, but that doesn't mean they are the only ones I buy."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"You absolutely have to read this before you buy ANY more cosmetics or skin care products!

Paula Begoun is therefore correct in insisting that the sunscreen that you use for yourself and on your child be one that contains UVA-protecting ingredients.UVA protectants are especially important for children, since most sun damage occurs before the age of 18.UVB protection protects the consumer from immeditate sunburn. Because sunscreens with only UVB protection allow you to stay out in the sun longer without burning, you may be increasing your exposure to UVA.According to the FDA and the AAD, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends that everyone use a broad-spectrum sunscreen having an SPF of at least 15, and advises consumers to check for ingredients that screen UVA: benzophenone, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (also called avobenzone and known by the trade name Parsol 1789).Begoun was correct in suggesting that having UVA protectants in suncreen is a must!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I've been a Paula Begoun reader since _Blue Eyeshadow Should be Illegal_ and have always, always found her research to be on the mark and impartial. Another reviewer deducted a star because her new line of skin care products and cosmetics is included in the book. Ms. Begoun includes them with descriptions but without ratings along with the many other products available because she recognized the conflict herself. This book and _The Beauty Bible_ have been invaluable to me even though I don't agree with her ideal of a more matte makeup finish.The product reviews will point out when an AHA or BHA product is inadequate (or dangerous), whether a 'natural' ingredient is irritating and when the latest 'miracle' serum is simply an emollient moisturizer. She also points out when a cosmetic is likely to turn color or crease in wrinkles, what's suitable for the various skin types despite the claims made by the company, whether or not the claimed SPF has the adequate formulation to be effective and if the SPF is even high enough. She says plainly what's good, what's mediocre and what is outright lousy.This book is to be used like any other reference, along with your own critical judgement."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I love makeup; buying this book was a no-brainer for me. However, as I read through it, I realized that unless your makeup preferences are parallel to Paula's, you're going to be hard put to find objective advice about the products that you are interested in. For example, throughout the book, the author comments again and again how she loathes any product that produces shine, glimmer, or bold color, which describes about 80% of makeup products on the market today. I am a woman of color and find color very appealing. I also like a little shine! More often than not, the products that sounded appealing to me were given a So-So rating by Paula.While I'm not hyping overpriced, unneccesary makeup, I find it very hard to believe her repeated claims that drugstore makeup is as glamorous and effective as high end makeup. If this were true, wouldn't we all be clamoring at Walgreens for the last bottle of Wet and Wild rather than noticing instead that it's the same bottle that's been there since 1983?If you have sensitive skin, love matte colors, believe that the only truly appropriate eyeshadow shade is brown, and are on a strict makeup budget, this book will be a lifesaver. There's a lot of good information about makeup in general. I wouldn't reccomend this book as a reference for people whose own cosmetic tastes deviate from the author's. Also, this book is dated; a lot of the new and intriguing products that have caught your attention at the Sephora counter or elsewhere are not going to be reviewed in this edition."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Although I don't agree on all points in this book, I found this to be an interesting read! I have tried numerous cosmetics and skin products and have found some of her recommendations were great and some disappointing. The one thing I wholeheartedly agree on in this book is how so many companies try to rip us off by using fancy French words. Some people actually do feel great when they know they've spend an extraordinary amount for a product. Why pay $38 for lipgloss when you can buy something very similar for $15 or $6?! Ooo! Ooo! Probably because the product must be great if it's $38 and all the movie stars use it! Pretty soon word spreads about the GREAT $38 gloss, well it MUST be great because EVERYONE is talking about it! Give me a break!Yes, it's true, you will not agree on everything you read in this book since we all have our own tastes, opinions and infuences. But Paula does have an extensive list of recommendations for each category which is definitely helpful. As stated in an earlier review, Paula does have her biases, but I still think anyone who loves buying cosmetics or anyone who is starting to buy cosmetics should at least read this book once to get some ideas."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I was hoping to garner useful information about selecting skin care product lines, but I soon tired of this book after reading numerous negative critiques. Begoun's negative tone was much too strong and repetitive to take her critiques seriously. It seems that only her line receives 100% high marks. It made me wonder how Begoun was able to evaluate &quot;over 35,000 products,&quot; effectively.This book lost all credibility when the author included her own line of skin and hair care products within the book. It was not surprising all of Begoun's products were posted in Paula's Picks as the best products to use. It was shameless self-promotion."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Contrary to what was written in an earlier review, Paula does not trash the competition to make her own products look good. How do I know? First of all, I have been reading her books for years, with her very first book, \\"Blue Eyeshadow Should Be Illegal\\". Way back then, she did NOT have her own cosmetics line, in fact that is a very recent developement. Second of all, it is obvious this person did not read her reviews for all of the cosmetic lines, for if she had, she would have seen, plain as day, that Paula likes and recommends many of their products. The fact is, Paula tells the truth, whether it is what you want to hear or not.I searched for years trying to find a book that would be informative and tell me what I needed to know about cosmetics. When I finally found her book, I was blown out of the water. I had no idea how much the cosmetics companies lie, twist and distort the truth, and that they can get away with it so easily. I was furious,yet I was glad I had found someone who would tell the truth, and I was determined to learn all I could from her. I have not been disappointed, as her help has saved me a lot of time, not to mention money, on products that not only don't work, but that I don't even need.If you are fed up with the lies in the ads, in the fashion magazines, and at the cosmetics counter (although, to be fair, many of the salespeople only know and believe what the companies tell them ) then this book is for you. I will warn you though, don't actually tote this to the counter with you or even mention Paula unless you have thick skin, as many cosmetic salespeople hate her, for obvious reasons. And if you get facials done, don't mention her there, either. They don't like her because she contends that just because something is high priced and called a \\"Professional Line\\", it is not necessarily any better than what is available in a less expensive line (contrary to their claims of \\"better\\" or \\"exclusive\\" ingredients). If, however, you are ready to save your skin and your money, get this book. It's the best you'll find."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I was running out of my usual moisturizer, facial wash, etc., and wondering if I should upgrade my skin care regime. I thought this book would be helpful in deciding what my next move should be in the skin care aisle at the drugstore. And is it ever helpful!At 41 I still have very few wrinkles (due mostly to very oily [ugh] skin), but perhaps it was time to put aside Ponds, and at least try Neutrogena, or Clinique or (pricey!) Lancome. Should I start forking over big bucks for little bitty jars of moisturizer, or individual ampules of magical skin elixirs? Should I at least pay another few dollars for a L'Oreal or RoC product?Nope!The gist of the book is this ... it's almost all hype (something which I think we pretty much knew already, but in this book that suspicion has been substantiated!). Claims by cosmetics firms are sometimes out-and-out false, or ... more frequently ... are only partially true. Manufacturers claim their &quot;botanical extracts, AHAs, oh-so-special vitamins, etc.&quot; will benefit skin, but include them in such minute amounts they have little impact. Ads are enticing, claims breathtaking, the packaging exquisite, the price eye-popping ... and the product mediocre! Thank you, Paula!So I went out and bought my usual Ponds Moisturizer, AlphaHydrox Facial Wash, and Freeman Scrub -- all products that work well for me, and don't irritate my skin.There are some problems with the book, though. First problem is that so many products are slammed it seems almost none are any good (so many, many &quot;unhappy face&quot; symbols on every page!). It becomes a game of choosing a product with the fewest evils at the best price.Next ... there is Paula Begoun's obsession with the sun and sun-blocking agents in products. I personally don't get a lot of sun, not even in the summer if I can help it, so all this harping on improper sunscreening ingredients gets on my nerves.One more thing ... if you have oily skin there really isn't all that much useful detail here for you. Begoun feels if you have oily skin then you don't need a moisturizer at all.I've found that if I slap on foundatation, etc., without first having used some sort of moisturizer, I'll break out. I need that thin film of moisturizer between my skin and cosmetics. I've also found that my skin is no more oily with moisturizer than without. The Ponds Moisturizer I'm using doesn't seem to be exacerbating my oily skin problem.That's it. The book's intelligently written and certainly comprehensive ... and sometimes quite amusing! It's fun to look up the descriptions for ridiculously expensive lipsticks, mascaras, etc. (many of which have earned &quot;unhappy face&quot; symbols) and then go out to buy a Wet 'N Wild product that earned a good review instead! Congratulate yourself on saving all that money on over-priced cosmetic and skin care products, and spluge on very good, very expensive chocolates!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I've bought previous editions of this book and found them to be very helpful. This version, however, left me disappointed. First of all, she dismisses certain cosmetics out of hand simply because some of their colors are &quot;too pink, too peach, too ashy&quot;. Well, what is that happens to be a woman's actual skin tone? And what does she mean by the term &quot;shiny&quot;?? Glossy? Iridescent? Wet? Radio-active??? Regardless, numerous products were similarly dismissed by virtue of their being &quot;shiny&quot;. She also rejects products that are simply not to her personal taste-- colored eyeshadows (as opposed to neutrals), glossy lipsticks, etc., many of which happen to be in this season's &quot;hot list&quot; with most fashion/makeup editors. If she doesn't like them, fine. But to write off a product on the basis of personal taste?Second, I did notice that her comments were much much more negative in this edition than they were previously. No one got all-around good marks! I kept wondering just what had changed until I got to-- you guessed it-- her *own* line of products. With a two page introduction to them, no less. At that point she lost a lot of credibility with me, and I immediately understood why other products were so roundly panned.No credibility here... Save your money."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I happened upon an earlier edition of this book when I was seventeen and it seriously changed the way I approach purchasing cosmetics. I used to feel bad about not having enough money to purchase all of my skincare products from expensive department store companies, and I used to be convinced that if something was more expensive, it was probably higher quality.Begoun's book really forced me to think about the corporate behemoth of the cosmetics industry and the untruths they spin to lure susceptible consumers (e.g. most of us). At the end of the day, all cosmetics--no matter how expensive or how hyped--are just different combinations of chemicals surrounded either by fancy or simple packaging. Some of these chemicals are good for the skin, some bad, but they are all merely chemicals.The advice found in this book is straightforward, immensely helpful, and--regardless of whether you agree with her reviews or not--truly ethical. For instance, her book urges again and again the incredible importance of wearing a good sunscreen with either titanium dioxide or Avobenzone (Parsol 1789) EVERY SINGLE DAY, rain or shine. Many expensive department store lines will be glad to take your money for their overpriced creams and makeup without ever reminding you (either in their sales pitch or in their product development) that if you aren't wearing a reliable sunscreen every single day, you're killing your skin.It's true that some of the reviews in the book are a little outdated (i.e. reviews for products that existed at the time of printing but which have since been discontinued), but this is not the author's fault as much as it is the inevitable result of reviewing over 200 brands that alter their lines every few months in order to stay in business. Also, even though it is probably true that Begoun does not try every single product herself (to do so would be disastrous to anyone's skin), I imagine she has a cadre of people who help her with the testing, perhaps based on skin type. And in response to the woman who said that if she actually took this book with her to a cosmetics counter, she would be labeled \\"a b---h,\\" let me just say that I HAVE taken this book both to cosmetics counters and stores like Ulta and Sephora, and if anyone has a problem with it, they can watch me not spend my money there and not earn them their commission.Do I agree with every single review Begoun gives? No. Do I run out and buy a product simply because she says it is good? No. Do I still wear jade green eye shadow (a big no-no color to her) on a regular basis? Absolutely. Do I still own products from expensive lines? Yes; some of them truly are better than cheaper products of comparable purpose. But does this book make sense of those impending counters at Macy's, Marshall Fields, Dillard's, and of the thousands of products available at pharmacy stores like Walgreen's which one usually can't test before buying? Yes! And that is why it is an invaluable book for all people who love makeup."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is an excellent resource and a lot of reviews miss the point regarding saving money and expensive lines versus inexpensive brands. Paula discusses products that make outrageous claims, are mislabeled for skin type, are misleading as far as color goes, and that seem to be geared too much to a certain generation (shiny for teenagers - not for those of us with wrinkles!). She reviews a lot of different brands and the associations the brands have with one another. I think her reviews can be scathing at times - but I think when cosmetics companies make products and charge a lot of money - $1000 for La Mer? (Bliss Spa sells it) - they set themselves up for ridicule. Another thing she emphatically states in the book is that a lot of cosmetics companies won't answer requests for info. Some info may be proprietary, but when women spend billions of dollars on this stuff, don't you think we have a right to know? I think it is because they don't want you to know that that extra $995 bucks is for the brand name and cachet that goes with it. I use this book for information. I'll still buy some of the products because I do like them, but I have found useful information about SPF (and the appalling lack of it in lines by dermatologists no less) and that some products I have been using are too harsh for my skin.

My skin went into total havoc and I was so upset that I had spent almost 80 dollars on cleanser, toner, and moisturizer that did everything it WAS NOT supposed to do. I HAD been duped...I ended up going back to the counter and telling them my experience with their products. I haven't been back since! So I ended up at Paula's website. I only use two of her products (2% Beta Hydroxy solution and the Blemish Control lotion) for almost 2 years now...and go to other brands for everything else but my skin is amazing now! I always \\"cross it with Paula\\" before I buy anything at the cosmetics counter, from make-up to what ingredients I should avoid because of my oily skin.

There was the \\"firming eye cream\\", \\"fine line minimizer\\", then the \\"firming and lifting\\" moisterizer, and then the \\" firming neck and chest cream\\", night cream, and on-and-on. All of these products promised anywhere from 47 to 67% improvements and it just didn't seem to be happening. But they had been \\"scientifically tested\\" - so it must be true, right? So I kept waiting and buying. Now I know the truth. I spend about $10.00 a month now on facial cosmetics.When I read this book I felt like Paula and I were sitting at a table having a cup of coffee. She's funny, scientific but easy to understand, entertaining, and writes in a conversational style. She does not put down cosmetic companies or their products in general - just the deceitful and dishonest claims that many of them make. She stays lowkey with her own line of cosmetics. Paula also gives valuable information on the use and application of skin care products and make-up.This is a must-read for anyone and everyone who uses facial cosmetics and/or make-up and hair care products. There is also a chapter on mens products and skin care!Paula is obviously an animal lover and gives information on which companies test their products on animals.

The quality of the paperstock is much poorer than edition #4 and while there are many new reviews -- if you haven't changed products, then your 4th edition will pretty much serve your needs. I am HUGE fan of Paula's - both her books and her products (which incidentially are terrific) but I wasn't swept away by the 5th edition - and for someone like myself (oily-skin), the categories for &quot;bests&quot; are numerous and confusing.

No, I haven't agreed with all of her recommendations, but guessing based on her 'first pass' has proven at least as good, and usually much better than my own guesses or guesses based on advertising or on a commissioned salesperson. I've discovered some great new lines (drugstore and department) and products as well. She also points out the bad shades (i.e. unnatural looking), which if you're over 30 really helps, and she lists the companies that still do animal testing. I know it seems conflicting since she went into the business, but she wasn't in it for a long time, and her reviews of the other lines don't appear to have altered any since she got in. Yes she recommends her own stuff, but she -- and her reader base -- recommends a lot of other products too (still too many to make the decision easy). I still trust her more than anyone else, she tells it like it is so I can cut through the hype, and I happen to really like her skin care line.

She also admits that we won't agree with all of them because we all have different preferences.As a person who has spent way too much money looking for a good foundation, these were the reviews I found most helpful. I particularly appreciate that she cautions about which ones are too pink, too orange, etc. I also appreciate the very thorough advice she gives for skin care. And I really like that she is straight up about the fact that sometimes drugstore brands really are just as good.I will never buy another cosmetic product without consulting this book first."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I've got some ambiguous review on this book because of the following:1. She mentioned her own product line in &quot;the best product&quot; list without reviewing it. I feel this as a hidden advertisment. It also made her reviews somewhat more subjective than objective.2. From many of her review, it seems that if a product contain one specific ingredients that is considered 'bad', all of the other product that contains the same ingredients is also bad. For example, stearic acid can cause pore-clogging if it is used in moisturizer (because the product has to be leave on the skin), but perhaps not so in water-soluble clenser (which has to be rinsed off completely and only leave minute traces of it). The same priciple also applies to other ingredients.3. In many formulation, the company often uses one ingredients as a part of the reagent, i.e. the ingredient listed could have been reacted with other ingredient to yield a compound -- a totally different substance from the inital ingredients. But the company has to comply to FDA regulation to list all the ingredients on the label. For example, egg, flour, sugar and milk are the ingredients for a cake. But you cannot see or feel traces of egg, flour, sugar and milk on a fully baked cake. The same applies to cosmetics. What's in the label does not reflect or indicate wheather the ingredients are either inactive, active or act as a reagent and has completely reacted to from another substance in the product. And since most of her reviews seem only based on ingredients listed, they are somewhat questionable.Nevertheless, the book mentions why some product works or doesen't work for topical application. This is for those who wants a better understanding and review of cosmetic products. But it's only a review from one person (who has no clinical or chemistry background) and should be consider as it is, not as the ultimate bible."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The first thing that flew out of the book when I took it out of the Amazon box was Paula's advertisement for her own product! I was completely shocked and felt like a dummy! I understand that she may feel, with all her research, she is an expert on the field, and even understand how she could possibly come up with an ideal product....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book will save you a ton of money and agravation. After reading Paula's reviews I know longer waste my time with high priced cosmetics when the drug store stuff can do the same thing just as well. Should you take the reviews as gospel? No. As Paula has said repeatedly in each edition of her books, you dont' have to agree with her. Some of the products she likes don't do anything for me and some of the ones she hates are cosmetics I've been using for years.The book does a great job of debunking beauty myths. There is no cosmetic that will shrink your pores. There is no cosmetic that will recreate your cellular structure and there is no cosmetic that will make a 60 year old look 15 again. Don't be fooled by the cosmetic industry.

But her negative tone gets to me very quickly in this latest edition, I must admit. The advice has changed my attitude towards buying makeup - no longer so extravagant; I mean who knows except yourself what you're wearing - and I discovered I shouldn't use anything with titanium dioxide in it and stopped having BAD breakouts (saving even more money). So overall it's good, especially for those with sensitive skin, oily or dry. Those lucky folks who never react to any ingredients don't need the book, although I think her message that you don't need to spend hundreds on skin care, anyone can use."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Ms. Begoun does not just tell us which products are good, she tells why.

The information on various products, how to apply, how they are rated is exactly what everyone that wears makeup should have. The most expensive is not always the best, I knew that but didn't know which ones were good - after all if I'm spending money on some designer cosmetic I want to get my money worth.

I tried all sorts of products some were expensive some were cheap, some where marketed for teens and others were for young women. I liked products because of the packaging and some because I saw the beautiful model wearing it.One day I went to the library and wondered if there were books on cosmetics, there I found Paula's first book. When the first edition of this book came out I was very interested to see what she had to say about the cosmetics I was using. There is no other book like it out there! No one has dared to compare cosmetics. Who believes magazines!? They are selling advertisments, aren't they!? Sometimes I am interested in a product and I see what she says and from that I decide if I want to spend the money. Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.When she came out with her own line, I thought like a lot of other reviewers on amazon have said &quot;Oh no she is biased! And, this is a big advertisement.&quot; But, has anyone counted how many products she raves about! She raves about so many products! And, some of them are cheaper then her own line!I have to admit one day I was looking for a good AHA product. There isn't that much information explaining which products have the good concentration. Of course she sells an AHA with the correct concentration. So do several other brands which she even recommends! I went for it and decided to try her version which I love because it is fragance free and color free! That was hard to find. From that experience my skin has improved even more because I look for fragance free and color free products and all of her products are. I still use other lines that I enjoy and she may not agree with but I wouldn't say she is biased especially since she still recommends other products.From her web site, this is how she &quot;rates&quot; a product. It is true that these questions might come out of opinion but then again that is what her book is!:&quot;Given the ingredient list, can the product do what it promises?How does the product differ from other products?If a special ingredient(s) is showcased, how much is actually in the product, and is there independent research verifying the claim?Does the product contain problematic fragrances (often listed as essential oils), plant extracts, irritants, or other questionable ingredients?How far-fetched are the product's claims?Do I feel this product is safe? Are there risks such as allergic reactions or increased sun sensitivity?Are there similar or identical formulations available that cost less? &quot;If you haven't read her books I recommend you do. You will be amazed! It really opened my eyes to the world of cosmetics. There are a lot out there and it is nice to have a guide out there."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Several years ago I flipped through this book at a Barnes & Noble (it may have been an earlier edition). It seemed intriguing. I thought \\"There are so many product lines out there that claim to do this for your skin or do that for your skin, but you don't know if any of those claims are true. Finally. A book that will explain them all\\". Ha! She is so biased it's sickening. SHE HAS HER OWN SKIN CARE AND MAKEUP LINE AND RATES HER OWN LINE IN THE BOOK! She would put happy faces next to products that she considered \\"Paula's Picks\\" or sad faces next to products she does not recommend. She pretty much trashes everything out there, but there are happy faces next to every product in her line. Also, she claimed that all of the ratings are based on scientific research of the ingredients found in the products, not reviews. However, when she rated the products in her line (a lip gloss, for example) she did not explain any of the ingredients, but stated something like \\"All of the women in my office wear this lip gloss and state that it is the best lip gloss they have ever used\\". What a joke."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Kindle is not a user-friendly format for this book.

A great resource if you are wondering if that $100 cream is really going to get rid of your age spots and which foundation might actually stay fresh the longest.

Couple of other products I like too were not her favorites, but not because they were misleading or harmful. One thing I was really surprised at (contributes to 4 stars) was that the book did not cover Merle Norman, which has a national presence in stores (did cover numerous other much smaller lines that most people have never heard of). I have used their makeup products occasionally over the years and liked them (sales staff had more knowledge then most and moderately priced).

She started more than a decade ago as a third-party unbiased critique for cosmetic products and gained a good reputation in the cosmetic industry.Her motto's always been \\"the highest price does not reflect the best quality in cosmetic products\\". So her mission was to uncover for her readers hundreds of inexpensive good quality cosmetic products.When she started her own product line several years ago, everything changed. Her real intention now is to make her readers/clients buy her own products. But she still needs to look trustworthy and unbiased. So what is Paula's solution now? The solution is very clever - she only gives high ratings to expensive products, those that are not HER competition. The inexpensive products that compete with her product line are either ignored or get bad and very bad reviews. For example, it is almost impossible to find any single inexpensive day-time moisturizer with UV protection in her book, besides her own \\"Paula's choice\\". The same situation with the night-time moisturisers, lipsticks, etc.I am very disappointed in her. Money making ability is a great skill, but when you capitalize on your good reputation, money will disappear as soon as your reputation is ruined. Today Paula is obviously cheating her readers. She may mislead one or even hundred clients (look at all those five-star reviews!), but the truth is getting out and will make her pay at the end."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book was a waste of my time and money.

I bought a moisturizer from Paula's Choice, thinking that her products must be good since she has critiqued all of these other products and knows what's good and what's bad.

It seems as if she's trying to do her best to hurt these companies. I use Erno Laszlo cosmetics, I have used this product for 30 years and for me it is the best line out there. My skin looks wonderful. I am 55 years old and am very often told that I don't look a day over 40. Really!! Women ask me all the time \\"what do you use? Your skin is so pretty.\\" Ms. Begoun's reviews of the Erno Laszlo line get nastier with each edition and I don't understand why. Yes, it is an expensive line. But no one is forced to buy it! I don't care if Dr. Laszlo wasn't licensed to practice medicine in the US. His ideas for skincare work wonders. Dr. Laszlo had a private practice and prescribed skin care individually. His product was used by Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Marilyn Monroe and more lately by Winona Rider as well as many other stars. Look at photographs of these women! They have/had lovely complexions! I feel sad to think that there are women out there that might believe Ms. Begoun and not try the Erno Laszlo line and miss so much. She almost seems to have a grudge against the line of cosmetics! Over the years I have tried other lines, giving up my Laszlo for a few weeks, and I always go back. I haven't tried anything else for the past 10 years. The Laszlo \\"rituals\\" are designed for several different types of skin, from very dry to normal to oil to acne-prone with different preparations for each, but for every type of skin there is the \\"rising\\" ritual where you rinse your face 30 times twice a day when you wash, before toning, moisture, treatment and makeup. My skin is so clear from years of doing this. Ms. Begoun says that soap is bad for the skin, that hot water is bad for the skin, but I know too many people, my daughters included, that use Erno Laszlo and would use nothing else.Ms. Begoun has her own line of products and I believe that since she is so against any line of cosmetics that is expensive, she probably uses the cheapest ingredients she can find. She gives so many good products, not just my favorite Laszlo but other lines as well, very negative reviews that are based mostly on her own arbitrary whims.She is very biased but I believe this is because she wants the reader to come to the conclusion, as led to by her, that her product is the one to buy.Don't waste your money on this book.

The author offers a lot of misinformation concerningingredients and companies. Hers is not a professional opinion.My professional advice would be for people to stop self medicating their skin without proper education and knowlegde of how to analyze it. There is a difference between Dry, Dehyrated, Normal,Oily, and Acne skin. If you don't want to spend the money on a professional, then please research some information, books, websites by Licensed Skin Care Professionals and Doctors before you buy anything or apply somthing to your skin that is going to be counter productive to the results you want.This author would lead the unknowing person to believe that expensive, French, or Spa skin care lines and Estheticians are over priced /or do not work because she sounds like she's on your our side. When in truth she is making a lot of money on people's ignorance.I found no credentials in her book to validate anything she writes. She knows nothing about ingredients and what they do for the skin. She knows nothing about the skin or skin diseases, nor does she offer any knowledge about the difference between an esthetitician and a dermatologist.The book isn't even co-authored by a licensed professional or doctor. Many estheticians work for Dermatologists, and many estheticians are Registered Nurses. She is not a Cosmetologist, Esthetician, Dermatologist, nor Chemist, nor Registered Nurse. She holds no Licenses or degrees from any State Board for industry professions studied, nor is her information objective. It's just entertaining. And it is really sad and scary that a few years ago, before I knew better I would have beleived just about everything the author was peddling. And I probably would not have gone and found out for myself the truth.THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE ERRORS AND PROBLEMS I FOUND:1.Papain is a well known enzyme both internally and externally.

L'Oreal Cosmetics, Maybelline Cosmetics, and Lancome Cosmetics are funded by L'Oreal the Corporation, but every company within has it's own researchers and developers.3. Not all Lancome products are fragranced.4. Most of the Lancome Products the author discusses in her book have been discontinued for quite a while.5. Dermalogica is a brilliantly researched line of skin care by the Dermal Institute. A company found by an Esthetician ( not a \\"facialist\\") from England, who spent three years studying the histology and physiology of the skin - which is what Estheticians are trained to do - in order to treat the skin (the largest organ on the body and the first defense against bacteria and infection). She began the Institute in the States, because of the lack of Advanced education among estheticians here. This was over 20 years ago.

SHE IS SELLING HER OWN PRODUCTS! While she blasts doctors for having conflicts of interest in selling THEIR products, she does the same thing........you just don't know it until you have wasted your entire day. I am furious!!!!!!!! Please do not waste your time on this book. I am either going to demand my money back for or throw it in the trash."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I recently bought this book and was quite disappointed. Although it rates over 35,000 beauty products, I noticed that the book is now quite outdated as it was published in January 2003 and therefore must have been written way before then.Obviously, the information being outdated was bound to happen at some point, but I didn't realize just how outdated it was until I'd purchased it. So, if you are looking for info on the latest products, then this book is probably going to be of very little use.On the other hand, if you would like an overview of all of the cosmetics brands that exist, then the book does a fair enough job. It provides a summary of the pros and cons of the different cosmetics brands before rating the products in the different lines.Other than product ratings, the book also includes some skin care tips, and has a cosmetics ingredients dictionary as well. However, I have found that most of the information included in the book could have been accessed on the author's Web site anyway, and so buying the book was rather pointless at the end of the day."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought this book with enthusiasm, but when I learned the author has her own line of products I felt like I had totally wasted my money. How can she honestly have an unbiased opinion when she has a real need to knock down other products? I disagree with many of her opinions and I wonder how many times she tried a product or company. For example, she doesn't have a whole lot of positive things to say about Mary Kay, but I wonder how many consultants she went to. I love my consultant and she has never done any of the things mentioned in this book! Maybe the author just had an unfortunate experience that most people won't have. At any rate, I take her &quot;advice&quot; with a grain of salt. I just don't possibly think she can be unbiased while she is selling her own line. Which of her own products does she not like?"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought this book thinking that I would learn more about cosmetics and skin care from an impartial consumer advocate. I did know ahead of time that Paula sells her own line, but thought that I could at least gain information about what is out there in the world of cosmetics. I am a BeautiControl consultant, so of course, I turned to the BeautiControl reviews. I am not a die-hard, brain-washed salesperson--I cross lines and will try any good product. When I read the BeautiControl reviews I couldn't believe my eyes. Paula listed products that are not even sold by BeautiControl! She lists Regeneration Gold twice--with 2 different reviews. In the first review she says it has 5% AHA. On the very next page, she writes that it contains 7% AHA. BC does NOT carry any Regeneration 3 line, yet Paula has very specific reviews of 2 products which include AHA percentages, prices, and amounts! Did she make this up??? If BeautiControl does not manufacture these items, how can Paula review them and provide ingredient lists??? BC also does not make a lipstick called Color Freeze Sheer Glamour Lip Color, yet Paula highly recommends this product and tells us it sells for $12. If one section of this book is fraught with this kind of mis-information, I have sincere doubts about the book as a whole. Is Paula's research ethical? I have my doubts!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Coming from a clinique counter I can personally tell you that a lot of her information is incorrect. Now I believe that not every product is for everyone but she is giving you wrong product info. For instance she states that turnaround cream is a good moisturizer and that is it, Actually turnaround cream has NO moisturizers at all, it is a chemical exfoiliant maid to break down dead skin cells refine skin and diminish signs of aging. Or she states that All About Eyes can be a very good moisturizer for all over. Please don't do this, it is not a heavy enough moisturizer for your face, it is a hydrater and also it has a active ingredient of Caffeine to stimulate your capilaries to pool out some blood and thus reduce dark circles and puffiness. Please talk to a consultant before using a product. We are here for you and one last thing, she has nothing to back herself up in, she isn't a chemist or a doctor."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"While the book was comprehensive and somewhat informative, I found it to be biased and sometimes irrelevant. Examples of both: Janet Sartin cosmetics are no more expensive than other department store brands, and what does a lawsuit against Mary Kay have to do with whether or not I should buy an eyeshadow? I received much better information from a dermatologist."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"When I picked up this book I expected to receive accurate and unbiased information about skin care and cosmetics. Instead, I read misinformation and sarcasm. I am an independent distributor for one of the lines that Paula reviews in this book. I was very interested to see how our products rated in comparison to other companies' products. I was confident that our products would receive rave reviews, because I use them daily and know by experience that they work wonderfully. When I read her review of our line, I was shocked! She reviews products in our line that do not even exist!!! She also gives inaccurate information regarding the content of the products and the claims that the company makes about the products. Products that she claims would probably produce no results, I have seen wonderful results from, not only in myself, but also in my clients. I cannot speak with authority about the other lines that she reviews, but I know the ingredients of the products that I represent and can tell you that some of the information presented is inaccurate. Not everything was inaccurate; however, there were enough inaccuarcies to shake my confidence in anything else she has to say in her reviews of other companies products.Another thought that crossed my mind in reading this book is that she cannot possibly have sampled and used all 10,000+ products listed. Where does she get this information?Finally, it is my opinion that this is one big advertisement for her products that YOU are paying for! She makes sarcastic comments about the other cosmetic companies while plugging her own line. Please be careful what information you choose to believe from the content of this book. It would be very difficult to say how much of this book is actually correct."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I would suggest potential buyer to browse this book at a nearby bookstore before actually purchasing it. I read the book and although I didn't find her remarks sarcastic, I have to say that it would only be useful to people who wants to &quot;check out&quot; a new line of skin care or cosmetics. It was helpful in that it could provide insights to some of the VERY EXPENSIVE line, so in general it's a good reference book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I truly admire what Paula is trying to do, expose the hype and outright lies foisted upon us by the cosmetic industry, which is why I gave it three stars. Personally, I think anyone dumb enough to believe a cream will strip 10 years off your face deserves to be out of $150. But given the fact that she has her own line to hype, I question her objectivity. I don't care for her sarcastic tone and she relies too heavily on the FDA, which is years behind the curve in regulating cosmetic ingredients. I remain absolutely unconvinced that she's tried even a third of the products she reviews. Her review of my favorite cosmetic line, Sage, is riddled with inconsistencies and downright inaccuracies. She bleats about how much companies charge for fancy packaging then slams Sage for its plain packaging and the fact that they don't list ingredients - but ingredients were always available on the web site. Sage is also the most consumer responsive cosmetic company out there which should score points with Paula but obviously doesn't. Again, Paula doesn't consider at all the processing method which does make a difference. I wouldn't touch the cheap mascaras she recommends and cheap blushers and eyeshadows don't have enough pigment and turn orange. Overall, I found Begoin's book filled with bias. Which makes me wonder whether the book isn't the biggest rip-off in the cosmetic industry."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula states at the beginning of the book that this is her opinion and her suggestions won't work for everyone. Then she goes on to tell us what is good and bad based largely on her own preferences. Is this about the facts or the world according to Paula? Each reader is better off learning what is best for their face and body, investigating product ingredients on their own. Save your money and read alt.fashion instead."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"As I have really sensitive skin which is also combination, I'm always looking for any assistance in the skincare department. The book gives a good overview of most of the products out there, but I don't always agree with her ratings or opinions on effectiveness . The book is also a good soapbox for Ms Begoun to promote he own range of skin care products, which I find a little tasteless. On the whole, not a bad investment, but don't believe every word she says. Her advice on cosmetic ingredients and their listing is invaluable though. I also agree strongly with her views on &quot;natural&quot; products being harmful, as an apprentice Naturopath I know that natural doesn't mean harmless, quite the contrary."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but this book is really great.

Now I'm going to buy her book about hair care."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book will save you a lot of money.

It's astonishing how much better quality product is offered in drug stores these days. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"My wife has sensitive skin.

Her cosmetic reviews have saved me money. I also enjoy her writing."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I found the book informative and well written. I especially enjoyed reading what I've already suspected, finding out that many of the high priced so called miracle cosmetics are definitely not all they claim to be. I'm so glad Paula makes a point to keep emphasizing sunblocking agents to be used in foundations or to simply use an SPF alone. We all need it. I use it everyday."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I am a Paul Begoun convert. I read one on her first beauty books, \\"Blue Eyeshadow Should Be Illegal\\" about 20 years ago and was hooked. I spend [a small amount of money]...on my skin care routine. I have avoided what most women my age have done: spent far too much money on make up. When I want to play, I take her book to the drug store and go crazy for [a small amount of money]....As for the criticisms, I think it is important not to take anyone's word as gospel. We really don't need ANY gurus. So, if you use a product that you like and works for you, just because she doesn't like it is no reason to a.) discount everything else she says, and/or b.) give up using a product you like and works for you.I should note that one of the things Paula includes in her ratings is the inflated claims vs. the reality of products. There are some good products out there that spoil themselves over too much hype and outrageous claims. Of course, the outrageous claims are required for a heavy price tag -- I am heading back to the drug store!!Finally, I have used Paula's make up and skin care products and find them to be very good. How are they different? Well, no outrageous claims, reasonalble prices, and good, basic stuff. No shine (for the over 35 crowd, this is important!) and no fragrance. I still use other products, but Paula does provide good options. That, after all is the point of the book, options and knowing what they are. A well informed consumer is the best defense against advertising. And a good defense against advertising really does protect your pocketbook."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I'm shocked that so many women have been duped by this book and her others. It seems like people assume that since a book is in print, that the interior pages must be absolute truth, written in stone. Not so. This self-donned &quot;cosmetics cop&quot; peddles the notion that the more natural skin care care products are a bunch of bunk and a waste of the consumer's money. She puts down the use of MOST essential oils, dismissing them as volatile oils that are skin irritants. Well, Paula, try doing your research! Pick up nearly ANY essential oil or aromatherapy book and they CLEARLY STATE that essential oils are highly concentrated and should be diluted with a carrier oil or other products, such as unscented lotion. She even dismissed lavender essential oil which IS able to be used on the skin undiluted.Furthermore, scanning a few pages of her website makes you feel like you are really soaking up a lot of knowledge that you need to know. Well, keep reading. As you read more and more, you find that it is all a clever web of pages designed to get you to buy HER products....products that reak of chemicals. She raves about mineral oil on your skin, but doesn't let you know that including it in products gives them a LONG shelf life, thus, increasing her profit margin.So...before you go to the cosmetic counter, do a little more research on your own and pick up a few more books. In my opinion, the &quot;cosmetics cop&quot; should have her badge taken away and replaced with a sign that says, &quot;snake oil for sale&quot;."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I think this is a very good way to buy decent cosmetics. One thing though, is that the author gives a bad rating for products that she says have skin irritants in them. I think everyone is different and wouldn't necessarily have a reaction to some of those things. I've used several of the products that she says will irritate skin, and haven't had a problem. (And I have very sensitive skin.)"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I won't buy cosmetics without referring to Paula's latest book -- yes, I have purchased every single edition.

Not to mention the amount of research that goes into evaluating all these products.Everyone owes it to themselves to be an educated consumer and Paula's books do just that."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The 5th edition's a great book for product reviews, especially given the sheer number of cosmetics lines covered and the fact that most products are individually reviewed. The front section of topics (such as what to look for in moisturisers, whether antioxidants have been proven effective etc) are very informative, as are those on how to handle breakouts and how to chose exfoliants (AHA/BHA etc) and sunscreens. Her advice definitely improved my skin, and although you might not agree with all her reviews (which tend to be skewed towards the cheap brands and generally very critical), at least it helps you make better-informed choices in what you buy. The promotion of her line Paula's Choice, though inevitable, bothered me a bit too. The \\"best of\\" selection at the back is good, although sometimes a little incongruent as products she's given lacklustre reviews can also appear, and the \\"best of\\" lists are actually quite long (though sometimes split into eg oily and dry skin parts which is useful). The dictionary of common cosmetic ingredients at the back is handy, especially in between editions.

This books review what makeup and skin care products works and doesn't. This book focuses on the reality of skin care products and exposes the fake and fantasy of makeup and skin care products. This book really breakdown certain ingredients that are skin irritants.I wish she review most the skin care products that aim ethnic groups like African Americans like Ambi and Palmers. Overall it is a good book. If you want a beauty book that isn't only aimed at skin care based on vanity (like anti-aging) and real skin issues (like scars). I recommended her other book, called \\"The Original Beauty Bible.\\" I wished she break down different makeup finishes like matte, dewy, and shimmer. I wish she went in depth on different genetic under bags (that have brown hue instead of blue) like tear trough and what make up is best for these issue.To the person dislike my review, how you going to dislike my review and I haven't write anything offensive? Yes, most of the products her company she reviewed were Mainstream companies, but I thought it would've been helpful she review companies that aim at different ethnic groups. Their many skin care and cosmetic lines that are specific aim at different groups like African Americans. You can't get mad or dislike my review for that. Other groups are citizens of this country too."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I thought this was a good guide for buying makeup and skin care.

I definatly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is an excellent book. I have put it on my wish list after taking it out of the library. Being overwhelmed by the amount of products on the market and in drugstores versus department stores I knew I needed help. Begoun helps with this book!She does a number of things:1. She talks about beauty in general - what we are told versus what her studies show, for example.2. She talks about your face! Everything you have every wanted to know about wrinkles, antioxidents, various vitamins, what works and what doesn't.3. Begoun then rates with explanations about 300 products including baby's and men's skin care products. In each review of the product line she gives perhaps a history of the company, she discusses ingredients, how the company has changed over the years and for whom the product may be best. She then lists many of the line's products with the price and what she thinks of it. For example, under Adrien Arpel's Bio-Cellular Night Eye Gelee with AHA Complex she asks, \\"How many AHA products does one face need? Thankfully none of these are effective exfolients, so don't worry. Basically this products is the \\"greasy kid stuff.\\" and goes on to tell us that if we have extremely dry skin, this product would work.She ends with her picks of products by category including sunscreens, cleansers and every kind of makeup you can imagine. Finally Paula has included a wonderful glossary of words. You don't know what ximenial oil is? Look it up! It is Plum oil that can have emollient properties.This is a wonderful book. I would love to have it along with her haircare book. I just wish it were less expensive."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I am sure just about every question you could probably think of regarding beauty care products is answered here. The book is complete, extensive, well-organized and factual. To date, I have not seen a better book written on this subject.I especially like the product ratings, although the reader may not entirely agree with all of them. That's fine, peference is an individual thing. One must keep in mind, the cosmetic industry in general is a multi-billion dollar business, and every cosmetic company out there has developed an extensive marketing and promotional strategy to convince you, the consumer, their product is better than the competition's. Beware! Do not be swayed into thinking the more expensive the product is, the better it must be. Sometimes you get what you pay for, often you do not - like a lot of other things in life.How many of us truly know what is in the beauty products we are buying. The book was very helpful in this regard. Some people do not care what is in it as long as it works. Personally, I want to know what is in it, what it does, how it works and the effect it may have over long-term use. I also want to know if the product has been tested on animals. If it has, it stays on the shelf, regardless &quot;of the wonderous fountain of youth&quot; the salesperson claims the product contains. Do not rely entirely on the salesperson's or beautician's expertise; quite often they receive a commission on sales, so if you were in her shoes, wouldn't you be inclined to make the product sound as if &quot;your youthful complexion is going to look precisely like the cover-girl of your favourite fashion magazine&quot; or &quot;the wrinkles on your fifty year old skin are miraculously going to be transformed into the youthful, dewy, flawless skin of a twenty year old?&quot; For most of us that would call for a magician, not a beautician!I did find this book to be extremely helpful in revealing the facts and reality of the beauty product industry, weeding out what is good and what is not. It is certainly a book worth reading, even if you do not necessarily agree with all the information provided."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"If you like to throw money away on overpriced cosmetics and are foolish enough to beleive the inflated claims made by the companies that sell them, this is not the book for you. Go buy the latest issue of marie claire, which the editors fill with little blurbs for embarrasingly costly cosmetics. However, if you're interested in finding effective and affordable products that can help you look your best, buy this or any one of Paula's indispensable books.

And, what's most important: with Ms. Begoun's advice on sunscreens, I am finally doing everything I can to protect myself from future wrinkles and skin cancer, without smearing a slew of unnecessary moisturizers (with their preservatives and irritants) on my oily, sensitive, breakout-prone skin. As far as her 'attitude' goes: she's angry at the cosmetics industry, and justifiably so! The misinformation they regularly put out to women is irresponsible and can be harmful."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I, too,upon reading this book, found that it offers great justification for downsizing, pricewise, one's beauty regime, regarding both treatment and makeup products. I immediately ran out to the closest Clinique counter, and purchased Dramatically Different Moisturizer rather than my usual Moisture on Line, which I had been pretty well pleased with. No more Lancome mascara for me...it was Maybelline all the way.Well...three months down the road, my skin looked dull and lifeless. The Cetaphil cleanser that I had started to use was not doing what my former, more pricey cleanser had done. The Maybelline mascara was great, but it did not wear nearly as well as the Lancome mascara. It didn't take long for me to resume using products that were higher priced, yet effective. Basically, you have to determine what your priorities are, before reading this book. If your main goal is to economize, and you are willing to sacrifice benefits, results, and convenience, then look for the smiley faces without the dollar signs in Paula Begoun's book. But if it's results you are looking for, if you want your mascara to wear well, your lipstick to stay on, your foundation to hold a true color, and still be on your face, and not your clothes at the end of the day, I would suggest putting this book on a shelf, where I believe it belongs, along with every other biased and one sided works that we have spent our hard earned dollars on.Is there no merit at all in this book? Of course there is some. I believe that Paula probably gave what she believes to be a fair and just review of her own cosmetic line. There is worth in everything. It's just that in this instance, what you get is much less than what you think you are getting from this book.Nice try, Paula. If everything that you said was true, cosmetic counters would no longer be center stage in most of our department stores. Yes, beauty is a business, but writing books and having them published is a business as well.May everyone enjoy the fruits of their efforts."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is a supremely interesting read for anyone who tends to buy and try TONS of makeup and skincare products. I have not been able to put it down since I got it in the mail. For 90% of the products in the book that I've tried myself, I agree with what she's written. Yes, it's annoying that she reviews her own products in the book (don't even bother reading those), but it's easy enough to overlook when she gives a lot of high ratings to other brands. I liked reading about the ingredients in cosmetic and skincare products, even if some other reviewers note that that list is incomplete. I wouldn't expect her to be able to cover every ingredient in existence.The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is her obsession with sunscreen and matte, neutral makeup. I don't think it's necessary to give a foundation, powder, or moisturizer that doesn't contain a sufficient amount of sunscreen a low rating for that reason alone. I want to know how the products will look on my skin and last through the day, without regard to sun protection. Besides, if we use one product with sunscreen in it, there's no need for everything we use to have it. Additionally, I'm in my twenties, and I'll wear shimmery eyeshadow or purple eyeliner if I want to. It's a little bothersome when she critcizes a great product just because they offer too many blues, purples and greens. Overall, though, this book is great!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is well organized so it's easy to go straight to the information you're interested in. The product lines and individual products under a specific heading (e.g.,cleansers) are listed alphabetically. Paula Begoun rates all the products available from each skin care and/or make up line. Then she also lists the best of everything alphabetically. You make the ultimate choices based on your budget and what is important to you. Although Ms. Begoun does have her own line of skin care products, she doesn't give them any special preference over other lines. She tends to be a little preachy on some topics. She doesn't like shiny or glossy anything, but she recommends items that have these qualities for people who do like them. I recommend also reading The Beauty Bible by Paula Begoun in conjunction with this book. It helps you find out what kind of skin you really have and what skin care program will help you look your best."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun's books have in the past been somewhat informative, but her latest edition is a waste of money. The reviews have not been updated, (there are a lot of products listed that are no longer made or have been reformulated) and the whole thing comes off as a sales pitch for her new line of cosmetics! She's just trying to sell that now on top of just selling her books, a bad combination! The reviews have the feel of &quot;this is why my products are better than theirs.&quot; Taking the advice of Paula Begoun is now no different than asking Clinique what they think of Lancome! (except they would probably be more tactful!)"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"What a great reference to have. Every woman who wears makeup should get this book! I took it to work with me one day and almost did'nt get it back. So many of my co-workers got helpful info. The author is very easy to understand and so well researched all her material. I was very impressed. I've also changed my own skincare regimen and have seen results. Her own products seem to be very consumer friendly especially to the pocketbook.

This book has done the research for you and is definitely worth looking into!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I am amazed at some of the reviews which demonstrate that some alleged readers didn't read the book very carefully at all. Paula clearly admits that the reviews in her book are her opinions. However, I've been reading her books for over a decade, and her opinions are based on solid, thorough, scientific research NOT funded by anyone other than herself. I don't know of another book that can make that claim. She mixes her opinions with facts that few others dare because she has nothing to lose in the process. When she tells the truth, we all benefit. Articles in women's magazines stand to lose an enormous amount of advertising revenue if any editorials threaten to blow Estee Lauder, Lancome, Clinique, Maybelline, or any cosmetics company that spends literally millions of dollars in ads off their solid gold pedestals. Paula also states quite clearly that if a certain regime or product works for the consumer, then the consumer should stick with it.However, for the rest of us who need guidance in choosing what is best for our skin and make-up routines, this book is a godsend. She rates products on the ingredients they contain, their effect on the skin, and how well they work. She never claims that all products purchased in a drugstore are as good as those purchased at expensive prices in department stores. She freely acknowledges some poor products that are inexpensive do exist. And she also acknowledges that some poor products which are expensive also exist. In other words, the price of the cosmetic has nothing to do with its effectiveness, safety, or application.What this book really does is give facts to help the consumer separate fact from fiction. One time when I was shopping for a toner, the cosmetics woman at the department store told me that the alcohol contained in her product was \\"cosmetic\\" alcohol - not the alcohol that would dry the skin. Sounded good to me....until I thought about it. Paula cuts through the sales talk to which too many of us have ignorantly submitted and taken as gospel.The book breaks through the \\"natural\\" myth, as well. Of course, we all want as natural as products as possible. What the natural companies don't often tell us, however, is that besides all those wonderful-sounding names are some very basic (harmless) chemicals that actually perform the task of the product. I personally like Aveda's hair products, but it isn't the natural products that are cleaning my hair - it's the chemicals. Paula helps us differentiate between what chemicals are harmful and which ones are beneficial. It often has little to do with brand name. Some products in a certain line are highly rated, and some are not recommended.The piece of advice that I garnered from the book, for which I shall forever be indebted, is the use of BHA (beta hydroxy acid) on my face. It has given my skin a brand-new look and made my skin healthier and better-looking than when I was a teenager back in the 1980s! I'd tried different ways of exfoliating but her recommendations of BHA for skin that is blemish prone and of the exact percentage (1% for me) was probably the best skin care advice I've ever received. I was nearly ready for a (completely unnecessary!) chemical peel costing an obscene amount of money and committing unknown damage to my skin when I learned about BHAs from Paula's book.It's true that Paula does have a line of both cosmetics and make-up. However, for anyone who's read her books, she does not push them at all. She speaks generally about ingredients and about what to avoid and what to seek. Her products are simply listed with the other 200+ brands! I do admit that I love her products because I know I can count on them not to contain perfumes, dyes, and other extraneous items that are used to sell most cosmetics. As someone with extremely sensitive skin, her skin care products are magnificent.I think the biggest boon to Paula's credibility is that she is not immune to changing her mind or advice, based on new research. She demonstrates a true ability to learn and grow with the rest of us. Too many \\"beauty\\" books contain a lot of fluff and little substance to really help the reader. This book contains a lot of raw facts and arms the reader with an arsenal of knowledge to help her (or him!) make the best choices she can for herself. Whether or not many people will admit it, a lot of cosmetics and skin care companies have been forced to revise their products in our favor due to the information contained in Paula's books. We owe her a lot."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I'll try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review.I'm a pretty big fan of Paula although I don't agree with *everything* she has to say. Being in the skin-care industry myself (I am a bio-chemist) I feel as if I am a little more aware than the average consumer. Some of her research seems dead-on while some seems a little off-base. I'll explain:Natural ingredients. I happen to be a huge fan of natural ingredients yet Paula, I feel, is way to harsh on companies or products who use such ingredients. As an example, she seems to be a huge fan of mineral oils and petroleum (both biproducts of the oil industry) while I am not. I just don't understand why she uses mineral oil and petroleum as her main moisturizes and praises any formulation that uses them as their main moisturizers. The molecules are simply too large to thoroughly absorb into the pores. They just sit there on the skin and look greasy. On the other hand, plant based oils are lighter in texture, are from natural sources, and are loaded with vitamins. Mineral oil just sits on your skin and clogs the pores.Essential Oils. When used in moderation (preferably in concentrations of %0.25 - %1) essential oils can work wonders on the skin and, I feel, are much safer to use than their chemical counterparts. Tea tree essential oil, for example, is one of the few things I can use that zaps my blemishes. On the other hand, Paula seems to be a rabid fan of BHA. Although effective, it is just too harsh for most people. She seems to really bash anyone who uses essential oils in their products. These are basically natural plant extracts that have several benefits for the skin and are meant to be dilluted and used only in small amounts. Sure there are some companies that overdo it (I won't name names though I can think of one in particular) but when used in the right amounts, essential oils can have awesome and natural benefits for the body.Fragrances. Though I totally agree with Paula in that fragrances should never be used on the face or eye area, fragrances are a nice additive in \\"fun products\\" like bath oils or shower gels. Again, they are used in such low concentrations (%0.50 - %3) that only those with extremely sensitive skin should avoid fragranced products.Product Reviews. I understand why she did not review her own products in her book (it seems like some of the other reviews in this section have a problem with this). But it would make no sense if she did rate her own products. If she gave one of her own products a low rating then we would just think \\"well fix it, silly.\\" lol On the other hand, I do think some of her reviews of other companies were completely unfair. Who cares if you don't like shiny eye-shadows or fragranced items- those are not \\"scientific no-nos\\" but personal opinion.Pricing. This is something I agree with Paula on more than I disagree. If you are paying more than $35-$50 on a facial cream, chances are, you are getting ripped off. Remember, in order for the emulsion process to work, water makes up approximately 70% of the total formula. No matter what else is in it, these companies that charge outrages prices (like $250 for 1 fl oz. of facial lotion) are out of their gourd and are really taking advantage of the consumer. I recently purchased a facial serum for $129. The main ingredients were water and vitamin E- Something I could have made myself for $2 if I had bought the ingredients myself at a health store. So on that end, to an extent, somethings can be way overpriced so I have to give Paula kudos on exposing that one (although expensive items don't necessarily mean overpriced). I usually stick to the \\"$35- $50 rule of thumb.\\" If it's over $50, chances are, you're getting ripped off.Hope this helps some people. This book was pretty much a hit or miss with me."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I used to work selling cosmetic ingredients. Meaning that I didn't work for any particular company, but in selling ingredients via a broker to cosmetic chemists and scientists of major cosmetic corporations. Because of this, I learned a wealth of information that I am not sure the author may have gained, although I do believe she has good intentions.The major discrepency I would point out at is that petroleum based products are her go-to moisturizer. Petroleum jelly and petro based ingredients are very cheap for companies to use so it's been highly popular. However, it's been banned for use in cosmetics or skin care ingredients in Europe because it's been shown to often carry carcinogens. It does, after all, come from the ground...It is actually currently going through FDA retesting right now in the United States because of this. (Google \\"petrolatum cosmetic toxin data\\". It takes waaaay longer to ban something in the US than other countries if it's been shown to cause some problems.) Because of this, any company I sold ingredients to that was big enough to be a world-wide company would not order any petroleum based ingredients because they are banned as toxic overseas already and are expected to be here in the next few years. Yes, petroleum jelly...what people put on their babies in the United States is banned as a skin ingredient elsewhere and expected to be banned here if tests go as expected.She has her own cosmetics line that uses many controversial, but very cheap ingredients. That bothers me. For example, she is against all-natural and organic ingredients and says so clearly. However, these have been shown in so many cases to not only work better, but be healthier...yet, they are far more expensive for a company to use in manufacturing. In looking at her own cosmetics line, she certainly doesn't seem to go for the most proven yet more costly and natural ingredients...they are, instead, quite basic and inexpensive...I am not saying this is profit-driven. I am saying that cosmetic scientists have much to say about it.There are many things the basic consumer is not aware of. For example, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate are some of the worst cleaning agents you can use in your hair, are highly stripping, and are also used in industrial floor cleaners. Yet in the United States, we equate \\"foaming\\" with \\"clean\\" and these are high foaming agents. They are also not used in Europe where there is more consumer knowledge about cosmetics and ingredients. Marketing-wise and price-wise, shampoo companies get more profit from using these. However, if you locate a shampoo that is sulfate and paraben free (They are getting far easier to find now as the consumers in the US become more smart on what they are using on their bodies) your hair will SHINE. If you dye your hair and avoid these ingredients, your color stays in twice as long, but if you go to a hotel and use a cheap shampoo with these in it, you'll see a great deal of the color wash out that day. It's that stripping of your hair's natural moisturizers as well as color. I have never had a hairdresser not commont on how incredibly healthy my hair is since I learned this. And I dye it which they can't believe because that SHOULD be stripping...but my hair gets no SLS products so it's strong and shiny. Although she is a hater on natural ingredients, science says otherwise.Now let's cut to acne products. If you see commercials like Proactive you'd assume you should pay more for a name. In reality, all over the counter acne products are the exact same thing (one of 2 products)...either up to 2% Salycilic Acid or up to 10% Benzoyl Peroxide plus other inert ingredients. They both work on acne differently but, by law, over the counter products can only contain that certain amount of either ingredient. Some products, like Proactive actually have LESS of the active ingredient than generic brands however! (you are paying for the marketing, not a better product) So forget the name, turn the bottle over and look at the ingredients...If 10% Benzoyl Peroxide works better on your skin than Salycilic Acid, Use the cheapest product with it. Proactive wash only has 2.5% and all other ingredients in it are inert (you will see 2.5% benzoyl peroxide listed as the only active ingredient on the back of the bottle) so you are getting less but paying far more, for example. On the other hand if Salycilic Acid works better on your skin, use a product with 2% of that. Forget the name. But you aren't going to get any difference in strength with a different product up to a certain amount. It's illegal for an over the counter med to contain any more than this. And there are only 2 primary ways to fight acne in over the counter meds (unless you go all natural) and that's it. The other ingredients are inert. How do they both work? Benzoyl peroxide knocks off the top layer of skin cells to open pores, Salycilic acid is actually chemically similar to aspirin (which is why you can put crushed aspirin with water on a zit in a pinch and get good results) and SA will not only slough off the dead skin cells which clog pores as well, but it will also fight the bacteria within the breakout and also prevent clogging of the pore in the future by helping to reduce the pore size. Because of this, for most people, 2% salycilic acid is a better acne medication...because it does more. But everyone is different. If your skin works best with Benzoyl P, just find a cheap brand with 10% Benzoyl P in it instead. Just remember to read the label...in over the counter products 10% Benzoyl Peroxide is the most it can contain by law or 2% salycilic acid. Paying for water and other fillers , or a product with only 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide is getting less but paying more for a company's ads.And guess what? Does a product you use tingle? Cosmetic companies put things that tingle in the product that are inert to make you feel like they are working. Americans equate tingling or burning with \\"it must be doing something\\".You don't need to buy expensive tanners at the tanning salon. Buy a regular brand...Same thing.But do not buy No Ad sunscreen...this is where you don't want to go generic. Those ARE worse and watery and won't stay on.Look, it's a profit driven industry and these are just some examples. Unfortunately, I feel this book is also profit driven in pushing the cheapest ingredients that are also used in the cosmetics that the author sells even though some of what she pushes the hardest have actually been banned in other countries due to skin problems and health problems and are expected to be banned here as well in spite of the alternatives being more expensive for cosmetic manufacturers--which is why they are lobbying against it.She mentions alcohol being drying and to avoid it--which it is in hair care products such as mousse BUT there are ingredients in the best skin care lines or hair care products that contain the name \\"alcohol\\" that are good ingredients such as stearyl alcohol or benzyl alcohol which are fatty alcohols. In fact, stearyl alcohol acts as a thickener and is the exact opposite of drying...so much so that it's used commercially in swimming pool liners to PREVENT the evaporation of water! (I kid you not) Benzyl alcohol is an all-natural ingredient and is derived from plants and is commonly found in fruits and teas and found to be beneficial as a natural bacteria reducer and is very good for your skin. You will find it in essential oils such as hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.The idea of the book is a good one and she does have some useful information in it...she just missed the mark according to cosmetic scientists in my own discussions with them. And I have worked with the best and the brightest."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is a great book. Because of it, I have saved lots of money by not buying overrated products. I am very grateful for how educating and eye opening the book was.However, I must say that I only take what she says with a pinch of salt. She has very strong opinions about expensive brands, shiny makeup, moisturizers and blue eye shadows that sometimes, you wonder if she is doing a fair analysis of each product. I agree with several of the others who commented that she seems to hate expensive skin care lines and the cheaper the product, the better. She seems to find whatever she can to attack an expensive product that may not live up to its miraculous claims but may still do wonders for skin.As for her own skin care line, I believe it is a good line based on reviews I've seen, but I was disappointed that she was not confident enough to give her products smiley faces, or truthful enough when reviewing them. Most of the time, her review was &quot;the concentration of ..... here SHOULD be good for ... skin&quot; If there was something not perfect about her product, she should say it, otherwise, go ahead and give it a smiley face. Afterall, isn't plain honesty and unbiasedness what her book is supposed to be about?I was also disappointed that while she was so strict in her review of products, yet when it came to the list of best products, almost every single product with a smiley face made it to the best list. I guess what I was hoping for was the best of the best.My advice is to use her book to educate yourself on the list of ingredients of products, because this will help you to judge for yourself whether a product is worth it or not. Ultimately, you know your skin best and one man's meat is another man's poison.Go ahead, buy the book, because despite all the cons I've mentioned, this really is a useful book and it gives you a second opinion of a product to neutralize all the slick advertising and persuation the sellers of the product will entice you with. Think of it as getting information from two opposing sides and you being the judge to decide."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"There are a lot of ingredients in skin care products and cosmetics that are bad for ANYONE'S skin and Paula lets you know which ingredients these are and which products contain these ingredients. I like the way she's not afraid to tell it like it is and be honest (some people would refer to this as sarcasm). She also points out which expensive products and reasonably priced products have the SAME ingredients so you don't waste a lot of money. The first cosmetic purchase I made after reading Paula's book I saved enough so that the book paid for itself. I have to say that the cheaper brand is doing just as good a job as the more expensive brand. Also since I'm sure she knows what she's talking about, I purchased her skin care routine. I LOVE it. My skin looks and feels better than it has in a long time and my makeup looks great because of her opinions. Now every time I need to buy something I refer to her book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought this book several years ago, and have peeked at the new editions in the bookstores when they come out. She does make some very good points:* the sun, not aging, does most of the damage to skin, so use a sunscreen!* The best sunscreens have avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide.* More expensive is not necessarily better.* Most of the hype in the cosmetic ads is misleading and they don't do what they lead you to believe they do.I've used her reviews for some products, and have generally been happy with the results.However, there are several things about the book I do not like:* She will not recommend a foundation with SPF if it does not have one of the sunscreens mentioned above. But she does recommend foundations without an SPF. That doesn't make sense. As long as you use a moisturizer with the appropriate sunscreen in them, it shouldn't matter what foundation you use.*Her focus on yellow-based foundation colors. I've tried several, and they just do not look good on me. Some people may need a bit more peach or pink in their foundation, like me.* She mentions that doctors who make their own product lines are suspect, yet she herself has produced a line of skin care products. I haven't found in the books why her products are so much better than anyone else's. She should rate her own line and explain why it is so good.*She hates products that have ingredients that might irritate the skin of some people. That is good information to have if you do have sensitive skin, but if you don't, then that is not a reason to avoid the product.*She gives negative reviews to some products that she obviously hasn't tested. For example, I recently started using the skin care products made by N.V. Perricone. He wrote The Wrinkle Cure, and developed his own line of skin care products. After about two months, my skin has never looked better. I don't even wear foundation anymore - I don't need it. I just use a tinted moisturizer (with appropriate SPF!). It IS outrageously expensive, but to me it is worth it. And I don't use the entire line - I just ignore what I think is unecessary. Nothing else has worked so well for me. Paula writes a skeptical review. But did she actually try it or talk to someone who has?* Her constant push for matte colors. I have several that have a shimmer to them, and I love them. I do not think they make me look older (eyeshadow). I love lipsticks and glosses with some shimmer. I generally don't like the feel of matte lipsticks, so I end up putting some gloss on top of them. I don't think it looks ridiculous. I don't use products or so many that I shine like a light bulb. I think she needs to get over it.* I try the cheaper brands of cosmetics, but more times than not I don't like it. Sometimes they are okay. But I usually go to othe department stores.The bottom line is that there is good information in this book to educate you so you can research and make up your own mind. Don't, however, take all of her reviews as gospel."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I am not surprised that so many people have had a negative reaction to this book. The idea that cosmetic companies are not looking out for our best interests is unthinkable. After all, we spend our money on these &quot;miracle&quot; creams and lotions, hoping they will somehow erase all of our defects, and make us look like we did when we were younger. People seem to forget that cosmetic companies are businesses and they need to make money. The beef that Paula Begoun has is that these companies make outrageous claims that the consumer ends up believing because they don't know any better. A cosmetic is just that, cosmetic. It can't repair skin, or get rid of wrinkling, a fact that Paula underlines many, many times in her book. I think that her book is worth checking out, because she takes the time to go through all the major cosmetic lines and explains in detail why their products don't work. It's a bit repetitive and not the most stimulating thing to read, but she knows what she's talking about. In regards to including her own line of products and not reviewing them, how is she supposed to review these items impartially? She is fair and meticulous in her reviews, underlining the strengths and weaknessess of each line. This book is a handy reference for people who are tired of wasting time and money searching for cosmetics and skin care that suits them."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book has saved me hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars!

From this book, I've learned that there are good and bad products in every line and now I use just a couple department store products and the rest is inexpensive stuff from the drug store. I'm finally off the very expensive cosmetics roller coaster! I only wish I had found her books sooner--maybe I would have a down payment for a house saved up by now!

Paula does a very good job of highlighting products that have well-known skin irritants as ingredients, such as witch hazel, methol, and speariment, as well as the lesser-kown (urea, for example). She also discusses ingredients that have unproven claims, such as Kinetin, and recommends not paying extra for them.Paula does pan the more expensive lines, as well as the cheaper ones. Wet N' Wild and Sea Breeze contain some of the worst reviews, as well as Origins (how do you think they get that \\"tingly\\" sensation?).Reading these reviews, it seems some people like feeling indulgent about overpaying, as if they're buying a fine wine. Others might just feel embarrassed at being \\"had\\". Either way, I read through more far impudence in these reviews than was warranted.True, Paula does criticize shiney, frosty, and sparkly make-up, but so what? It's not her taste, maybe she should have kept her mouth shut, but grow up, get over it, and read about the ingredients. If you like sparkle, then wear sparkle, stop acting insecure. You're not reading this book for her taste, you're reading it for her analysis of ingredients.Lastly, Paula does have her own line, which she provides brief descriptions of, but DOES NOT RATE with any of her smiles/frowns/faces. In fact, she admits her own line of moisturizers with SPF for oily skin are as fraught with problems as those of any other brand.It's worth a read.

Most of the people who are complaining that the book lacks value, are probably those who are reading nothing but the opinions on specific cosmetics, such as a specific mascara or eye liner. I, also, do not always agree with Paula's assessment of a particular costmetic item. I have used her recommendations, however, to winnow out which ones I want to try. People who work for the companies who's products are reviewed are frequently displeased with her comments. But, if you've read Paula's &quot;The Beauty Bible&quot;, you'd know that Paula begs companies for ingredient lists and factual information. For example, if your advertising states that a &quot;study&quot; showed xxx result, wouldn't an inquiring mind want to know who performed the study and what was the control? Paula subscribes to the cosmetic scientists/industries magazines, and if there's any REAL studies, she knows about them. Ms Begoun does not expect people to consider her infallible.

I had no idea that it was the products causing irritation. I've used her books ever since as a guideline to buying skincare products.Begoun's writing style is blunt and to the point, but I find that to be refreshing. She points out the lies, hype, and other tactics that cosmetic companies use to dupe otherwise intelligent women into buying their products, only to find later that it did not do what it was supposed to do. She also points out that expensive products don't necessarily mean better products, and sometimes they can be worse than drugstore products.

I'm not necessarily one who believes that more expensive and prettier packaging = better quality either (not that I can afford the $500+ creams anyways).I used to sell Avon and Mark (twice), and I really like some of their products, not all but a good portion - and their price is quite nice (especially when you sell it). Through selling their products and reading about beauty products, application, etc I thought I knew quite a bit about makeup and other beauty products.I however, know nothing compared to Paula Begoun.Paula Begoun's bestselling book, Don't Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me has been revised and updated for 2010 in its 8th edition. Who knew certain products are actually much better for the skin than others? Paual Begoun does - and she shares it with all of us in this book!\\"The Cosmetics Cop\\" as she calls herself, sorts through thousands of products, does ingredient research and has so much information it hardly all fits in this 1192 page book! For more information, you can check out her websites: [...]This is one huge resource of information on all types of makeup and beauty products that are currently out. I checked out the ones that I use - and was quite surprised by some that weren't so good. For instance, my \\"on the spot\\" acne treatment from Neutrogena got a neutral (but it really isn't working for me, so I can see why now!). My L'Oreal foundation got a smiley face though, which is nice. At least that was a good product! I laughed out loud when I read about the Avon \\"in a wink\\" eyeshadow sheets - I tried these when I sold Avon, and I thought they were terrible too! Seriously, how does one get this on like it shows it should?Overall, I think that this book is a great resource of information for all women who use beauty products (which is all of us, isn't it?). Going by Paula Begoun's guide (and choosing for yourself of course) which are good buys and which aren't will save money and probably a lot of time with trying to find the better product you wanted all along."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"i have been reading Begoun's books and her website for years. They have saved me lots of money from buying useless and/or expensive products. The only problem was that the book was so big it is impractical to bring to the store. Now it's on Kindle which is perfect."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"A very helpful guide to beauty products, but not an oracle to be followed religiously. Use this book, with its recommendations and warnings, as you intelligently choose products and form your own conclusions on what works well for you.This is an exhaustive compendium of products, ingredient lists and the author's opinions on both. All based on cited scientific literature published in professional journals -- not beauty mags. Begoun is NOT a scientist, which some readers just can't forgive her for. But, to my way of thinking, it's an insult to any intelligent and inquisitive person to say that only those who have an advanced degree can read carefully, reflect critically and form valuable opinions. I'm satisfied that the book's author has been reasonable and responsible in the analyses she presents. Begoun has a point of view (don't we all), she can be dogmatic, and may be guilty of using hyperbole in promoting her own book. So what? Personally, I'm not looking for a beauty guru. If, like me, you're looking for well-supported information that can help you wade through the flood of products out there --this is a very good book to have on the shelf.Pros: Thoughtful reviews. Product ratings, prices given. Supporting professional journal articles cited. Informative \\"Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary.\\"Cons: Not a well organized book.Writing is not particularly compelling.The Bottom Line: Buy it. Use it -- along with your own good judgment. And feel less like a fool hoping for miracles in a jar or glamor in a tube.Begoun also has a website for reviews of new products and updating of pertinent scientific research."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Wow! This book really stands out with its scientific references. How often do you find complete references including even the page numbers of the scientific journal, in a popular book? I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though cosmetics are not really my thing (I'm too lazy or \\"busy\\" to bother). Now I actually find myself using face creams and sunscreens. I used to think all cosmetic products were a waste of money but now I'm convinced that some products actually do help the skin.Some of the critical reviewers here have clearly not read the book very well. I don't know where they get the idea that Begoun is against natural ingredients or plant oils. Quite the contrary, her own products are full of these and nowhere in the book did she say that she is against them. What she is against is using natural ingredients (or any ingredients) that have not been proven effective by scientific studies. In other words, she only wants to use those natural ingredients that actually work.The same goes for essential oils. She is not againts using them if they have proven to be effective. Some essential oils have been and you can find those in her own products. What she does not like is for essential oils to be added to products solely because of the scent. And I agree: why would you want to put ANYTHING on your skin that does not have any purpose? If you want to enjoy the scent of essential oils you can use them in candles or spray them onto your clothes. You don't have to expose your skin to something that nobody really knows very much about."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Update: Since Paula stopped publishing new books, the info in these books is now listed on her website.I used to be hooked on spending lots of $$ trying department store brands with very limited success. In the Best Products section of this book, I found great products that WORK at a great price. My suggestion for using this book: Go to the Best Products, choose about 5 for each area (moisturizer, cleanser, etc) and then read the review on each one. I have given this tip to my friends and family with the same great results."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Generally I have found the book helpful, but it needs to be edited down! She is very repetitive. Also, some of the smiley face ratings conflict with her prose. For instance, she says in the Mary Kay intro section that &quot;lipsticks tend toward the greasy side.&quot; Yet in the ratings list, where the reader could make quick and easy reference, she gives Mary Kay lipsticks the smiley face, compliments the product and doesn't say anything about being greasy. Which is it? Greasy or Good?"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have read her book and, I am thankful that I went to the library versus buying her book. I have found a few errors and, am curious if she is being held liable for misinformation. I was an employee for a company that she reviewed and, I can tell you that she made false claims or incorrectly listed an ingredient in this particular line. Which completely discounts her credibility in my eyes. I encourage the potential buyer to be aware and check her credentials.You may be better off with an ingredient dictionary. 2 that come to my mind are A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetics Ingredients or What's in your Cosmetics."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Very disappointing.

This is one of the longest running facial cleasers on the market. Heck, my grandmother used it! Plus, it's the only skin wash that hasn't made my skin dry. And then she gives smiley faces to Neutrogena, which by the way made my skin break out in a bad rash. She neglects to highlight the important cosmetics.

Each company has both good, and less good cosmetic products. Or should I say, &quot;products that need improvement&quot;. I do agree that the customers ought to be advised and guided when making a buying decision. This book has its minuses and pluses. The only plus that I saw, was the interesting information given regarding the active and other ingridients found in cosmetic products (found at the end of the book). As for making a judgment on ANY product, I do think the author should revise her statements. I do not see how anyone is able to try all the products, on their own face, and then make a quality judgment about a certain product or line of cosmetics. Not only that products are misjudged, but the language is very ignorant, by using such words as &quot;it's an embarrassment&quot;, &quot;it's a waste of time&quot; and so on. For example, the famous Mary Kay cosmetic has the saying, &quot;Try before you buy&quot;. Now, if the products are as described in this book, how come there are millions of customers that use these products for over 30 years? And how come the 900,000 consultants (and NOT 300,000 as mentioned in the book!) are still in the business? I think that what is an embarrassment and a waste of time and money, it's this very book.

All this books does is slam most of the products in here for a variety of reasons including testing on animals or \\"the maker didn't return a phone call\\" or even that \\"they did return a phone call but sounded as if they were trying to recruit me to sell their product.\\" Products were also slammed as being 'too costly' and 'only for those who have too much money' but never does the author describe the vast testing by the makers of the products. She obviously supports PETA.None of the products were tested by the reviewer, she only rated what she thought of ingredients and whether they test on animals or use certain kinds of chemicals that the author claims \\"we are allergic to\\", apparently speaking for all of us.

Each product is tested and reviewed thoroughly.Sadly, Paula says this will be her last edition although she will continue to publish her bimonthly newsletter. Oh, the injustice. It is a shame that she takes so much heat for doing this thankless job when all she is trying to do is help the average consumer. I, for one, have saved much money by reading her reviews and purchasing only what I need based on her comments and recommendations.Thanks to her, I am now an informed consumer and am no longer ignorant of topics such as sun damage, BHA's and Botox.My only (small) complaint is that some cosmetics lines did not make it into this book (ie Mary Kate &amp; Ashley, Becca) I wonder why?"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Any consumer out there with common sense will leave this book behind!

I'm not sure how this makes her more qualified to recommend products than dermatologists hocking their own, but she is doing it nevertheless-- So, on with the review:If I reviewed every product listed on Amazon like she does in this book, the other members would be on a campaign to get me banned for trolling. I can't emphasize enough how useless rating a product on ingredients alone is. Different fillers, quantities, packaging and preparation can and do have different effects on how any product performs, including makeup and skincare. But because her rules are more important than the outcome, she relies almost exclusively on ingredient lists. If she tried something it was likely on the back of her hand, not in the way it was intended. So much for complaining about cosmetic companies' testing when she can't even be bothered to do decent testing of her own.Even if she wasn't peddling her own stuff, it's just too much information for one person or even a small group of people to tackle. One person, one skin type, one ethnicity, performing one test one time (if that) is just not enough to get an accurate picture of what a product will or won't do. Her incessant complaints about shimmer & color make most of the makeup reviews useless since this is so subjective. I applaud her enthusiasm for sunscreen, but her criticism for products that don't contain it seems like overkill and is rather arbitrary in some cases. She completely ignores the importance of a small amount of sun for vitamin D synthesis in skin. If you're going to wear a lead suit every time you go outdoors like she advises, you ought to at least ask your doctor about a vitamin D supplement.She says we should look for a moisturizer that has antioxidants, cell-communicating ingredients and so forth, but does not provide even basic lists. Ingredients that she does name are buried in a sea of text. The review for Urban Decay Primer Potion states that you can get the same effect from a good, silicone-based concealer, but she doesn't name any. She goes on to waste the space complaining about shimmer, sometimes finding it in products that I can't find any shimmer in at all. She would have been better off including a symbol indicating \\"this product contains shimmer,\\" and using the extra space to elaborate on performance. Instead we get a condescending attitude toward anyone who likes shimmer, and that attitude extends to anyone who disagrees with her. She provides a list of \\"irritants,\\" but it seems to be based on her own biased opinions against essential oils, etc. Her biggest irritant is irritation, and apparently everything except petroleum by-products and her own questionable line irritate her. Many of the reviews themselves only consist of a couple of sentences-- hardly enough information to help someone evaluate a product.Any brand that's halfway decent almost always gets the dollar symbol indicating that the product is outrageously expensive. Even if it doesn't have a dollar sign, she sometimes still wastes review space criticizing the price. I happen to agree that a lot of stuff out there is a rip-off, but this is more overkill. Listing the price and amount of product you get would be more than enough for me to decide on my own. Her general view seems almost communist-- everyone should use cheap skincare, everyone should wear the same matte neutral makeup colors, and she acts like she is there to protect us from the big bad corporations. (Maybe she should run for President.) It's a great business strategy-- make everyone think you're a consumer advocate and expert in the field, trash the competition and then introduce your own products.The format is as obsolete as her early 90s views on matte, neutral makeup, blue eye shadow, shimmer, natural ingredients, essential oils and fragrance. A database like this should be in an online, searchable format that is continuously updated and expanded as new products and cosmetic advances are made. I think this is what she is doing with her new site, but I don't recommend THAT either. Bad information is bad no matter how well-presented it is.Bad stuff aside, it's actually an entertaining read in the same way that infomercials and reality shows are fun. There's some scathing, witty commentary, someone claiming to be on your side, and a lot of shameless self-promotion. The disclaimer in the front says it all-- it's a train wreck of dumb ideas, bad advice and unflinching arrogance. I laughed out loud at a lot of it because it was just so absurd. Don't kid yourself about this being a beauty bible or even mediocre reference material. Go to an online cosmetics community to get good product reviews. Buy this book for the laughs and keep it on your comedy shelf, because that's where it belongs."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Firstly, I would like to commend such a strong woman of failed attempts with cosmetics to sound out her voistrous opinion of the industry. As the previous reviews have stated, yes, she is frank, openly honest, and factual. However, the fault lies by her bias views. She points out the obvious faults of advertisement, profit minded, and lack of comparison between high end and drugstore brands.Advertisement is the key to successful business, like herself. Advertisements promote the brand, their philosophy, and certain upcoming products. It's the same routine when purchasing a movie ticket, brand name food, or even this book. To reprimand the industry for advertising is hypocritical. Furthermore, her thoughts are stuck from a scarred childhood in the 70s. Do I need to compare today's guidelines verses 1972?Moving on to the industry using it's celebrity influences to 'lure' women to the makeup counter and furthering convincing them to purchase anything and everything. Yes, cosmetics is a profitable and sales oriented environment. This is true. Most are located inside a department store. Here's my issue. Number one, she states as matter of fact that no woman knows anything for herself and even down plays the stereotypical mindset of women as if totally hopeless. She paints a distinctive picture of swarms of high class ladies being overtaken and overwhelmed by make up. Now I don't believe that women are so gullible to the point of any sales pitch would win them over. Number Two: her main point of the book is \\" I know that make up is hard and confusing. I feel the same way, that's what I'm here for. To help you take on those big make up companies. I don't agree with them either\\" INSERT: so buy my book because I didn't last at a counter. Now, we're still on profit and why this is a bad thing, to Paula. I am no trying to put her down for her opinions that she adds facts to persuade you to deter away from counters, like she does in her own books. CosCosmetics is a business like any other. In business one must make a profit. Can you honestly say in every industry every worker is trying to give the best service to customers? Absolutely not. Skin care isn't based on a load of crap products that everyone should use. To combat her whole reasoning to writing these controversial books: Astringents can be used for oily skin, the right astringent. Young and proud at 24- instead of researching the line she worked for, Paula starts telling customers not to buy certain products that didn't work for her. Hmm, everyone has different skin. Products work differently for different people. To use a moisturizer and not find the effects satisfactory is one persons need for more moisture. You can't say every diet works for everyone- same as product. And the salesperson who sells a woman everything is because she is doing her job and the woman has a shopping problem.Moving forward to comparison. Yes Estee and Loreal own everyone. If you are mortified that one brand has a corporate owner, then wake up to the 21st century. Every brand has a corporate owner, take an economics course. To propose that because of this fact we should shy away from high end and purchase drugstore because it's the same is preposterous. Each brand within the company represent a separate philosophy and type of product. Introducing the idea that there is something for everyone. And to say that drugstore make up would be the same quality as designer make up due to an ingredient list is element lacking. Bigger companies have research centers, higher standards, and most importantly a name to uphold.The empowerment she tries to ruffle up within women is geared at the wrong direction. Don't portray women as mindless and use small lack of knowledge in the industry to promote cosmetics as a big bad monster that with only her help can we succeed! A better approach would be to explain the industry as it is and how no, we aren't out to get you and your money. We are here to educate on products, uses of, technique, and brand philosophy. We are a sophisiated industry helping women with everyday issues. If serious issues are happening- go to a dermatologist.

I'd recommend it ONLY to those with very, and I mean VERY limited knowledge on skin care and makeup. For the others like myself that regularly read health&beauty; magazines, books and articles, well, then alot of this will be old news to you. For example, throughout the book Paula constantly reminds us that most of the damage and aging to our skin is brought on by the sun, so wear sunscreen avidly and avoid tanning like the plague. Well, anyone not living under a rock should already know this. And as for the cosmetic ingredient listings in the back of the book, handy for some I'm sure, but I have seen comparable listings on various web sites and in numerous magazines over the years, so nothing new there.Okay, then there's the product reviews. I have to be honest here, I just didn't agree with ALOT of them. She marked quite a few of the makeup and skin care products that I have used religiously for years and adore, with frown faces! And the explanations for why she didn't like them left alot to be desired. I want MORE detail!And I really started to wonder if any of the products that Paula marked with smileys and gave favorable reviews to were indeed as nice as she claimed, so I tried a few, and truth be told, my opinion was far different from hers on some of the products.I will say this, she is basically right that most of the dept. store makeup and skin care products are the same as the drug store products, the only difference being the price and packaging. BUT, on rare ocassion, some of the more expensive makeups and moisturizers that I have tried did wonders for my skin that a drug store bottle just couldn't. So, sometimes, just SOMEtimes, a higher priced product MAY be better (sorry Paula). I feel that it truly depends on the person's skin, as we all respond differently to different products, none of us having the same skin.Anyway, I don't like to complain, but I feel I really didn't get my money's worth ($22 plus postage)from this book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I'm so glad I read these reviews before I bought this book. As soon as I read that Paula is a proponent of mineral oils I knew her product recommendations would be irrelevent for me personally. I think Paula has some great advice as I've read other books by her, but she seems to have only one way of thinking. As an aesthetician with extremely sensitive skin that is prone to break outs, I've learned that what works for me doesn't work for everybody. The most baffling thing about skincare is that there is no universal treatment. EVERYONE'S SKIN IS DIFFERENT and reacts differently to ingredients. Even Dermatologists don't know everything there is to know about skin so how can someone who isn't a doctor have all of the answers? The simple fact is that you have to take any skin care advice with a grain of salt regardless of who you get your information from."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is well organized but it is very strict in many spots and not in others. I found the reviews of products inconsistent. I can't believe she has tested all of these products enough to sustain her harsh opinions."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"In this book, I found a distinct prejudice towards the more expensive comsetic lines. There is an element in her book that makes me think she takes things a little too personally depending on how a clerk treats her at a cosmetic counter. And a great deal of reverse snobishness is apparent, too. Her reviews are most misleading sometimes. Excellent products are often panned, but mediocre, almost useless preparations are given good reviews. I think her book could turn many people away from trying products that would benefit them. Begoun seems to believe that if it's expensive, it's probably overpriced, but my experience has been, you get what you pay for. If you have a good, sturdy skin, a cheaper cream from the drugstore may be just as good as a more expensive one from an upscale store. Then, her recommendations may be useful. But in my case, I was not blessed with a &quot;good&quot; complexion and spent many years trying to find the best products for my skin. Dermatologists helped clear my skin, but it was far from pretty. I found several lines of cosmetics that are expensive, but did things for my complexion that no other products, expensive, cheap, or prescription, could do. But of these products, the author wrote extremely negative reviews. Her dismissal of many products as not worth the money is misleading. In particular, one expensive product line I use did so much for my complexion, that after one year of use, my not-so-good skin became not only clear, but radiant. Strangers compliment me on my complexion, often telling me how lucky I am to &quot;have good genes.&quot; My dermatolgist (I don't see him for my complexion, but to remove a mole once) told me that whatever I'm using, to continue, it's doing amazing things: and at 48 years old, I am often taken for being in my mid 30's. When I'm with my 26 year old son, I have been mistaken for his &quot;date.&quot; I would love to have everyone that wants good skin to be aware of this line of products, and, dismayed at Begoun's negative remarks, I wrote to her that such negative reviews may mislead someone looking for good skin care. She did respond, but her reply was patronizing and condenscending. I'm glad I only borrowed her book (latest edition) from our well-stocked public library. I wouldn't trust her word on anything, but her catalog of products may prove useful. I can't help but feel she gets something from certain companies for positive reviews. I wouldn't try her cosmetic line. It is bound, in view of her philosophy, to contain the cheapest ingredients. I think her book would benefit from opinions given by others, even if she disagreed with them. Then, alongside her negative review of something, could be a commentary from someone who loved the products. And vice versa. That would give a reader a very good basis from which to make a decision about a product. But I don't think Begoun's so interested in someone finding what works for them as she says she is. I think her motives are much more self-serving. I would not buy this book. Look up what you want in the store or get it from the library. Use your common sense when choosing cosmetics and you won't need her book."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is a must-have for all women and teens who shop for cosmetics and make-up. Written by Paula Beguoun, a beauty and cosmetics expert, this book helps you make a wise descision before going to the nearest Clinique counter at your local Macy's and spending nearly $... Begoun reviews over 40,000 cosmetics including eyeshadow, blush, lipstick, lotion, powder, eyeliner, mascara, exfoliators, bath products, and much, much more. Over 300 cosmetics lines have products reviewed, including Revlon, Max Factor, Bonne Bell, Bobbi Brown, Lancome, Clinique, L'Oreal, Neutrogena, Avon, and a lot more! Also, Begoun reviews baby-care products and men's skin-care products. Each review also has the price of the product so you can determine how much you'll be spending before heading to the cosmetics counter. If you're thinking that everyone's different and that the products will affect each person individually, so you shouldn't follow the reviews in this book, don't worry! Begoun mainly lists the ingredients and how they will most likely affect everyone's skin. For example, she may give a product a low rating because it included irritating skin ingredients. If you are looking for reviews of hair-care products, however, I would suggest reading \\"Don't Go Shopping for Hair-Care Products Without Me\\", also written by Paula Begoun. This book is a wise purchase and invaluable reference for all women and teens who buy cosmetics."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought her first edition a number of years ago, and most of her information regarding product ingredients and what they do is now readily available all over the internet, not only for FREE, but.... it's all manner of actual scientific research, not the opinion of someone who seems to hate everything except for her own products.When I purchased her first edition, I was floored by her insight, her seeming awareness and down to earth \\"my best girlfriend\\" style of explaining. As I became a bit more educated over the past few years, I came to the unfortunate realization that her opinions are worse than biased, and rather pompous, I believe she thinks that her readers are genuinely stupid, or worse, lemmings. And as someone else wrote... HOW DOES SHE GET AWAY WITH CALLING HERSELF \\"COSMETICS COP\\" WHEN SHE'S SELLING HER OWN LINE OF PRODUCTS, WHILE CONDEMNING EVERYONE ELSE'S? To me, this smacks of total fraud. The reason that I'm writing this review is that I have used Paula's products in the past, and they were \\"okay\\" and I mean JUST \\"okay\\", and I've been an Origins user for a number of years also (I've tried many products, but I always end up back with Origins) and while browsing through my local bookstore, I thought I'd look through the NEWEST VERSION of Paula's book. I turned to the Origins section, to see what she had to say, and not only is the section disgracefully thin, but the list of illogically random products is so outdated that I was confounded. Who here does NOT know about Origins White Tea line, especially the anti-oxidant skin guardian? It's only been out for about FOUR years, and is incredibly popular... AND IT'S NOT IN THERE? Neither are most of their moisturizers, cleansers, exfoliators.... I suspect that IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY, SHE DOESN'T PRINT IT! Suspecting that, I flipped to a few other sections that should have well known popular products that I like, and.... THEY'RE MISSING! I sent an e-mail off to paula's choice with this inquiry, and what I got in return was the explanation that Paula is so busy, and some products are NOT WORTH MENTIONING! HAAAAA!Paula Begoun, just hang it up, you've been exposed. And stop having your shills post reviews about how wise you are, accusing others of working for the competition, it's unbecoming."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book has saved me hundreds of dollars. After reading this book, I looked in my bathroom at the drawers of half-used skin care products and realized how much money I wasted over the years following the false promises of the department store salespeople. My skin still looked horrible. Paula focuses her reviews on product ingredients, not the price. I was amazed to discover how many different cosmetics lines are owned by the same companies. I won't buy anything at a drugstore or department store without consulting the book first!I am now using Paula's skin care products (Paula's Choice) almost exclusively. My skin has never looked better. Her products are no-nonsense, no false promises, no fancy packages --just down-to-earth basic skin care.

Her reviews are on the spot, and she doesn't wishy-wash about what works and what doesn't. I had terrible cystic acne before I read previous edition of this book and also THE BEAUTY BIBLE. I spent thousands of dollars (I'm not exaggerating) on products, trips to the derm. doctors. Because I am married and of child-bearing age, I could not take accutane, and didn't want to anyway. No one ever suggested I try Retin A and swear off the sun-tanning, until I read BEAUTY BIBLE. Armed with this new information, I asked my Dr. for Retin A and followed Paula's instructions for my skin-type. Then I used this book to find makeup and other over the counter skincare. I have had great skin now for over 2 years, to the point that people actually stop me and complement me on how clear and translucent it is (and I am NOT some perfect model face, either!).

Not until I read Paula Begoun's book did I understand that most products for acne actually make it worse. I have seen a great improvement in my skin after using the products she recommends. I did not find her tone sarcastic, in fact I think it would be a dry book without a sense of humor. However, the Best Products chapter is not easy to use and it was time consuming to find the best products for acne prone skin.

Well I don't always agree with her assessment, but this book has definitely helped me in saving some money by pointing out cheaper alternatives that work equally well. If the book has managed to done that, then to me it has served its purpose. And I also believed Ms. Begoun had said if a product works for you (regardless of her own opinion), stick with it by all means. Keep those two points in mind before reading this book. Remember: it's a guide/reference, not the law. Regarding her own skin care line--both me and my sister are currently using her products and they work incredibly well. But again, what works for one person may not work for the next. In no way did I feel this book is one big infomercial as a previous reader claimed. Your run-of-the-mill beauty magazine is a bigger plug of products than this will ever be."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The author claims to have tried the products personally but I ask you, how can one person test products designed for various skin types when each individual's skin type is as unique as a product should be? In reviewing products, she blasts her sarcasm in claiming that plant ingredients are not beneficial or at least she doesn't understand how they can be and then, to the contrary, makes a claim that plant waters in another brand are beneficial. If she doesn't have the right knowledge to analyze ingredients, how can she make recommendations? Some herbal and plant information is available in the PDR for Herbal Medicines and other information through other scientific resources. Plants and herbs are beneficial to the skin if they are skin compatable, just like skin compatable oils. Although this book and its format appear to be a good reference, the book is very misleading and inaccurate. A reader needs to remember and realize that this is one person's opinion and apparently is not based on scientific or factual information. It's a shame that publishers and distributors are not more discerning in what they make available to the public."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is incredibly detailed and useful if you want to separate fact from hype. I like the organization in that you can search both by brands as well as by her \\"picks\\" in various categories. It's much more helpful than articles about new products that make me wonder whether or not the product is any good.I interviewed Paula on my Internet radio show EverydayWealth Radio recently about the book (her interview is archived online if you want to listen). It's clear she has a passion for what she is doing, and feels strongly about helping women become informed consumers.Like another reviewer mentioned, I appreciate the fact the book takes an unbiased approach. She never pushes her products. I would prefer using this book to the \\"buy it and try it\\" approach another reviewer suggested. I've done that, and it's too expensive! At least this gives a starting place for products that may work.This book is a tremendous resource, but I can understand why she won't be compiling a new edition. But if you don't have this edition, I would recommend getting it and holding on to it. No doubt some products will change, but there are many that you will still be able to research with this.

Following her beauty advice, I have saved money (LOTS OF MONEY), my skin, and my youthful appearance.Read each of the product reviews carefully before you buy, and you will not be disappointed. I am only disappointed when I can't find an item I am looking for at the store. I find her advice and reveiws to be on the money 99.9% of the time (I have very dry skin, so sometimes I need more moisture in my products than Paula recommends.) However, I NEVER go shopping without carrying this book with me. Be warned, sales women at the cosmetics counters will treat you badly if they see it, so either be discreet, if you need their help, or pay no attention to them and just ask for what you want.The only thing that would make this book better, is if it were available on as a searchable CD-ROM. That way you could print lists to take with you, instead of the whole book. Are you listening Paula?"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Ladies, ladies, ladies! Such excietment over something so relatively insignificant!I have read all of Paula's books, and am delighted that there is someone out there who is obviously knowledgeable about the cosmetics industry and interested in cutting through the hype. While I don't agree with all she says, I use the book as a reference.In defense of the book, and to respond to some of the comments and provide balance (no, I don't work for her or have anything to do with the cosmteics industry...):She clearly states that she obtains ingredient lists from the manufacturers. Since she has educated herself in cosmetic chemistry, she can tell what will irritate or clog pores from these lists without having to try everything herself. Chemicals are chemicals, no matter which manufacturer uses them or what they say about them.Also, I'm not sure why people complain about her hyping her own line - I have read the latest edition of the book cover to cover, and found mention of it on FIVE of the approximately 380 pages - hardly an egregious amount of self-promotion! Additionally, I have used her skin-care line for about two years and am very satisfied with it; it's fragrance-free, gentle and non-drying, and very reasonably priced. I don't use everything, but the products I do use I like a lot.As I understand it, the smiley faces are for the harmfulness of the product, or the degree to which it does what it says it will do, not her personal opinion or how well she likes it. They are pretty objective; that's why she can say a lipstick is greasy but still give it a smiley - maybe some people like greasy lipsticks. As long as the greasiness isn't harmful, it gets a smiley.All the salespeople who complained about her negative reviews of the products they sell say that she isn't objective. Are they? Who is more biased than a salesperson whose income depends on convincing you of the hype?I agree that she tends to be very conservative in her opinions on make-up, but you are free to ignore them. She includes reviews of products and colors she doesn't like, so you can use them or not. I value the book for it's information on ingredients, not her opinions on how I should paint my face.Lack of timeliness is a problem in any printed book - new products appear and disappear daily, so obviously no book can be completely current. But is that a reason to discount the entire book? There's a lot of information in it that is still current a year after publication, and her newsletters provide updates.I have a friend who sells BeautiControl, so I read the entire review - it seemed to me that she actually LIKED the line, with some reservations. So why are all the BC folks up in arms?There are good products and useless products in every line - this book is a tool to help sift through them and figure out which is which. And the lists of best products in the back is invaluable.So even if you don't agree with everything she says, there is a lot of good information in the book, not just on the products but also on basic skin care and new developments in research and industry. This book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I have struggled my whole life with oily, breakout prone skin and I have tried every product on the market to make it better.

As for her spending over 1/3 of the book plugging her own cosmetics line (previous reviewer's comment)--she does spend SEVERAL, not many, pages on her own line. As someone who has tried the very reasonable products ($8.50 or so for an 8 oz. cleanser--can't beat that!), and as someone who has very sensitive, dry, yet problem skin, I can attest that I, for one, am THANKFUL!! that she has her own line that is cheap and effective.

Therefore, if you want to know which is the very best mascara to purchase, you have to look through pages and pages to get the info.

She says that if you drop it it will easily break and that the product tends to flake.I have dropped the tester in the store. This means that it was open and i dropped the whole thing from the shelf, which was about 5 feet. The make-up did NOT crack. It even popped out of the container and the container's container (so there was cube of pure make-up) on the floor and did NOT crack.Furthermore, I have dry skin on my eyelids that flake. I use the shimmer cubes to STOP them from flaking. So I don't know where she gets the \\"each shade is grainy and the shine tends to flake.\\" Or if she meant \\"fade\\" instead of \\"flake\\" then she should take course in English.Overall, I think it's important to not take everything she says seriously."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I am very glad that I read this book.

First of all, she plugs her products too much. and she's really negative about a lot of products. Now, I'm sure she has back up, but some of the products she rated very low, I've had great results with. And there are a ton of products not reviewed....like OroGold, Gratiae, and some others. It's a huge book, but it's form 2009. Obviously there are a ton of new products out there, since the business of wrinkles is a billion dollar industry. It needs updating. Her website is way too geared for her line...which I've never heard of before seeing this book. It's called Paula's Choice. Not a name I'd look into...of course all the reviews about her line are positive. It's just too slanted. I'd have more respect for her if she didn't have her own line, and wasn't trying to sell it when ever she could. it took her credibility away for me.

Paula Begoun tells what is best for different skin types and what is just sales hype. She also explains what kind of washing, exfoliating, moisturizing routine is best for which skin types and problems such as acne, rosacea, sun damage, age spots, etc. There is a \\"Best Products\\" list in the back. She is too critical with some of her negative reviews, such as saying that a sulfur based facewash is too drying (my teenage daughter's dermatologist recommended a sulfur wash for her) or a concealer is too greasy (a friend with very dry skin prefers that particular concealer), but you get the overall idea of the product. Her web site is not as easy to use as the book, which is very inexpensive if you order a used one.

After reading this book and The Skin Type Solution by Leslie Baumann, I've come to see how misleading and confusing shopping for beauty products really is. It's amazing how many promises manufacturers make and how many gimics they use for so many sub-par products. It's no wonder it's a multi-billion dollar industry. It's like they purposely keep consumers confused, so we're always on a quest for the next-best product. Paula does a great job outlining each product. I like the summary chapter of all Paula's Picks at the end of the book. It brings the whole book to a good conclusion. After the few weeks I had this from the library, I realized what a valuable resource the book is and bought a copy on my Kindle. It is worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Never read a better book of this type, unless it's Paula's \\"Don't Go Shopping For Hair Care Products Without Me\\".

She is a one woman Consumer Reports of everything and anything skincare, haircare, make-up, body products, etc. for every gender and race (The whole book is amazing, in the back, there are specific sections for issues and products specifically for men, babies, older women, specific skin conditions (i.e. rosacea, acne, etc.),teens, blacks and asians). Plus a list of the best products for (insert every category you can imagine here: For instance, Dry skin with a little combination plus sensitive areas... Or sunscreen without moisturizer for oily skin). It's a literal dictionary of almost every cosmetic/skincare company under the sun, every line and every product in those lines (updates since this edition came out are available - depending on the product in either the free e-mail or the subscription based website - also a must buy). If you wash your face ;) , wear make-up, and/or read beauty magazines - this is perfect for you or a perfect gift! I've been using her books (every edition), for the past 15 years (I'm 34) and have saved so much money (for expensive products she gives comparisons of drugstore \\"doubles\\", and products that aren't great, she lists products that are better than do the same thing (For example a certain L'oreal mascara is as good as the excellently reviewed Dior Diorshow and Lancome Definicils, or the brands that consistently put out top-rated products, and the ones who consistently put out poor products - for example, Neutrogena for the former and Garnier for the latter).She has also helped me pick out the perfect skin care for my very fair, sensitive skin (and stopped my dry spots), and helped my mum pick out the perfect cosmetics and skincare to deal with her rosacea (she also lists dermatological and surgical options for conditions, citing the latest medical and scientific journals - no Allure or Cosmo style \\"oooh it smells so minty it must be good!\\" here.)Before the kindle, I had to print out pages from her subscription-based website (beautypedia.com and cosmeticscop.com), or lug her very heavy printed edition around (I used to keep a copy in the car just in case I went shopping). Now If I'm in the department store or drugstore, I can look up a product straight from my kindle!My paperback editions (I bought every update of this and Don't buy haircare products without me) have been donated to my dentist (he specialises in cosmetic dentistry).

I don't understand how she does her ratings.

If you want advice on what products work and what products are actually detrimental to your skin, this is the book for you. She gives honest reviews and ratings on a tremendously wide range of products. So forget what the magazines tell you - magazines promote certain products to make their advertisers happy. The customer is the victim here so be a smart consumer and you too will thank Paula. Many reviewers complain that Paula badmouths the more expensive cosmetic lines.. which is not true. She has given many great reviews on a lot of their products. The truth is, if you're going to spend that much money on cosmetics, you're probably not going to settle for drug store substitutes. You are simply going to be a more educated consumer and learn to choose the best products from each cosmetics line."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I was seriously disappointed in this book. This woman dictates her opinion as if it were law. For instance, she gives a bad review to a mascara because it doesn't &quot;build&quot; and &quot;define&quot;. I have long thick lashes. I love the gel mascaras that give incredible shine without making one look like Tammy Fay Baker. She gave a bad review to a skin care line that completely cured my acne problem, stating that it contained incredients that COULD irritate the skin. Ok, so, what about all the items that she gave good ratings to that contain KNOWN carcinogenics?"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"For anyone who's ever wondered just what's IN that multi-cellular-renewing-botanical-regenerating-essence-of-epidermia-francais-foo-foo-oui-oui-$75.00-an-ounce-creme! This book, along with Ms.Begoun's other works, cuts through the hype and tells you exactly what you're getting for your money. I've found her to be scrupulously honest and impartial, and I tend to be one suspicious puppy, so that's a real compliment. She's done wonders for my skin AND my wallet! Paula's absolutely fabulous, dahlings!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Begoun's book is a good subjective reference for just about any cosmetic line you can fathom. It is very complete, reviewing many lines of cosmetics and products. I found every product in my cosmetic pouch within a few minutes. Well organized and easy to use.I found it fell short on any real extensive advise or solid reccomendations on anything. For example, If I wanted to know what product had the highest quality for the price.. I would not see that in black and white. Instead I would wade through a list of the best products in alpha order.( Some inexpensive, some very expensive.) I would have prefered a ranking so I could pick the &quot;best buy&quot;.It is important to keep in mind is that this book is a subjective review. Some of the products I love, she panned and some of her favorites I find very difficult to use. Overall, I do agree with her on many products. ( I have tried them all) For example, I can honestly say I have tried every foundation possible and have found that one inexpensive product to be the very best. She also mentions this inexpensive and unlikely product in glowing terms. In that instance, I was very pleased with my good taste and her wisdom.I think it is a good basic reference for any woman however, Don't think of it as the &quot;bible&quot; of cosmetics. I still think, we may need to &quot;trial and error&quot; as we usually do.. this book may just keep the trials down to a minumum."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This book is great! It is very comprehensive and informative. In my case it paid for itself on my first two purchases after buying the book. I have passed it on and will be purchasing the other books by Paula."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"The other reviewer who has rated this 1 star has pretty much stated all there is to know about this book and I agree with her review in entirety.In summary.I am so pissed at the reviews in this book. Every product that somehow manages to get a positive review from Paula ( a smiley face)...she most times end off her positive review by saying something totally negative about the products. eg. she will give thumbs up for good amounts of antioxidants in a product but in the end she may say the molecules won't make it into your skin so it might as well not even be in there....then I turned to her product and of course they are all smiley faces with not a word of negativity. almost like she is just trying to make me deny the positives about every beauty company except hers. Now look to amazon and read the reviews on her 'perfect' products and see the 3 star ratings she is getting from people who actually use her products. I will never buy her products just because I have seen the way she is bashing other products and moreso because she was bashing doctors. On one of her reviews she was even bashing Dr. Murad, himself( Murad product line) and I thought that was really low and unprofessional... She has created the impression that she is such a piggish person. Uuuugh. Be a little professional Paula. I like her name and I pronounce it Paula Be-gone...and I wish she can do just that."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"After purchasing the book I found that Paula, the author, has her own line of moisturizing products so I ordered some free samples. They feel just dreamy on my face!! In fact, since I began using only products that pass muster in her book, my face and especially my lips have never been the same -- yes, I've notice a marked difference.Paula's book is very well organized and so so simple to use as a reference tool with a section at the back that lists all the products that received an \\"A++\\" so to speak, broken down into categories (i.e., face moisturizer, for dry skin, under $20, etc.) There are hundreds of products to choose from in just this section, making that alone well worth the price of the book. She also teaches us how to rate products on our own based on their ingredients.Additionally, Paula pulls no punches whatsoever in her reviews of different product lines, and she proves over and over that price often has nothing to do with quality."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Of course I don&#8217;t agree with everything she says and some of the products she rated as average or gave a thumbs down to I felt worked best for me. Because of this book I&#8217;ve become more of a label reader and educated myself about certain ingredients on what does and doesn&#8217;t work for my skin. I&#8217;ve found out why certain foundations that are labeled oil free still cause skin problems and what ingredients cause this. Using myself as a example, I&#8217;ve found a concealer contains the same ingredients in a brand that has never given me any problems and I find the concealer works just as well as a foundation on any uneven areas of my skin .As for Paulas line well since not too many people seem to have reviewed it let me let me throw my 2 cents in :I like the skin care line. I&#8217;ve finally found a sunscreen that doesn&#8217;t look or feel greasy on my oily skin and can be used for the body as well. It is the only day moisturizer I will ever need. The 2 % acne solution is great dries up problem areas without over drying as does the cleanser for oil/combo skin .I still use Dermatologica sometimes but this works as well without the high price tag and with out over drying my skin during the winter months. I would keep using this line of skin care , it has simplified my routine and will save me cash in the long run.On the Paula&#8217;s Choice makeup I&#8217;ve have only purchased orders sample of the face powder (which I admit wasn&#8217;t that impressed I could see the talc on my skin) and the lipsticks . On the lipsticks well I admit I&#8217;m ambivalent; it has its pros and cons . It comes in cream formula and matte. Personally I would skip the matte formula, they re too drying and dry looking. The creams are just right though. Good for someone who wants a lipstick to go on smooth but not too greasy feeling or looking. Doesn&#8217;t bleed..The colors are wonderful range of neutral brown, red/brown and plum/berry colors that would compliment most skin tones. The only major problem I Have with this is when I ordered the sample lipsticks I noticed that the when the color started to wear off some of the color deposited in the deeper wrinkles in my lower lip and looked a bit weird. I don&#8217;t know maybe I just got some old samples. So if you have very noticeable lip deep wrinkles or dry lips you may want to skip this product. ) My advice you want to try this lipstick is to first check out the samples (for color) . I think its ($) for five sample colors that come in either warm or cool color group and matte or cr&egrave;me formula then decide if this product is for you.PS. I finally broke down and ordered a full sized lipstick. The full sized lipstick seem more &#8220;fresh&#8221; went on smoothly and didn&#8217;t leave color deposits in my lips. Although Paula&#8217;s says most of her are fragrance free I did notice a slight perfume odor on my lips, This may or may not bother some people .The lipstick case is an exact copy of what Bobbie Brown line has is although I wouldn&#8217;t go so far to say they&#8217;re as creamy as Bobbie Brown, but it did go on smoothly and covered well. Full sized lipsticks are ($).Like a previous review stated, the book supposed to get women to think about their choices when choosing cosmetics . I still buy department store makeup but now I splurge on the one that truly look and wear well on me and not just purchase because it&#8217;s the &#8220;hot&#8221; or in right now brand.It might even get you stick with a few products that work only for you and maybe clean up that clutter that&#8217;s been growing in your make drawer/kit . Or you can keep on believing the women&#8217;s magazines that seem push mostly expensive make up brands and skin care products as the ones to buy and stay on the merry go round of being a &#8220;cosmetics junkie&#8221;. Hope you have a trust fund or have a high five,six figure salary job to pay for your habit.That&#8217;s it, but of course the above is just my opinion"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"This is quite a remarkable book. It really takes all the things that cosmetics companies say in their advertisments and just blows it out of the water.

Her product reviews are not that great and can be confusing (I noticed some products that were either out of date or not actually in a line at all).

There are so many of those skin care lines from Paris that a lot of the beauty spas use and maybe for one day my face will look good, but to buy the whole line of products for a daily skin routine would cost me $200 or more!Paula has her own line of cosmetics and skin care.

Her warnings about frosted eyeshadow and makeup can also help less experienced makeup users avoid the cheap bimbo look.This book isn't for people who want information handed to them on a silver platter without their having to think much. You have to take the time to read the reviews. I'm sure there are people who don't like this, but, quite frankly, if you don't have time to read a book, you don't have time to apply makeup.I only have one minor complaint; although Begoun gives product ingredients for most of the cosmetics listed, she doesn't give specific lists of plant oils and other 'natural' substances -- all of which are very common allergens. Ingredient lists aren't available for every cosmetic before buying (and usually aren't available at all here in Canada), and it would be nice to know, for instance, which c! ! osmetics include lavender oil, hazelnut oil, aloe vera, and other common allergens."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I found this book to be a very good overview of the thousands of beauty lines/products that are out there, and I recommend it if you're having problems finding the right cosmetics,and you don't want to spend a fortune. This book serves as a very good resource. I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because I also had a few problems with this book. The author strongly suggests using neutral, matte cosmetics and her reviews reflect that opinion. So if a line has particulary &quot;shiny&quot; cosmetics, it's dismissed. Also, the author has her own skin-care line featured in the book, which I think is a conflict of interest, even though she doesn't rate the line. Personally, I found some of the products she dismissed as really great finds, and some of the products she recommends as just awful.

I have found most helpful. When she would answer people on her website she would say that &#34;natural&#34; products are no better than synthetic. Now, she is selling a natural line of skin care on her website! I have always thought there were slots of unregulated chemicals in products... Now I check goodguide.com and skindeep.com and am shocked at all the toxins in most cosmetics and skin care! It may not matter to her, but it matters to me.. Health, Society and ecology are more important than the best products.... Especially cosmetics.

I love Paula Begoun, I think her advice can save women lots of money by telling them what products are worth it and what ones you can avoid, or purchase more cheaply.

I will refer to this book again and again."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I pre-ordered the 7th edition of this book and just hadn't reviewed it. For those unfamiliar with Ms. Begoun, reviews from several editions are posted on all the product pages. In other words, you may not know which edition is reviewed.I came across the 6th edition at the library. I checked it out so many times I knew I'd buy the 7th edition if she ever published one. Although the information in the 7th edition is updated, it is not as good as the 6th edition. The 6th edition discussed products for men and children; this does not. It's also evident this was written hurriedly.Still, this book is a far more reliable resource for good skin care and makeup products than any magazine I've read. They're all flavor-of-the-month. Sure, you can find out about some new products, but have you ever seen a magazine PAN a product it's featuring?I've been following Ms. Begoun's advice for about 5 years now. Full disclosure: I do use a few of her products. I do a better job applying and removing makeup, I choose better colors, and I get better results from my skin care products, and EVERYONE who knows me can see the difference. That is reason enough to invest in the book.I did not want to subscribe to the companion, paid website, but I did, and I'm glad I did. Ms. Begoun does change her mind about products and ingredients on further review, and of course, new products are constantly being introduced on the market.The benefits of being able to find good products and not waste money on cosmetics and skin care far outweigh the price of the book. You've paid more for a face cream, haven't you? Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"There's already about 200+ reviews on *what* is inside this book, so I'm going to give my opinion and my opinion only. First, I like the fact that Ms. Begoun is against animal testing. The thing I didn't like is that she didn't even really seem to like the products that she gave a 'smiley' and a 'checkmark' for. There's those two icons for each product that Ms. Begoun liked a lot, but after the product listed she would usually have some mediocre review about and/or saying &quot;it's as good as anything out there&quot;. So, I was left wondering what exactly was the best. In the back of the book there's about three pages of &quot;what's best&quot;.. I did like that a lot."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"THis is a tough call. I find i keep buying the book and find it helpful and informative. On the otherhand... i think you need to know that while you are getting alot of info that cosmetic companies dont make easy to find...you are also very much getting her opinions. I have found it difficult sometimes to sort out the info.For example, there are many products she dismisses as over-priced and *standard*. Yet...a few of them i have tried and i *do* see differences in how my skin feels using them. There must be something past *standard* if i can notice differences. Perhaps she is a bit biased as most products are *generally* similar but i think she does need perhaps to do some research on how individual users (not just her) evaluate the products.That said... I find the info very helpful when considering a new line. Many are over-priced and if they dont provide samples free, it becomes difficult to assess them without spending HUGE amounts of money first. Some products i have bought after reading abouyt them, and some not. This book is very reasonable priced for all the info it has in it. That said, i dont think there is that much difference between editions.i have the same issues as other people with regards to her *selling* her products *in the book*. I have tried them, actually. Some i like alot...some not at all. All are reasonable priced though. Frankly i like some products that she panned better than hers. Some of hers i like *the best*... but the whole idea of her reviewing other peoples products while selling hers...i dont know...seems a bit conflicted to me. i felt better about this book beofre she started doing that... and she has a website (cosmeticscop.com) that sends out news letters with info on newly reviewed products. Subscribing to the newsletter is very good and keeps your info up to date."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"She seriously does not go to the cosmetics counter without it!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I came across Paula Begoun's book coincidentally. It is a great composit of just about every popular cosmetics and skin care products on the market. She rates the products based on the ingrediants and compositions, and still tells you if you are getting your money's worth. For instance, if Estee Lauder asks for $... on a small bottle of SPF 15 moisturizer, then Paula lets you know that while the product may be excellent, the price is too steep.Sunscreen! That's one hot topic in every Paula's books. I am personally very thankful for her detailed explanation on the subject. The importance of regular sunscreen use is very important in any skin routine and it is the best way to prevent wrinkles and other skin diseases.Paula has her own line of skin-care products as well as cosmetics. I use her skin-care system for a few years now. Let me just say that I want to personally thank her for making these products so effective. My acne is gone, skin looks radiant, and amazingly my skin doesn't go through the same summer tortures anymore, which is really great.Back to the topic, I recommend you getting this book as an eye opener to the skin related products on the market. Not only will you learn a lot, you'll save a lot of money in the long run by not wasting money on advertising gimmicks of the next cosmetics company. In short, check it out. If you care about your skin, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I wanted to read the book because I'm curious about the product reviews. Before the reviews is 100 pages of other information, some of which it was pretty tempting to skim or skip over in my rush to get to the good stuff. But I read it all--luckily it wasn't difficult because Begoun writes in a fairly entertaining style. It was interesting to read how she got into the cosmetics business (she used to be a freelance makeup artist) and how she went about writing the book (she goes undercover to makeup counters).Now I think there are a few ways to go about reading the product reviews. You can read the whole thing straight through, finding out about every single product in the book, but after awhile it gets a little tiring. You can go through and look up the products you're currently using to see what she says about them (she rates with a happy face, straight face, or sad face). Or you can go straight to chapter four, where she lists the best products in each category, then go look up those products to decide what you think is best for you.I liked the fact that Begoun includes retail prices next to the product name. If it's way out of my price range, then I don't bother reading about it (why torture myself?). And she also puts dollar signs next to products that she would recommend if it weren't for their outrageous prices. I like it that when reviewing certain products, she'll say, &quot;Product X is good, but product Y, at a quarter of the price, works just as well or better.&quot; Very important to those of us watching our pennies.There are a few things to keep in mind when reading the book. Probably most important is that this is just one woman's opinion. It's true that she has experience in the cosmetics world, as an artist and a consumer and a businesswoman, but because she doesn't like something doesn't mean you won't. Some points, like products containing irritants, are valid for everyone-who wants to irritate their skin? Other statements, about coverage or shininess/matteness, are more personal preference.For instance, she gives Revlon's ColorStay Lip Tint SPF 15 a sad face because it doesn't contain any of the three ingredients (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or avobenzone) that actually block out 80-90% UVA radiation. I love ColorStay Lip Tint in Mauvestone and wear it often, not because I think it's a sunscreen but because I like the color and how it feels on my lips. She also gives lower ratings to blushes and eyeshadows that are shiny rather than matte; while I don't wear shiny products all the time, I do wear them occasionally, so I took her statements with a grain of salt.A few times she also seems to be contradicting herself. In the introduction to her Avon reviews, she writes that they have &quot;some incredible bargains, particularly in the lip and eye pencils, mascara . . .&quot; But then she gives Avon's mascaras a straight face and a sad face ratings. Does she consider a straight face an incredible bargain? In the key to ratings she says a straight face means that the product is OK but not impressive. I don't know about you, but I want all my products to be impressive.Keep in mind that she tested these products on her skin; although she makes recommendations for how they would work on other skin types, unless you have the exact same skin type as Begoun you're not going to get the same results. Also remember that Begoun also has her own line of skin care products, many of which are featured in the best products section.Overall I found this to be a great book for anyone who is interested in expanding their knowledge of cosmetics or who is unhappy with the products they're using now and needs a little guidance in how to find something new."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun is the only REAL beauty expert around.

Paula has simplified my life and my morning routine. Finally, a beauty writer who actually evaluates cosmetics systematically and scientifically. Intelligent readers will appreciate the validity and reliability of her research. Paul is simply the most informed and unbiased of any beauty author. This book empowers individuals.P.S.

When I read the labels and asked her about the ingredients, she didn't have a clue so I wrote them down and googled them when I got home.Paula Begoun's name kept popping up and I started to take notice. Every product or ingredient that I wanted to know more about, she had a review and understanding. I felt empowered because now I had knowledge to make the right choices that were good for my skin but most importantly I didn't have to continue throwing money away on spa/salon-only products when drugstore brands - at half or more than half the cost - are just as good or better.\\"Don't go to the costmetics counter without me\\" is like a bible of information on all the skin care lines out there. Every product is ranked and explained why it's good or not good for your skin. Of course some of the information is outdated because new products have come out since the publication date but you can go online to Paula's site or google her name + the product name and more than likely she has a rating for it now.I bought her Beauty Bible book first before the Costmetics book and both have really excited me and made life so much easier when choosing my daily and nightly skin routines.

I simply want someone else to test it for me and tell me what is the best in a concise table like format. There is no way I would lug that great big book to every cosmetic counter I visited.That said, I do think this is about the best resource available for cosmetics, just plan on using it as reference with little guidance on what is best. There are extensive lists in the Appendix on her favorites under each product, but there is no indication or order according to price or which might be better.In Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's book they only include those items which have won awards. The only reason I can see to include every item tested is then you know for sure if she has tested it, and to fight Mary Kay sales reps, then you know why she doesn't care for their direct sales products.

Who wants to cart 3 young children into a department store to try on cosmetics and have the sales people tell you about &quot;toxins, vitamins, etc&quot;? I don't have the time or the patience. I much prefer to buy my products at the drug store and have been able to do so by reading up on certain products before buying them. It has saved me so much money! In Paula's defense, I believe she started her research and review of products long before she started selling her own line. I have tried her skin care line for dry skin that is prone to breakouts and it has worked wonderfully! I am glad that Paula has her own line.

She lists the lines alphabetically as well as includes a brief history of her own personal involvement in the cosmetic industry (sales and artistry) which I found interesting.I am not a makeup artist or in the industry at all, just an average user and I refer to this book all the time when I want information (basic and in depth) on a line I want to try or a brand I am currently using.

Paula is at it again and as far as I'm concerned it's better than ever. As a working makeup artist, I have relied on Paula's candid reviews for years to help me select the most effective, affordable products, and I am seldom disappointed. From Avon to Zia and (almost) everything in between, Paula's reviews are a welcome change from the constant stream of cosmetic rhetoric that the industry loves to propagate (I know, I used to be one of them!) I also appreciate the updated information about skin care. If you've ever wanted to know the lowdown on whether retinol or vitamin C products can work, or why there is no such thing as a &quot;wrinkle cream&quot;, this book can help. I especially loved the new ingredient dictionary and the new chapter about men's skin care. Yes, she has her own line of products but she states repeatedly that they are one option among many. After all , how many other cosmetic lines sell their own products but then turn around and say, &quot;Although our products are great, here is a list of 100 other moisturizers (or cleansers or toners, sunscreens, etc.) that you could also use!&quot; I don't know about you, but I haven't found such a company!! And lastly, I noticed some existing reviews about the book make mention that Paula test the products on herself and makes recommendations from there, which is not true. Paula explains in detail (it's Chapter 3 of the new book) how she evaluates products and that how a product may work for her does not translate into how it may work for millions of other women. C'mon, people! Read &quot;between the lines&quot;! Paula is not out to &quot;get&quot; anyone, she just wants to present the facts and offers an incredible resource for consumer reporting on the cosmetics industry.

Anyone who cares about the future health of their skin should try it. It is just that simple. Paula has tried her best to show us the truth that you will never read in a fashion magazine or hear from a salesperson, and she does a great job of it! This book covers everything, from acne to wrinkles, oily, normal, and dry skin, and ingredients that aren't safe or effective. I can't understand why people give such awful review of her; if you remember she is only human, and entitled to a couple of mistakes. She has an incredible amount of money alloted to her to spend on her research--for example she bought FOUR TUBES of one particular mascara to ensure that the performance was consistent; and with the sheer volume of that kind of research and paperwork there will be oversights. Anyone who can't accept that needs to lighten up and see what she is trying to do: HELP US!! In truth, her suggestions have helped me more than my dermatologist's. As for her comments regarding things such as shiny eyeshadow, she is also entitled to her opinion and has much downplayed her disapproval of such fashion statements in this volume, and does not let it affect her reviews as much, except when the color choices are limited to only shiny products. Please, give the woman a break and use this a reference like it is meant to be, and forgive her for being human. This book is worth every single penny paid--I promise."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I purchased this book &amp; flipped right to the section on my favorite cosmetics line: Chanel. I was surprised to find that she did not recommend many items in the product line. The skin care line that I have purchased many items from (Serious Skin Care) also had many products containing irritants and fraudulent claims.When Paula stated in her book that many people working at the cosmetics counters in department stores didn't really know much about makeup application &amp; skin care, and were taught to simply repeat what they'd been trained to say over &amp; over, I thought she was just being vindictive. Lo &amp; behold, when I went to buy a few of the products in the Chanel line that Paula did recommend, the woman tried to sell me items with &quot;light-reflecting properties&quot; to &quot;reduce the appearance of fine lines, imperfections and wrinkles&quot;, just like Paula said! I'm only 30, for heaven's sake, and don't even have any wrinkles (yeah, I know they're coming)! Instead of trying to sell me something with a high enough SPF to protect my skin, this woman sounded like she was reading from a script! It took an amazing amount of control not to laugh right in her face.I really like the fact that Paula gives you a list at the end of the book with all the items she does like for each particular category of skin type. This list includes high-end items (if you like pretty cases and big names like I do) as well as drugstore brands that get the job done if you'd rather not spend the extra cash."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"It would be difficult to improve on the review of Jennifer Metcalf on this site, but just to add my two cents, this was the best impulse purchase I have ever made.Particularly useful to me were Paula's dissection of the \\"natural\\" trend in cosmetics, her skincare routine advice, her non-amimal testing list and her analysis of the UVA protection in sunscreens. I've always had suspicions about the touted benefits of \\"all-natural\\" products but clever marketing usually won me over. Now I have a solid reference for what has actually been shown to work and what is potentially irritating to the skin. As common sense ought to dictate: natural does not necessarily mean \\"good\\" and synthetic is not synonymous with \\"bad\\".Paula's strength is her reliance on solid scientific research to formulate her opinions, which is an objective and sensible basis. Sure we could try every skincare product out there to reach our own conclusions, but who has the time, money and, crucially, the freedom from the power of suggestion? I for one am not immune to clever marketing and need all the help I can get to cut through the pretty packaging and convincing pseudo-science.It gets a bit more subjective when she gets onto the subject of makeup (rather than skincare), but she repeatedly stresses that these are her own opinions. Her biases are quite easy to figure out - she loathes 'shiney' makeup and green and blue eyeshadows. If you, as I do, like some of these things, it's simple enough to dismiss those negative points and concentrate on her very reliable comments on texture and application.I gave the book four stars rather than five for some practical quibbles. It is nigh on impossible to do as the title exhorts because the book is a tome of over 1000 pages. If you do bring it along shopping, you will look like an obnoxious b***h. Paula advises discretion, but seriously, how do you be discreet with this mega-volume? Also, Paula has stated that the sixth edition is her last, which means that it's inevitably out of date. Many recommended products have been pulled and some have perhaps have had their formulations changed. Nevertheless, the principles underlining the reviews in here are well worth the read."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Three days ago, my husband said to me in the car, \\"do you know you spent $1000 at Sephora in April? It's right on the Visa card.\\"Yes, that was in April. But in June, I got my first ever copy of Paula's book and it changed everything.I had been using Chanel Sublimage eye cream at $175. Now I don't use eye cream at all. I had been using Christian Diors Capture R60/80 XP Ultimate Series, serum, lotion and cream, spending in total about $700. Turns out I have oily skin and that line was doing me nothing but harm.And make-up? I thought I had to use all the same beauty line at a time. That's right, if I wanted to use Diorshow mascara, I thought I had to use only that Dior line with that mascara that day. I basically owned 3 make-up lines- Dior, Aveda and Channel. Three looks, natural, night, work. Boring.Paula's book taught me that every product is different. Dior makes a killer mascara but their $100 Capture R60/80 XP Ultimate Wrinkle Restoring Serum is a complete waste of money. AND HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. Guess who makes some of the best face products according to this book? Freakin' Neutragena (and many other drug store brands trump the pricey department store lines!).I was also pleasantly suprised to see that Paula went and started her own line, which I've tried and love. Her website gives away samples of the entire skincare line for free. I was worried at first but it's been months now that I've been using Paula's pick from Neutragena and my face hasn't ever looked better. I'm still using some high-end products, the ones she reviews in her book as 'Paula's Picks', and my skin looks amazing. Sometimes I don't even need to wear make-up. I should point out that the author isn't against department store products at all, if it works and does what it says it's going to do, then she gives it a good rating, whether it comes from Barneys or Walgreens.I study her book for the best in each lines' beauty products, lipstains, waterproof mascaras, eyeshimmer, illuminators, foundation, and then buying what she recomends. Her reviews are so in-depth that you're able to pinpoint exatly what your looking for and leave the rest. So far my favorite line is Urban Decay. I'm having so much fun buying make-up from boutique lines like tarte, benefit and too faced, lines I wouldn't have shopped before.One last note, after I bought this book, I became very obsessed with it and carried it everywhere, I became virtually infatuated with getting the perfect formulas and colors of all my products. It paid off and I look amazing but the fixation that gripped me lasted for months and still rears it's gorgeous head.

However, her product reviews, although sometimes helpful, seemed more opinion based than fact based, and nearly any time she gave a product a favorable review, she added a &quot;but&quot; with a negative or derogatory criticism. Except of course, with her own products, which she did not have to rate since they were made according to her &quot;standards.&quot; What dismayed me even more was the fact that she identified no formal education in a health, science, or skin care related field, but she is expecting the consumer to trust her advice on products that are filled with sometimes complex combinations of chemicals, etc. I realize you don't always have to be formally trained to understand a field. However, I was not convinced that she had a good BASIS of understanding in chemistry or dermatology. When I finished this book, I wondered if I had... to listen to her complaints (although some are well founded) and to be convinced to go online and purchase products from her skin care and makeup line. I also felt like Ms. Begoun had a personal war against cosmetic companies beyond just trying to be helpful to the consumer. For good, upbeat skin care advice, I enjoyed Carolyn Ash's book &quot;Timeless Skin&quot; much more. She does not advise on specific products, but does give tips on what to look for in a product. And as a licensed aesthetician, Ms. Ash gives advice within her understanding and refers to other books when a subject goes beyond her realm of expertise."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I bought this book a year ago, and wrote a favorable review on 4/21/99. Starting in August, 1999, I got serious about my regimin. I have oily skin prone to breakouts and, at 44, am very &quot;concerned&quot; (read &quot;vain&quot;) about wrinkles, etc. I use Paula's 1% BHA lotion in the morning, followed by her 15 SPF moisturizer/sunscreen. At night I use a 2% BHA she recommends in her book, though it's made by another company. Last month I met an old friend who hadn't seen me since March 1999. The first thing she did, after goggling, was ask what I was using for my face because I looked &quot;absolutely wonderful&quot;. She isn't the first or the last to comment on how smooth and fresh my skin looks. My skin is baby soft now and seldom breaks out. Even my husband has commented on the positive change, and this isn't something he's prone to notice. You could visit her website for intial skin care information before deciding whether or not to buy the book. She made sense to me a year ago, and I'm a firm believer now!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"As a self-confessed cosmetics junkie,and a person who has to take extra-special care of my skin,I found this book to be the utterly perfect guide.I agree with Ms. Begoun's views on matte,realistic colors,but even if I didn't,the information on the efficacy of both cosmetics and skincare would be enough reason to buy this book. She states right from the beginning that her views on cosmetics colors are her own,and I agree that the trend towards shiny and/or bright colors has taken over the industry almost to the exclusion of more sophisticated colors.The factual information on ingredients is wonderful-I always had an instinct of doubt about the trend to &quot;natural&quot; ingredients and new-agey ad copy,and now I know why.As far as Ms Begoun's own product line,I am looking forward to trying it. I think it's wonderful that she put her money where her mouth is and came up with a product line that will meet the shortcomings of the products she reviewed. To me,that only makes sense.If this line meets its claims(which are not unrealistic and don't promise to give you &quot;inner serenity&quot; or eternal youth),then she has done many women a service.And the point she makes of sunscreen is wonderful. Scientists have noted that it's not so much the natural aging process that destroys skin,it's the effect of the sun over time that plays the biggest role.Our great great great grandmothers were ahead of us in this respect!I know I'll still buy some high-end products,just for the &quot;luxury&quot; aspect of them(Trish McEvoy's lipgloss compact is one-there's hardly anything in there,but the credit-card size of the compact got me,and the tiny lipbrush in there is actually quite workable). But I'll do so forewarned and forearmed with knowledge,not because I've been taken by hopelessly unrealistic hype.Oh,and I ESPECIALLY appreciated the info on foundation and powder tones. My skintone,like that of the largest percentage of women,is indeed based on yellow tones,and it's only in recent years that cosmetic companies have even begun to acknowledge this.What took them so long? I want to enhance and refine my face,not change or mask it.(The book reinforced many things concerning this that I'd already found to be so,ie Aveda,amongst a very few others,having a decent range of foundations and powders with yellow tones.And Prestige and Jane,two drugstore lines,having a good selection of colors and textures-I was actually very surprised and pleased with Prestige,as I usually scorn low-end makeup.)Great book,can't wait for the update!(I'm looking forward to the review of &quot;KissMe&quot; mascara by Blinc-I hope it's safe, as I love this stuff,LOL)."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun tells us what many cosmetic companies (and beauty editors!) don't want us to know: that most high-end, pricy cosmetic products are not much, if at all, better than their drugstore counterparts. Ms. Begoun's style is straight and to the point, and empowers the reader to go out and make some educated choices about cosmetics. She tells us which colors are too pink, too peach, etc. We probably already know that a Maybelline mascara makes more sense than a Chanel mascara, but the reviews of the skin care products are eye-opening!As to the issues of not agreeing with her on everything -- well, sure, isn't that obvious? If we agreed with her on everything, we would not really need this book, would we? And it's OK not to agree on everything. She is simply providing information that consumers can use.By the way, a few years ago, Allure magazine ran a story on Paula Begoun (probably referring to a previous edition of this book). Allure slammed her. I recommend taking Allure's commentary with a big grain of salt. Just look at who's taking out ads in the magazine! It's the cosmetic companies, who have the most to lose by Ms. Begoun's honesty.Overall, this is a great book for the cosmetics junkie in all of us!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"You MUST read this book if you care about your skin! As reviewers say, Paula has it all from &quot;acne to wrinkles.&quot; In this book, she goes from A to Z through the expensive department store and brand name products to drugstore products -- to her own concoctions -- and tells readers what is great or not-so-great about products on today's cosmetics market. She has great plans for skin care for everybody's skin, including the fact that we all should wear sunscreen every day, and exactly what ingredients must be in the sunscreen to work right against wrinkles. Sunscreen, she reminds all readers, is the ONLY answer to prevent wrinkles on the market. She describes how AHAs can help reduce lines somewhat, as can prescription-only Retin-A, but nothing can fully remove a wrinkle once it's there. For acne sufferers, great news! Cure and prevention is there, and at low cost! I couldn't believe how much this helped my skin. In my early thirties, I still often suffer with breakouts. My skin is so smooth after listening to her advice, which you won't hear from a dermatologist -- she and I can promise you that! Now the worries about wrinkles start to come in -- but Paula even has that covered with her news that exposure to the sun causes them, and sunscreen can help prevent. For those who want to be tan, regardless of the dangers of exposure to the sun and future wrinkles? She explains which sunless tanners on the market work the best and how to apply them. I've been using sunless tanners for years, and most people don't know it. Also, in a segment on &quot;E&quot; with David Hasselhoff of Baywatch, he said all the gorgeous tans people admire on the show's bods are from sunless tanners. Paula has thought of it all, where skin is concerned, especially the wallet. The end of her book describes which products are the best for the money.She is a star at her craft and is gaining no profit from any of these companies. In fact, she regularly irritates them! Best of all, the book describes how to get a monthly newsletter and gives an email address where readers can ask their own questions. Answers to my questions usually came within a few days. Yea for Paula!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Paula Begoun is the only REAL beauty expert around. She approaches her work with the devotion and rigor of a true scholar in the cosmetics field. After reading her book and using her products, my skin looks fabulous. Friends and strangers both comment on its glowing condition. I felt both relieved and foolish after finding this gem of a book--relieved because I now had the information needed to take charge of my own beauty routine, and foolish when I thought of the thousands of dollars I had spent at Nordsrom, Sephora, Saks and dermatologists offices with little to show for my wasted money! Paula has simplified my life and my morning routine. Finally, a beauty writer who actually evaluates cosmetics systematically and scientifically. Intelligent readers will appreciate the validity and reliability of her research. Paul is simply the most informed and unbiased of any beauty author. This book empowers individuals.P.S. Any comsetics devotee should really check out her line of brushes. They are better than Trish or Shu Uemura any day!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"After buying several HUNDRED products myself as well as buying beauty guides I'd just like to let you know that Paula is an EXTREMLY SERIOUS AND HONEST woman, I am literally impressed with her reviews, she may not be a Dr. or a dermatologist but honestly the reviews she gave to ALL of the products that I used( most of them unbelievebly BAD!!) were RIGHT on target. I used SEVERAL lines like Shiseido, Chanel, Phytomer, Lab Series from Aramis, Clinique, Vichy, Neutrogena,Dr Perricone, Clarins, Lancome, [heck] the more I write the more I remember and yes finally I used the ultimate skin care THIEF line, the chief of them all , Sisley!, I spent nearly a thousand dollars on this line alone! I regret it so much I consider it a sin! All in all Paula's reviews of all these lines were nothing short of perfect, I agree with 99% of what she has said, and that is more than I am willing to agree with anybody in the cosmetic industries nowadays, believe me I've become VERY skeptical you'd be surprised =), to my big surprise Paula is honest, and the products that she does recomend as being very good, such as clinique city block 25 SPF for example, are really the very best choices. SHE IS NOT, I repeat this, SHE IS NOT HARSH on ANY reviews!, the vast majority of the products JUST [STINK]!, and you'd think that these lines are competing to see who makes the best product,HA, what a dellusion!, they compete to see who sells more, and they dont give a [DARN] about your skin, JUST your money! so yeah, Paula does not recomend thousands of products, someone said that and thats a LIE she recomends hundreds, and these have been through a serious, honest, meticulous evaluation like I have never seen performed by anybody noy anywhere not even in NASA's space programs! I have never used Paula's products, I can tell u this much though, the ones she recomends are PERFECT and I don't think Oprah Whinphrey would have invited Paula to her show more than a DOZEN times if this woman wasn't at the very least execptionally serious about what she says.

She's just WRONG so often. Lavender is harmful for your skin??? SEAWEED is harmful for your skin???So much of what she says in this book is just straight up wrong its ridiculous. I've trained with over 20 cosmetic lines and have been a trainer myself. I am all about researching ingredients to see what they do and see what effect they have on the skin. Ive spent hours of my own time doing this. Ugh. This book was garbage. Use what you think works for you. There's no way this woman went out and tried 30,000 products and even if she did, she doesn't have the same skin as you. Skin care and make up should be fun, and effective. Not based on some cracked out theories of some woman. Especially when they are almost all wrong. If something works for you - THEN USE IT. period."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I love make up, but there are just so many products out there to choose from. A friend recommended this book and it really helped me narrow down what foundation to use for my skin type and in my price range.But, as always, go out and TRY the product before you buy it. You can try many department store cosmetics right at the counter and many drug stores have a policy that allows you to try the product and then bring it back with no hassles! (Harmons is a great one for that!)So I highly recommend this book to guide you through the world of cosmetics!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I enjoy reading each addition of Begoun's cosmetics critique and I'm disappointed that this edition is her last. If nothing else, it's a fun read and I'm always curious to hear what she says about products that I've used. That being said, I find the tome valuable only for the skin care evaluations. We all know that cosmetic companies charge exorbitant amounts for what amounts to mostly hocus-pocus claims - I've fallen victim to it myself. Begoun does an admirable job of deconstructing the ingredients, but in the end, the only way to really know is to see for oneself. For example, Begoun gives her highest marks (smiley face with checkmark) to Chanel's Rectifiance for its state-of-the-art formulation. I don't doubt that the ingredients are stellar, but I just didn't care for the texture and thought it felt tacky on my face. Conversely, she gives a neutral face to Dior's No-Age eye serum, and I think it is one of the best eye creams out there. Obviously, one has to be mindful of what goes into the final product, but anyone that thinks over-the-counter skincare is really changing anything about their skin is pretty naive. Please - it's not that \\"deep\\" pardon the pun. Buy it because you like the way it looks - and feels. Not because you think it's changing your cell structure.Make-up is pretty straightforward so why she even bothers to review is beyond me. There is nothing mystical or sleight-of-hand about shiny eyeshadows. If cosmetic companies keep making them, it's because women want them. It's seems to me to be quite obvious what they look like before you buy them. This is where Begoun borders on condescension. Does she really think women are so stupid that they can't tell if their foundation is too pink or her eyes are too glittery? Give me a break.If you're planning on a new cosmetic wardrobe, especially skincare, by all means, start here. But just because Begoun doesn't like something, doesn't mean that you won't either. And if you're going to spend big bucks, get samples first. If they don't have them, bring your own container and most lines will make you one."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"Let me save you some time: Paula has something negative to say about every product on the market except for her own.

I tried some of the suggested less expensive products. But, I'm going back to Estee Lauder. The cheaper products resulted in break outs and skin that felt dry.

If this were just an unbiased review of skin care products by an authority on the subject (I wish I could use all caps, but will refrain), it would definetely hold more clout in my book, but in this case I would have to say that this book is bogus.The fact that the products have not been TESTED, just analysed by their constituents, is my first real caveat. I have seen woman with oily skin put the most \\"pore clogging\\" creams on their faces and love the product.Unfortunately, if we are going to live in a society that does not practice wholesome nutritional practices, their skin is going to suffer and they are, unfortunately, going to have to pay more for skin care products that have high quality ingredients to replace the antioxidants (etc.) that are not consumed. To say that high priced creams are a rip-off across the board is like saying that there is a generic equivalent to a Porsche Carrera GT, and we know that is not the case. Higher costs generally mean more overhead, meaning more expensive and better ingredients. Need I have to say any more on this topic?I do feel, however, that there are certain creams (La Mer is a prime example) that are really out there for rich people to waste their money on instead of donating it to poor hungry children, but that is a matter of opinion. Which obviously Paula has, and she also has her own line of products that she \\"Highly\\" recommends. One thing I would have liked to have seen was Paula giving herself a mediocre rating on just one of her products, perhaps \\"You know what guys, I really did a bad job\\". Maybe that would make this farce more acceptable."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I think that there is a lot of good information in the book. It might make a good starting place for make-up consumers. For better skincare advice, see a dermatologist. Cosmetics, by definition, cannot permanently alter your skin. Things that do that are classified as drugs and are regulated. I have met very helpful and informed cosmetics counter people and used to be one. While I admit there are people who just want you to spend your money on products you don't need, I managed to become the top seller at my counter by only selling people the products I thought would benefit them. If you aren't happy with the person helping you, get someone else. The woman writing this book sounds angry, and I have a hard time swallowing advice from an obviously biased person.

In reality, though, it's not that helpful. The author spends most of her time debunking the outrageous claims of skin-care manufacturers, which I guess is nice if you are the kind of person who actually believes those things. But as I read the book I found myself asking over and over, &quot;so, what DOES work?&quot; to which her only answers are common-sense ones like staying out of the sun and not squinting, along with ever-present pitches for her own line of cosmetics. Also, her judgments on different colors of makeup (along the lines of her first (?) book, Blue Eyeshadow Should Be Illegal) are completely out of place: bright colors are back in style, and women who want to wear them should know which brands offer the best quality. The only real revelation in the book was that way too many people who don't need it wear moisturizer.

Then I noticed that Paula sells her very own line of products which is conveniently listed but unrated in her book! I have to give her credit for her marketing ploy -- get women to buy a book which criticizes other cosmetic companies, then promote your own line without spending a cent on additional advertising. Begoun complains about fancy packaging and showy cosmetics but seems to forget that makeup IS about fancy packaging and glamour; women don't want utilitarian makeup - cosmetics are about the art of artiface after all. I love makeup and cosmetics but although I am always looking for some 'insider' information on products, I find it hard to take Begoun seriously since she has her own line to promote. Begoun's criticism of pricing IS relevant however; I agree that many women are duped into buying overpriced products which promise impossible results.

Fortunately, Paula has done a lot of the work I thought needed to be done. Descriptions of individual products, debunking myths, etc., are all great things. I would say this book is an essential buy for all women. It will save them bundles of money and they will get the results they want. However, there is not an index in the back of the book. Also, the listings of recommended products in the back of the book aren't specific enough. How can I choose a moisturizer from a list of a hundred plus without reading the description of every single one? It would help to provide Paula's Top Five or Ten in each category, for example, Paula's Top Ten Inexpensive Moisturizers for Dry Skin, Paula's Top Ten Moisturizers for Dry Skin (Regardless of Price), or Paula's Top Five Creamy Lipsticks. There is so much good information here, but the reader really has to work to figure out what to do with it.

Several of the products Ms. Begoun touts do not live up to her 'hype' and it left me wondering if we were talking about the same stuff. For instance, she recommends a specific Chanel mascara which I found to be clumpy and difficult to use, not to mention expensive.

Everyone's skin is different. I've heard/read a lot of conflicting reviews on products. My point is, you might avoid a product just because of her review, and miss a perfectly decent product for you.She also seem to review a lot of products based on what she sees, or ingredients, without actually trying the product out. For example, she said that Bobbi Brown's foundation shades all seem to yellow for anyone. But she never seem to have tried it on herself, or she would phrase it as &quot;it was way too yellow on my skin&quot; or something similar. Because I found the yellow-tone in BB's foundations perfectly fine. She also does this for a lot of drugstore foundations, such and such shades are too yellow, and such and such too pink or peach. Since drugstore foundations don't usually come with testers, I doubt that she actually brought the bottles and tried it on her skin. And if she didn't, why don't I just go to the drugstore myself and judge from the bottle.But despite its flaws it makes a good reference guides.

If you want drug store quality cosmetics, you can find useful ones, some very good ones. If you want very good quality cosmetics, more often you will pay for the increased quality.Ms. Begoun says in the intro to this (hopefully) final edition, that she was hired by a mall in Silver Spring years ago. Since I grew up in the Silver Spring area and still live nearby, I'd love to know what mall she's referring to. Years ago there were no malls in Silver Spring. A few shopping centers, but no malls.She says she had acne and saw that toners didn't close pores, etc. She's right in many ways, but she's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own.If you want the very best cosmetics, you will have to patronize high-end stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, etc. The professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin. It may take time, but all depends on what you want.Ms. Begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics. Maybe they don't work for her. When I look through her book, it may be cleverly written, but she doesn't really know what she's talking about.I had \\"bad skin\\" until I began using the Erno Laszlo line. I had clogged pores, pimples, dry, scaly patches. After a few months of using Laszlo and continuing to now, people I don't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is. Strangers don't comment on someone's skin for nothing.When I see Ms. Begoun's book, I always turn to the section where she rips the Erno Laszlo line of cosmetics. This edition, she omits what she has written in the past, that Laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product. There is a reason Laszlo customers are loyal. It works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life.I have used Erno Laszlo for almost 32 years and no one ever believes that I am 53 years old. Of course I don't look 20! But my skin is smooth, the occasional dark \\"age spot\\" that appears fades within a few weeks of using Laszlo's wonderful \\"No. 3-9\\". My husband is 47, looks younger than 47, and still everyone thinks he is older than me. My lipline is smooth, lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when I wear lipstick, which is daily.Ms. Begoun in this edition of the book says that Erno Laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot, hot water (part of his system requires 30 rinses of hot water twice a day), but that rinsing does exfoliate and I have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause. My cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll (Laszlo works, but gravity is a very powerful force and I don't expect to look 40 when I'm 70!)She rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but I think that's because she has a conflict of interest. Is she selling her own products? I know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics, I didn't bother to find out if she's still doing so.Erno Laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford - you can read in \\"Mommy Dearest\\" how Crawford's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening!The reason Erno Laszlo had these clients is because his system works.It's not cheap, it's very expensive, but it works. Most definitely, it works.Last week, I was \\"carded\\"! Quite a compliment for a someone who's been a mom for over 32 years!"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I wish that reviewers here who say, \\"She hates product lines that have worked well for me and my clients\\" would tell us what those product lines are.

I have no doubt, Paula is exceptional at what she does, but what I cannot handle, is how she \\"mocks\\" companies ad campaigns, this drives me insane. Just because they are not as boringly packaged as her \\"Paula's Choice\\" products, she tends to be rude in the way she describes several of my favorite skincare products. I reference Paula before I make any skincare purchase, because it helps me make an informed decision about my skin. This book has definitely saved me money, because you can rule out garbage skin products.Another problem I have, is Paula presents skincare products in such a grim fashion, at least anti-aging products, that it puts such a poor outlook on everything. So you basically lose all hope that there will every be a skin care product that can help you with wrinkles.Overall, Paula is great. She has a no-nonsense way of telling what is good and why.

Paula is very opinionated on her ratings and she does have her own line that she sells, but she still makes recommendations of products from name brand companies. Her research is based on scientific facts,published studies and she explains what all those confusing ingredients listed in your eye shadows mean. I don't agree with all her ratings(I will never give up my Bare Escentuals or my Caudalie products despite her mediocre assesment of them) but her knowledge of the industry is right on the money. I use this as a guide to refer to when I am on the fence about spending money on that $100 moisturizer, which I sometimes do anyway.

The claims made by some companies about anti-wrinkling creams and other antiaging products are absolutely ludicrous. Some products go as far as promising results that won't materialize (such as a foundation which pigments adapts to light to match skin color!!!).

Also, in her first book I often disagreed with Ms. Begoun on products I have personally used as did many of the blind test groups.

The first thing you do when reading this book is to look up the products you use and see how they rate. Not a single product any of us use was given an overwhelming endorsement.

I also purchased her first Blue Eyeshadow Must Be Illegal book. This was long before she came out with her own line. I learned SO MUCH from those early books, and was able to save alot of money by knowing which products that would be worth trying for my sensitive skin. I am in my 40's now, and have more problems with my skin than when I was a teenager and early 20's. Breakouts with dry skin, sensitive to soaps and harsh ingredients, etc., all starting in my early 30's. I was using alot of the wrong products, and her advice helped me achieve much better looking skin.When Paula came out with her line, I immediately tried her cleanser, beta hydroxy formula, sunscreen, and nighttime moisturizer. Within two weeks, my skin was better than ever. I have been a faithful user for over two years now, and I did try going back to a drugstore product once, and I broke out. While I can see why many people think she's just self-promoting her line, I think it's great that she decided to offer a product of superior quality. She rates other products well, and I've tried many with great success. Her prices are reasonable, also. I have a 16 year old son with severe acne, and using her products have made a huge difference in his skin. His doctor is recommending her products to other patients. They really do work. Her advice is for everyone, not just middle-aged people. I use some of her makeup (eyeshadows,lipsticks), but have had great success with lower priced drugstore lines based on her recommendations.While some of her reviews are a bit harsh, I think she is offering a wonderful service. Take what you can from her advice...there's something good for everyone even if you don't agree with it all. UPDATE 9/03: I had to stop using the sunscreen because my skin had a reaction to avobenzone, one of the ingredients. I still use the cleanser, beta hydroxy, and now the 2.5 benzoyl peroxide. I also use some of the makeup (eyeshadow and blush) which is excellent. Her compact brush set is outstanding. My son's acne has cleared considerably, so he doesn't use the products anymore. That being said, I've also read the newest edition of her book. I still think she offers good advice, but her sarcasm on some of the reviews is annoying. I do believe it is somewhat of a conflict of interest to rate other lines while selling your own. It takes away from her credibility to some extent, but you can still get good information from the book. I took off one star based on my updated observations."},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","review":"I reccomend this book to everybody. In fact it should be required reading. This book is about so much more than blue eyshadow, or shiny blush (which she does say is OK for night time; who wants to walk around with shiny cheeks in the daytime?), it is about properly taking care of your skin. I have seen a dramatic improvement since taking her advice, and understand how and why products work.

I can go nuts on eye shadows and blush and lipsticks because Ms. Begoun has told me what has good consistency and blendability and what does not. She is not a big fan (to say the least) of shimmer and sparkle (except for special occasions). She recommends matte products. I have tried products I wouldn't have normally given a serious thought to, and love them!!!

Paula Begoun delivers clear, straightforward information on what a product contains and whether it will deliver what you need. She helps you decide whether it will be worth spending the money for some exotic sounding ingredient that is really nothing more than water!Although she may appear somewhat biased against the more expensive cosmetic brands found in department stores, she does so for good reason. Most of them are selling hype in a bottle and why should you spend more of your hard-earned money than necessary? Her reviews will honestly tell you when one of their products will produce results even if it is expensive. In all fairness to these brands, she does state that if you feel that you are truly getting your money's worth, then spend it even if there is a less expensive and comparable product.She also has some very definite opinions about suitable makeup colors and effects such as shine, so you should keep in mind that it is only her opinion, and decide for yourself if blue eyeshadow or a shimmery blush is something you want to wear.The point of her book is to educate in order to save you time and money and it does just that.

Of course I don't agree with everything she says and some of the products she rated as average or gave a thumbs down to I felt worked best for me. But if you need a basic guide on buying cosmetics this one is the most complete Ive come across . I dont know of any book that covers this many brands in cosmetics industry , ingredients and prices. Because of ths book Iv become more of a label reader and educated myself about certain ingredients that Iv find have caused problem for my skin type. Ive found foundations that are labeled oil free but still make me break out . Using myself as a example, Ive a found a concealer (of another brand)contains the same ingredients in a brand of foundation makeup that has never given me any problems and I find the concealer work just as well as foundation on any uneven areas of my skin, and it has more staying power (wont fade)without causing skin problems . (...) Like a previous review stated, the book supposed to get women to think about their choices when choosing cosmetics . I still buy departments store makeup/skin products but now I stick to products that truly look well on me and not just purchase because it's the \\"hot brand\\". It might even get you stick with a few products that work only for you and maybe clean up that clutter that's been growing in your makeup drawer/kit . Or you can keep on going by the womens magazines that seem push mostly expensive cosmetic and skin care brands and skin care product as the ones to buy and stay on the merry go round of being a \\"cosmetics junkie\\".

Keep the highlighter/writing utensil handy to write in the margins! The authors use humor throughout in their attempt to make very difficult concepts more palatable. Some of the jokes were appreciated, and in other places they appeared forced. I think the authors could have simplified some of the concepts a little more--again, it was billed as an &quot;introduction&quot;--but there is no doubt that the information is there for the reading. The study questions at the end of the chapters (with answers in the back) were helpful. Also, I really enjoyed several chapters involving logical fallacies.

Though I completed reading the entire book, I was only able to keep up with the first few chapters, reviewing and doing the exercise, and they are not easy. If I were to grade myself, I believe I barely got a C perhaps because I wasn't serious enough since I wasn't using this book in a more disciplined classroom environment. I wish I did.

Included are sections on the methodology of scientific study, an outline of introductory probability, and an in depth look at fallacies.Geisler and Brooks convey the material in a lucid and efficient manner assuring the content is easy to understand. The book is weakened by a slight bias toward religious views that tends to disrupt the flow of the material if your intent is to learn only of logic. Religion as a premise requires elements of faith, which has its place, yet in a book on logic it creates a clear contradiction and does not feel apposite when viewed with objectivity.Although qualified and wide-ranging, I recommend reading a book on logic that carries no agenda.

An understanding of loigc is necessary for even a superficial reading of the Bible. St. Paul in every sentence is using logic to its deadly effect. To read Romans and Galatians without reasoning properly is...For those of you who read the review of Mr. John M K and could not understand what you wrote, do not be alarmed. He deliberately spoke in incoherent sentences, which is what happens when you deny the validity of logic. The only time he did make sense was (for the sake of argument, I assume he did) when he was using logic to attack the use of logic. For example, thieves often reason this way, &quot;This is not my wallet but it is not the case that it is not my wallet.&quot; We usually do not take them seriously. I will let the reviewer decide the validity of that. With all due respect to Mr. M K, this is not the first time that he has committed logical fallacies in reviews (see my review of *Christianity and Liberalism*).The bright moments of this book is that the employment of logic opened up a new world for me. I fault Geisler with certain examples he used. Sometimes he did not go far enough. That aside, tis should give the student an understanding of the basic content and how to use it. After mastering this book I would recommend moving on to *Introduction to Logic&quot; 11 ed. by Copi and Cohen. For a quick refreshment of logic see chapter two of *Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview* by Moreland and Craig (I do not entirely endorse other parts of that book, but chapter two is pivotal)."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This book provides a good introduction to logic, while using a lot of examples from Scripture."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Norman Geisler is well known for his work in Christian Apologetics and has written contemporary classics in this field (e.g., Christian Apologetics, When Skeptics Ask, Philosophy of Religion, Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics). What makes this particular book interesting is that it shows you, through many examples, how logic can be used in defending the Christian faith although such a defense is not the primary purpose of this book.During my in-depth study of this book (and study - not casual reading - is what it'll take to master these principles of logic), I've noted a few minor errors. For example, on page 46, the allocated figures for some moods are either incomplete or erroneous. Compare this list with the chart on page 45 and you'll see what I mean. For example, mood (AEO) should read 2,4 and not 3,4 and mood EAE should read 1,2 and not 1,2,4. On the same page (46), the authors state: &quot;Mood and figure are governed by rules 4 through 7 of the syllogism.&quot; Technically, figure is determined primarily by rules 1 - 3 (governing TERMS) whereas mood is determined primarily by rules 4 - 7 (governing PREMISES). Aside from these minor technicalities, this book is invaluable to Christians and apologists - and anyone else for that matter - who want to sharpen their thinking skills. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Quite possibly the best primer for a book on Logic. Geisler does a great job going over the basics, and even includes nice excercise questions at the end of each chapter.Logic is used everyday and people don't even realize it, so I highly recommend this wonderful book on reasoning for Christians that have taken their first step into learning philosophical matters."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This is an easy to understand text written in a light-hearted manner on a difficult topic. The topic is likely difficult because most education has now dropped formal logic from their offerings. We need to challenge how we think and this helps do that."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This is a very &#34;deep&#34; read, not for someone who wants things done in a hurry. Good material, but you will need to read it slowly to ponder its meaning and application."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Tired of believing what you believe because someone else said you should? Worn out with the whole concept that existential angst is the only proof that you are alive? Fed up with the fact that whoever can best manipulate emotions becomes king? Start here."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Come let us reason: An introduction to logical thinking by Norman Geisler and Ronald Brooks (1990) was more detailed than a similar book, Being Logical. I appreciated the additional depth, though Being Logical will be a great go to resource. With that said, the first several chapters of Come let us reason were difficult to understand. The complex notation of categorical syllogisms were challenging for me to grasp. As he began to flesh these thoughts out in the later chapters, however, I really found the initial information to be an important foundation. I will probably need to read through this book a few times to understand logic and be able to spot it in daily life. All in all, the authors not only establish the importance of logic for the Christian but the inherent logic of the Bible."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Before I tell you why I gave this book only 2 stars, let me tell you that I am a huge fan of Norman Geisler! I am not out to bash his beliefs, nor is it my intent to steer anyone away from this subject or this author. He is a good man.I am convinced that one of the reasons the world portrays Christians as inept and simple-minded in their beliefs is because Christians have not entered into the realm of logical thinking and reasoning. Books by Norman Geisler such as \\"I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist\\" and William Lane Craigs \\"On Guard\\" are fantastic books that show Christians that reason, logical thinking, and science are not the enemies of Christianity, but essential tools! Both authors plead with Christians to delve into the realm of logical thinking and defend their faith with logic and reason, and both authors acknowledge that the church (small \\"c\\" church) has failed miserably in equipping believers with these tools.With that said, if this book is supposed to be an introduction to logical thinking, then \\"Come Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking\\" will cause very few people to sit down at the table and \\"come, let us reason.\\" Authors Geisler and Turek acknowledge that there is a need for Christians to delve into logical thinking, but then begin at a level far beyond what most Christians will even attempt to grasp! Why is it so important to explain logic in 5-syllable, upper level, college terms? As I look around at the many Christians I know, none of them; and I mean NONE of them, are even remotely interested learning a new \\"language\\" in order to \\"come, let us reason.\\" If they are attempting to reach those with little understanding of logic and reasoning, then BEGIN at a level to reach those people. There are much simpler ways to say what they say. There has to be a much less academic way to show us what they are trying to show us. Perhaps it should have been edited, and critiqued, by those who they are trying to teach before it was ever sent out to the masses."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Geisler covers a good bit of ground in his intro to logic, but he's such a good logician AND good communicator, he makes it highly graspable.The book is written from a Christian perspective, so it's not likely to appeal to students or readers who aren't believers or who dislike ideological assumptions on the part of authors. Still, anyone who's familiar with Geisler knows he's a formidable logician, Christian or not, so this should appeal to readers who can look past his beliefs and appreciate his acumen."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"I purchased this book thinking it sounded like a solid introduction to logical thinking. I found the authors' use of biblical references distracting to what was presented as a purely logical discussion. There is no question that God and logic can be discussed and examined in the same context. In this book, however, the combination is at times cumbersome."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"The religious beliefs of the author are totally rammed down the throat of the reader. It really ruined this book for me. Why cant he just stick to the point? The christian vocabulary got on my nerves so much that I was quite unable to concentrate on the sudy of logic... The reason I bought the book in the first place. To be honest, the explanations are not bad at first but I put it to the writer that he had an agenda: to lure the reader in with a promise of logic and then spring the trap as an obsessed bible thumper. Basically I was unable to get past the first few chapters and am annoyyed with the author."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Purpose/Summary to introduce Logic ability to see also construct good arguments also to see bad arguments and articulate why their bad argumentsAuthorDr. NormanGeislerCons its meant to introduce logic although its actually basically intermediate levelPros its an amazing intermediate level reference book for anyone whos arleady accquianted with logic and these concepts"},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This here kind of book reading made my brain hurt so I drank some more beer....I thought I should lighten up the psychobabble, I hope you smiled."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"The subtext of Geisler's argument is the inflation of reason best espoused by Hegel: The Real is the Rational.However, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the groundbreaking work of Godel and Brouwer, the limits of reason, and logical thinking in particular began to be delineated.Geisler ignores the reality that there ARE such things as paradoxes, which is kind of strange given that his religion is riddled with them: the Trinity, a &quot;fully human, fully God&quot; Christ, etc. This is not surprising, since Paul himself completely missed the import of Epimenedes' paradox (put it its most direct form: This statement is false.) Geisler is at a loss to resolve paradoxes of this nature.Godel, in particular, showed - via logic- that any deduction of even such a &quot;simple&quot; system as Number Theory (the theory that governs the relationships with whole numbers) cannot be fully derivable from logic alone- that any such derivation must be either incomplete or, if complete, inconsistent.What this means is that logic's end result is the impotence of logic to describe even the &quot;ideals&quot; of number theory, let alone the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This book is an excellent introduction into the basic formulas and terminology of logic. All basics are covered: Syllogism, inductive, deductive, dilemma's, and so on. The reviewer from Vancover, WA, who unfairly rates this book low, brings up that Godel and Brouwer have demonstrated the inability of logic (paraphased);But didn't they use logic to reach that conclusion? - yes they did. Without logical thinking, all our statements and beliefs become nonsensical! Either logic is used or abused.Geisler and Brooks have written a great text and its only real (possible) flaw is that it is written from a conservative Christian viewpoint. Myself a Christian, I do see problems with people who will unfairly rate this book low or not give it a fair reading because of the overtly Christian stance. With that said, this is also the book's strength, because many Christians need to learn logic and may turn to this book because of the Geilser and Brook's religious position.The chapters on &quot;informal fallacies&quot; and &quot;scientific thinking&quot; are extremely well written for the primer level. This book is great from start to finish."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"I recommend this not-boaring-at-all book to anyone who takes thinking seriously and wants a concise look into logic. This book is a must for those who have never studied logic, as it teaches how to identify correct and incorrect thinking. This book reads like a text book, as it gives you exercises to complete in order that you apply what you learn. Geisler looks at logic with Theology (his primary discipline) to clarify the rules of logic, which I don't think is a deterrent (to the unbiased), in that it does not detract from the study of logic itself, but rather gives us examples to sink our teeth into. There's plenty of incorrect thinking in our society, &amp; this book helps one to see through the bad arguments proposed."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"The main strength of this book is its thorough catalog of informal fallacies, accompanied by a glossary for easy reference. Although overtly Christian in tone, it is suitable for anyone interested in informal logic."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"This book is not meant for casual reading (you have to think to understand this one), but it can help enlighten the casual reader (who does not want to study) if he/she skims through the first 90 pages (which require some study of terms and differences)and then coasts through the rest. Geisler and Brooks are Christian thinkers who understand thinking and logic, and they present the major components of logical thinking in a Christian context.The authors explain syllogisms and differentiate between a valid conclusion and an invalid conclusion. They also distinguish validity from actual truth (valid conclusions are not always actually true in reality; they are merely logically based on the premises presented). That's the stuff addressed in the first 90 pages.But the best part (and most enjoyable for me)began with chapter 6, \\"Informal Fallacies.\\" This section was lighter reading. Since this is an election year, it would be a study in itself to compare political commentaries and supposed answers to questions with the logic presented in this volume!Since the authors are serious students of Scripture and Geisler is a celebrated Theologian, most of their examples come from familiar Bible texts or theological issues. Although I have stronger convictions about Sovereign Grace than do the authors, I really found their examples useful in the realm of hermenutics (Bible interpretation). They are solid defenders of an inerrant Bible and ethical interpretation.If you want to brush up your thinking skills, this might be a good place to start. \\"Fit Bodies, Fat Minds\\" by Os Guiness persuades us that the use of the mind has been neglected in evangelical communities, and Geisler and Brooks have written a work to help properly activate those little grey cells. Not really an easy read, and not for everyone, but a meaningful mind stretcher."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"In my opinion, everyone should read a book on logic and argumentation to clear up the way he thinks. The advantage of this book over the others on the same topic is that Geisler's book:- is not &quot;dry&quot; and boring as are many book on formal logic- is still very clear, unlike many books on informal logic- succeed in teaching a lot in a limited spaceI can recommend it. The contents are:1 The Whats and Why of logic2 Building blocks3 Basic logical structures4 Other types of syllogism5 Formal fallacies6 Informal fallacies7 Uncovering logic in literature8 Introduction to induction9 Scientific thinking10 Fallacies in scientific thinkingEach chapter is followed by exercised, the answers are at the end of the book"},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"The reviewer Daniel J. Paszak \\"Diogenes\\" criticizes this book because it claims that a tautology is invalid. If the reviewer, however, bothered to read p. 23, he'd see that \\"there is a difference between truth and validity.\\" A conclusion may be true (such as a tautology, for instance), but if it does not follow from its premises, then the argument is still invalid. This is a standard logical system. See the definition of \\"valid\\" in Copi and Cohen, Introduction to Logic. Also, this book does not claim that \\"-p or -q\\" is \\"-(p or q).\\" Look again. The authors are not unaware of De Morgan's theorem.Furthermore, it exasperates me when reviewers like Truth seeker \\"a reader from NY\\" say that they are surprised to see that this is a book that assumes/promotes Christianity. Or when other reviewers like John L. Davis say that the use of biblical references is distracting. Duh! Look at the back cover and see what the book is about and who the author is! This is one of those \\"logic texts intended explicitly for Christians.\\" Geisler is \\"one of evangelicalism's most prolific writers.\\" This is a book written by two Christians for a Christian audience. And do you know where the title \\"Come Let Us Reason\\" comes from? (Hint: the Bible.) So don't gripe that this book assumes a Christian worldview.Now, for Christians: Anti-intellectualism is one of Satan's strategies that have made the church ineffective. Geisler's book combined with a good textbook on biblical hermeneutics will enable the Christian to recognize and combat deception and fallacies, and appropriate God's truth.By reading this book, you'll know what a \\"straw man fallacy\\" is. Accusing Geisler with something he didn't say is an example. Geisler in the book mentions paradox, but does he ignore it (See the the fallacious review by J. Kowalski \\"mumon\\")? Geisler only says that what is not paradoxical in theology should not be considered so. [The trinity is a mystery but NOT a paradox or a contradiction because it does NOT say 1 is equal to 3. God is 1 in an aspect (essence) and 3 in another aspect (person). Anybody who says Christians believe a contradiction is again guilty of straw man attack.] The reviewer also insinuates that Geisler holds that all truth is derivable from logic. However, Geisler is an evangelical and holds to truths revealed in the Scripture, not just truths derived from reason.You'll be able to recognize what a \\"faulty dilemma\\" (also called \\"false dichotomy\\") is. Saying that being human and God at the same time is contradictory is an example.And what is \\"dicto simpliciter\\"? It's the fallacy that applies a general rule to circumstances not included in the rule. The general rule that \\"Cretans are always liar\\" does not apply to Epimenides, so Paul is able to quote him and assert that \\"This testimony is true\\" (Titus 1:13).You'll also learn from this book what an \\"argumentum ab annis\\" is. It's the fallacy that says because a concept is oudated, it must be false. (Sounds familiar?) What does age got to do with the truth value of a proposition?You'll also become familiar with what \\"argumentum ad verecundiam\\" and \\"ignoratio elenchi\\" are. Appeal to Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is an example because it does not speak of the utter futility of logic to arrive at a truth, only that given any finite set of axioms, there are propositions that cannot be proved or disproved from this set alone. And saying that if a proposition cannot be proved then it must be false, or if it cannot be disproved then it must be true, is \\"argumentum ad ignorantiam.\\"Satan's strategy is always deception as can be seen in the world's history. As Christians, it is our task to unmask those lies and fallacies. So, my suggestion: \\"take up and read\\" (the Bible with a good book on hermeneutics, and a good book on logical/critical thinking like this one)."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Truly philosophically minded introductions to Aristotelian logic (the other is Peter Kreeft's _Socratic Logic_). I now do work in advanced mathematical logic, but the good old syllogism is still the most useful logical tool on a daily basis. My favorite two parts of this book are the early parts on Logic and God. It should be required reading for modern Christians. Also, the chapter on Uncovering Logic in Literature is very very good. I have taught from this text in Classical High Schools and have found it ideally suited for that purpose. It also works very well for a self-taught course. There are answers to exercises in the back. I should add that the exercises are largely drawn from philosophy and theology which makes them much more interesting than conventional logic texts."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Norman Geisler and Ronald Brooks have written a fantastic textbook on how to think using Logic. They dare to focus on students within their own Christian faith, demonstrating that you can think and be Christian! Even with the faith based examples they refrain from preaching in any way, so this work is a great introduction to Logic for anyone who wants a taste of how to examine their thinking. The book is worth buying just to read the contrast it makes between inductive and deductive reasoning. I am glad to see this book still in print!"},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"The church is permeated with people propagating pious notions of anti-intellictualism. While the intellect is not the be-all-end-all of the Christian life it is one of the most often neglected aspects of santification. The mind in scripture is the only thing that we renew. God supernaturally gives us a new heart, but gives us the enormous and exciting responsibilty for the renewing of the mind. Logic is one major aspect of this renewal. While emotions are central those emotions must not be irrational. Geisler and Brooks provide the framework by which we can decern the fallacies of foolish thinking and grasp the essential role of Logic in the life of the Christian. This book along with J.P. Moreland fine work &quot;Loving God with All Your Mind&quot; will serve as an antidote for our neglect of the mind."},{"Title":"Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking","review":"Christianity has become intellectually bankrupt and we now have more frauds and cults than every before.

When a touring Faire comes to town, super-confident (and lazy?) Ralph loses all the booth games to his cousin Percy, and Percy gives the prizes to the beloved Sarah.Ralph cheats (he's sometimes clever, sometimes just downright rotten) and wins some games, but he eventually owns up to his dishonesty. After making it up to the booth operators, Ralph finally--and honestly--wins a prize at the dunking booth.I love the Rotten Ralph series, especially for Nicole Rubel's rich, color-saturated illustrations. She uses beautiful, unusual colors (sometimes recalling Matisse), and her sense of fun complements Jack Gantos' underplayed humor. Gantos wrote a great line for Sarah on the last page: \\"'Oh, Ralphie,' she said. 'You don't need any practice at being my winner.'\\" 48 pages divided into four small chapters. The jacket informs us that \\"an animated series based on...Rotten Ralph is now appearing on television in over 20 countries.

This is rather expensive, and the stories are downloadable for free on the web since they are now public domain."},{"Title":"Wreckers must breathe","review":"This was Hammond Innes' first book, published just after the outbreak of WW2. Like a number of his wartime books such as 'Trojan Horse' and 'Attack Alarm', this book revolves around a clever and highly original German infiltration of Britain.What is interesting is that even at this early stage, the typical Innes elements are all in place. Walter Craig is the \\"everyman\\", a drama critic on holiday who through no fault of his own gets drawn into the story. Maureen Weston is a capable, resourceful, and very engaging heroine; the narrative actually shifts to allow her to tell her story through extended letters, which is not something I believe Innes ever did again. Logan, too, is a fascinating; Innes has already established his trademark of making the most interesting character someone other than the narrator.The central plot is very clever, and the story progresses quite well. The only issue I have is with the ending. The idea of a handful of people overpowering hundreds of experienced German sailors is a bit far-fetched, even if the way in which Craig and Logan go about it is well thought out. Innes generally avoided such gung-ho theatrics in his books.Since it's his first book, 'Wreckers Must Breathe' is as good a place as any to start with Hammond Innes. Just be aware that this isn't quite as solid as his late 40's and 50's work, and has nowhere near the depth of his epic 60's-90's novels."},{"Title":"The Eskimos,","review":"Though the book is a bit dated (Published in 1971 by Crown Publishers, Inc. from New York; Lib. Congress Cat. #: 78-147326.) it covers an outstanding depth of information regarding the Eskimo culture. The author not only covers the well-known Alaskan Inuit tribes, but also touches on the Greenland peoples as well.There are 70+ pages of photos, plus a map of the region and pages of native drawn art dealing with their interpretation of everyday life. (These photos are both black-and-white as well as in color, so if you are researching for artifacts or for more visual details, you won't be disappointed.)This book covers life ranging from paleolithic times up to, and including, the Eskimos transition into modern (1971) life. There are pictures of stone, hide, ivory and wood artifacts, as well as many fascinating pictures of Eskimo daily living (hunting, social ceremonies, burials, living in hide tipis, as well as pole houses, not to mention what is considered the &quot;traditional&quot; igloo).If you are at all interested in Eskimo culture, THIS is the book to get - truly superb research and the photos (both new and old, pre 1900) make this book a gem."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"I must disagree with the earlier reviewers.

Up to this time, most of the attention toward this families accomplishments has focused on the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, and left others of his amazing family in the dust. Bathurst's research is impressive and her ability to tell this story is thorough, yet highly enjoyable(I missed my bus twice.). The most exciting part really is about patriarch Robert Stevenson's building of the lighthouse at Bell Rock. You can feel the sense of horror as Stevenson notices their ship has pulled away from it's moorings, and his realization that death may be near as the tide rises. If you don't have a summer book yet, and you like good non-fiction.

Several small errors; Robert Stevenson could not have used Dynamite in the early 1800's because it was not invented by Nobel until 1862.

Quite frequently, there is a lighthouse nearby and I always seem to be made aware of those that were \\"British Built.\\"What I had not realised before reading this book, was that the famous Robert Louis Stevenson came from a long line of Stevensons who were expert lighthouse builders. Indeed, he is quoted in the book as having said; \\"Whenever I smell salt water, I know I am not far from the works of my ancestors.\\"This is a fascinating work which has been brought to life by an author who has done a really good job. Having been brought up in an age where electricity was used to power lighthouses from before I was born, photographs and accounts of how coal was hoisted to the top of these mammoth structures in earlier days is both a revelation and education in itself.Containing portraits of various notable engineers in addition to the different lighthouses they built, I was impressed by the inclusion of a painting of one light by the legendary J. M. W. Turner, no less, the comparable sizes of different lights and sectional drawings showing how the brickwork was interlaced in order to withstand the fiercest storms.An excellent book and one which will allow me to tell my fellow travellers something about whatever remote lighthouse we end up climbing at some time in the future.NM"},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"I must disagree with the earlier reviewers.

But the book is a mess. It is poorly constructed, with lots of irrelevant material, (a whole chapter about some English loony who didnt even build a lighthouse) and a fair amount of women's mag level psychobabble without any real insight into the character, intelligence or motivations of the Stevensons. There is little make us care about them as people. There is also no hint of any real understanding of the technical achievements of the Stevensons who were working at the frontiers of engineering and technology of their times(and thus no convinving attempt to convey it to us!). Also, God only knows why the book wasnt properly proof read or edited but it wasn't - which just adds to the irritation. This review is a bit of a fraud because I was so disgusted I didn't finish reading it. However even on 2/3 reading it is apparent that any pretentions to write a definitive account of the lives of the Stevensons must await the efforts of someone more competent than the author."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"Bella Bathurst is a bit of a conjurer. In just over 260 pages, she has managed to provide a lot of fascinating, exciting and even quirky information concerning the construction of the Scottish lighthouses, plus well-crafted biographical portraits of members of four generations of the Stevenson family. She gets the reader hooked immediately, interestingly enough, by writing about someone who was not even a member of the Stevenson clan - Captain George Manby. Manby, around 1805, came up with a method of keeping rowboats afloat in heavy seas, to be used in conjunction with a &quot;rescue line&quot; tossed out to foundering ships which were close to shore. In conjunction, these would be used to rescue seamen before their ships sank and they drowned. This didn't appeal to the people called &quot;wreckers,&quot; who depended upon booty from the sunken ships for their livelihood. In their view, it was better to let crew members drown - after all, they might put up a fuss concerning the theft of the ships' cargo. When, in 1807, the naive Manby let some wreckers take him out on a boat so he could test the seaworthiness of his new and buoyant rowboats, the wreckers intentionally capsized the boat - hoping to drown Manby, who couldn't swim. (Fortunately for Manby, he managed not to drown.) This anecdote ties into the rest of the book, because when the Stevenson family started building lighthouses, the wreckers weren't too thrilled with that development either. So, a lot of the people in the seaside communities didn't exactly put out the welcome mat. Not only that, but the Stevensons' had to put up with &quot;press gangs&quot; trying to shanghai workers so they could man merchant and military ships. Part of this book reads like an adventure tale - with the workers battling the mighty forces of mother nature on remote spits of land that were sometimes 10-15 miles off of the Scottish coast. The workers, at some locations, would have to be transported daily from the mainland - fighting against seasickness and terrific winds and rain. They would sometimes be marooned on the desolate pieces of rock where the lighthouses were being constructed, as savage storms would blow for days or even weeks on end. There is even an Egyptian flavor to the construction - as huge blocks of carefully carved and smoothed stone are transported and painstakingly put together. Each block had its own unique place in the puzzle, and the margins for error were slight- 1/8 of an inch per stone in some cases. This was a case of bullwork being combined with fine craftmanship - all being done under atrocious climatic conditions. It is a tribute to Ms. Bathurst's writing and organizational skills that, even with all of this activity swirling through the pages, we don't lose sight of the Stevensons. We see the patriarch, Robert Stevenson, with his formidable work ethic, energy, and devotion to public duty. Even in his late seventies he was still going, by ship, all along the Scottish coast, on long inspection tours of &quot;his&quot; lighthouses. Religion is also a part of this story - in particular, the Scottish belief in a stern, no-nonsense God: On one project Alan Stevenson, one of Robert's sons, made his men work on the Sabbath days. Later on in life Alan came down with a neurological disorder (which the author speculates was muscular dystrophy). Alan was convinced that God was punishing him for his sins. He tried to atone through prayer and through whatever work he was still able to do. When the disease went into remission, Alan thought he was finally being forgiven. When he got worse, he thought he wasn't doing enough to earn God's forgiveness. This makes heartbreaking reading. The writer, Robert Louis Stevenson (known as Louis), also enters into the story, as his father, Tom, wanted him to continue in the family tradition. Louis made some youthful efforts to accomodate his father but, although engineering and lighthouses were in the blood, this life wasn't for him. We'll never know if this was engineering's loss, but it was certainly literature's gain. When they weren't dealing with 100 mile-per-hour winds and, sometimes, 200 foot waves, the Stevensons also found time to build roads, bridges, harbors, breakwaters, etc. In the preface, Ms. Bathurst says that she didn't attempt to write a definitive biography of the Lighthouse Stevensons, but she hoped the book &quot;will be seen as a kind of taster for the subject, and that anyone wanting to search further will be able to do so.&quot; This reader, for one, found this remarkable book to be very tasty indeed."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"What comes across loud and clear was the desperate need for navigation aids on the coast of Britain in the 18th Century; in 1800, Lloyds reckoned they were losing one ship a day (!) to shipwreck - and these are only the ones reported - the true figure, including small craft, was probably many times that. The lighthouses that did exist were coal-fired, inadequate, confusing and extinguished at the worst possible times - in storms.This book does not pretend to be a treatise on all lighthouses, but specifically those built by the 4 generations of the Stevenson family.It starts unusually with the youngest, and most famous, of the Stevensons - Robert Louis - who had few dealings in lighthouses, nor any wish to; but his experiences and those of his forebears influenced his life and writings, as in 'Kidnapped' and 'Treasure Island' - both concerned with wrecks and dark deeds on lonely islands.His unfinished family history is a fount of information (and speculation), however, and this is the reason for his place in the book; the main protagonists come next, starting with his step-great-grandfather, who stumbled into the job of erecting a REAL lighthouse (as opposed to the earlier amateur attempts) on the basis of his experiments with lamps... the rest is history.The chapter on the Bell Rock reads almost like a novel; Rennie, the man originally hired to design and build the light, being gradually ousted by Robert, who claims the work as his own - understandably, as Rennie wanted the kudos, but had no desire for the hardship, only visiting the construction 3 times, whereas Robert thrived on it (but was not averse to a touch of glory).Of course it all ends in tears, with an acrimonious wrangle dragging on for years; but it established Robert as THE lighthouse engineer, winning him new commisions for roads, canals, bridges etc..His descendants follow in the family tradition (pushed heavily by Robert), keeping to the same basic design of Smeaton's Eddystone light, they erect lights all round the Scottish coast; incidentally gaining the undying hostility of the hordes of wreckers, whose grisly activities were effectively foiled by the lights.Ms.Bathhurst's writing is fluid, assured and informative, never patronisong or descending into scholarly jargon, and, though very well-researched, (see the comprehensive bibliography), does not pepper the text with notes, foot-notes and references - this is after all a Popular History book.Thoroughly entertaining - highly recommended.*****."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"It's hard to imagine that a book about lighthouses would be a page-turner, but this one is. The tale of how multiple generations of Stevensons (with a Smith or two thrown in there) perfected the modern lighthouse is told with a perfect balance of technical coverage, tales of bravery, and family history. The fact that one part of the line ended with Robert Louis Stevenson, who helped build one major lighthouse before turning his back on the family business, adds a fascinating coda to the story.I've been to Scotland, but never visited the coasts. I've climbed several lighthouses in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and South, but they are not sited on such difficult terrain. So, reading this book makes me want to see the lighthouses of Scotland: the true tests of man's ingenuity vs. nature's power. Those lighthouses have withstood gales and 100-foot waves for more than a century (sometimes more than two centuries). The author really makes you feel what kind of an achievement that has been.It's also one of those books that makes you want to do more reading -- on lighthouse construction, but also on the history of modern Scotland, the Crimean War, and, of course, Robert Louis Stevenson."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"This book should appeal to anyone with an interest in lighthouses or the sea, engineering, Scotland or, although there is not much about him in the book, Robert Louis Stevenson. His father, cousins, uncles, grandfather and a non-Stevenson great-grandfather are responsible for the construction of a surprising number of lighthouses, some of them in the most challenging locations. Details of how this was accomplished by four extraordinary generations of a single family are competently sketched by apparently first time author Bella Bathurst. However, the book left me thirsting for more detailed descriptions of exactly how these sometimes astonishing feats of engineering were accomplished. A good introduction to the subject and perhaps also to the nascent profession of engineering. Five stars if all you want is an introduction."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"I happen to think that the history of engineering is amazing, awesome. inspiring. This book is about the Stevenson family who built the majority of lighthouses around England in Victorian times. In the process they established procedures for what is now the profession of engineering.I find that words are failing me so perhaps you should Google up a few pictures of Skerryvore, Bell Rock, Dubh Artach, Muckle Flugga, Inchkeith and then try to imagine how you would build them in an age before machine power. Absolutely awesome!!"},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"Thanks to the staggering success of Dava Sobel's _Longitude_ a few years back, we now have a flourishing subgenre of similar works. It might be called something like: \\"Smallish books about great achievements in the history of science and technology and the amazing people behind them.\\" Bella Bathurst has written a fine example of the subgenre; if you liked _Longitude_ and _The Professor and the Madman_ you'll like this one too.On the good side: Bathurst can write smooth, engaging prose that keeps you turning the pages. She sketches the landscape and her main characters neatly and economically, and has a nice eye for anecdotes. She keeps you interested and gives you a fair sense of what it was like to build lighthouses in the 19th century.On the bad side: The character sketches remain just that--sketches. I don't feel like I know *any* of the Stevensons as rounded human beings; nor do I have a sense for the changing millieu in which they worked. The descriptions of the lighthouses have the same problem. Bathurst clearly doesn't care much about the details of the technology or the construction methods . . . but I *want* her to care, and to explain them to me, because that's a big part of what makes the Stevenson story so extraordinary. How *do* you hoist multi-ton blocks of stone off a pitching barge onto a slippery rock, anyway?Let me be fair: I *enjoyed* the book as I read it. Ultimately, though, it left me feeling unsatisfied. This is history-of-technology lite . . . a pale imitation of modern classics like David McCullough's _The Great Bridge_ and _The Path Between the Seas_ or Stephen Ambrose's _Nothing Like It in the World_. It's a pale imitation, too, of journalistic work about extreme environments, like that of Sebastian Junger, John McPhee, and Jon Krakauer. All those authors give better value for the money than Bathurst: fully rounded characters and total immersion in the details of the events and processes they're writing about."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"this was an excellent book...the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's familyin Scotland...they were determined to build lighthouses to protect sailorsand ships which travelled the waters surrounding their native Scotland.the detail is extraordinary, the drama is worth the read and theirlifelong and multi-generational commitment to this work is inspirational!a total thumbs-up to author Bella Bathurst."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"I found this book to be a fast and informative read. I am neither a lighthouse enthusiast nor a Stevenson literary junkie but still managed to enjoy my time spent reading the book.I can see where this blend of biography, history, and engineering would be too thin to please serious lighthouse fans, literary historians, or marine engineers.However, for the general reader, the book succeeds nicely in combining a selected history of the Stevenson family, their works for the Northern Lighthouse Board, and the family's impact on Robert Louis Stevenson.It is an interesting account of the difficulties overcome in the creation of some of Scotland's most magnificent lighthouses. The author knows how to turn a fun phrase which adds to the reading a bit of an Easter egg hunt for bon mots.The typographical errors previously mentioned have been corrected in the paperback edition."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"After visiting Scotland last summer, I was excited to find this book. The wild Scottish coast is an intriguing context for adventure, courage, and (here) amazing engineering achievement. However, the book is a huge disappointment. The story is potentially quite a compelling one, but the HUGE number of mistakes--both in the editing and proofreading and factually--detract to an overwhelming degree from one's possible enjoyment of the book. If this were a paper from one of my students, it would get about a C-. Given the number of mechanical errors in the book, one might be very skeptical about the historical facts, as well. And if it isn't good history, it sure doesn't cut it as decent fiction. If you want to read this one, check it out of the library. Don't waste your money on a flawed book."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Stevensons","review":"I like the books by R.L.Stevenson so its really cool to see how he came by his experience. Granddad was a driven guy who forced everyone into the family business. R. was lucky to escape to become a no-account writer. Well books turn out to last longer than bricks. But still, its amazing to read that some of these lighthouses took ten years to build. The first summer's work having been washed away by the winter's storms. Plus the social aspect of the coastal towns which made their living from plundering the treasure (recycling?) of wrecked boats. They weren't all that interested in helping to put these lighthouses up. Eventually shame at the death of the sailors and persistence by the Stevensons got the job done.Anyway if you love books about the sea, you'll like this one.

Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"Wow! After reading this book, all I can say is Wow... How did I not hear about John Gilmore sooner? I found this book while searching for anything regarding John Holmes and the Wonderland murders and anything about Barbara Graham, notorious murderess who was put to death in San Quentin in 1955.Anyone who has seen \\"Wonderland\\" knows a lot of what happened to the \\"four-on-the-floor\\" denizens who were heavily involved in the drug scene. Was John Holmes in the wrong place at the wrong time? Maybe. Did John Holmes have something to do with the deaths of the four on Wonderland? Highly likely. Did John Holmes perpetuate their deaths? The chances are very, very, high. Headed on a road that he never veered from, John Holmes sealed his fate after getting too involved with Eddie Nash and the Wonderland crew. He rose to fame quickly, and descended even quicker. John Holmes gives an amazing insight into the drug scene and porn world in the late 1970's, into the 1980's, including Holmes' death in 1988.Barbara Graham, the \\"Ice Blonde\\" was headed on a similar descent into drugs, prostitution and murder, paving her way to San Quentin's gas chamber in 1955 along with two others implicated and highly likely to have been guilty in the robbery-gone-bad murder of Mabel Moynahan. Although Graham denied it, two men testified against her, while one who was going to testify against her \\"disappeared\\". Mabel Moynahan was a former skater who was sitting in a chair, reading a mystery novel when there was a knock on her door. Had she known what was going to happen to her, surely she would have not opened the door or let the young woman at her door in. It was Barbara who knocked on the door, explaining how her car broke down, and could she use the phone to call the auto club. Graham's entrance brought the other men involved into the house. They thought there was a hidden safe in the home. There wasn't. There was $500 in cash and several thousand dollars worth of jewelry in a handbag in Moynahan's room. They never found it. And Mabel ended up dead...I won't ruin the rest of the book for you. But I will tell you that this book pulls no punches. I could not put it down! Gilmore is now one of my favorite writers! His style is unique and powerful. And he doesn't give a damn if you like it or not!

I've read the reviews (natch!), and it's now a cliche to say John Gilmore pulls no punches, goes for the throat, and kicks you where you feel it bad. L.A. DESPAIR is a totally heavy book and it's chuck full of true crime, porn stars, bad dude killer like Billy Cook and then the whole heavy, heavy scene about Barbara Graham which really freaked me; and more, a total fall from grace (with no parachute!) on the part of Barbara Payton (watched TRAPPED last night), and Gilmore's caught her exactly. I don't know of any factual errors in the book and if I did it wouldn't make any difference. This is my kind of writing yet I can't think of another book like it. I'll call it NEW WAVE writing! HOT new wave writing! It is great!"},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"John Gilmore is not the kind of writer to play patty-cake with apologists, so those who have looked for \\"sympathy\\" in Gilmore's writings should have saved their money and bought the more popular look-to-the-bright-side books. Those who have read LAID BARE know where Gilmore takes his stand. From there he shoots from the hip. He is a great writer with the applause of many highly respected talents. LA DESPAIR is not a reader-friendly book, so take your chances carefully. It is a big book offering Classic Gilmore. The photographs are vivid, exciting; some are WEIRD and others downright grotesque (like the dead bodies and the retrieving of bodies of murdered children. WEIRD! He is a master of the hard-boiled and the macabre, and this is probably his most controversial book to date (with the exception of CRAZY STREAK which is TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS in that he deals with underage sex and incest). John Gilmore speaks for our TIME. He is an important artist reflecting the grotesque, empty culture in which we live. His work seems to say, \\"Children, rise and slay the dragon!\\" There may even be some out there who think he should be censored or his work repressed. Others hate him because he dishes out a TOUGH TRUTH! Like Tough Love. For me, long live Gilmore and his OUTRAGEOUS work. Like Bret Eston Ellis, Gilmore he is a voice of our IMMEDIATE time.

Reading the reviews so far, seems he has blown a few minds and the book has just arrived. I've been waiting for the publication of L.A. DESPAIR for a year since reading an interview with the author, and I have to say this surpasses my expectations. This is as dark and edgy as it gets. A great book. The section on western swing king Spade Cooley is fantastic, as is the wild ride through horrorville with hitchhiking highway killer Billy Cook. Windows into the heads of Barbara Graham and washed-up movie starlet Barbara Payton is remarkable. Don't miss this one. It's sure to blow a few more minds."},{"Title":"L.A.

Whether the fabrication of this pseudo-biography is representative of the entire collection I can't say, but it certainly has nothing to do with the reality of her life. Gilmore knows that this sort of thing satisfies some deep inner need of his own, and obviously that of his most devoted readers. But for those who are interested in a non-fiction account of her life, I urge you to wait for the publication of \\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\\", a complete chronicle of her life by John O'Dowd soon to be published by BearManor Media. Until then, this book should be re-titled \\"L.A. Despair: The Interior Landscape of John Gilmore\\"."},{"Title":"L.A.

I recently attended a reading by John Gilmore in Phoenix at the Perihelion Arts and it was a rewarding experience. His presense is as strong as his words.To the \\"Pathetic\\" reviewer claiming to be Barbara Payton's son, I wonder where all the outraged \\"supporters\\" were when for years poor Payton was sleeping on bus benches and in gutters, a drug addict, a drunk, a lowly prostitute, all dreams gone, all hope vanquished, her life ruined by her self-destructive, wicked and hopelessly lost personality. I have read Gilmore's chapter, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE, three times and it is a powerful, convincing, tragic tale. I doubt that anyone other than Gilmore could tell this sad story with such a compelling understanding of the subjects.This is a work to be saluted. In these \\"five bleeding sides of beef\\" as Gilmore has labeled the stories, there are rich nuggets of truth to be discovered, running in the flood of \\"bad times\\", from which all of us might benefit. Barbara Payton's life was a sad one indeed, and Gilmore shows her incredible hatred of men and her twisted, pathological nature that ushered in her early death. L.A. DESPAIR transcends genres and does offer light in this dark \\"landscape of crimes and bad times.\\""},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"My heading says it all. This book reminds me of an issue of E.C.'s \\"Crime Suspense Stories\\" from the 50's. A great, grisly and lurid comic that almost destroyed the industry. However I think that is Gilmore's intent. He seems to make up a few characters or \\"sources\\" in the Wonderland Murder segment and then uses them for a little hard-boiled rhaphsodizing with appropriate grim n'gritty lingo. He has one porno extra saying how she met John Holmes in an L.A. Starbucks during the late 70's,early 80's. Come on! There were no starbucks in L.A. during that time! Gilmore definitely delves into magical-reality when he writes, but thats not a bad thing exactly.His segment on Barbara Payton was completely lifted from John O'Dowd's excellent article on her in Crimemagazine. Its online and I strongly recomend it!!!! Reading that article and searching for more on Barbara Payton is actually how I found out about Gilmore's book. I wouldnt be suprised if there are other \\"borrowed\\" portions in L.A Despair. Mr. Gilmore probably does his research with Google like the rest of us. I would venture to say there isnt anything in his book you couldnt find elsewhere and probably with better facts, however its still a fun and morbid read with Gilmore's turgid noir poetry running thru it. L.A. is truly the end-of-the-line city of dreams and nightmares! If your in the mood for a guided tour thru the L.A. Funhouse of Horror then John Gilmore makes a great carnival barker. What the hell, at least he's getting his books published! I'll probably get Laid Bare by him as well. I'm sure it'll be a fun Magical-reality read."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"The crimes and bad times will stun you by their clarity of vision. I have not read a book in a long time that offers this quality of vision. Gilmore is a writer who has mastered the ability to capture so much with such brevity. Truly an internal read, yet easy, fast, and hard-hitting. I can think of no other author who accompolishes this with such originality and power. It is definately a Gilmore work, and the word is relentless. A highly recommended read that takes you totally into another world, albeit a dark and terrifying world. After reading L.A. DESPAIR, I was glad to be alive, to look at the sun and the sky and the city around me. I feel Gilmore took me by the hand and led me into a shadowland I'll never forget."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"It is disappointing to see that Mr. Gilmore lifted so much material, verbatim, from my Crime Magazine Internet article on Barbara Payton (online since 2003) for HIS chapter on Barbara's life, and fails to credit the information to me in any way, shape or form (save for a passing mention of me at the tail end of his story). With Mr. Gilmore's legendary pomposity and self-important attitude he, of all people, ought to know how disheartening it is to see one's words taken without permission and made to seem as they are the words of another writer. That, Mr. Gilmore, sucks!I could find many things to gripe about in his malicious and unkind look at Barbara's life, but two that come to mind right off the bat are that he has nearly every person he \\"quotes\\" in the passage sound just like him when they speak. (Really, Mr. Gilmore, are we to believe that everyone you spoke to has adopted the same, hard-boiled manner of noir speak that you employ? Okay...) Second, as another reviewer pointed out, this man completely ignores Barbara's many good qualities. Not once is her well-known generosity mentioned, much less any notice whatsoever given to her extraordinary talents in the kitchen and her excellence in interior decorating, furniture refinishing and home improvement. Instead, we are told that Barbara Payton was a wanton, sex-crazed waste...an alcoholic and drug-addicted barracudda who chewed men up and then spit them out. Where is the woman's humanity in this portrayal? Why aren't the many MARRIED men who wooed Barbara called TRAMPS and WHORES? If she were YOUR daughter, Mr. Gilmore, wouldn't you want people to know that she also possessed some endearing personality traits as well as some unfortunate ones? Did Amok not give you enough space perhaps, to document Barbara's many positive qualities? Did you think it not important to try to seek out even ONE of her family and friends who could provide you with this kind of less-than-sensational material? Or was it just not important to you to try to write a well-rounded study of this woman's life?For people who want to see how John Gilmore lifted many of my words, right out of my mouth, so to speak, you can read my Crime Magazine article on Barbara Payton on the Internet. Again, it was first posted in April 2003. My comprehensive biography of Barbara's life--in which I dispel several of Gilmore's published allegations about her character--will be published by BearManor Media in 2006.I'm glad that Mr. Gilmore felt the material I wrote was so powerful that he thought he'd claim it for his own.The chapter on Barbara is a disgrace and I can only hope her son John, her brother Frank, her sister-in-law Jan and her ex-husband Colonel John Payton (among her many other family and friends who still love Barbara very much) don't read it as I know it would only break their hearts.John O'Dowd"},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"Gilmore slips up badly in his reporting of Barbara's sad life. In fact, he has written several things that are downright inaccurate and border on fiction. Barbara Payton has been cruelly and terribly maligned through the years and she deserves to at least have the truth written about her life.1. Barbara took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood. WRONG. She had already moved from Texas and was living in Compton with her husband Jack Payton when she decided to pursue a MODELING career.2. Lee Redfield joined a construction company down in Odessa, Texas. WRONG. Upon their move to Odessa in 1938, Lee and Mabel opened a motel called The Antler's Court which they ran for the next 12 years.3. Barbara and John Payton went to Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel on their honeymoon. WRONG. John Payton INSISTS that he and Barbara did not honeymoon in Hollywood...but in Rockford, Illinois, at his parents home.4. John Payton had to leave California (during the fictitious honeymoon episode) to go back to the Air Force base in Texas. WRONG. John and Barbara were already living in Compton, CA. when this was supposed to have happened. He was attending school and she was a housewife.5. One of her cousins in Odessa claimed that Barbara had more than one pregnancy, one of them, ending in a miscarriage. WRONG. John Payton insists that Barbara was only pregnant ONCE, and that she gave birth to their son, John Lee Payton, in 1947.6. Barbara ditched Payton, left the baby in her mother's care and climbed aboard a Greyhound heading for Hollywood. WRONG. John Lee was NEVER left in Mabel Redfield's care for any period of time, nor did Barbara \\"ditch\\" Payton and \\"take a Greyhound to Hollywood\\". She and Jack Payton were already living in Compton when she decided to pursue a modeling career (her acting career came three years later).7. Barbara met George Provas in a bar at the hotel she was staying at in Mexico. WRONG. George Provas (who prefers to be called TONY) said they met at the hotel's swimming pool.8. Provas whisked his bride west to Bahia-Kino. WRONG. They lived in Guaymas first, then Nogales, Arizona, and didn't move to Kino Bay (a.k.a. Bahia-Kino) until 1957.9. Provas supposedly said they tried to get Barbara singing in a club but she would be too drunk to sing. WRONG. Tony Provas says this NEVER happened.10.Barbara and Provas traveled to Tijuana, etc...WRONG. They were NEVER in Tijuana together, says Tony.11.A black pimp was paying for Barbara's room at The Chesterfield Hotel on Wilcox. WRONG. Barbara lived at The WILCOX Hotel for a time, with actor John Rayborn.12.Her father found her body crumpled on the floor of the bathroom. WRONG. Barbara's mother found Barbara DYING in the bathroom. She was STILL ALIVE when Mabel heard Barbara moaning in agony and rushed to her side. Barbara died a few minutes later...in her mother's arms.The chapter on Barbara Payton is a singularly negative account of her life and only further taints her memory. As those who REALLY knew her can attest, Barbara was NOT a cruel and conceited woman who treated people badly. She was both wild and innocent and deserves to be portrayed with much more accuracy than what appears in this book. Gilmore fails to bring up up even one of Barbara's good qualities or talents (for instance, she was a gourmet cook, she rebuilt and refinished furniture, she was a genius in interior decorating and she was generous TO A FAULT) and this is terribly unfair to her memory. She and her family and friends-- who still love and miss her--don't deserve this jaundiced and one-sided look at her life."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"A brilliant work with enough impact to bowl over a Mac truck. Stunning originality, unquestionably brilliant writing, despite the pittance of detractors who seem to appear regularly with each new offering by author John Gilmore. A similar ilk used to burn Gauguin's paintings.Such is expected whenever one dishes extreme material and Gilmore's writing is profoundly extreme. The word \\"relentlessly renlentless\\" has been used to describe his novel, Crazy Streak, as well as his Black Dahlia book, Severed, now a haunting classic.In L.A. Despair, Gilmore tracks through the Wonderland killings, following John Holmes and a host of lowlifes caught in a pitiful existance only Frankenstein could appreciate. Gilmore's view of the porn \\"industry\\" positions that world as subjects for a firing squad, and I say Right on, Mr. Gilmore! In five hard pieces, from killers to wasted stars, he sketches a dark and violent landscape; a sensational, stunning book by a fascinating yet uncompromising author. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"Yeah, the \\"wannabe writer\\" below is right: this book, L.A. DESPAIR, is about as in-your-face as it gets. John Gilmore's about as tough a writer as comes down the line. A painter named Richard George said, \\"An artist has to decide whether to paint in the mainstream of art history or to paint whatever he wants to paint.\\" An a literary artist, Gilmore writes what he wants to write, and literary history is the richer for it. I read an interview by the author who states it is the only way one breaks \\"on through to the other side.\\" Gilmore says, \\"You'll make mistakes but you'll keep chasing the discoveries...\\" That's what L.A. DESPAIR is and the problem of whether we \\"get it\\" or not must rest with us and not with the this author. The \\"despair\\" inherent in John Holmes or Barbara Payton is similar to so akin to the anguish and despair of Spade Cooley that all of them could trade skins and come out the same. From what I gather, Gilmore is by choice not a mainstream writer, his focus set beyond the surface plotting and values of mainstream adherents. He manages through some magic or miraculous manipulations, to get inside the subjects he writes about, these miserable people who become, as it were, magnifying glasses into the molecules of our culture, and into us-each of us. Once reading Gilmore, all else seems tame. Try his novel, CRAZY STREAK on for size. In your face? It'll knock you flat on your you-know-what. Mainstream safety you won't find here or in any of Gilmore's works. He \\"rocks\\" as they say, and aims for discoveries into the fiber of our human condition, or at least that is where he seems headed in literary history. A terrific book, as are all Gilmore's works, though as \\"mainstream\\" entertaining as an auto wreck; and Gilmore seems able to grab and hold of that part of us that must slow down and rubber-neck the scene before heading on down the road."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"One is challenged to find a book by an author other than John Gilmore for going beyond the limits. His work is word magic and ingenious originality. The five sections making up L.A. DESPAIR are unnerving and even frightening. Gilmore's work is totally unique and unhackneyed, and shatters the concepts foisted upon us by lesser and more commercially-aimed writers. Gilmore is truly the literary renegade.His unblinking, harsh examination of the pitiful life and execution of murderess Barbara Graham blasts apart the previous, pretentious, Hollywood whitewash. Spade Cooley, maligned as a monster for almost half a century, comes before us as the tortured, sad genius he was, destroyed by drugs, alcohol and a disastrous marriage; to be RAILROADED for the gas chamber. Lucky for Cooley, he didn't get the death sentence but spent many years in prison, only to drop dead upon his release. This is perhaps the saddest tale in L.A. DESPAIR.Hollywood hellion Barbara Payton was beautiful, arresting, and in possession of an intense, aloof magnetism that Gilmore captures without a flaw in KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE, which is exactly what Payton did, from the threshold of astounding fame to the L.A. gutters. Gilmore shows her unbridled sexuality, alcoholism, drug addiction, and an uncontrollable thirst for sex and liquor that pushes this once-gorgeous girl into a dark, dangerous, haywire fall from grace. Another reviewer has nitpicked over what he claims are a handful of fact errors in this section, and apparently missed the pathos delivered in Gilmore's book. All the views or landscapes of life in these five sections are brilliant \\"portraits of the unredeemed...\\" A truly awesome and unforgettable book, deserving of a ten-star rating if only for its breakthrough originality and the awesome offering of lives broken in our city of angels."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"John Gilmore's \\"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times\\" takes you directly into the underbelly of the City of Angel's most infamous criminals and publicly ruined lives. Starting off with the story of 70's porn star and legend, John Holmes, L.A. Despair takes you into the life of a character with little to no redeemable qualities whatsoever. Holmes is, as Gilmore himself has put it, the definition of the L.A. mutant. He is a self-serving man whose only purpose in life is to get his next fix at any cost or consequence. After reading the story about Holmes, there is little doubt that he was a walking sociopath and a man who was headed for one place and one place only - self-destruction. It continues on from there into the story of 50's bombshell and fallen starlet, Barbara Payton, who notoriously went from making 10,000 dollars a week to being a homeless prostitute and drug addict living on L.A.'s skid row. I never knew about Payton before (because I was born in the 80's long after her rise and fall), but I found her life story to be unbelievably tragic and depressing. Riveting, to say the least. From there on, Gilmore goes onto several lesser known characters. People who were more infamous for their crimes and horrible deeds than anything else. However, there is an explosive conclusion in store with the story of Spade Cooley - a man who savagely beat his wife to death over her past infidelities imagined or otherwise. It's never made clear, but Cooley comes across as being an obsessively controlling and tortured man whom, at times it seems, tortures himself into believing the worst possible case scenario by looking for any reason whatsoever to justify it. Understandable, yes. Redeemable? Not quite sure.In the end, L.A. Despair is like a bunch of little stories in one. Modern day and real life horror stories, you could say, centered around the City of Angels. Los Angeles is a city that people mainly associate with the famous, rich, and beautiful, but as John Gilmore demonstrates here there is a terribly dark and unforgiving underbelly to the city also. In any case, this is a portrait of sociopaths, bad times, and ruined lives.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"The title of this book is L.A. DESPAIR, A Landscape of Crimes and Bad Times, not Better Homes and Gardens. I'm not interested in Barbara Payton's interior decorating skills and as for her gourmet cooking abilities, maybe she should've spent more time in the kitchen cooking up food instead of hiding behind dumpsters cooking up a shot of heroin. This is a book for people interested in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, not a love letter for Barbara Payton fans (if in fact, they truly exist). Some of the previous reviewers apparently didn't read the other four superb chapters in this book. Like the opening chapter, a vivid account of the morally bankrupt porno star John Holmes. Or the haunting tale of Billy Cook, the hitchhiking misanthrope who drops dead bodies down a wishing well. Then there's Barbara Graham, the ice blonde accomplice to a grisly murder. But the final chapter on singing cowboy and wife killer, Spade Cooley, sticks out as particularly poignant. Love kills, folks.Gilmore gives us commentary-free reporting straight from his files. As far as any inaccuracies, this book is fact. But the coat hangers for these facts: dates, bibliographies, indexes, are not required nor are they missed in the least. He is not after what filmmaker Werner Herzog calls \\"the accountant's truth\\" but rather a deeper understanding, a greater soul.Gilmore knows people and he does his leg work as well as his desk work and comes back with sharp portrayls of some of the most tragic figures to pass through this dark world of ours. Like Detour star and Payton romancer Tom Neal, who can't seem to handle any of the women in his life. He ages way before his time thanks in part to his own bad decision making and also as a result of being subjected to the mercy of the drunken fate that los Angeles offers. This is the stuff nightmres are made of. They read as easily as the grim fairytales parents tell children to help them \\"bare their lives as people buried alive,\\" as Rainer Werner Fassbinder would say. Read it cover to cover and read it at bed time. . . 5 stars. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"If you're just looking for details of some bloody events, this'll do the job for you. Otherwise, it's colorless in two senses: literally (there're probably no more than a half dozen pages that mention a color) and in terms of mood. Maybe because of the many extensive quotes from non-writers, descriptions are non-specific, flat, banal. There isn't a single scene that a reader can visualize with any accuracy... quite a contrast to the rich sense of place that characterizes LA crime fiction. Maybe the author wanted to avoid that tradition to separate his work from fiction. As a result, though, he separates it all from context."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"I read this in the library and was disappionted. It is all imo gossip from trash mags. I wouldn't buy it go to your local library if you want to read it!"},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"I rushed to buy this book after the reviews in amazon.com. I must say I was not too impressed. Gilmore is an in-your-face writer and he holds nothing back, true. But I think he doth trieth too hard to shock and awe. After a while, it gets over-played. I am also not too impressed with the choice of stories. Eddie and Holmes -- ok. Barbara Payton -- ok. Then it begins to slip. By the time you get to Spade Cooley, you begin to wonder whether this was just a filler. Ahhhh!!!! No. Not too pleased."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"as Dick Lane used to say on the old TV shows. John Gilmore takes us back to huddle with the King of Western Swing, Spade Cooley, and this is the first and most exhaustive account I have read of Spade Cooley and his conviction for the first-degree murder of his wife, Ella Mae. \\"Whoa Nellie\\" Dick Lane is quoted regarding Cooley's drinking problem which got him fired from TV, and Cooley's downhill story is the most tragic account in Gilmore's \\"five bleeding sides of beef,\\" as he calls them in the well-written introduction by Anthony Mostrom. Western swing music was put on the map by Cooley, ingrained into the American country-western scene, and Gilmore's handling of the Cooley tragedy is detailed and sympathetic, He is able to separate the tortured man from his musical brilliance. Equally, I have given this book five stars for each of the five \\"side of beefs,\\" each tale unfolding souls as tortured as Cooley's; John Holmes, gas-chamber bound Barbara Graham, mass-killer Billy Cook, poor Barbara Payton, the fallen star. The book appears as a mosaic set into the consciousness of L.A., the megalopolis that, according to Gilmore, knows no pity. A very hard to put down book."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"A mind-blowing read. Hard to take in at times it is so stark and the style so jabbing, intricate and hard-boiled. The images Gilmore summons up are unforgettable and the photographs shocking. They are sorrowful and hard to look at if you are not a crime scene freak. Especially harsh are the shots of the children victims of William Cook, raised from an abandoned well and laid in a row along with the murdered mother and father. I have read Gilmore's other books, but this one seems different. The writing is sharp as a razors edge and dark, so very dark it makes you want to run into the sunshine and bathe in the glory of being alive."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"If you enjoyed his other collections of anecdotes and analysis of the Hollywood sub-culture then you will enjoy this collection.I especially enjoyed the chapter on John C. Holmes which actually had some very good insights on Eddie Nash that had me wanting to know even more about this arab Godfather.Fascinating reading is to be had here without a doubt!"},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"I have followed the work of John Gilmore for several years, the fiction, nonfiction, and true crime. By far this is his most aggressive work; an overwhemilng quality to it, thrusting at you as it does. Few writers have this capacity. The tragic timbre that lays beneath the surface of this work is devastating. A true presentation of where contemporary literature should be and, unfortunately, is not. A fine book on the vanguard of this author's body of work."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"The most thorough and accurate account of the life, crimes and times of hooker/murderess Barbara Graham that has ever been presented. For the first time, the real story unfolds before us. The public has been brainwashed by the media (movies/television) into thinking Graham could have been railroaded when there was NEVER a question of her guilt, only a question of whether she would get the gas chamber with her child-murdering co-horts, Jack Santo and Emmit Perkins. Graham was convicted of beating an elderly lady to death with a pistol. The later execution of all three (the same day) in the California gas chamber is told in precise, hair-raising detail. The other accounts in L.A. DESPAIR, expecially the story of mass-killer William \\"Billy\\" Cook, are without equal in the true crime genre. I saw the movie \\"WONDERLAND\\" about John Holmes, but came away knowing nothing new about the case. Now, in Gilmore's account, \\"BAD EDDIE AND OTHER NO GOOD PEOPLE,\\" the story takes full-blown, grotesque shape. John Holmes was a true L.A. \\"mutant,\\" a tragic, awful story of the darkest side of the street. The book is a balance betwen the crazy, the bloody, and the remarkable. An amazing read, packed with fantastic photographs."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"I bought the book mainly for the chapter on the infamous Wonderland murders in 1981. And while the author's prose is, as some have stated, sparkling, I have to say that I stopped reading after finding numerous factual errors in just this chapter. Luckily for me, it was the first one.For instance, two pictures of dead victims at the crime scene (Ron Launius and Joy Miller) were incorrectly labeled (names transposed), despite the fact that the photos in the book were still shots captured from the famous LAPD crime scene video, where detectives walked through the house and identified exactly the room they were in at the time.Susan Launius was found alive in the same room with her dead husband, not, as the author writes, in another bedroom.Perhaps most unsettling was the author's version of the murder event itself. Given the fact that Holmes never testified at any legal proceeding, and despite the fact that none of the actual killers were identified, it's obvious the author invented the whole dialog.These are just a few examples of what caused me to discard the whole book.Moreover, I believe it was a wasted opportunity. There has not been a serious literary treatment of the Wonderland murders. \\"Four on the Floor,\\" a book by the two investigating detectives, apparently was never published. \\"Long Time Money and Lots of Cocaine\\" is merely a reprint of the transcript from John Holmes's preliminary hearing.Ironically, the most informative source on the crimes is the 2003 movie \\"Wonderland\\" starring Val Kilmer."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"No one gets across the scorching picture of the \\"dark side\\" more disturbingly than John Gilmore. Quoted in books, media, television interviews, bogs, journals, updates, etc; he is an icon of the true crime, Hollywood memoir and \\"pulp fiction\\" generation. He has lived, loved, performed and written about some of the most exciting people of the past half-century, individuals who we, not even born at the time, only admire or worship from afar. At the risk of presumption, John Gilmore appears to have lived as a wandering poet through the American headline and tabloid culture, telling his tales and travels, and we are the richer or maybe smarter for them. He is still going strong, as in L.A. DESPAIR: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times. In slashing boldly to get at the \\"the thing in itself\\" (as he says in interviews), he often risks our displeasure, our consternation, even our anger. A few individuals throw rotten tomatoes and often bricks. But his \\"landscape\\" of fans, the majority applauding him, understand this is expected of any controversial figure. Gilmore has stated that he anticipates the \\"displeasure of many...\\" every time he writes a book. They step forth quickly, the same as in any oppressive regime, seeking to squelch original voices that challenge the status quo, the propaganda, or, more succinctly, the basically colorful albeit fake world of the TV sitcom and other ersatz or pop-psychology offerings.L.A. DESPAIR: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times captures a section of the human condition we choose to brush under the carpet because it fails to guarantee a profit for the promoters of mediocrity. Gilmore's \\"Landscape\\" is a hostile, threatening environment as an earlier reviewer has suggested, indeed a \\"mad dog\\" world we are a part of, the same as each is connected by our humanity to the tragedies around us. The undertow in Gilmore's work brings this point uncomfortably home. We thrive in loveless sex, lust, drugs, murder, bloody, bloody murder; Hollywood glitter and suicide by gun shot, poison or pills. He writes of desperation and failure to love, of DESPAIR and tragedy, and this is LITERATURE. Not to be confused with a sitcom or fan zine or a pizza or bag of popcorn. This is ART, as Gilmore is quoted in the introduction by Anthony Mostrom, his \\"five bleeding sides of beef.\\"But a word of CAUTION: Gilmore's writing hits below the belt. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.Indeed, L.A. DESPAIR \\"goes for the heart as well as the throat,: and Gilmore has never been as definite as in this presentation. It is impossible to take the book lightly. Readers seeking \\"light\\" reading must look elsewhere. L.A. DESPAIR is about human horror. It is about the failure we face every step of the way through life. I was left with the thought, we can be thankful to whatever gods one chooses for allowing the life we own, and the fact that we're still alive says there is HOPE, and through hope there is life. As the word DESPAIR signifies, this book is about hoplessness in the megalopolis of L.A., a city with its own code of horrors, the \\"front office,\\" as it were, being the manufacturers of high-priced illusion, and then there is the bitter pill and how the cost translates down to us.Take him or leave him. One is hard pressed to deny John Gilmore's special niche as a major, literary voice, and unquestionably he is one of the movers and SHAKERS of our culture. For example: SEVERED: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder; Gilmore's book about Elizabeth Short, her dreams and her hideous murder, was the first-ever true crime book on the life and death of the Black Dahlia. It has subsequently changed the face of an industry. Few of the nay-sayers can say as much. L.A.DESPAIR is an astonishing book."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"In his introduction, Anthony Mostrom describes this book as \\"Portraits of the Unredeemed: John Gilmore's Desolate Landscape.\\" And a desolate landscape it is for certain. These five stories of the famous or near-famous are raw, shocking, and written in the best Gilmore \\"true crime\\" style. These are true crime classics, painstakingly researched and told from an insider's perspective.\\"Bad Eddie and Other No Good People\\" details the life of John Holmes and his benefactor, sometimes friend Eddie Nash. In his heyday, Holmes was hailed as the God of Porn, for reasons that will be clear to readers. Eddie Nash was a ruthless hood who knew how to grease wheels and make piles of money. Their uneasy alliance forms a backdrop to Holmes' doomed career and final years as pathetic has been flunky toNash.\\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\\" is a Hollywood success story gone horribly bad. Barbara Payton showed up in Hollywood an electrifyingly beautiful young girl and left as a ruined shell, feet first. Her early promise fizzled fast thanks to drugs, alcohol, and insatiable sexuality. Franchot Tone thought she was just what the doctor orderedand was briefly married to her. Bob Hope enjoyed her wildness for awhile. Barbara had an untamable wild streak and took whatever she wanted, but in the end Hollywood showed her who was boss.\\"Hard Luck\\" shares the awful life journey of Billy Cook, a soulless young man with H-A-R-D L-U-C-K spelled out on the fingers of one hand. Those who knew him said Billy lived in his own world, totally lacking in human compassion, feeling, or sentiment. The murderous rampage he cut through life is brilliantly written and powerfullytold by Gilmore. Cook comes off as what he was: an unloved stray cur that somehow survives to adulthood with no reason to love or trust anyone. From birth to death, he caught no breaks and gave none.Barbara Graham is the infamous \\"Ice Blonde\\" with an angelic face, curvaceous body, and emptiness where her conscience should be. Graham followed her impulses, used people for her own ends, and was never sorry for anything. Except for her outward beauty, she had no saving graces. She liked to hang with criminals and murderers and noamount of pretending to be sweet and innocent could save her in the end. Her part in the vicious slaying of an elderly woman takes Graham to the gas chamber.In \\"Shame on You\\" we follow the meteoric rise and spectacular burn out of Spade Cooley, Hollywood's King of Western Swing. The popular \\"Fiddlin' Cowboy\\" entertained his fans in movies and on TV, was a friend of Roy Rogers, and built an empire with his musical talent. But like so many other phenomena before and since, his weaknesses ruined him. The shocking murder of Cooley's wife ends his career, and hisprivileged life.A review of Gilmore's work in Maximum Rock 'n Roll says, \\"John Gilmore is one of the best nonfiction writers of our time, the type of writer that grabs you by the throat and by the heart.\\" I agree totally with that assessment. His topics may be unsettling, and not for the squeamish, but his writing is pure Grade A.review by Laurel Johnson for Midwest Book Review"},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"L.A. DESPAIR gives us a tragic, fragmented landscape of degradation and misery; each portrait reaches relentlessly into the deeper, dark side of this thing called human. What unfolds across Gilmore's desolate landscape is a bleak shadow-world populated by desperate people; some lives without promise, others grabbing feverishly for anything and everything we are told to dream for: success, fame, love; all are shocked asunder by these embedded forces Gilmore lays bare: self-destruction, psychological crucifixion and plain, horrific self-deception. The tragic consequences hurtle through the author's episodes (as in Spade Cooley and Barbara Payton) with a stark, merciless accuracy that jolts the reader beyond the hard-boiled into a terrifying confrontation with the forces that can and do go wrong.It has been established that in previous books, Gilmore has revealed a brave, new kind of writing in which the genres of true crime, investigative journalism and biography collapsed beneath the brutal intimacies of personal recollection. His great capacity to peel away the layers and reveal the twisted deception that lurks within our idealized vision of beauty, fame, and success. He puls no punches in this vivid, exciting read and show a profound grasp of human perversions and life experience. Here, in L.A. DESPAIR, he appears to clarify a personal vision of human hell, embodying a predominantly hard-boiled theme so powerful it supersedes the ordinary concepts of an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to violence and death. Gilmore's writing is powerful and unique and rivets us as he dashes across this horrific landscape like a mad dune-buggy amidst a jungle of emotional wreckage... A sorrowful history of an equally mad environment. This book is a major accompolishment by a major writer and will be read and re-read with no end in sight."},{"Title":"L.A. Despair: A Landscape of Crimes & Bad Times","review":"John Gilmore's L.A. DESPAIR is a pure literary wonder. I'm in agreement with another reviewer about the originality of this book. It shrieks originality and one of a kind style. Here is an impassioned voyage into the back alleys, the mind haunts, fears and terrors of \\"the dark side of the moon\\". I highly recommend this to all goths, geeks, freaks, underground readers and the intelligensia of today's literary world. Possibly too strong for a lot of people, but wow, does Gilmore know how to deliver a knock-out punch. I must add that I find it abominable that a reviewer(or one using different names)singles a section on Barbara Payton to discredit Gilmore, urging readers not to buy L.A. DESPAIR, but wait for the reviewer's book to be published and buy that. This \\"reviewer\\" obviously does not belong to the big following of ardent John Gilmore fans. Maybe some sour grapes? As Gary Indiana says, Gilmore's the greatest, and L.A. DESPAIR sits tops the stacks of this author's exciting, hard-hitting books. He's Mister L.A., and maybe a little too hard-hitting for the movie mag fans? Hey, get real!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"What a writer.

The characters were very well intermingled and the emotion contained in the novel was heart rending at times."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Set in Rome and Florence in the seventeenth century, this is a story of the emerging talent of Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653), the most famous female artist in the history of Italy.Her father, Orazio, is an artist who teaches his daughter the passion of painting. He introduces her to Agostino to teach her perspective. Agostino promises marriage as he abuses her body, but at his trial it is she who is tortured and humiliated by the Inquisition. She leaves Rome and marries Pietro, an artist in need of her dowry. He does not mind her career as a painter as she strives for professional acceptance, but is angered when she is boldly admitted to the Accademia del Disegno in Florence before him. Their relationship gradually diminishes and Artemisia spends more time with her paintings and her daughter, Palmira, turning at this time to her scientist friend Galileo Galilei who espouses his controversial theories on astronomy.She describes Galileo as \\"not particularly handsome, he was an intelligent man capable of kindness, a man whose gallantry was sincere, a man easy for an intelligent woman to love ... in spite of the incredulity of his ideas, an affinity of the mind drew us together.\\" They were also both taking risks in their careers. Soon afterwards, for his beliefs in astronomy, Galileo was brought before the Inquisition in Rome, tried for heresy, and threatened with torture.Well-written and interesting. Excellent for non-scientists and fascinating for science historians.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"A fascinating story of a woman artist's struggle to succeed against the odds in medieval Italy, both in her work and her personal life. AND she's a real person, a contemporary of Galileo, whose paintings you can actually Google and visit (if you're in the right place.) The book is overflowing with rich details on the locations, clothing, food, and human relations Artemisia encounters in various cities. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"A fine historical fiction following the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, the first woman in 1600s Italy to be accepted to the Academy of the Arts of Drawing in Rome. Her works, of which her series of the Judith story is the most famous, portray strong females with attention to their natural form, rather than the more commonly idealized version of the female form by male painters of the time.Her life as a painter was almost destroyed when she stood a public and humiliating court trial after her father accused her painting teacher of raping her. She was subjected to a public gynecological examination and tortured with thumbscrews during her interrogation. The belief at the time, was that, if a person could tell the same story under torture, then it must be true. She bore the physical scars of the thumbscrews for the rest of her life on her hands.To escape from the jeers and slurs in Rome slung at her, her father arranged her marriage to a Florentine artist and she left Rome. While being a wife and mother, her artistic career started to take flight in Florence, where she gained the protection of the Granduke Cosimo de Medici. She became friends with Galileo, and she was favored by Michaelangelo Buonarroti the younger, (nephew of the great Michaelangelo).But an artist's survival depends on patrons who commission works from them, and that meant sometimes that the artist had to move to new cities to find new commissions. Artemisia took her family with her as she moved from Florence to Rome, Venice, Naples and briefly England.The fictitious take on Artemisia's life, while changing some of her conditions and certainly the make up of her family as a child, and her family after marriage, doesn't detract from showcasing a woman who lived for painting, a woman who didn't allow her past to turn her into a meek and apologetic woman, a woman curious about the world and a woman who sought to make those who look at her works think of the people in them, as opposed to looking at them as flat figures. In a way, I'd say she sought to challenge their opinions of familiar subjects."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Without question, Vreeland has done a lot of research, and it shows. Influenced by her father's art and the controversial Caravaggio, Artemisia's paintings bring to life with vivid talent some of the darker moments from the Bible and historical legend. Absorbing and richly described, The Passion of Artemisia is a beautiful, and sometimes gritty, insight into Baroque Italy's artists, patrons, and even religion. Artemisia's life is visually detailed by Vreeland, as descriptive and thought-provoking as Gentileschi's actual paintings. The end result is a most satisfying read, of an engaging and tangible view into life for a female artist during one of the most influential times of Italian art.Those who are interested in art, the process of mixing paints and applying to canvas, and how a painting is translated from the mind to the canvas, will truly enjoy this book. If you liked Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier, then you will most likely enjoy The Passion of Artemisa by Susan Vreeland. I look forward to the next audio production of Susan Vreeland's Girl in Hyacinth Blue, also narrated by Gigi Bermingham, and also focusing on art.Thoughts on the AudioThis is my first audio book that I actually enjoyed! Many of you know that I've struggled with finding a good one. Vreeland's story of this historical figure felt genuine and thorough, and the usage of the Italian language peppered throughout is wonderfully engaging and kept me enthralled. In fact, this is one of those books where I believe (based on the overall professional production of it) that I would much prefer the audio to the printed version.Part of my enjoyment of this audio production was Gigi Bermingham's lyrical and fluid narration. When reviewing her background, it's no surprise that she is also registered with the Screen Actors Guild and has done film and television. Effectively maneuvering through the Italian language with an ease of an Italian born in Rome, Bermingham carried the story effortlessly. There was a clear and distinct voice to each of the characters, men included, and never once did I feel distracted. Combined with musical interludes introducing chapters, this audio production was exactly what I needed to feel more comfortable with listening to books."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Susan Vreeland transforms the art world for the average person. I'm not an art afficionado, but Ms. Vreeland's writing makes me want to learn more. The art is real,her stories surrounding the art are fiction, but read as if they could be real. She keeps you transfixed from the first page to the last page."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This is one of the best fiction accounts of an artist I have ever read. Vreeland is a master at connecting the reader to the character and the reader wants so much for Artemisia to find happiness. I want to return to Italy and see her paintings and learn about her from her works."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I really wanted to love this book. All the hype, plus my love of reading about art and artists, convinced me that this book would be outstanding.I am sorry to say that I did not find it so. If it had not been for the descriptions of the paintings and wanting to find out where Artemisia's life went, I would never have finished the book.The book was so poorly edited and awkwardly written. There were many, many errors and contradictions. The historical facts were presented in the most ungainly and awkward way. (I am talking about little tidbits ---what was going on at the time). It was as if the author had stuck post-it notes on the pages with factswritten on them. These were not woven into the fabric of the novel in any way.One poorly written passage sticks in my mind -- on page 221 Vreeland writes, about Artemisia's daughter Palmira: \\"Palmira watched the soup for me hanging in a pot over the fire.\\" Poor child, hanging over the fire in a pot! This kind of writing is inexcusable, in my opinion.My suggestion would be that some serious editing be done before the next edition or the paperback are printed."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"As a fan of Artemisia, I've been devouring books on her lately, trying to learn as much as I can about this fascinating woman. I admit this book is well-written but, to me, it reads like the author hoped it would be made into a movie. It was just a bit too \\"dramatic.\\" The reason for this may be that there is little historical fact in it. If one compares it to the remarkably researched book by Alexandra Lapierre, who spent years digging through archives around Europe, one is left wondering where Vreeland got her data. Sure the book is exciting and more interesting than Lapierre's, which gets bogged down in places and leaves one longing for a bit less detail, but Vreeland's book should be classified as fiction and Lapierre's as biography. There's so much missing from Vreeland's book that I was dismayed and annoyed that she should assume such literary license with her subject, when so much documentation exists that she has ignored. If you read only one book on Artemisia, and really want to get to know her, this is NOT the book for you."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Although Artemisia Gentileschi was certainly unusual for her era, the character Vreeland gives her in this book feels too modern. A more interesting version of the life of Artemisia is the earlier book by Anna Banti, entitled Artemisia, and first published in Italian in 1947."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"\\"If Rome craved spectacle, then I would give them spectacle.\\"So states Vreeland's heroine at an early point in the book while under extreme duress. This is an apt way to introduce you to this book that catalogues a fictional account of the life of Roman born artist Artemisia Gentileschi. Interwoven in Vreeland's style of wit and superb detail are the factual experiences that occurred to this unfortunate woman as she slaved under the patriarchal dominance of the post-renaissance art world. But the determination behind this artist's desire to triumph against insurmountable odds is best summed up by the aforementioned statement.\\" The real principles of living are not in the Scriptures. They are in blood ties, histories, sayings, innuendos, surreptitious looks, clandestine agreements, and hot clasped hands. When you learn to recognize them, life will become easier, rich in opportunities and rewards. Be wise, Artemisia. Be watchful. Look in their faces and show no fear.\\"For those of you who do not know this tremendous artist, this is a spectacular way to learn a bit about her and who she might have been. I personally have read about her before this, but I enjoyed this book as a means of getting the gory details of her life to the masses in an interesting way. The real Artemisia was a woman born to a Roman artist, Orazio, who taught her how to paint young. When she was in her teens she studied the style of Caravaggio and the latest trends in perspective under Orazio's fresco partner Agostino Tassi. Tassi's name went down in history when he began to rape Artemisia repeatedly, promising her that he would marry her in order to get her to acquiesce to his demands more smoothly. What happened ultimately is that he denied her the chance to salvage her honor and because of this her father decided to sue him for rape and slander, among other things. As you can imagine, in the 1600's her reputation suffered from this event, and she was subjected to numerous torment at the hands of her peers, neighbors, friends, and even had to endure torture in the trial by having the sibille bind her fingers until they bled profusely. This is where Vreeland starts the novel, at this tumultuous and life altering point in Artemisia's young life. It seems she has studied the transcripts of the trial well, as there are several details I had read about previously added to the court scenes in the book.What is very interesting about this particular book is how destructive this event is on this poor woman's future relationships with men, particularly the one with her father who becomes somewhat estranged after the circumstances of the trial escalate to a point of no return. This, is in fact, disastrous for Artemisia, who can never quite bring herself to trust a man again, even though she is shortly later married off to a Florentine painter to get her out of Rome. Even though she does struggle to get beyond the rape and the shame of the whole ordeal she can\`t quite let go of her anger, and it is this anger that she holds against her father that stands out the most throughout the course of this book. This affects everything she does, and she spends a good deal of time running from her father rather than the past. She even denies her daughter the relationship with her grandfather for a large portion of her young life.This is an engaging story and a quick read. Certainly not perfect, but a nice way to spend a quiet evening. I recommend it to fans of contemporary fiction and historical fiction alike.\\"Have you ever felt abandoned by God?\\"Her chin pulled back a little, the only hint of her surprise. A disturbance past over her face that I had never seen before.\\"By God and man.\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"After reading The Passion of Artemisia, I could not help but wonder if author Susan Vreeland was an artist herself. Through descriptive first person narrative, Vreeland presents us with vivid images of the models that Artemisia painted, rich details of the cities of the Rome, Florence and Genoa, and colorful portraits of her contemporaries, that not only bring the Italian Renaissance world to life but help us see the world through the artist's eyes. And through the use of contemplative questions that Artemisia asks herself, Vreeland makes us feel as if are intimately involved in the artist's personal life as she struggles to find fulfillment in her roles as wife, mother and daughter. Artemisia's paintings are used as a chronicle not only of the her artistic development but as a reflection of her personal development as well, giving us insight into the personal significance of her body of work. Vreeland identifies Artemisia's rape early on in the story as a significant catalyst for subsequent events in her life that lead to both suffering and triumph and ultimately, a recognition of her lifelong passion to be a great artist above all. It is in the healing of this early wound that Vreeland succeeds in drawing a rich and satisfying conclusion to this fascinating story of one of the greatest painters of the Renaissance."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I enjoyed this book enormously. Vreeland's descriptions of Italian artwork is exactly as I remembered it in person. I was truly sorry to let Artemisia go at the end of this delightfully written book. I have recommended it to my book club and my mother (the toughest critic!)."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Similar to Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring, Susan Vreeland creates character based on what she interprets in Artemisia Gentileschi's artwork. Vreeland is greatly aided by her real-life heroine's well-documented rape, and therefore it's easy to make the connection that her art would frequently be disquieting and violent. Vreeland intelligently concludes that this violence (in the depiction of blood, severed heads, and daggers) may be the reason that Artemisia's own daughter was repelled by her mother's art as a child. Here, Vreeland should be credited with the \\"invenzione\\" she bestows on her subject.Artists frequently reflect that art is a lonely lifestyle, and Vreeland portrays the conflict between living for one's art and living for love. Artemisia fairly often comes across as self-absorbed, and then is later stunned when her husband or daughter rejects her in some form. It is probably a realistic if not wholly sympathetic portrayal. Occasionally, Vreeland interferes with her character by putting modern thoughts into her seventeenth century characters' heads. (\\"Let them wonder about that for centuries,\\" Artemisia muses) Certainly a worthwhile read for art lovers, and also, I feel, a book that can generate discussion of the conflict of love and loyalty versus pursuit of one's art and independence. Excellent for book groups."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I really though I would love this book, I love art, love the premise. I'm a voracious reader, but rarely have read a book as poor as this. I kept reading, since I wanted it to improve, but finally gave it up 3/4 through, just didn't care to continue The dialog is really, very poorly written; and the writing is in a very strangely detached style, the &quot;Passion&quot; in the title is never achieved. Last one from this author I'll read."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, having read \\"M; The Life of Caravaggio\\" in the past. I was very disappointed. The writing level is extremely low. The characterization, dialogue, and description are around the level of a generic romance novel.Further, I recently read David Hockney's fascinating and convincing book \\"Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters\\" that demonstrates how optics were almost certainly used by artists of the time (and Artemisia is specifically sited with examples). Since the author of this Artemisia book seems unaware of the evidence (published in 2001), this book suffers from passionate descriptions (although not exacting) of foreshortening practice and other techniques that were unlikely to have been used by the artist. This poor research throws the authenticity of the whole book into serious question.If you're interested in painting, I would suggest you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I too wanted to love this book -- Artemisia Gentileschi is one of the most fascinating historical figures who is only recently getting &quot;her due.&quot; Vreeland has written a decent enough book, but suffers from making her Renaissance era character into a modern soap opera-worthy vixen.

I hope that she continues to write as she has a wonderful gift to share."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I admit to knowing nothing about the subject of this novel, Artemisia, the first woman painter admitted to the Academia dell'arte in Florence, other than the information gleaned from this book and the movie which deals with her earlier life. That being said, I admit to having no idea as to whether or not Vreeland successfully portrays the artist and the woman validly. I will say that the Artemeia who speaks in first person in this novel certainly knew what she wanted most in the world and took great pains to get it at the expense of many other people in her life. Vreeland uses her literary license to the extreme in conveying Artemesia's sensibilities as that of a modern day feminist even though she also does a fine job of exploring the focus of religion and God so prevalent during the historical period. Vreeland's Artemesia is an angry woman as is her right; she was raped by her father's collaborator and treated shabbily by her father who more or less chose his art over her respectability. But Vreeland uses this event, which is not related in the novel, to drive the character and at times her modern rationalizations do not match her 16th century inability to lash out about it. Even though Vreeland suggests that Artmesia realizes through her analysis of her father's actions regarding his family and how it fit in with his art, that her motivation was to manifest the beauty and ideal of God, the reader assumes that perhaps her quest for respect with regard to her rape drove her to create great art rather than her purer need to simply create.Whether or not Vreeland is correct in her portrayal matters not, \\"The Passion of Artemisia\\" should be of interest to anyone who likes the Renaissance and novels revolving about the great art of the time. Mainly a character study of the title character, the novel suceeds in chronologically detailing the motivation behind Artemesia's major works while weaving the story of the artist's life after the rape. Artemesia's relationship with Galileo is especially of interest, like Artemisia, Vreeland's Galileo is wise and too astute for his time--- The depiction is devoid of any real romantic alliance, Vreeland's Artemisia sadly misses key components with the important men in her life with which she attempts to replace, sometimes successfully, with her art. All in all, Vreeland's Artemesia is wrought with frustration and a bitter anger. True? I don't know. Anyone who created such beauty could not have been suffering so during that creative surge---perhaps afterwards. The author resolves this angst at the very end of the novel in a key scene invovling the artist and her father, but overall the reader does not get a real sense of satisfaction----instead one feels that the rushed ending should have been supplemented by some additional information where the fruits reaped by a mellower Artemesia are observed and nodded over.I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this book so I have no idea if an appendix exists which sheds some light on what Artemisia did with the rest of her life once she had rectified her feelings of her anger towards her father as the author suggests. The audio version also contains some filler music used to punctuate particularly sad scenes which I thought unnecessary and a bit overdone.This all said, I still liked the book and I recommend it to all who like novels about art and artists. Keep in mind however that the feminist tinge to the telling of this tale does not make it truly representative of the period and therefore suspends belief at times. I found myself wanting this modernly depicted Artemisia to have it out with her father, turn the page and get on with her life. Something tells me that in real life, this is exactly what she did do. However erroneously portrayed, Vreeland's character represents a strong woman with much angst on her plate whose life will keep you turning the pages and wanting to look up her lovely paintings to see what she really was all about."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Well, I guess Vreeland has proven that instead of pushing herself as an author, she's going to run her \\"inside the artist's life\\" book-concept into the ground. While I found \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" enjoyable, mostly because of the way she wrote about Dutch cottage-beliefs, this one is seriously lacking all around. Her writing is very poor, and her treatment of Artemisia's story is to take a woman who, in real life, was one tough cookie, and turn her into a washed out, maudlin weakling w/Daddy issues. For a much better treatment of Artemisia's story, I recommend \\"Artemisia: A Novel\\" by Alexandra Lapierre."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This book is very interesting.

Every day? Every hour? Him the only focus of my life? A painter or a wife. A wife or a painter. Which did I really want to be?\\"Susan Vreeland's new novel, The Passion of Artemisia chronicles the extraordinary life of Artemesia Gentileschi. It is a story of a painter who transformed Renaissance Italy with the beauty of her work. It is the story of a woman who had to make a choice. Fortunately for us Artemisia chose to be a painter -- the first woman to make a significant contribution to art history.At age eighteen, Artemisia Gentileschi finds herself humiliated in papal court for publicly accusing the man who raped her -- Agostino Tassi, her painting teacher. When even her father does not stand up for her, she knows she cannot stay in Rome and begs to have a marriage arranged for her. Her new husband, artist named Pietro Stiatessi, takes her to his native Florence, where he talent for painting blossoms and she becomes the first woman to be elected to the Accademia dell'Arte. But marriage clashes with Artemisia's newfound fame as a painter, and she beings a lifelong search to reconcile painting and motherhood, passion and genius.The Passion of Artemisia is the story of Gentileschi's struggle to find love, forgiveness, and wholeness through her art. It is at once a dramatic tale of love and a moving father-daughter story; it is the portrait of an astonishing woman that will captivate lovers of Gentileschi's paintings and anyone interested in the life of a woman who ignored the conventions of her day and dared to follow her heart.One can only wonder if we could have chosen as Gentileschi did. (Do we even know what our passion is?) Or would we decide not to choose, but instead try to do both -- to devote ourselves to our families and our passion as so many women of today seem to be doing? Each of us owns the answer. Artemisia Gentileschi's poignant story, as related in The Passion of Artemisia, can help us to find that answer -- if we chose to first as the question."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"A wonderful book that leads readers through the story of a pioneering female artist. A must read for both lovers of literature and those interested in a woman's struggle to express herself in a male dominated culture. Filled with great detail and imagination."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"The story was mildly interesting, but I have to agree with the reviewers who criticized the writing. In general, the dialogue and language sometimes fit the historical period and sometimes seemed to come straight out of a none too literate contemporary novel. &quot;Fine with me,&quot; Artemisia says to herself at one point.Vreeland thanks her editor for help given, but either Vreeland didn't take her editor's advice or her editor needs an editor. Vreeland ignores the rule that a possessive pronoun must precede a gerund (&quot;at the risk of you thinking&quot;); she uses &quot;like&quot; as a conjunction (&quot;like Father had written&quot;). The book is flawed with multiple instances of these two sins.Here's a double negative: &quot;I don't need but one.&quot;&quot;Kind of long&quot;: This is an error one should overcome by middle school. What's wrong with &quot;rather&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot;?&quot;It wasn't him that was making this difficult.&quot; &quot;It was me.&quot; &quot;Was it him or me?&quot;&quot;strikingly different than tradition because each of the three stories were the same height&quot;: &quot;than&quot; instead of &quot;from&quot; and an error in subject-verb agreement in the same sentence."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Simply stated, Vreeland has delivered a novel full of passion: for life, for love, for art, and for betrayal. The prose is lyrical, provocative, and moving. It opens with young Artemisia testifying in papal court during Italy's Renaissance after being raped by her father's artist friend. The betrayal of her father's friend pales in comparison with the plot set against her by her own father. To escape Rome and her sullied reputation, Artemisia enters a loveless arranged marriage with a fellow painter and moves to Florence, Italy's art center. We follow Artemisia through her tentative marriage, her celebrated birth of a child, and the success of a female artist unparalleled during her time. All of her success cannot make up for her attack, her father's ruination of her reputation, her husband's jealously, and her child's imperiousness.I stayed up all night to finish the book, as I could not put it down. It sweeps you into this woman's life and passion for her art, through which she learns the powers of rage and forgiveness. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This book is wonderful - Ms. Vreeland takes us back to a time and allows us to live and feel the struggles and joys of a women in the early 17th century.

The changes and knowledge gained since that time is great - but its comforting that art is still a powerful and beautiful tool to express all the emotions that come from ones journey through life.

In her teens she was raped by a friend of her father, setting her painting on a course that showed not only Rome and Italy, but a world of pain as well as the strength she emanated. Her paintings wreak havoc on the senses. Her women are portrayed as independent and strong, something unheard of in this period. She was the first woman to be recognized in the male dominated world of art.Artemisia spends time with Galileo, an apt pupil to his musings on the theory that the Earth orbits around the sun, a blasphemous idea at the time, for which Galileo was placed under house arrest. He found her to have a meditative mind with a different perspective. She was a woman with vision and was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in Florence, an unprecedented happening for a female painter.This book is beautifully written. It is a story of healing and forgiveness. Her relationships with her father, daughter and even the husband that is so often absent are developed to perfection.

Frequently, I very solipsically found myself wondering why we have to spend so much time dealing with ugliness and unpleasantries in our beautiful world. Alas, it's all selfish fantasy; harsh reality is unfortunately the arena in which our ultimate humanity must be won.

That may be because the author includes NO details. Having just read Oscar and Lucinda (a book which I also did not love) I feel that I have fully covered the detail spectrum. Oscar and Lucinda provided too much, this book provides too little. The characters in this story are so one dimensional, the relationships between the characters are not developed at all- especially the relationship between Artemisia and her husband. Artemisia's daughter struck me as a spoiled brat. I also found it interesting that in reality Artemisia's daughter became a painter, since they place so much emphasis on the fact that she did not take to painting.

She has been raped by her painting teacher, a friend of her father's, but keeps the secret of the outrage because he tells her he loves her and promises to marry her.Artemisia's father discovers the truth and files charges against Agostino Tassi. The young girl finds herself a participant in a papal court. Her cruel treatment at the hands of the court, the realization that her father's actions are not fueled by concern for her, but by his own selfish motives, and the release of her abuser, lead Artemisia to accept an arranged marriage to a stranger. However, she is grateful to leave Rome and go with her new husband to Florence, a city rich in artistic heritage.Artemisia attempts to follow her passion - her painting - while hoping that she can also finally find the kind of love that holds no betrayal or pain. But is there room for both in her life? And what will be the cost if she follows her dream?THE PASSION OF ARTEMISIA is another masterpiece painted from the heart of its author, Susan Vreeland. Like GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE, Susan's previous novel, the reader is pulled into the dimness of the past and the existence of a world long gone. Susan breathes life into the shadows and brings Artemisia and those around her into vibrant and living color.Reading a novel penned by this great talent is like stepping out of one existence into another.

I'm truly amazed that it was published and is a best seller. The grammar is atrocious. The writing is over-wrought and reads like a dime- store romance. The plot is contrived, historically inaccurate, and thinly researched.

It tells the story of post-Renaissance painter Artemisia Gentileschi&#65533;s life with a balanced mixture of fact and fiction. The author, Susan Vreeland, reveals this magnificently talented and complex woman with such ease, it is as though she were there with Artemisia as the events of her life unraveled. Set in cities of Italy and England, this story gives the factual sequence of events in her life and the rollercoaster of pain and ecstasy she must have felt throughout her many triumphs and tragedies. Beginning in Rome, the artist&#65533;s birthplace and also the site of her infamously horrible rape and degrading trial, the story then continues throughout Italy as Artemisia makes her way into the hearts of Italy&#65533;s highest nobility and even the great Galileo Galilei, never letting her crumbling marriage of convenience or society&#65533;s sexual bias discourage her from achieving her dreams. The novel ends in England, where the artist is reunited with her aging father, renowned painter Orazio Gentileschi, and a lasting peace between them may finally be realized after years of bad blood. This is the story of a true heroine, a woman who was not willing to let anybody or anything come between her and her dream. Vreeland uses her extraordinary talents to portray her subject as someone both easily related to and hard to forget. Artemisia truly inspires with her courage and her ability to continually pick herself up after she faces many knock-downs. The Passion of Artemisia is full of touching moments that linger in the reader&#65533;s mind.

Then there's a bit with her dad who was the reason she was tortured by the Inquisition and I couldn't believe any of it would actually happen. Completely unsatisfying for me."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I CAN'T BELIEVE that I actually read this whole thing. As an Art History major (undergrad & grad), I found this story totally insulting. I love historical fiction (a la Mary Renault), but this drippy tale has me thinking that most readers are historic, linguistic and cultural morons."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"When I attended the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit, my favorite times where spent exploring the Detroit Institute of Arts. One semester I took a class on Women Artists and I clearly remember how captivated I was by the story of Artemesia Gentileschi. She was such a strong and heroic woman and immensely talent artist. She was so far ahead of her time. I was forever moved when I visited the DIA and saw her masterpiece &quot;Judith and Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes&quot;. Now, almost twenty years later, I discover this book, which describes not just Artemesia's life, but tells me exactly what went into one of my favorite masterpieces! Susan Vreeland has done an incredible job of painting a picture of another age. Her words depict the life of this incredible woman artist in the same way that Artemsia captured essence the subjects of her artwork."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Such a letdown after Girl in Hyacinth Blue. This book has none of Girl's poetry or soul. For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre. And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel. It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book. It's not written from the heart."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I'm not sure I would say this book is full of passion, but certainly the writer has concerned herself with Artemisia's passion for art, and in that, the descriptions and feelings are endless and beautiful. The story is a good one, it flows beautifully into a reality you can absorb, and it is at times both intense and painfully shallow. Artemisia is not just an artist, she is a woman, a mother, a daughter, a person with deep insights and dark emotions. I think the author does a superb job of keeping the reader spellbound with this easy flowing story, and of joining both reader and characters together in an intricately weaved and artfully told environment. I could read it again, it's the kind of book you feel as though you could always learn something new from. There were parts I thought I should stop and write down, sentences and thoughts so beautifully phrased I wanted to preserve them. But I had borrowed the book, and an anxious next-reader was waiting. Read this book. It's excellent."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"There were enough parts of this book to make me want to read to the end (exploration of an artist's thought processes, street scenes of Italy, the very fact that the character was the first woman admitted to the Florentine academy. Really enjoyed the side story of Graziela and thought that struggle between confinement and freedom, religious sacrafice and artistic freedom could be a book all of its own.) I found this writing detached and cool and very unpassionate. The dialogue was especially weak and it didn't help that it was all in modern vernacular overlaid on top of 1615 Italy."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Until I read this book, I had never heard of Artemisia Gentileschi. I picked it up because, flipping through it, Susan Vreeland's style seemed similar to Tracy Chevalier's (&lt;u>Girl With A Pearl Earring&lt;/u> - and other novels), whose books I devoured, as I did &lt;u>The Passion of Artemisia&lt;/u>. Her story is riveting, from the strength of her convictions and spirit in the rape trial, through her trials with her father and then Pierantonio, her subsequent noteriety and patronage of the Medici family, and how she learned from her father, then made his style her own - as well as her interpretations of traditional themes. I searched out some of her paintings on Google and was so completely blown away I printed 4 of them and pinned them to my bulletin board at work. I've already ordered a framed print of two of her Judith works.I'm now reading &lt;u>Artemisia&lt;/u> by Alexandra LaPierre, who did exhaustive research in Italy and through historical documents to piece together the details of her life. As good as Susanna Vreeland's book is (and it's very good), it's a 5th grade history book compared to &lt;u>Artemisa&lt;/u>, which is riveting in its details and their researched truths. But that's a different review!If you want an introduction to an amazing woman, born before her time, &lt;u>The Passion of Artemesia&lt;/u> is a good place to begin."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I enjoyed the author's first novel and was interested in the artist Artemisia Gentileschi, so this seemed like a natural. I did enjoy the book but was distracted by how much the action deviated from what I actually knew about the artist's life. I think I might have enjoyed it more if it had been pure fiction instead of purportin to be about Artemisia.That said, the novel itself is well written and enjoyable, delving into the psyche of the emotionally scarred artist as she explores artistic themes and tries to deal with the men in her life.Not a stunner but perhaps an entertaining introduction to a fascinating artist."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I have never heard of Artemisia before and now that I have read this book, I am very intrigued by this historical woman artist! This book will captivate you from the first page to the last. It is a keeper as well!Artemisia stands on trial in Rome after she accuses a man of raping her. It turns out that it was her reputation and life that was ruined ~~ so her father, instead of defending her, married her off to a painter from Florence and sent her home with him. And that is just the beginning of the story.With flair and careful descriptions, Vreeland writes of a woman struggling to find her calling as an artist, wife, daughter and mother. Throughout Artemisia's life, she is always struggling internally with her father's betrayal and it shows in her painting and relationship with her daughter. It shows in her relationships with men and other people, as well as with her father.The descriptions Vreeland crafted in this book draws you in ~~ you can't help but look at colors differently now. She does a wonderful job of painting a world of words for the reader ~~ and gives the reader a new appreciation of life and art and love. This is a book that no one should ever ignore ~~ it speaks so vividly to the spirit. And you can relate so well with Artemisia ~~ she is everywoman struggling against the mores of society, trying to carve her own niche in life.This is a keeper.7-31-03"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"If you know anything about Artemisia Gentileschi, you'll know she was a genius, a woman who broke all barriers of gender to do what she loved to do - paint. Susan Vreeland captures this woman's passion in this book, and makes it very clear that in order to paint, it must be your lifeblood. She writes with such a startling love for art and painting that you can hear the pigments being ground, feel the brushes between your fingers. Artemisia has an excellent speech to her daughter, Palmira, late in her book, about the intensity and empathy that painting requires. It is, by far, the strongest point in the novel and it should be read simply for that scene.When I first began reading _The Passion of Artemisia_, I found that it moved entirely too fast. I got comfortable with one situation before I found it moved to another, and years would pass so quickly I would get lost. Some would call it short but sweet. I call it disappointing. Not because it was too fast - I later discovered that the pace was more decent than I previously believed - but because I loved the writing and the world of the novel so much that I wanted to see more, feel more, read more. I felt as though Vreeland skimped out. However, it thankfully is not too wordy - and the words that Vreeland does use all seemed to be hand-picked for effectiveness.Despite the fast pacing, it isn't -too- quick. It's quick and intense and by the time you're done you don't quite feel like you've missed anything. It moves along almost with the swiftness of a movie (in fact, I think this version would make an excellent film - I saw _Artemisia_, a critically acclaimed French film, before I read this and it was wonderful, but the two stories are very different and focus on different periods of her life). I just wish the book were longer so I had more of a chance to savor the eccentric beauty and passion of the painting world that I got a taste of in the narrative.The other slight problem I have with _Passion_ is that Artemisia's voice felt too modern. In some ways it was effective, but it was difficult to grasp the fact that this was a woman living hundreds of years ago. The historical details are all accurate, there aren't any anachronisms. The voice merely did not seem aged or perhaps refined enough. It doesn't take anything away from the novel, however. It may even enhance it - making the reader more able to understand and empathize with her.Slight problems aside, I highly recommend _The Passion of Artemisia_. I'm sure you'll wish it were longer, too. Also - I would recommend that when you read it, you have either a book or an online gallery of Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings, to understand what's being described in the novel. It completely enriches the experience."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Having read The Forest Lover some time ago, I enjoyed reading the Susan Vreeland novel and didn't think twice before picking up The Passion of Artemisia. This novel is about the painter Artemisia Gentileschi and her masterpiece work of art called Judith. With a beautifully described backdrop of post-Renaissance Italy, we read about her humiliating trial against her rapist, her father's assistant Agostino Tassi, and the cruel judgments and prejudices she suffers from men and women alike. No one believes that she had been raped, instead choose to think that she had gone to bed with him willingly. After the very unfair outcome of the trial, Artemisia embarks on a journey that begins with the thought-provoking advice from an enigmatic nun to her arranged marriage to a fellow artist. We see her struggle as she tries to be taken seriously as a gifted female painter, which pays off when she becomes the first woman elected to Florence's Accademia dell' Arte. There are various twists throughout the novel.I love the prose used in this novel. It has the feel of Italy during the seventeenth century. The things Artemisia goes through as a woman spoke to me. In this day and age, women endure things not unlike the humiliations the artist experiences. The scene in which she is examined by two midwives while everyone in court looks on through a very thin curtain that barely covers the procedure is gruesome. The double standards she experiences are horrible to the max. I love the way the author describes, in first-person narrative from Artemisia's POV, how the artist vented her impotence, anger and frustration while creating the Judith painting. I wish the author had explored Artemisia's feelings during the process of the painting a bit more though. The Passion of Artemisia is wonderful, almost as great as The Forest Lover. The one thing I find fault here is that Artemisia's narrative falls flat during the particularly gruesome scenes. Further description of her feelings of anger and disbelief during the verdict would have been nice. Other than that, I enjoyed this beautiful novel and I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"My 20 year old granddaughter is, has always been, a reader. Currently she is in college, working 20 hours a week, and studying for an internship, but she continues to read for pleasure. She and I had both read THE PASSION OF ARTEMISIA but I loaned it out and it never came back to me, so when she wanted to read it again I ordered the paperback from Amazon."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"As I read The Passion of Artemisia, by Susan Vreeland, I realized how fortunate I am to live in this era. Artemisia, for me, depicts a view of a woman ahead of her time. She is a victim of a kind of and level of chauvinism that we, in this day and age, cannot possibly imagine. From simply being considered the property of her father, then of her husband, a woman is not her own person, in charge of her destiny. Artemisia is unlike other women of her time, and trying to raise a headstrong daughter to be more enlighted. She comes to the realization toward the end of the book that she has become like her father, choosing art over her child, but makes an effort to change it. This is a chance to experience old world Italy, a culture drenched in the arts, when the world valued talent. It is an escape."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"First let me say I loved Girl In Hyacinth Blue and was eagerly awaiting Susan Vreeland's next novel. The Passion of Artemisia was enormously disappointing. The writing was poor, the plot was trite and the book was overflowing with present day political correctness. I know that this was loosely based on fact but it could have been much better. I am tired of books with heroine as victim. The author took lots of liberties with the truth. According to one source I read the real Artemisia had sons yet to make this a feminist novel you cant have her having a positive relationship with a male. I am sick of stories of women done wrong by men.Perhaps it is time for women to grow up."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This book is very differente from Vreeland's first book and her writing skills are much more evident in The Passions of Artemisa. I loved both books very much. Art is normally not a topic I am drawn to, but both her books are really captivating, centered around works of art. I am so enthralled by the characters in the book, I just couldn't put it down. I was sad and happy and sad again reading this book - it is very emotional and makes one contemplate what life was like in those times. Espcially for women. A wonderfully pleasureable book."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I enjoyed this book. I'll read anything by author Susan Vreeland, after having read a couple of her books and been drawn into her stories fully during that time.

My undergraduate career was focused in Art History and concentrated in Italian Renaissance works, so I am well knowledgeable about Artemisia and her influences. I when in to the book energized because from my research Artemisia's life is an amazing story for women. However, the lack of plot and inaccurate information left the last 300 pages painful to read, but I hoped each chapter would meet my expectations.Save your time and money, better artistic reads are \\"The DaVinic Code\\" or \\"M; The Life of Caravaggio\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I read this while in Florence and it brought art and history alive for me.

Though it takes place in the early 1600's, women in general still face some of the same ridicule and suspicions.

An artist treated like a cow by her dad, hometown, and her husband makes joyous art and is in real life, the 1st woman accepted into Florence's Art Academy."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several people. Artemisia is a real painter in renaissance Italy but the story is fictional. Susan Vreeland really combines the real aspects of Artemisia's life with the fiction beautifully. This book had me researching Artemisia to see her paintings. You can find them on-line by doing a simple search. It is interesting to see the paintings that has been described in the book."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Like many, before reading this book I had never before heard of of the post-Renaissance painter Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653). Although this book is a fictional account of Artemisia's life, important historical references are accurate. For example, the trial record and Artemisia's associations with Galileo, Cosimo de' Medici II and Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger are documented in art histories. Likewise, all paintings referred to in the book are actual works of Artemisia's. As the author points out at the beginning of the book, \\"Like a painter who clothes figures from centuries earlier in the garb of his or her own time, so have I sought to render Artemisia Gentileschi in a way meaningful to us three and half centuries later, yet concordant with the soul and passions of the real Artemisia Gentileschi...\\"In short, as a work of fiction about a historical person, Susan Vreeland does a wonderful job. If you enjoyed Susan Vreeland's novel Girl in Hyacinth Blue, you will surely like this one."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This was my first book by this author. I listened to the audio version which is nicely perfomed by a voice actor that is adept in pronouncing the Italian names. I enjoyed learning about the struggles of a talented female artist in the post - Renaissance period. The story moves along with great detail of the art and architecture of the time, as well as the food and clothing. I love all things Italian and parts of the book are almost like a travelogue. The author provides us with a lot of emotional investment in Artemisia, but the other people have much less character development."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"\\"The Passion of Artemisia\\" is the fictional account of the life of the real-life post-Renaissance painter Artemisia Gentileschi. The story begins at the time of the well-publicized trial in which Artemisia accuses her Father's painting partner of raping her. This event is a pivotal moment in Artemisia's life, because as a result of this trial, she must flee Rome due to the disgrace that the trial brings. Her Father arranges a marriage for her with a mediocre painter named Pietro Stiattesi of Florence. Things go well at first for the marriage, and the pair have a daughter together. Eventually, though, Artemisia's talent overshadows that of her husband, and puts a strain on the relationship. Her painting skill and her adaptability as an artist lead her to work for many patrons in many cities all over Italy, and the novel follows her journey to these many destinations, and describes the way in which she came to create many of her paintings.I found this story very inspiring, as Artemisia had to overcome so many difficulties in her life. She was really quite ahead of her time, as she had to deal with the issue of juggling marriage, motherhood and career. She also had a very complex relationship with her Father, whom she loved very much, but also harbored a lifelong disappointment with due to the fact that he never really stood up for her during the rape trial. She was the first woman to be accepted in to the presitigous Accedemia dell'Arte, which was quite an achievement in her time. She had to make some difficult choices in her life, and eventually came to a level of acceptance that she could not have it all. Certain things had to be sacrificed because her art always came first.Susan Vreeland has quickly become one of my favorite contemporary authors. She is really able to put herself in the place of the artist she is writing about, and really brings her/him to life. I found it helpful to reference the author's website while reading this novel, as she has an image gallery of the paintings that are written about.This book was absolutely beautiful, and I found myself reading it very slowly at the end, as I did not want to leave the world of Artemisia. Very enjoyable and highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Although this novel has a lot of wonderful qualities, in the end I was disappointed in it. Vreeland does a terrific job evoking early 17th century Italy and it was interesting to read how Artemisia went about deciding just how she wanted to paint a particular subject-which moment in time she wanted to capture.However, the novel was quite somber and I couldn't help but hope the real Artemisia had a little more happiness than this fictional one seems to have experienced. Even though the author tried to convey the absolute joy Artemisia sometimes experienced in her painting, I still felt the book was pretty joyless and heavy-handed. The main objection I have to the book, though, is the way the author mixed fact and fiction. I enjoy well-researched historical fiction, and I am used to authors filling in gaps in history with their own best guesses. After reading the author interview in the back of this book, though, I got the feeling that Vreeland wanted to tell a particular story, and as long as Artemisia's story meshed with the one Vreeland wanted to tell, fine, but where the historical record didn't fit, Vreeland chose to ignore the truth to advance her own story. She is very upfront in admitting this, but in the end I think it would have been better to have created a fictional story that may have been loosely inspired by Artemesia's own story, OR, written a novel hewing as closely as possible to the facts and only creating what needed to be invented. In the end, I certainly didn't feel I knew the \\"real\\" Artemisia at all.I will add that I chose this book for my book discussion group and most of the members enjoyed it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Everytime I read this book I want to pick up my brush and loose myself in painting as Vreeland describes Artemisia doing. This book is about that passion when one is driven by the smell of turpentine, the shimmering brilliance of color, and the image that slowly creeps upon the canvas.If anyone wants a complete historical view of Artemisia then don't get a fictional story. Check out:www.artemisia-gentileschi.com/index.html. There are great sites and books to check her work. If you want to know about the passion that drives an artist, then loose yourself in this book and picture yourself at this time, doing what Artemisia did.Thank Goodness I don't read a book with a red pen."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"There are two recent novels about the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of a prominent artist, who became an artist in her own right. I chose to read The Passion of Artemisia by Susan Vreeland, the author of The Girl in Hyacinth Blue, also set in the rarified world of artists. Early in the 17th Century, men dominated the art world, painting in the Baroque style, with emphasis on light and shadow. Artemisia is notable for her memorable and complicated paintings, but even more infamous for taking her father's best friend, Agostino Tassi, to court, charging him with rape. Unfortunately the male-dominated court of the Inquisition put her on trial and it was her reputation that suffered.Vreeland's prose acquires the nuanced perspective of the artist and her personal and imaginative perspective of the world around her. The author captures details that carry the ring of truth, as seen through Artemisia's eyes: \\"A dusty beam from a high window fell on his hands and lightened the fold of his sleeve to lavender.\\" Another: \\"...a small man swathed in deep purple was sharpening his quills with a knife, letting the shavings fall to the floor.\\" Simple observations, really, but I immediately trusted Vreeland to portray the story with a visual perspective.In society at the time, successful artists were revered, especially when favored by Church patrons who were intent upon establishing the Church of Rome as a jewel in the eyes of a world beset by heresy. In accusing Tassi of rape, Artemisia took on the male hierarchical establishment and the ponderous weight of the Church, but she refused to dishonor herself and back down, even when tortured by her Inquisitors. Even witnesses were fodder for torture in trials, in order to ascertain truthfulness and expose liars. Circumstances were complicated by the fact that Agostino Tassi was Artemisia's father's best friend and the two often collaborated on projects, Tassi painting the architecture and Orazio the human figures.After the trial, Artemisia was married quietly to an obscure painter and moved to Florence, where she and her new husband painted together. This young woman couldn't exist in the narrow space society allowed, driven to create her own interpretations of historical, predominantly Biblical, subjects. Artemisia found a patron willing to sponsor her, and left Florence with her young daughter, leaving her husband on his own. An extraordinary and talented woman, Artemisia was an aberration in the society that formed her. But Vreeland's novel ultimately disappoints, following Artemisia's tumultuous life with no well-planned ending to the story. All the energy is in the first few chapters, the drama of the rape trial and the undeniable drive to live as an artist. By the ending, the \\"Passion of Artemisia\\" seems to have dissipated..."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and an entertaining story.This is not a biography, but rather a story (that probably takes many liberties with the truth) of a 17th century Italian woman who defies society to become an admired painter.I don't understand why some reviewers are quibbling about the exact facts in this woman's life. If you are a serious art historian, you would probably dismiss this book as being too &quot;flimsy&quot;, but I feel most readers would just enjoy it. The success of a good book is wanting to learn more about the subject. After reading this book, I am interested in finding out more about this Renaissance woman."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"After reading Girl In Hyacinth Blue I eagerly awaited this novel and I was not disappointed. Artemisia is born with a passion to paint and she never lets anything destroy her passion. She is raped at 17 by a friend of her fathers and after much public humiliation she is married off at 18 to Pietro and moves to Florence. She is wary of placing to much faith in Pietro after all the hurt she has already had in her young life. She continues to paint and eventually becomes the first woman to be selected for the accademia. Her husband is not and thus begins the growing distance between them. This story covers 20 years in the life of Artemisia. From a young woman, to a wife and mother, to a gifted painter and finally in the end she discovers the woman she really is inside.I enjoyed this book because it is historical fiction. If it were anything else it would have problems but, it is not. It is fiction, just the story of a strong young woman during a time when woman were basically to be seen and not heard. Artemisia made herself heard and was able to be proud of herself. This reminded me alot of Pope Joan. Another work of fiction but, the story of another woman with very strong convictions. Life is full of stories and this is how learn. To remind ourselves of the possibilities that life offers each of us."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I was COMPLETELY DISSAPPOINTED with this book. The author had the opportunity to write an incredible novel with deep characters, historic value and a taste of what it would have been like to be a powerful woman in that time period. The characters were shallow, the description of the countries from Rome to Venice were disappointing. Don't buy it...It's closer to a...dime store novel than anything I've read in years and it cost 21.00"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Vreeland's character of Artemisia brings to life a 400 year old story, revising the myth surrounding women in art. Here is a strong woman full of passion, overcoming adversity to fulfill her basic necessity: the need to paint. Her visions were innovative, and her will unbreakable. Vreeland captures the harsh reality of the patriarchy and displays humanity at its finest and its worst. It is under this construct that Artemisia struggled, and we struggle today, with the constant purgatory of the artist versus Woolf's \\"angel in the house\\". This book is a worthy historical account written in the truest emotions of fiction. Brava, Susan Vreeland."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"If I'd never read Girl in Hyacinth Blue I wouldn't know what this story doesn't have. It doesn't have the depth and fascinating details of Vreeland's Blue. But, it does have a good story, and one that made me want to know more about the non-fictional Artemesia. The stories behind the paintings were intriguing, and enough to keep my interest. I hope there are more artist books to come."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Susan Vreeland paints a detailed picture of some of the urban and artistic aspects the seventeenth century Italy. I very much enjoyed the art historical details of the making of pigments, hiring the models, the artistic rivalry and the careful look at some of the contemporary painting and sculpture in Rome, Florence and Genoa. Some of the characters are well sketched and ring very true, especially Artemesia's daughter. Enjoy it. A few illustrations would have been a plus."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book and was not disappointed. It may have had a few faults as some other reviewers have mentioned, but none took away from the story or my enjoyment of it. Some have said that they found the fact that it was written in first person narrative inappropriate and distracting; I found it refreshing and it allowed me to feel like Artemisia was talking directly to me. I also agree that some of the language may have been inappropriate for the time period of the story, but the story was still clearly expressed and understood.Most importantly, I was able to feel Artemisia's passion for her painting. Some of the other descriptions and conversations may have been superficial, but the description of the art, the act of painting and Artemisia's yearning to paint was deep and moving. Her desire to paint brought her ultimate happiness and deep pain at the same time. The colors were vivid and clear and I felt like I was seeing the beauty in the art with her. When I finished the book, I immediately looked up some of her art on the internet just to be able to witness it with my own eyes.I also especially enjoyed Artemisia's relationship with Graziela. It was one filled with unconditional love and overwhelming wisdom. Graziela's words were touching and filled with a beauty that I can only wish to posess.I definitely recommend this book. It is quick and easy to read. Its title most certainly reflects the true depth and expression of this talented painter."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This novel is a good read. I enjoyed the progress, both artistic and growth as a human being, that Artemisia displayed throughout the novel. The prose is simple, and the few Italian words and phrases sprinkled throughout the story are neither distracting nor does it reduce the characters to stereotypes. I was a bit disappointed that the author did not include more of the real Artemisia in this story (for example, she had 4 children, not 1). I also found that the novel was a little \\"too modern\\" for the era it depicts. However, it is a novel, not a biography or a serious study of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi. Keep that in mind as you read it and the historical inaccuracies will bother you less."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Although this novel is about a fascinating woman in history who shone among the women of her generation, this book lacks a richness in character development."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"It was surprising to find, after reading the Passionof Artemisia, that some online reviewers wereunhappy with the novel. Criticism ranged from \\"toosimplistic\\", to \\"too modern in style and text\\". Somefelt that Vreeland made Artemisia into too strong of acharacter - far bolder and having more of a feministspirit than would have been feasible in apost-Renaissance era.But the very things that garnered complaints are whatI felt were strong points.Yes, the language was far from archaic, hardly whatone would imagine Galileo and his ilk to utter, yetperiod prose would have been too heavy handed, toomuch to trudge through. The average reader wants toenjoy a verbose vocabulary, but does not want to beburdened with having to reach for a trusty Webster'swhen coming across numerous words no longer spoken inthe present day. The language was not so much overlysimple as it was in layman's terms. Yet sophisticationwas far from lacking and the sentences managed tostream together in a visual and lyrical way. We felt,saw, and breathed as Artemisia, and also visualizedher art through the careful placement of words. Isthat not the objective of the writer?Perhaps Artemisia was portrayed with every strength ofa modern woman, possessing a reserved out-spokeness.In reality, she may never have been so bold, but woulda present day reader, used to the current structure ofsociety comprehend the subtle strands that apost-Renaissance might take, and the scandal thosesimple gestures would cause. Vreeland broughtArtemisia to a level that we could understand...astruggling artist, a despairing wife, a disappointedmother. Triumphs and tribulations that crossgenerations and make the painter more vivid andthree-dimensional.It was this sense of realness that appealed to me themost. The sense that Artemisia was tangible. The artthe Artemisia was surrounded by, her own and the worksof others, was portrayed in such detail that thereader could share the experience. From page 64 \\" Istood transfixed before Masaccio's Expulsion of Adamand Eve from Eden. In a bleak, brown setting withoutany hint of a garden, Adam covered his bowed face withhis hands. Eve's eyes were wounded hollows nearlysqueezed shut, and her open mouth uttered an anguishedcry that echoed through time and resounded in myheart. The pathos of their shame moved me so that mylegs were weak. I held onto the stone balustrade.Between Eve and me, I felt no gulf of centuries\\".The Passion of Artemisia may not prove to be a novelthat will gain accolades or top the bestseller lists,but it tells a poignant story of a dreamer andvisionary, a woman with strength and sensitivity. Itis an impressionable (albeit fictitious) look into theheart of an artist struggling against the constraintsof her time."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"10 to 1 you've never even heard of Artemesia Gentileschi (I hadn't), the female Renaissance painter. Regrettably, after reading Susan Vreeland's novel/biography, you're probably not going to be any more knowledgable.The best historical novels give you a good grasp of both the differences and the similarities of the situations people faced back then. Artemesia's world, however, is more like a Renn faire than the actual Renaissance - a thin veneer of quaint history, overshadowed by an effort to make Artemesia a thoroughly modern, feminist heroine. Unfortunately, this effectively trivializes the struggles she faces as a female artist in a decidedly misogynistic time. After a promising first chapter, in which she is tortured and villainized at the trial of her former teacher and rapist, the omnipresent Church seems to disappear. At one point, Artemesia even blithely asserts that she sees the Bible merely as a source of good stories, a view that I would think any reasonably sensible Renaissance woman, much less one who's already found herself on the wrong side of the Inquisition, would be a little more discreet about disclosing. Her truly monumental achievement, becoming the first woman admitted to the Accademia dell'Arte in Florence, is likewise glossed over and eventually forgotten, as she leaves her husband and moves to Genoa with her young daughter. Meanwhile, the few tantalizing hints that are dropped never materialize into anything, like the prospect of an affair with Galileo himself.In fact, Vreeland's story is more about a young working mother obsessed with her career than about art, the Italian Renaissance, or female artists. In trying to make Artemesia a character modern readers can empathize with, she's turned a woman who was surely fascinating and complex into someone whose story we've all heard before."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I found this to be a nice easy read with characters that held my attention, and a story that was interesting enough to make me want to find out more about Artemisia and her life. I would have liked a more in depth look at Artemisia and her husband, their relationship, and his relationship with his daughter.Although this was not an &quot;exciting Page-turner&quot;, it did hold my attention, and I cared about the people in the story. I really enjoyed the descriptions and the interpretations of Artemisia's paintings, Italy, and the art of the times, and I found myself looking up her paintings on line so that I could see for myself what she wanted so badly to express in her art.I am very glad that I read this story, and look forward to reading her other book, Girl in Hayicinth Blue, as I haven't yet had the pleasure.Enjoy,Debbi"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Two stars for giving Artemisia some attention...and a redeeming conclusion. I Enjoyed the girl in hyacinth blue...the story and format. If a book were to be measured by the number of times you need a dictionary I was disappointed that there was no need for one. It kind of reminded me of books I'd take out of the libary in junior high. O but this is about Artemisia...Okay I did have my dictionary at hand and I appreciated that... but the lack of dimension...of depth...made one who I would imagine to have substance...flat. Like a hobbyist painter there was an obviouslack of creativity with words. My brain bored by the lack of effort needed to grasp significance of what was being said. I.e. no afterthought...no I take that back- I will look into the life of Artemisia with heightened interest. So I need to be appreciative that this book was written to serve as inspiration to search out something with substance. I am sure for folks who are satisfied with a veneer- as opposed to a multi glazed production which reveals layers of thought, understanding complexities ,utilizing genius,expressing true passion,undergoing pain and emotional torment and still functioning, and originality-this piece of fiction is entertaining...but don't look for enlightenment as to what it could have been to be a women in the 1600's who was humiliated yet not crushed. Rather she used her experience as a means to depict the nuance of emotion. If life were as simple as this bookthere would be no need for writers to share the journey by echoing our voice."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This intriguing novel brings to life Artemisia Gentileschi's tragic ordeal and leaves us reeling at the injustice. The artistry with which Vreeland melds the real-life tragedy with the rage of Artemisia's incomparable \\"Judith\\" spins a gripping, fascinating story.Despite Artemesia's anachronistically feminist ideas (as depicted in this novel) her unjust plight can't fail to enlist the reader's sympathies and outrage. Her quest for wholeness sweeps us along in this enthralling tale of art and passion.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"In this work of historical fiction, susan Vreeland paints a vibrant portrait (pun intended) of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, an actual 17th-century woman painter in Italy. Raped by her father's friend Agostino Tassi, who is also her painting tutor, Artemisia is humiliated and her reputation in ruins when Tassi is all but exonerated in the crime. To escape Rome and its cruelty, she arranges to marry Pietro Stiattesi, a Florentine painter. In Florence, Artemisia realizes success in her art, painting biblical figures from a uniquely feminine perspective, and becomes the first woman accepted into Florence's Accademia dell'Arte. However, from her jealous husband Pietro, who has not found equal success in his art, she earns only resentment.This was a relatively quick read which inspired me to learn more about Artemisia and her contemporaries, and I look forward to trying more of Vreeland's historical works."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I had studied Artemisia in a Women's Art History class in college, so I had some idea about her biography. And I think Vreeland did an amazing job of stringing out a believable tale of what her life was really like. This book really captured the essence of &quot;Judith&quot; and offered a believable account of what Artemisia must have been thinking when she painted it. It's the only Susan Vreeland book I've read (and the least known, unfortunately!), and I can't wait to read another! I couldn't put this one down!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I much prefered this novel to the Girl In Hyacinth Blue, though I stayed up all night reading it, too. I had seen a movie about Artemesia, and had learned a bit more about her through articles and my Italian study, so I really enjoyed this novel version of her life. Of course, having studied Italian, there are some things in the book that are implausible, but fun.. the hubby going to see the 'calcio', an important part of non-high Italian culture today, but 200+ years before the game was invented. Good to have a sense of humor about things."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"As the best-selling author of GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE, Susan Vreeland once again stuns readers with a lyrical depiction of a woman destined to follow her artistic dreams. As an early seventeenth century artist under the tutelage of her artist father, Orazio Gentileschi, Artemisia experiences tremendous humiliation as she faces her rapist in papal court. Though Agostino Tassi, a colleague of Orazio&#65533;s, had raped Artemisia, she is forced to endure a degrading public examination to prove her accusations. With her ruined reputation, Artemisia leaves Rome to wed Pietro Stiattesi and move to Florence.Together, Pietro and Artemisia indulge in the art of painting, but unfortunately for Pietro, it is Artemisia who gets the most recognition, first with a commission from the nephew of the famous Michelangelo, and later from Cosimo de Medici. Though Artemisia and Pietro have a daughter, Palmira, Pietro becomes resentful when Artemisia gains admission to the Accademia dell&#65533; Arte del Disegno before he does.The all-encompassing descriptive prose leads the reader back into seventeenth century Italy, following Artemisia and her daughter as they journey to Genoa, Venice, and come full circle back to Rome. With the incredible artistic backdrop of the timeless treasures of these cities, the author often makes a religious connection to the magnificent works depicted there.And for anyone who ever wanted an eyewitness view into an artist&#65533;s soul, this novel is the perfect venue. Even a non-artist can begin to understand the depth of emotion and lifetime experiences that go into an artist&#65533;s creativity. Most enduring though, is Artemisia&#65533;s triumph in a time when women were treated in a most inferior manner."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I had never heard of Artemisia Gentileschi until I opened this book. I realize that it is a fictitious account of her life, but it made for an interesting read.Set in the 17th century, the story opens with Artemisia having been raped by her father's assistant, Agostino Tassi. Her father has accused him of this rape and sets into motion a trial that will continue to haunt Artemisia for the rest of her days. The rapist is released and Artemisia, her reputation ruined, is forced into an arranged marriage.She begins to paint her collection, most notably her \\"Judith\\" collection. Her art becomes famous with the most renowned people of her day. She portrays the women in her paintings as strong and independent, retribution being the key. I found Vreeland's account of how the paintings came about and why to be extremely interesting. Artemisia soon becomes the first woman to be accepted into the Academy of Sciences in Florence and this causes a rift in her marriage.The people along the way are also wonderful characters brought to life, especially Graziela who is wise beyond her years and helps to put things into perspective for Artemisia. Her passion for painting brought her the utmost joy and pain. A lesson not lost on Artemisia.I was so fascinated by Artemisia's story that I looked on the internet for her paintings and was not disappointed. I discovered a few inconsistencies in the story and the real life of this painter, but overall I think the book is worth the read.Another book similar in theme to this one is Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"In &quot;The Passion of Artemisia,&quot; Susan Vreeland does a great job providing her readers with details of seventeenth century Italy. Her descriptions of food (dates, almonds, pear wedges, bread, olive oil, saffron, antipasti), clothes (gowns, quilted doublets, embroidered bodices), and Italy itself (Rome, Florence, Genoa, and Naples) are wonderful. I could not get enough of the twisted alleyways, the villas, the references to historical characters (Galileo, Cosimo de' Medici II), and of course the paintings. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the story itself. Told in the first person narrative, Artemisia is a somewhat flat character -- Susan Vreeland is unable to convey the passion and courage that drove Artemisia to pursue her dream of becoming a famous painter.&quot;Girl In Hyacinth Blue&quot; sparkled. It was clever, intelligent -- a little gem. &quot;The Passion of Artemisia,&quot; on the other hand, is entertaining (the Italian words scattered throughout the novel were just plain fun: bene, brava, tesoro, poverina, la dolce vita). It depicts details from seventeenth century Italy marvelously (the reason for the three star rating), but ultimately, it does not deliver the dramatic tale about a woman who ignored the social mores of her time.If you enjoy fiction published about art, history, and the lives of women consider reading: &quot;Tulip Fever&quot; by Deborah Moggach and &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This book may be fascinating, but is it not nearly as fascinating as the real story. I thought Vreeland gave us a rather flimsy tale, and decided to give a more scholarly work a try. And after all, what can one expect without historical records of the time? Well, turns out one can expect a lot, and there were a lot of records. What they tell is a very different story from that Vreeland gives us. In fact, her version omits many astonishing details, and really misrepresents Artemisia's life for cliches and trite dramatic purposes. The real story -- skillfully presented by Alexandra Lapierre (translated by Liz Heron) in Artemisia: A Novel -- does our Artemisia justice.What I can't figure out is why would someone take a really rich and lively story and water it down for a series of vignettes, when the true story is one ripping read? Although Lapierre entitles her work &quot;A Novel&quot;, she refers to her primary sources -- and she expounds on the manners of the day -- to make a vibrant portrait. I felt more than disappointed by this version when I read Lapierre's - I felt betrayed. This is one author who will not get a second chance."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I bought this book believing I would really, really love it. I love art, I love Italy, so...what was there not to love?The Passion of Artemisia is the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, born in Rome in 1593. After the death of her mother, Artemisia was raised by her father, who was himself, an artist. Vreeland tells us that the book is, for the most part, historically accurate, and I have no reason to doubt her veracity. However, the historical portions, the descriptions of the art and the cities, etc., make up the only interesting parts of the book.When the book opens, Artemisia is a girl of eighteen who stands at the center of a rape trial. Artemisia wants to see justice done, but her father has other ideas and other things on his mind and Artemisia is left ruined and unmarriageable.Although unmarriageable, Artemisia does wed and only about a year later as well. The union is a relatively happy and peaceful one and her husband, also a painter, takes her to his native Florence where they both pursue their vocation until Artemisia gives birth to a daughter.When Artemisia clearly proves to be the superior painter, her harmonious relationship she has enjoyed with her husband ends and she eventually leaves him, taking their daughter with her. She travels first to Genoa, then to Rome, then to Naples. She is determined to support both herself and her child as a painter, no matter how much society is against the idea.Artemisia Gentileschi was a fascinating woman. She was the first woman admitted to the Florentine Academy, she was a woman who lived apart from her husband at a time when living apart from one's husband was virtually unknown. She moved in the same social circles as the Medicis and the other families of the Italian nobility. Artemisia was, as the title of the book, suggests, a passionate woman. So, what is the problem here?The problem with this book is twofold. First, the character of Artemisia, as painted by Vreeland, is both dull and flat. Instead of giving us a fascinating character, Vreeland seems to be using Artemisia as a vehicle through which to give us her views of the issues of Renaissance Italy. Artemisia \\"talks\\" at length about science, art, religion and politics, but her views are not those of a passionate artist, they are the views of someone totally detached from the day-to-day life of the times. Unfortunately, we learn nothing about Artemisia's passion for her art, for her husband, for her child, for her homeland. This is the story of a cold and cerebral woman, not a passionate, life-affirming one. It is only when Artemisia is analyzing the painting of others that she becomes in the least bit interesting as a human being.The second thing wrong with this book is the poor quality of the writing. The narrative prose is just awful. It is a mystery to me why Vreeland wrote this way and even more of a mystery as to why her editor (or even a first reader) didn't catch (and fix) the problems. Wherever the fault lies, there is simply no excuse to foist bad narrative prose on the book-buying public. It is really unforgiveable.Artemisia Gentileschi was a fascinating and passionate woman. She certainly deserved better than this."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"Vreeland's writing captures the characters and involves the reader with them. I enjoyed reading this book, but was stunned at the contradiction to the reality of Artemesia's life. Although fictionalized biography by definition takes liberties with the subject's life, it makes no sense for example: 1) to portray Artemesia with only one child (she had 4), 2) to portray that daughter with no interest in painting (her surviving daughter was a painter), 3) to have Artemesia return to Rome alone with her daughter (in reality she returned with her husband), 4) to portray Artemesia's marriage as breaking up much earlier than it did in reality. To me these distortions change so much about Artemesia that the book becomes pointless. It puzzles me because Vreeland is a good enough writer to be able to carry a story without contracting essential facts."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Having known nothing about Artemisia, I purchased this book because I enjoyed Girl in Hyacinth Blue. Let me tell you, this book is soooo much better!!! Although the book is a work of fiction, I followed the career of Artemisia by printing a collection of her paintings from the internet and followed her career as I read along. It's too bad the book didn't include pictures of her various paintings (similar to Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper)- that would have made the book so much better!!! The story follows Artemesia from the age of 18 when she was raped by her father's friend through her adult hood (about the age of 41). You learn of the various people she met and worked for and how she came to paint the paintings she did. Of course this is Ms. Vreeland's view on how her ideas formed, but they are strong and believable thoughts. My biggest complaint was the book's ending. I found it incomplete and lacking. It needed a more definite ending instead of the one that was published. I was left turning the pages, asking \\"Is that it?\\" In spite of its ending, I would highly recommend this book to art lovers, fans of the 17th century, romance readers, readers who enjoy a good moth/daughter relationship. It's all there in these 275+ pages. I anxiously await the next book by Sue Vreeland - after \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" and now the improvement of \\"Artemeisa\\", her next book should be even better!!!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"As a lover of historical fiction and Renaissance art, I was very excited to read this book. Unfortunately, the writing was far less impressive than the story it told.The writing falls flat, often failing to capture the imagination, or sometimes even the interest, of the reader. I often found that instead of actually evoking in me a particular emotion, I was told what emotion I was supposed to feel. The writing felt, in a word, superficial. Though there were many opportunities to delve a little deeper into the meat of the characters, the author consistently stopped a few steps short, making the deficiency of emotional substance dismayingly evident.The novel was certainly not all bad. I became more and more engaged as the book progressed. Though the ending fell a bit flat for me, I found a rather fanciful and compelling story between the less compelling brackets of beginning and end. For the most part, I looked forward to opportunities to read a bit further.For a brilliant read that succeeds in many ways in which \\"The Passion of Artemisia\\" falls short, try Sarah Dunant's \\"The Birth of Venus\\".As a final note, the audiobook version of this novel was a disappointment. The narrator makes each man in the story sound similarly lecherous, unsympathetic, and one-dimensional, precluding an effective conveyance of the emotion and evolving interaction among characters, ultimately compromising the story. Additionally, music was occasionally played in the background, which sometimes impaired the listener's ability to hear all of the narrator's words. Avoid the audiobook of this novel."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This was the first book I had read by Susan Vreeland. Normally, I don't like first person narrative, but this book was wonderfully written. The story of Artemisia is one of betrayal and passion, and the slow realization that reality isn't all that it's cracked up to be. She is forced, by circumstance, to be married to someone she doesn't know. HE can't accept that she is a better painter than he. Artemisia spends the majority of her life trying to reconcile her past to her present and to find a balance between her love of painting and the love of her family.I would recommend this book to anyone. Not only does it illustrate a period in history that I don't know much about, but it allows the reader to see behind the paintings. The pursuit of art, for art's sake, is a noble venture, and to see the background makes it even more important."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"I picked up this book because I had so enjoyed Alexandra LaPierre's novel on the same subject. The book had also received some excellent reviews. However, I was really disappointed. First, the language is trite and Artemisia speaks in cliches. I felt like the narrator was speaking to me on a ninth grade level, which I didn't like. I'm amazed that I finished the novel.I think more importantly, though, the character of Artemisia really irritated me. Here is this woman who really triumphed over adversity to be a female painter in a time when women didn't do anything besides birth children. However, she plays the helpless victim throughout the novel, and, rather than foster an environment in which her daugher can make her own decisions, she forces the daughter to paint.The novel is also riddled with historical inaccuracies. After doing some research on Artemisia, these inaccuracies really irked me."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"\\"This book traces a particular painting through time: in this case, the post-Renaissance painter Artemisia Gentileschi's violent masterpiece, \\"Judith.\\" It takes you on a wonderful artistic journey,I enjoyed it thoroughly...and learned about how different life was for women at that time.

Artemisia was Italian and lived in the 17th century. The book is a fictionalized story based on her actual paintings.

I quickly emailed a few friends and my book group to suggest this \\"must read.\\" Then I came here and was amazed by the poor reviews. Not well written? You've got to be kidding me! Vreeland's descriptions of smells, sights, scenery, etc. were right on the money and beautifully done. I don't know anything about the real Artemesia, but as a work of historical FICTION (yes, people, FICTION), this book was wonderful. I hope the bad reviews don't stop people from reading this book -- it was a pure pleasure and gift to read."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"The Passion of Artemisia is a deeply emotional and passionate journey into the exploration of the everyday struggles that artist, Artemisia Gentileschi, must face. Her fight and determination to continue painting must make her choose between love, hate, forgivenes, mockery and scorn of a past she had no control over. A must read for anyone, but especially touching to a woman's heart. Susan Vreeland is a genius. She captures the moment of every sentence with her gracious detail."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"This book continues Vreeland's interest in painting, focusing more on the life of the painter, in this case a woman, than the owner of a painting. Set in 1600s Italy, it offers a fictionalized narration of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, a real woman painter of the time. It begins with disturbing material - the trial of her painting teacher for raping her, in which she is the one tortured by the Inquisition, humiliated, and examined. It almost made me put the book down, although it wasn't tastelessly graphic. after this &quot;brief unpleasantness&quot; we move into the up-and-down life of the woman, which grapples with: what does it mean to paint, how can a woman be a painter in this man's world, how much is she married to her painting &amp; what sacrifices must she make and are they worth it, how do you let bitterness go and forgive, etc? A deeper, longer book which commits to neither the pessimistic nor the optimistic, quite skillfully."},{"Title":"The Passion of Artemisia","review":"The main reason I read this book was because of a friend who wanted to read this and discuss it. I really didn't think that I would like this book at all but it turned out that I was wrong and I was really captivated by the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was the first women to be admitted into Accademia dell' Arte in Florence.The story of Artemisia Gentileschi begins with the trial of Agostino Tassi, who raped Artemeisia and is her fathers assistant. During the trial it is Artemisia that is physically tortured by the trial and its outcome. This experience becomes the inspiration for some of the violence that is displayed in her paintings.Susan Vreeland has done an excellent job in describing the meaning and reasoning behind each of the paintings and creates strong characters who remain in your memory for a long time. I especially liked Sister Graziela who was sort of a surrogate mother to Artemisia.

The condition of the books that I ordered was fantastic and shipping was really quick. THANK YOU."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Having read all of the Agatha Christies at least twice, I can honestly say that &quot;Crooked House&quot; is my very favorite. One reason is that Agatha Christie does in this novel what she does best---gathers an extended family all under one roof, allows one of the family to be murdered, and shows quite clearly that all the others had motive and opportunity.&quot;Crooked House&quot; is an excellent story of a complex family. The patriarch is Aristide Leonides, a Greek who has come to England and made a fortune in the restaurant and catering business. His mansion is home to his two sons, two daughters-in-law, three grandchildren, his first wife's sister, and now to his young and beautiful second wife plus the grandchildren's tutor. When the wealthy old man is poisoned, the reader learns that everyone had not only a motive but also an alibi. The characterizations are wonderful and the characters stand out as some of Mrs. Christie's most memorable ones.The usual detectives are absent in this one, but the detecting is in the capable hands of Charles Hayward, the son of a Scotland Yard detective and the fiance of Aristide's granddaughter Sophia Leonides. When the blood-chilling ending occurs, one is shocked and yet, on careful reexamination, must admit that all the clues were clearly there.Curl up with a cup of cocoa (unpoisoned, of course) and enjoy this classic crime with one of Mrs. Christie's most spectacular and unforgettable endings."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"This is one of the Christie books I remember reading as a child. When I reread it recently, I was amazed at how superb it is - it is not a Poirot or Miss Marple mystery, not at all, but it is a very different type of mystery. The shocking solution is in fact a brutal attack upon our own culture, our obsession with murderers and murder, and the inexorable impartiality of evil - it is a very frightening book, largely because it does not follow ALL the strictures one expects of a murder mystery. A novel as well as a whodunnit as well as a psychological study. And a grand success."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"I'm such a huge fan of the fastidious and meticulous Monsieur Poirot and the gentle, yet perceptive Miss Marple, that I rarely stray from them in my Christie-mania. Their mere presence in a book adds a little humor and, yes, comfort - knowing that at least one person is going to make sure justice is done is comforting.But as Agatha Christie's work isn't infinite (oh, that it were!), I occasionally have to leave behind Poirot and Marple and dive into the unknown. I'm glad I did. Crooked House starts out familiarly enough - the large house in the country, the rambling family and hangers-on that occupy it, no lack of motive or opportunity - but you soon realize that it's a bit darker than that. At some point you start to feel a bit uneasy, and by the end you are fully creeped-out. With no valiant Poirot and Marple to save the day, anyone could be the killer.The whole thing is just genius and a real page-turner. I found myself thinking about the book for days after reading it. Whether you're a seasoned Christie fan or not, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Crooked House is supposedly one of Christie's top two favorite books and I can see why. Filled with interesting characters, suspenseful twists and a myriad of suspects, Crooked House does not disappoint. On top of that, Hugh Fraser is the best at capturing each character and giving them life. Loved this one!"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"This is one of Christie's most interesting novels. Don't be surprised if you can't put it down!! You will be quite surprised at the ending and kicking yourself for not guessing whodunit! My hint to you--listen to the description Christie gives about the mind of a murderer, and then try to pick which character matches."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"My mother got me hooked on Agatha Christie years ago and I have a collection of about 12 books so far and I hope to be able to complete my collection. I can't put a book down when I start reading one because she keeps you guessing clear through the book and just when you think you have it figured out she throws a monkey wrench into the plot and fools you. Anyone that likes mysteries will love Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Crooked House by Dame Agatha Christie appeared in 1948. The novel concerns the murder of a wealthy Greek restaurant owner Aristide Leonides. The old chap had married a much younger woman Brenda who was a waitress at the time of their nupitals. The book is narrated by Charles Hayward a Scotland Yard criminologist whose father is also a policeman involved it he case. Charles is in love with Sophie Leonides one of old Aristide's grandchildren. Her family is eccentric to say the least. The family consists of her ineffectual father Phillip and his older brother of whom he is jealous. Crooked House is an evil place and the murderer is hard to discover.The book is written in Christie's simple style and required only a few hours of reading. If you want a short mystery novel to while away a few hours this Christie classic will fit your needs to a tee!"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Agatha Christie displayed once again why she was at the top of the list of mystery writers in this very well written murder mystery in the Leonides family. The characters are vivid, and for the most part unlikeable, and yet this story captivated me from the beginning. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who would like to pass the afternoon or evening with an intelligent and baffling mystery."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"I read all these reviews because I am a Christie fan-at-it. The charge that she plagiarized CROOKED HOUSE fron an Ellery Queen book, while shocking if true, can't be verified...so I'm not even going there.This book has all the Christie elements: strange house built by an even stranger owner; family pitted against the aged wreck of a Grandfather who held the purse strings, to a new--and VERY young bride; the family themselves being pretty much crackers & at odds with each other, and two murders that has everybody suspecting everybody else. The final element, the one that I most relate to--is that it's really very funny. Christie had a very modern, almost existential, sense of humour.For example: At the beginning of the story the two young lovers have been separated by a World War II that is now over. They plan to get together again at a classy restaurant. Unfortunately, their reunion plans have hit a tiny little snag--the girl's Grandfather has been murdered. The cops think it's an inside job & give orders not for anyone to leave the house. When they manage to meet anyway, the boyfriend asks: But how did you get out of the house? She replies that she shimmied down the drain pipe. His response: Darling!I thought it was funny & cute. There's a lot of that in CROOKED HOUSE. I really don't think the typical Christie humorous touch was the result of plagiarizing."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"\\"Crooked House\\" is notable for being one of Agatha Christie's self-proclaimed favorite mysteries, stating that: \\"writing \\"Crooked House\\" was pure pleasure and I feel justified in my belief that it is one of my best.\\" In the absence of her two most famous detectives (Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple) the mystery is told in first-person narrative by Charles Hayward, a young man who falls in love with the wealthy and beautiful Sophia Leonides in Cairo near the end of WWII.Postponing their engagement until the end of the war, they are finally reunited in England. Unfortunately, they cannot enjoy a happy ending just yet. Sophia's grandfather Aristide Leonides has died at age eighty-five, but the police are certain that he was poisoned, and are currently investigating the family for his murderer. All the Leonides family hope to pin the blame on Aristide's extremely young widow, believed to have been carrying on an illicit love affair with the tutor of the younger family members, yet Sophia and Charles are not so sure.As his father is an Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, Charles has access to the police reports, and because of his relationship with Sophia, is able to mingle with the Leonides family. As expected, they are an eccentric bunch, from the embittered sister of Aristide's first wife, to his inadequate sons, his melodramatic daughter-in-law, and his sullen grandchildren. All of them had motive and opportunity, none has a watertight alibi, and everyone had access to the poison used to kill him.With complications over the will and Sophia's younger sister prying into the murder investigation on her own, Charles is left trying to analysis each family member before another murder takes place.\\"Crooked House\\" is vintage Christie right down to the title, which like many of her novels is derived from a nursery rhyme. There's a strange extended family living in a large, imposing house, all of whom are viable suspects with distinct personalities.This is one of the few Christie mysteries in which I've been able to deduce who the killer was (which isn't saying much, as that's only happened once before) but was no less enjoyable because of it. I find that the novels that don't feature the strong personalities and idiosyncrasies of Poirot or Marple are ever-so-slightly darker, touching on themes and possibilities that can be quite chilling if you're reading alone on a dark night. \\"Crooked House\\" definitely falls into that category."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Crooked HouseI started reading Agatha Christie when I was a teenager. I also read Zane Grey and Earl Stanley Gardner. Of the three Miss Christie held my interest better because her plots were always more intricate and harder to figure out until you got to the end.

It is a fantastic murder mystery, but not by the standards of Christie's other books. The \\"surprise\\" ending on this one wasn't so surprising.

Christie should have developed the characters Charles and Sophia more; it was dissapointing to learn almost nothing about them and what happens to them after the murder is solved."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"This Christie novel doesn't quite deliver the goods. It's the usual savoir faire: a crumbling family's patriarch is murdered, and his significantly-younger trophy wife is thought to be his killer. The dysfunctional Leonides family thinks the victim's wife might be carrying-on an affair with the live-in tutor. There's plenty of police talk and not nearly enough character development. In fact, one wishes the characters weren't so \\"Christie,\\" i.e., familar, predictable, etc. Despite a mildly intriguing denouement (which, also, was somewhat predictable), Crooked House lacks fresh characters and gripping dialogue, which makes it a tedious read."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"One of Christie's shorter pieces is also one of her greatest successes. Hey, if you've never read Ellery Queen, it won't seem like plagarism. Blunt outcome is so well hidden you'll never see it coming. And yet after you do, it seems obvious from the beginning. Certainly one you should add to your Agatha collection. It's chilling and unforgettable..."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"&quot;Crooked House&quot; has long been considered one of Agatha Christie's most brilliant and memorable books -- the author herself singled it out as a favorite. I gave it a five-star review two years ago, but was recently stunned to see this one-line comment by Korean reviewer &quot;ellermoris&quot;:&gt;this mystery pirate ellery queen's work &quot;the tragedy of y&quot;Agatha Christie a plagiarist! During her golden years of the 1940s? Surely this couldn't be true ... could it?Yes, it could be. And it is.Here is the plot of &quot;The Tragedy of Y,&quot; without giving away any major surprises: Three generations of a warped, wealthy family live together in one house. The hated grandparent is murdered. The children's tutor is wrongly arrested. Secret handwritten documents emerge that solve the crime. The murderer is shockingly revealed to be &lt;the same person as in &quot;Crooked House&quot;&gt;. (Given the ostensible originality of Christie's ending, this last point is the most damning of all.)&quot;The Tragedy of Y&quot; was first published in 1932 under the pseudonym of Barnaby Ross. It was reissued as a paperback in 1945 credited to the more familiar pseudonym of Ellery Queen. &quot;Crooked House&quot; was published in 1949.Despite this disturbing and embarrassing discovery, I would still strongly recommend &quot;Crooked House.&quot; It's a better book than &quot;The Tragedy of Y,&quot; which suffers from a surfeit of clues, an overly analytical explanation, and weak characterization. Christie takes the same ingenious plot and turns it into a compelling human tragedy with an intuitively satisfying solution. We'll just have to live with the fact that the plot wasn't hers...."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Christie lists this as one of her all-time favorites of the novels she wrote. I'm glad she also lists Endless Night (but not Sleeping Murder), as well as her most famous ones. However, Crooked House failed to draw me in as much as the ones I just mentioned. First, there was too much dialogue and too little description, so it made me wonder if it was originally intended as a play. The narrator, Charles, is a bit of a dolt, pleasant but a little ineffectual (like Hastings), and hardly a good match for the sharp Sophia. A bit of weirdness too that could easily have been put right by a good editor, such as when Charles returns home after years abroad and, seeing his dear father for the first time after his long absence, they immediately launch into a discussion of the case. Another oddity is when Charles first visits the house and is led into the drawing room for no particular purpose (nobody in there) and then to the library. It could have been better. The plot stands up well, and the villain is (as usual with Christie) unexpected. It's still easily better than most contemporary cozy mysteries."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"I already had this book, but couldn't wait for it to come out on Kindle. This is one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels. I love the characters and the surprise ending. Brilliantly written!"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"This work is darker than most of Christie's work, the ending is disturbing but it is one of her best.In war-time Egypt two young people, Charles Hayward and Sophia Leonides, met and fell in love. They are separated by their duties but keep in touch and plan to met after the war. When they are finally able to be together again in England Sophia and her family are under suspicion for the murder of her grandfather. Charles attempts to solve the crime and becomes immersed in his future in-laws lives.Who has commited the crime and why? Was it the old man's young bride and her lover? Or was it one of his disappointing sons? Perhaps his dead wife's sister who despised him or one of his daughters-in-law, or someone else....This 1951 story is another of Christie's dysfunctional family studies but most other aspects of this one are departures from her usual style. First the patriarch of the family dominates by affection and kindness not fear and bullying. Also this is not one of her series, the detective and narrator, Charles Hayward, appears in this book only.The writers of Christie's day laid down certain rules of dective fiction, no unknown poisons or death rays, the butler did not do it, all clues must be fairly laid out for the reader etc. Christie adhered to these rules (although she sometimes interpreted them in unusual ways) and did absolutely in CROOKED HOUSE. The clues are all there for the reader to follow and yet I believe that, for most readers, the solution will come as a surprise."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Just as Christie's Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot so often uses psychology to solve murders, the solution to this mystery lies in the mental nature of the characters. There are no logistical considerations to take into account, for all the suspects have ample opportunity to commit the deed. Instead, it's motive and personality that are examined. Up until the solution is revealed, the novel is very typical Agatha Christie (which is certainly no bad thing). However, the conclusion is quite surprising in my opinion, and it makes the book above average.Others have summarized the plot, so I'll simply say that the characters are all very vividly painted and are interesting, though possibly a little caricatured for some tastes. Charles Hayward is a perfectly adequate narrator, but I was left wanting a little more zest, such as in the dry humor of Leonard Clement in The Murder at the Vicarage.Christie herself wrote in her autobiography that Crooked House, along with Ordeal by Innocence, was one of the two mysteries she was most satisfied by. I don't quite feel that strongly about it, but while certainly not a gem like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd or And Then There Were None, Crooked House is nevertheless an intriguing non-series Christie mystery. Recommended!"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"In this stock account of the poisoning of a Greek tycoon by a close family member, there is far more conversation than deduction, far more discovery of possible motive than ratiocination. Indeed, the identity of the psychologically abnormal murderer dawns on the narrator-hero only after the murderer's diary falls into his hands. Not one of Christie's best."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"A too predictable plot to me, except for the ending. Well written, absorbing and easy to read.

The connections it forces a reader to make in order to solve the crime are entertaining."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Christie is most famous for her Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple books, but I think this stand-alone detective story is her finest. The mystery surrounds the death of Aristide Leonides, a wealthy Greek entrepreneur (think Aristotle Onassis) with a young trophy wife and a bunch of relatives who sponge off him. Christie's characters in this book are fascinating -- nearly every one of the eccentric family members is a suspect in Leonides' death.Luckily for the reader, Charles Hayward, fiance of Leonides' granddaughter and son of a Scotland Yard detective, is perfectly placed within the family. As Charles delves further into the mystery, and more family members are attacked, he realizes that one of the Leonides may be a sociopath.Everything about this book is perfect -- the plot is riveting, the suspense is never-ending, and the ending is truly a shocker. Do not miss this book."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Read it.. It's wicked! You'll never guess who did it.Great Book! Agatha Christie is the Queen of Mystery for a reason."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"I am a huge Hercule Poirot fan,(and an Agatha Christie fan), but I don't care for Miss Marple or Tommy and Tuppence, so years ago I stopped reading any Christie except for Poirot.I picked this book up idly while I was wandering around Barnes and Noble one night, and began reading it. I was surprised to find a \\"detective\\" other than the ones mentioned above, although the book blurb, which callsCharles Hayward a \\"criminologist\\" is somewhat of an exaggeration. He's really more of a firsthand witness with police connections.Be that as it may, Agatha got me with this one. I enjoy Poirot more for the characterization than anything else, and I am no better at solving mysteries than I am at playing cards, because I am too lazy to catalog details.But in this book I did try to deduce who the murderer was, and as I say - Agatha got me. I missed it completely.With this book I discovered that what they say about my old, favorite author is true:she gives you all the details you need to solve the mystery. Still, you don't.This was a fun read. The characters were original and interesting, and the suspense was maintained through to the end.The family saga was an interesting counterpoint to the murder, and Charles personal involvement in the case added to the suspense.I am going to look for more Charles Hayward mysteries."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"The beginning tells how Charles Hayward met Sophia Leonides in war-time Egypt. When Charles returned to England to meet Sophia he read the notice of her grandfather Aristide's death. Sophia tells him her grandfather's death is suspicious. Charles' father is Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, and he learns of the facts in this case. Three Gables is a large home composed of three separate houses. Bombing had brought the family together. Inspector Taverner questions the family, and we learn about the events and their character (Chapter 7). Then about the young widow and the private tutor (Chapter 8). Charles talks to the widow Brenda Leonides and we hear her story (Chapter 9). Sophia explains her grandfather's cleverness. We meet Josephine, Sophia's young sister, who likes detective stories. Aristide's will was found unsigned! Next we learn that the family business is in difficulty, due to the error of mismanagement, nothing criminal. The death of Aristide prevented him from saving his son Roger (Chapter 11).Sir Arthur Hayward gives his opinion on amateur murderers: they are vain and want to talk. What about heredity and additive weaknesses (Chapter 12)? Why did Aristide provide a blueprint for his murder? Charles attends a family meeting; nothing will be done to save Roger's business (Chapter 14). Charles looks around, and talks to Laurence Brown and the young widow (Chapter 16). The missing will is found, and it has a shocking surprise (Chapter 17). But another person is hurt, it is no accident (Chapter 18), Incriminating documents are found (Chapter 19). Aristide's will creates the usual turmoil when the heirs don't share equally (Chapter 20). The police arrest the obvious suspects (Chapter 21). Yet there is some doubt by the family - and the police. Charles discusses his observations of the family. Then an urgent telephone call has shocking news: another poisoning (Chapter 23). The final chapters have the ending to this story. It would be shocking if you did not pick up on the clues appearing near the end. The murderer was hidden in plain sight, like a sapling among trees. Like other stories, it is very intriguing even if implausible.The final irony is that Charles Hayward will join the Diplomatic Corps and be sent to Persia. He will surely miss the peace and quiet of Swinly Dean."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Nowadays most people seem to know Agatha Christie from the TV and film adaptations of her novels. But her books are still out there to be read, and \\"Crooked House\\" is one of the better ones.There is no Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple here, only the grown-up son of a senior man at Scotland Yard. He wants to find the murderer of a rich and sly Anglo-Greek businessman, Aristide Leonides. Or to be precise, he wants to find the murderer providing it's not Leonides' granddaughter Sophia, the woman he loves.There are plenty of suspects, the most obvious being Leonides' second wife, more than fifty years younger than him.The whole family live in the same, rambling house, and the atmosphere is pretty claustrophobic. The plot keeps you turning the pages, and the dialogue is good.The novel is set circa 1947,and this is reflected in the stiff-upper-lip approach of some of the characters. However a history student of the '40s wouldn't gain very much from studying this book as source material, nearly every paragraph is focused on the plot. The story is set in the affluent London suburb of Swinly Dean, but about all we learn about it is that it has 3 golf courses.The most noteworthy character in the book is the murder victim himself :\\"Crooked , yes- but not a crook. Never anything outside the law...Funnily enough, he was attractive... Nothing much to look at. Just a gnome- ugly little fellow.\\"If you haven't read Christie before, and want to see what the old Dame of Detective Fiction could do, this is a good book to start with.

There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Like other reviewers I admire CROOKED HOUSE for its claustrophobic plot and the audacity of its payoff, another variation on Christie's famous \\"least likely person\\" gambit. But even if you know going in who did it, it's still an intriguing read. This time around I noticed, for the first time, how very deep Christie's cultural specificity ranges. Usually we think of her as light reading, sort of fluffy, but CROOKED HOUSE is oddly stuffed with allusions to all sorts of bodies of knowledge. Hardly a page goes by without a definite reference to some other book, myth, piece of music, popular song, TV program, or what have you--the sort of brand name precision Stephen King is famous for. I hadn't really noticed it in Agatha Christie before, but check it out.One suspect, Magda, is compared directly to a real life actress. \\"For the first time I was aware of the charm of her delightfully tip tilted nose. I was faintly reminded of Athene Seyler.\\" Athene Seyler! Not exactly, even in 1948, a particularly well known star. It's not as though Christie wrote \\"Garbo.\\" No, she meant to characterize Magda more precisely by alluding to La Seyler. Never a huge star, she was 50 in 1948, far from slim, a sort of Kathy Bates type perhaps, equally at home on the stage as on the screen. In the CROOKED HOUSE, the references continue: one victim was painted by Augustus John, a painter whom Christie saw as the epitome of modernism, another by John Singer Sargent, perhaps her example of an outmoded genteel tradition. Magda and her son, Eustace, are glimpsed in a family pose, and Charles thinks it looks very like a portrait by Gainsborough.Magda recalls a scene from THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE, Granville Barker's 1905 melodrama recently updated by none other than David Mamet! Famous murderers of the past are invoked, most notably Edith Thompson and Constance Kent. Charles agrees to play \\"Watson\\" to young Josephine's \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\" And there's a lot from Shakespeare and the Bible: the \\"mark of Cain,\\" for one, and \\"this side idolatry\\" (Ben Jonson speaking of his love of Shakespeare). Poetry is everywhere. We are reminded that Henry the VIII was in fact a poet too, writing verse to Anne Boleyn. Christie alludes to Chaucer and Colerudge as well. But it's not just the work of the canon that you need to know in Agatha Christie, there's pop culture too, for one of the suspects is an avid listener to the \\"Brains Trust,\\" a popular UK radio show of the postwar period.Then there's all the history lessons! \\"The drama of Thermidor,\\" writes Christie, regarding the French Directoire, \\"the decree of outlawry against the Robespierrists, the magnificence of Barras, the cunning of Fouche--Napoleon, the half-starved young gunner lieutenant.\\" Suffice it to say if you don't know your French Revolution you will never guess the ending.Perhaps my favorite character is Clemency--the steely wife of Roger, the woman who helped develop the atomic bomb and thus, we suspect, might be willing to commit a murder as well. In one passage Charles, the narratorm dwells on \\"Clemency's abstract expression.\\" I can't help but wonder if this is a reference, possibly subconscious, to the \\"abstract expressionism\\" that was all the rage in painting circles at the moment Christie was composing CROOKED HOUSE--1948? It was popularized, don't forget, by CLEMENT Greenberg, possibly CLEMENCY is an ironic reference to this art critic. Oh well, just a thought!"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Most of Christie's mysteries offer startling solutions, but few are such complete jaw-droppers as the solution found in CROOKED HOUSE, which is as unexpected as it is inevitable. The story of an eccentric family smothered by a rich and wiley patriarch who meets with unexpected death, CROOKED HOUSE relies largely on character and atmosphere for effect. These are not elements one normally expects from a Christie mystery--but not only does Christie deliver them here, she does so without allowing them to overshadow one of the craftiest puzzles in her career.

First of all, I say you SHOULD read this book because, well, you should. It's not a matter of wanting to, it's just something that, if you're a Christie reader (even a little bit), you should force yourself to read this. (Kinda' like the obligation you have as a human being to read The Catcher in the Rye before you die.)The reason I recommend this so strongly is because while I don't think this is exactly her BEST book, it probably has the best ending, psychologically speaking. This truly exemplifies pure evil.Crooked House falls in the catagory that Endless Night and a few others inhabit--those books you wouldn't call superb, but have the acute awareness of human nature and the human pysche that all of her other books lack in somewhat.So, in short, I would read this. The end will perhaps horrify you, but you must nontheless give in to it. It might remind you that evil inhabits all of us, no matter who we are.Holly Burke, PhD.

I enjoyed it,but for me, there are others I like better."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Having read so many Agatha Christie mysteries, I always appreciate reading one that does not feature her trademark sleuths, especially as Hercule Poirot can be a trifle overbearing at times. &#34;Crooked House&#34; is a delightful, closed door mystery, that will have readers guessing until the very end. It is a tale filled with love and hate, murder and jealousy, all of the elements that make up a good murder mystery.Charles has just fallen in love with Sophia, the sensible daughter of wealthy but clueless parents. She and her entire immediate family (and some extended) live with her grandfather and his new wife in their strange country house. Their grandfather, Aristide Leonides is a wealthy businessman who does as he pleases and gives generously to all of his children and their offspring. So when he is found murdered, there is very little motive although everyone had the opportunity and knowledge to kill the diabetic when they administered his insulin shots. And Charles finds himself drawn into this mystery, not only because his father works for Scotland Yard, but because Sophia will not marry him unless the murderer is found. Charles is faced with a strange family, at once cold and unwelcoming, but with some members who instantly confide in and beguile Charles. Could Aristide's much younger wife want him dead so she could run off with the grandchildren's tutor? This is what everyone wants to believe. Is one, or both, of his sons angry at some perceived slight? Did one of his daughters-in-law view their living arrangements as more of a prison than a home? Charles knows he must act face before someone else is murdered for knowing too much about the case, and to save his future with Sophia.&#34;Crooked House&#34; is a fast-paced read that will have readers guessing and confused to the very end. Christie paints a logical case for nearly every suspect and follows several red herrings to their convoluted ends. The ending is unique and sinister and not quite what one would expect, although there have been similar murderers in other Christie works, and indeed in real life."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"Many years ago I read all of Agatha Christies books and they were great fun.

I suspected about everybody, but found it satisfying that there were reasons to suspect the real killer above other suspects.I can see why Christie found this a fun book to write--it is fairly straightforward but imaginative in its plot.Glad Christie found so much joy in writing it.

The detective is not Hercule Poirot nor Mrs. Marple but Charles Hayward, the son of an eminent Scotland Yard superintendent, who's in love with Sofia Leonides whose grandfather has just been poisoned. The book is a good example of the \\"all in the family\\" murder genre as Aristide Leonides was murdered in the family home and the prime suspects are his own wife, his sister-in-law, his sons, their wives and his grandchildren.As often in the Agatha Christie novels of that period, there aren't many descriptions of London or even of the \\"crooked\\" Leonides house in the book. CROOKED HOUSE is pure Christie style : a lot of dialogs and psychological considerations carried out per se by Charles Hayward. In addition to the final twist which seems to have been very innovative and provocative in 1949, American radios refusing to broadcast the radio adaptation of the novel, I liked very much, in a detective story, the fact that nor the detective, nor the police inspectors could find the identity of the murderer(s).A book for the week-end."},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"THis is not as scary as \\"then there were none\\" but I really like the twist at the end of the story.

It is often the final solution of an Agatha Christie book which makes or breaks it.Up until the solution, there is little new to be had here. It is the typical Christie dysfunctional family haunted by the shadow of murder. Into the fray steps a detective, sleuthing around and discovering all sorts of misdemenours. Nothing wrong with that at all. Provides excellent enjoyment. However, it is with the ending that an Agatha Christie book can really provide more than enjoyment, and can inspire wonderment.This is one which does just that.It's really rather run-of-the-mill until the solution is propounded, whereupon the book explodes in an unexpected horror in the fact of almost pure, yet very simple, evil. You will never guess the solution. But when it comes, it is one of the most surprising she concocted. And shocking.No one can ever underestimate her contribution to the genre. It is with books like this that she really redefined the nature of the crime novel.And she has far more literary worth than most critics would have you believe. (Rather like critics of the excellent Stephen King.) Her writing is good, her characters well formed, and her psychology spot on. (Her adept hand at psychological acuteness is often overlooked, but all her books are truly excellent psychological thrillers, as well as classic detective stories.)"},{"Title":"CROOKED HOUSE","review":"One of Christie's strongest. Although the plot is neither intricate nor clue-laden, the ending is powerful and immediately convincing.

Christie's publishers wanted her to change the unconventional ending, but she wisely refused.

As comic books go, however, this one is kind of pointless: to both a long-term fan and someone just starting out. The plots (there are two) are really not that interesting: the first one focusing on the \\"Mutant town\\" of new york, and the second focusing on the Hellfire Club. The first is much better, but still the whole thing doesn't really do anything but cement a new character into the X-Men books, (the process further and better carried out in the next Graphic Novel in this series) and the whole mutant town concept is pretty poorly explained. The next one is a plot only fans can love, with so many obscure and unexplained characters it was confusing even for me (where the heck did Selene come from?!?!?). Both of these two plots did have their brief moments of characterization (such as the confrontation between Rachel and the White Queen), and they both have decent art, but even this does not really make it worth it. All in all these felt more like fillers done in desperation then anything else. So if you absolutely must buy these, buy them for brief moments and good art. Otherwise, if you are looking to save some money by skipping a Graphic Novel, or you are a newbie, skip this.P.S If marvel wants to highlight an issue like slavery, why create a fake mutant slave trade, when very real and terrible ones already exist?"},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 2: The Cruelest Cut","review":"This second volume of legendary X-scribe Chris Claremont's return run on Uncanny X-Men finds Wolverine encountering Marvel's newest (and hottest) character in the past few years while investigating a murder: the X-23.

If you read the previous volume, The End of History, then you'll know what to expect in Cruelest Cut. Claremont seems to be getting more comfortable back in the house he built by not trying to impress everyone every issue. He's having fun here writing characters he created and riding on the mythology he helped shape, which helps make this TPB a worthwhile read. The art by Alan Davis and Andy Park is great as well, especially Davis' pencils as he once again draws a mouth watering Marvel Girl. All in all, longtime and new readers who have either enjoyed Claremont's last volume or were there in the golden age of his Uncanny X-Men run should give this a look."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 2: The Cruelest Cut","review":"I'm obviously in the minority here; I think Logan is cool but I don't need to see him in every X-Title.

Unfortunately, I have to admit to enjoying Wolverine alot in his own comic book, but am losing his character in the X-books. I don't really see how he can be on more than one team at once and still have enough adventures to justify his own title.Maybe I'm just over exposed to him? Regardless, I feel as if stories about the Weapon X program really should stay in his own comic - I actually read X-Men to catch up with how the team as a whole is doing. It's getting hard to really justify buying what is essentially a team book when the focus is increasingly on one character.The arc isn't bad; it's just treading a plot line that has been overdone in the X books in Wolverine's case, it's really hard to work up enthusiasm for another person who went through the Weapon X process."},{"Title":"Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 2: The Cruelest Cut","review":"I thought this book has a interesting story line.

Bandura gives a broad hint to the reader, and offers answers to some of the most important and advanced issues that each of us encounters during life. The book stimulates a better awareness of humans' potentials, and encourages to rivisit our constructs.Bandura's study on self-efficacy is supported by the citation of 47 pages of references.

Finding the right balance is important. This book is easy to read, easy to understand, and makes Bandura's concepts personal"},{"Title":"Self Efficacy: The Exercise of Control","review":"Bandura's work in psychology is (in my opinion) the most agent-friendly and self-empowering. I'm convinced that the most effective way to beat anxiety is to identify its source in dysfunctional **self-referent thinking**. The best way to start feeling good is to ramp up your perceived self-efficacy. The salutary thing about Bandura's work, in my opinion, is that, unlike many psychologists who, if they are empirically-minded or neuroscience-minded, decompose a human being into a concert of subpersonal processes, Bandura actually acknowledges that YOU ARE THERE as a real agency-possessing person, and that the reigns of agency can be used to exercise influence on one's internal psychic environment as well as on the external social and natural environment through **metacognition**.Eliminating, or significantly reducing, anxiety is, under Bandura's Self-Efficacy theory [SE], achieved by recognizing that anxiety is a function of the perceived mismatch between threats in the environment and one's appraisal of one's own ability to cope with that threat. A negative mismatch favoring the threat (where ability is smaller than the threat) leads to anxiety; while a negative mismatch favoring one's ability leads one to \\"feeling money\\" (in the parlance of our times). The Antidote to feeing anxiety: Locate the threat, affirm your ability is greater than it, or, if it isn't at present, locate actionable means to beefing up your coping strategies and the anxious affect will diminish. This is not arm-chair psychologizing; this is real empirical psychology. And, since my discovery of Bandura's work (2004), SE has been confirmed over and over again in my own personal experience. Bandura's work, and that of other efficacy-oriented sociocognitive theorists, represent, in my opinion, the best work in psychology. The theory is highly illuminating and has remarkable explanatory power.(For a short description of the personal benefits of studying, and internalizing, Bandura's work, see the \\"Comments\\" section below this posting.)It's been over a decade since Albert Bandura's book \\"Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control\\" (hereafter SE) has been published. What's annoying is how little Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory seems to have permeated popular culture, despite the fact that there is an impressive amount of empirical evidence to support the explanatory linkages between \\"perceived self-efficacy\\" and human behavior, in particular, \\"performance attaintments\\".(This review is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of SE. Instead, what I offer the reader is a brief but detailed explication of some of the major theoretical concepts of SE, emphasizing Bandura's explanatorily powerful notion of a self-efficacy BELIEF. Let me clarify what I mean by \\"explanatorily powerful\\". First, this concept has an impressive range of application to any domain of human life which can be thought of as an activity over which we exercise some (voluntary) control. In other words, self-efficacy beliefs can regarded as determinants, not of involuntary bodily movements, but over any domain which falls into the phenomena studied by philosophers of ACTION. (Human actions can be understood as a sub-class of goal-oriented behavior -- \\"sub-class\\" because not all goal-oriented behavior is subject to human choice or control (e.g., the autonomic physiological processes of natural organisms are goal-directed). For present purposes, when there ARE features of an environment, social or natural, such that THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXERCISE OF HUMAN CONTROL, then it makes sense conceptually to use the construct of perceived (self) efficacy to explain behavior in that environment or domain of activity. Sports, health, interpersonal relationships, occupational activities, business relations, and scientific pursuits--all of these are domains in which people - you and I - have to produce performances of various kinds, not as helpless spectatorial automatons, but as COGNITIVE AGENTS.SE refers to the \\"self-efficacy\\" component of a larger theory which is called **Social Cognitive Theory**--\\"cognitive\\" because it holds that BELIEFS (i.e., cognitions) \\"mediate\\" (i.e., \\"determine,\\" for simplicity's sake) affective (emotional) and somatic (i.e., physiological) states and behavior--\\"social\\" because psychological phenomena are determined by the structures (social and natural) which environ human beings. Bandura does not buy into the notion of a isolated, self-contained, private domain of \\"internal\\" phenomena which are causally out of reach from external, i.e., environmental influences. It follows from this, that to understand one's own psychological states, necessary reference to one's historical workplace, the current social structures in which one lives one's life must be taken into consideration.In this context, it would be well to introduce probably THE most important general philosophical doctrine associated with SE. It is the doctrine which asserts a TRIAD OF RECIPROCAL CAUSALITY. People's internal reactions (personal cognitions, choices, emotions) produce behavior; since this behavior occurs IN THE ENVIRONMENT, it can alter it; So, personal (internal states) can determine behavior; behavior can determine the environment. But what about the people on the OTHER END of your behavior; the recipients, who have to adjust THEIR behavior because of those actions you introduce INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, and VICE VERSA. Other people's behavior (natural events notwithstanding) alter the environment, requiring YOU to adjust YOUR behavior; therefore, the environment determines (your) behavior; moreover, having to adjust YOUR behavior (e.g., having to exit a lane on the freeway because of incoming traffic), in relation to others can determine your personal reactions (e.g., you get angry or frustrated at certain cognitions because some motorist cut you off on the freeway.)Performances of any kind in any given domain of human functioning, whether it be cognitive (e.g.., I Q test performance), social, occupational, recreational, or whatever are the result of two different classes of deterrminants - an abiility determinant, which most people recognize - and a \\"NON-ABILITY\\" determinant , which most people do not. According to Bandura, self-effficacy belief falls under the second class of derterminant of performance attainments. What is a self-efficacy belief? A self-efficacy belief is a belief concerning one's own capabilities, relative to a given domain of activity or human functioning. A self-efficacy belief can differ in a number of important respects, in strength and magnitude. The strength of one's self-efficacy is understood to be the degree to which one thinks that it is true; in other words, the strength of one's self-efficacy belief is the subjective certainty with which one holds that belief. (This is the phenomenon that people ordinarily call \\"confidence\\".)The 'magnitude\\" of one's self-efficacy belief refers to what one thinks one is personally capable of accomplishing relative to a given domain of activity. Suppose I think I'm capable of playing chess pretty well. I do well at the public tables. But I don't think I can compete at the state, national, or international level. So, the magnitude of my performance which I can expect in the exercise of my personal \\"chess\\" capacities, in this case, is the level of performance in the game of chess. Assessments of magnitude depend on some ranking withing a continuum of performance attainments, against some implicit, or explicit standard of excellence. Self-efficacy beliefs reflects a self-assessment of (the state and current level) of my capabilities, which reflect social comparisons. However, in aspirational modeling, i.e., when you set out to be a dentist, ball player, insurance salesman or whatever goal-setting (by definition) involves aiming beyond the perimeters or horizons of one's actual accomplishments. You don't aspire to be what you ALREADY ARE; rather, you aspire to be that which you (currently) aren't. Therefore, the goal that you set for yourself is such that the evidcen you currently have on your capabilites to determine whether or not you can do this thang is going to FALL SHORT of confirming that you do. But if you only set goals to do what you've already done, you would never set an aspirational goal. So, since to set an aspirational goal means taht you set up a goal system (fior yourself) which is such that the goal is an accomplishment for which you have no DIRECT EVIDENCE that you can accomplish this goal, it's vitally important to your success, to voluntarily adopt a policy of \\"optimisitic\\" (as opposed to verdical, i.e, strictly accurate) self-appraisal. This confers all kinds of benefits, like warding of f disruptive affective and cognitive states, such as depression and anxiety (while you're on the aspirational course).\\"In nonhazardous endeavors, veridical self-appraisal can be self-limiting.\\" (Bandura, 1999)This has been in the psychological literature for well over a decade, and is empirically well-documented. Some psychologists (e.g., Susan Harter), think that self-esteem derives from basically two sources, socially valued interpersonal relationships, and the developent of competencies invested with personal significance (sports, dating, cooking, academics or whatever). While (in Self-Efficacy), Bandura agrees that self-esteem may derive from either of these two founts, he (with an astuteness and compactness of expression I have come to expect of him) points out that self-esteem is NOT EQUIVALENT to self-efficacy: feelings of worthiness or unworthiness, how much you like yourself, are not the same thing as your belief that you are capable of performing well in a given domain. For example, say Bob is a grocery cashier, for example, but since he don't personally invest this domain of activity with much significance, that Bob is good at it doesn't really matter to him as, say, being a good cook or actor does matter. THe point is that increases in perceived self-efficacy, relative to some domain of activity, do not necessary coincide with increased self-esteem.To put illustrate the point more directly, take the film **A History of Violence**. The lead character, played by Viggo Mortensen, had a history of violence (as a former mobster). The mobster (\\"Joey\\") had high self-efficacy beliefs (both in intensity and magnitude) in the domain of \\"offing\\" people, i.e., murderous thuggery. But, as you find out, this is not a skill that increased Joey's self-esteem; on the conrary, \\"Joey\\" abandoned his thuggish life and its deleterious social associations in order to began a new (and secret) life elsewhere as a devoted (and non-violent, almost behaviorially meek) family man. (Sorry for the spoiler.) Point is, self-efficacy can be very high in a given domain, but it mayn't lead to high self-esteem; however, if self-esteem JUST IS self-efficacy, this would (by Leibniz's Law) be impossible. Since it's an empirical fact (thus, not impossible), self-esteem CANNOT BE the same THING as self-efficacy.By distinguishing self-efficacy from self-esteem we can illumiante the latter by positing an explanatory linkage between the two: we could say that, the degree of self-esteem is determined by how well I perform at x-ifying, where x-ifying is a domain of activity I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT (read: \\"identify with). Then, self-esteem isn't some epiphenomenal property that supervenes over your psyche, but rather something you can EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OVER. In increasing competencies in areas you care about, you can exercise control over your self-esteeem, i.e; your feelings of worthiness or unworthiness. And that is SWA-EEET. Finally, as a NON-ABILITY determinant of performance, optimistic self-appraisal can elevate your performance attainments, and therefore positiively affect your self-esteem levels.So the question, then, is, do you have any control over whether or not you can adopt a policy of optimistic self-appraisal? Answer? Yes. You have \\"cognitive construal agency\\"--the ability to voluntarily adopt interpretations of life-events which are self-enhancing as opposed to ones which are self-belittling. Understandably, when one is operating under a negative construal bias, interpretations of one's circumstances which reflect an optimistic appraisal of one's capabilities (and thus of the outcome of one's efforts) may be not be so persuasive. This is where the \\"agency\\" in \\"cognitive construal agency\\" comes in. Bandura recognizes that people can exercise some control over their thought processes. They can exercise some control over their own internal \\"psychic environment.\\" They can affirm positive construals of their capabilities which makes for a more optimal internal setting for their initial efforts at success.This may require practice. Practice at cognitive construal agency involves generating self-referent thoughts (positive thoughts about yoruself) and keeping them ready-to-hand for immedate deployoment whenever you lapse into \\"negative rumination\\". The idea is not to waste time denouncing NSRTs, i.e., negative self-referent thoughts, but rather to REPLACE THESE with PSRTs, positive self-referent thoughts. Thought control efficacy can be expressed in either of two ways, by thought-suppression or by thought-replacement. Bandura acknowledges that in thought control, considered as thought-supppression, you run into a PARADOX of thought control: the very attempt to elimiate unwanted thoughts or cognitions from consciousness, is frustrated by the fact that, in order to NEGATE a NSRT (say, some propositions P = that you are fat, or not a good grad student, or whatever), you have to produce that very thought content in consciousness first, then denounce it. So, you can see how thought control, understood as thought suppression, is a cross-purposese with the aim of thought control (to eliminate unwanted thoughts or cognitions.)By contrast, in thought control, understood as thought REPLACEMENT, you do not attempt to denounce every unwanted thought (i.e., cognition) that come your way. Instead, when NSRTs come your way, YOU CHANGE THE CHANNEL. That is, you DIVERT YOUR MIND FROM the NSRTs (in Kant's terminlogy you \\"abstract from\\" the NSRTs) and pay attention INSTEAD to other PSRTs (which, byt he way should not be contrued as some New Agey, pollyana life-is-a-bed-of-roses cognitions, but plausible optimistic cognitions). (Obviously, much more can be said about what THIS MEANS.) Suffice to say here, however, is that the \\"paradox of thought control\\" just described does not occur in thought control, considered as thought-replacement, because the procedure is not to target negative cognitions (in your attentional cross-hairs) for elimnation and denoucement. Rather, this happens indirectly by virtue of their being replaced by positive cognitions (by your having, so to speak, changed your mental channel). As I said, for those with dysfunctional self-evaluative systems, this will take practice, but the benefits are, well, nothing short of life-altering."},{"Title":"Self Efficacy: The Exercise of Control","review":"In this volume, Professor Bandura situates the self-efficacy construct within a theory of personal and collective agency that operates in concert with other sociocognitive factors in regulating human well-being and attainment. Bandura also addresses the major facets of agency - the nature and structure of self-efficacy beliefs, their origins and effects, the processes through which such self-beliefs operate, and the modes by which they can be created and strengthened. In addition, Bandura reviews a vast body of research on each of these aspects of agency in diverse applications of the theory.

Lawrence writes poetically--never mind the sportswriters' rule against repeating the same word in a sentence (\\"Angels,\\" \\"Seraphs,\\" \\"Halos\\")--this author uses \\"dark\\" numerous times in a single paragraph. I felt as though I were in northern Italy with him. Incredible. Also recommended are his other travel works, such as Sea and Sardinia and Mornings in Mexico."},{"Title":"Twilight In Italy","review":"Much is said of D.H. Lawrence's fiction, but we've mostly forgotten about his amazing travel writing. Twilight in Italy takes us on a foot tour of the Alps all the way down into the verdant gardens and sun soaked plaza's of Italy. Lawrence, as always, finds small stories here and there that not only share a sense of place but also relate the experience of a real traveler. If you are a fan of Paul Theroux or Pico Iyer you will immediately feel at home with this book."},{"Title":"Twilight In Italy","review":"I was so impressed with Lawrence's description of the Etruscan tombs in this book that, when I was visiting Rome, I got on a bus trying to get to the town where the tombs were. The bus didn't go there and I got back to Rome fairly easily by train(all train tracks also lead to Rome). I tried again and got to the town, whose name I forget, and walked along a road until I found the site of the Etruscan tombs and went down the stairs to see several of the tombs, which are now sealed behind clear plastic to preserve the painted walls inside. The paintings have faded since Lawrence described them but are still quite impressive, with flocks of birds and happy, plunging dolphins, people having what appears to be sado-masochistic sex or just smiling and eating. These tombs are cheerful and colorful."},{"Title":"Twilight In Italy","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I tried more than once to read it.

This is honest, real life police work and it is more exciting and stimulating than any work of fiction. The characters in it are real and you can't ignore the impact they make as they march across the pages of the book. The criminal element presented in the stories is not at all like those you meet in traditional detective stories. The workaday law enforcement officers you encounter are intelligent, brave, hard working people who deserve our greatest respect. As you read the book you will note that they don't always come away unscathed. I highly recommend this book to one and all. You will be entertained by it but you will also come away with a deep sense of awe for those who protect and serve. At times you will laugh and at other times you will cry.

I laughed, I cried, I felt angry and sad, love and hate. Many times I felt I had jumped into the story and was right with the main character.

Clearly, she worked on this biography of Spinoza for some years, even going to the trouble of teaching herself Dutch to research the seventeenth-century Jewish philosopher's life. And then, just as it's finally published, Cambridge University Press brings out Stephen Nadler's *Spinoza: A Life*, a book that in its dispassionate tone, its even-handed treatment of potentially scandalous subjects, and in its deep and thoughtful treatment of Spinoza's Jewish milieu, puts *Within Reason* very deeply into the shadows. It's hard to write about a philosopher who died over 300 years ago, and left almost nothing in the way of scandals or love letters. Gullan-Whur compensates by inventing a homoerotic relationship between Spinoza and a Dutch student (along the way showing her complete ignorance of the reams of scholarly work done in recent years on issues of Renaissance sexuality); by teasing out at great length the issues involved in Spinoza's &quot;excommunication&quot; by the Amsterdam synagogue (along the way showing her complete ignorance of Judaism in general--the &quot;oral law&quot; is NOT, repeat NOT, to be confused with the kaballah); and by generally wearing on her sleeve her manifest dislike for Spinoza as a person. The only thing that saves the book is its fairly lively writing, and some vivid pictures of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. Otherwise, it's a historical novel. Read Nadler, if you want to know anything about the philosopher Spinoza. If you want to learn about Margaret Gullan-Whur, read this."},{"Title":"Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza","review":"Nothing invalidates an historical study more than the imposition of modern values on earlier times. Such an approach misleads the reader and misrepresents the subject. No amount of footnoting and references can redeem a book that applies this century's &quot;political correctness&quot; to attitudes of three hundred years ago. This work is a classic case of the faults of an &quot;a priori&quot; approach to history and philosophy. Gullan-Whur is self-deluded, confused both about Spinoza's life and his thinking, and sadly lacking in historical sense. Gullan-Whur's book makes meagre contribution to the recent studies of Spinoza's life and philosophy.The chronological narrative would be a redeeming feature of this book, except that Spinoza's wanderings defy detailed analysis. This isn't Gullan-Whur's fault, but her struggles to locate him physically are on a par with her comprehension of his philosophy. Spinoza, in line with many thinkers of his day, adopted various nom de plumes in his dealings with others. A Jew of Portuguese ancestry living in the Dutch Republic made communication difficult. Gullan-Whur traces his attempts to learn Dutch, Latin, and even a smattering of English. Latin, however, remained the international language. This situation meant that in a given day several languages might be needed according to circumstances. Gullan-Whur blithely ignores this aspect of language and applies one of his various identities according to when and where she's describing his activities. Her variations in Spinoza's names are compounded by her exasperating habit of referring to many of his contemporaries by their given names.Within a dozen pages, Gullan-Whur launches into a diatribe on the condition of women in the 17th Century Dutch Republic. A short comment would be understandable, but she returns to this theme throughout the book. At one point she accuses Spinoza of being both &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;misogynist&quot;. As a final thrust, she entertains the notion that Spinoza's solitary life indicates a propensity to homosexuality. As final point, she abhors his affection for pipe smoking.Gullan-Whur's attempt to deal with Spinoza's philosophy is little short of catastrophic. She trolls his writings to substantiate her pre-conceived notions. Using the material like a condiment, she sprinkles quotations from his writings throughout the text. These must be constantly referenced in the Notes to determine the source. The validity of the statements she attributes to him must be assumed. In most cases she imputes the citation to some early period in his life, implying that all his ideas were fixed at an early age. Development of ideas is apparently alien to her. The result is a goulash which the reader must reverse-engineer to derive some logical progression of thought. Given the breadth of Spinoza's ideas, her approach invalidates much of his thinking. This book has no place in early Enlightenment studies. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza","review":"Margaret Gullan-Whur is a victim of bad timing. A Spinoza scholar, she released her book around the same time as Steven Nadler's excellent biography of Spinoza. Spinoza poses large problems for any biographer, for the vast majority of his life was &quot;lived&quot; in the public sphere. Letters from friends and intimates were destroyed. Whereas Nadler presents a straightforward biography heavy on philosophical analysis, Gullan-Whur, by contrast, attempts a psycho-biography of Spinoza, attempting to fill in the gaps in his life with speculation concerning his philosophical works, particularly the &quot;Ethics.&quot; She tries to tie in the philosophical chapters, especially those on sexual desire, with speculation about Spinoza's life.At times, when solid facts are there, her speculation is strong . . . but at other times, we are led down the road of fantasy, as in her specualtions on pp. 142-43 of a homosexual relationship between Spinoza and a Dutch student. And having made the speculation, she wonders what we are to think of it before wavering as to its veracity concerning Spinoza, citing a recent Dutch novel about Spinoza being homosexual. How can we be sure when she admits she isn't even sure. Who is the biographer here and who is the reader?When dealing in the world of facts, Gullan-Whur is strong, evincing a strong, imaginative writing style. The first two chapters of her book are a joy to read. However, when dealing with the restrictions of biography, she comes off a distant second to Nadler. It would have been far better, given her fluid, imaginative writing style, to have penned a philosophical novel about the life of Spinoza. There she could have speculated to her heart's content."},{"Title":"Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza","review":"Margaret Gullan-Whur's biography of Spinoza does a fairly good job of placing Spinoza's work within a philosophical, social, and historic context. The connections between the works of Hobbes and Descartes and Spinoza show intellectual reaction and continuity. The connections and associations between Spinoza's work and the Dutch Reform Church and the Jewish community in Amsterdamn seem logically constructed and documented. The potential influence of the rise of the de Witt brothers and their assassination also was also thoughtfully developed. I needed this background of Dutch protestantism, the rise of the Dutch republic, and the philosophical forefathers to better place Spinoza's thought. It is interesting that he and Rembrandt were contemporaries and yet there is no evidence that either knew of the works of the other. The final chapters where Gullan-Whur records the commentaries of Goethe, George Elliott, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell, and David Hume to the work ofSpinoza further places his work in context from the perspective of later centuries.Bertrand Russell's quotation: \\"The noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers. Intellectually some others have surpassed him, but ethically he is supreme. As a naturalconsequence he was considered, during his lifetme and for a century after his death, a man of appalling wickedness.\\"This observation by Russell is fully illustrated throughout the book as Spinoza struggles to express his philosophy while staying under the 'radar\\" of the repressive cultural and religious forces of his day.A quotation by Hegel: \\"The allegations of those who accuse Spinoza of atheism are the direct opposite of the truth; with him there is too much God.\\" is also fully illustrated by the exploration of Spinoza's philosophy that is integrated into the biography."},{"Title":"As For Me And My House: Crafting Your Marriage To Last","review":"Walt Wangerin's gift for story telling is demonstrated undeniably in this marvelous book on the challenges of making marriage work. His powerfully transparent autobiographical sections moved me and drew me in, setting me up for his teachable moments, which are compelling and instructive. I wept with Wangerin as he told of the grace and forgiveness afforded him by his wife, knowing full well the liberating joy of being similarly forgiven by my wife of 26 years.

However, there were some chapters that were left out which I later read on my own. Of some of the terrible advice in this book, Wangerin advises cheating spouses, rather than confess to their spouse, to confess to a responsible, trustworthy Christian, in order to save the spouse from hurt. Also, he advises spouses who are beaten by their spouses to give their spouses several chances to stop abusing before kicking them out. Even then, he advises them to still give them another chance."},{"Title":"As For Me And My House: Crafting Your Marriage To Last","review":"Regardless of whether you have been married for some time or are going to get married, this book is exceptionally well written, helpful, and well worth the time to read.

Be that as it may, AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE is, without a doubt, the most helpful resource I've found for couples who want to build a genuinely fruitful Christian marriage. I say \\"build\\" because a marriage does not happen overnight - it is constructed over years of companionship, trust and, lest we forget, forgiveness. No other resource that I've seen even comes close to describing the kind of work a successful marriage requires, and no other resource identifies forgiveness, not love, as the centerpiece of that rare gem, a fruitful Christian marriage. I give this book to my pre-marriage couples, but I would give it to a 60-years married couple with no hesitation, because I believe that they would learn from Walt (and Thanne's!) wisdom and counsel."},{"Title":"As For Me And My House: Crafting Your Marriage To Last","review":"Walter Wangerin's \\"As For Me and My House\\" presents a relationally and spiritually pragmatic guide for building a lasting, Christian marriage. While the writing style edges towards maudlin on occasion, the book's core concepts are rock solid and presented in a clear language with even clearer examples. Wangerin's approach is to set aside the conventional wisdom about how relationships \\"should\\" be--absorbed through culture, church, and family---and address how individuals actually feel and how relationships could be if approached from what might be called a \\"servant's\\" perspective. Wangerin's effectiveness in articulating this approach is based upon his long experience as a pastor in counseling couples and his insistence on acknowledging that marriage is a rewarding, if at times, harrowing challenge. Several themes, emphasized through vignettes about his marriage, are expanded upon to provide concrete suggestions for action.First, Wangerin addresses newlyweds by showing that marriage is, no matter how much time the couple has been dating, an altogether different type of relationship. He discusses in frank terms the struggle to absorb a new life together with new realities and new responsibilities. His honesty in addressing a couple's fears, unrealistic expectations, and occasional dismay with each other upon first being married serves the newly engaged or newly married reader by relieving the pressure of a \\"perfect\\" marriage. According to Wangerin, every newly married couple experiences these issues. Wangerin goes on to insist that marriage is in fact a leap into the unknown. From a conventional wisdom perspective, this is an unorthodox but intuitively satisfying perspective that frees the reader to being building their marriage with an optimist's realism.The second portion of the book explores the central pillar of Wangerin's marriage philosophy: forgiveness. According to Wangerin, love is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to sustain a marriage. Above even love, the ability to forgive is the means by which a long and mutually satisfying marriage can be built. Moreover, developing the ability to forgive depends crucially a strong relationship with God. For Wangerin, forgiveness is less a gift from a magnanimous spouse who was been wronged and more a service to the spouse and the relationship. Different from forgiveness of wrongs suffered from those we are not in close relationship with, Wangerin insists on a much more aggressive approach to confronting sin in marriage. Without the sinner understanding the sin, neither true forgiveness or true repentance can take place.The third portion of the book builds out what Wangerin calls a servant's approach to marriage by discussing the six tasks of a marriage: 1) Truthfullness and dependability, 2) Sharing the work of survival, 3) Talking and listening, 4) Making Love, 5)Healing, and 6) Gifting and volunteering. While nothing in this section would surprise the reader, the honesty with which it is written provides the reader with clear insights into how to approach serving one's spouse. Wangerin also to discusses adultery and abusive relationships which primarily draw upon his concept of forgiveness.The strength of \\"As For Me and My House\\" as a guide to marriage rests in Wangerin's ability to translate Biblical principles into practical guides for improving one's relationship with their spouse. His credentials as a counseling pastor enable him to show real examples of the principles. Thus \\"As For Me and My House\\" is a book immediate impact which should prove useful to the reader with a genuine desire to build a spiritually satisfying marriage. The weakness of the book is that it was written almost twenty years ago and cultural norms and relationship patterns have changed significantly. Yet even while the reader may feel that Wangerin is coming from a different time, this does not in any way reduce the value and relevance of the lessons he seeks to teach."},{"Title":"As For Me And My House: Crafting Your Marriage To Last","review":"I thought it was a great book written by a man about marriage from a man's standpoint and view. The author had great insight into what makes a marriage and the sins committed in marraige that lead to failure. Often times sins against the marriage are not things that most people would even consider as sins, but the insightful way in which the author explained them, made understanding where most mistakes are made and most sins happen that eventually lead to the breakdown within the marriage and even the end for some, but it doesn't have to happen.

Not that I still didn't get a lot out of those books, but some of the ideas about women were very traditional and some of the expectations on women were extremely conservative and stereotypical. In As For Me and My House, Wangerin, respects woman and his treatment of both men and woman are fair, taking into consideration that not all women and men are the same.

Wangerin has been one of my favorite authors, and he does not disappoint in this book, offering marriage tools that are nothing like the self-help tips of other books in this class. His words are born from experience and a mixture of both pain and joy in marriage. He speaks as a pastor, a friend and counselor, offering priestly wisdom to marriages that are struggling or doing well. Every marriage can benefit from this Christ-centered model of forgiveness, repentance and long-suffering love. The book would make a great study book for small groups or a weekend marriage retreat and includes study questions and retreat suggestions.

He says that each person should do his or her chosen tasks for the good of the relationship. He also emphasizes that forgiveness is one of the primary tools and tasks of a good marriage.

For example, I started reading in the Bread section, and in 25 recipes, I found 24 typographical errors or omissions (like a recipe for whole wheat bread that doesn't tell you how much whole wheat flour to use, and a refrigerator roll recipe where you are never told to put the dough into the frig). If you are an experienced cook, you will probably do OK with this book using trial and error, but if you are inexperienced, it is frustrating beyond words."},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"I was really curious to see this book after seeing the disparity in the online reviews. This is an excellent source of information-- packed with interesting recipes, some of which purport to be (and sound as if they might be) from the pioneers. It certainly provides a wide selection of dishes and goodies to make using long-term storage foods such as whole grains, dried milk, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, etc. There are, however, enough recipes that don't use these foods to justify purchasing the book to add to your cookbook collection, even if you don't store dried foods. Okay, so it's poorly edited. There are asterisks that don't seem to refer to anything, numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and apparent omissions. But these don't render the book unusable. The reader will need to work around them. The author appears to assume that the reader can already cook. It certainly isn't a book for the novice in the kitchen! I'd recommend that the reader carefully read any recipe before trying it, considering whether it makes sense or whether there might be some omissions. In addition to the very interesting recipes, the book has useful information on emergency substitutions, reconstituting dried foods, quantities to store, and survival foods (what's out there in the wild that you can eat in a pinch). All in all, I'd say it's a great addition to your cookbook library, very reasonably priced, an interesting read, and a must-have if you're into long-term food storage--definitely worth the investment!"},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"I was very disappointed with this book because many of the recipes are inaccurate and incomplete. I have even called the author for clarification of a recipe but she would not respond. It seems like she had a lot of her friends submitt recipes for the book but did not really try the recipes herself, to see if they were complete and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"This book appears to have been thrown together without anyone trying the recipes to see if the results are actually edible, or if all the ingredients we were asked to gather were used. It is frustrating to be told to mix &quot;all ingredients,&quot; then two sentences later be told to put in another of the ingredients. This is one example of many. The directions are sketchy or downright inaccurate. There are so many obvious typos, that I wonder how many of the ingredients and amounts are accurate or are also typos. I dislike this book so much that I will not even give it away. What a waste of money. This book may be good on the &quot;lore&quot; side, but it is not a cookbook. I am still looking for a good cookbook tailored to home storage. This isn't it."},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"A helpful book in that it includes information on rehydrating freeze dried and dehydrated foods, how to cook and combine them, how to substitute stored foods in place of fresh ingredients and includes many recipes that a normal person would eat on a normal basis - soups, casseroles etc. But there are so many typographical and grammatical errors it is hard to believe this book made it through any proofreader at all. Although that aspect is very annoying, it is still the best reference cookbook available in this category and the most helpful."},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"Being new to breakmaking, I was excited to purchase this book so that I could begin making bread from my food storage. It doesn't appear that any of the recipes were tested because if you try and make the 100% Honey Wheat Bread - trust me, it doesn't work. I even enlisted an expert baker and she said there is no way this recipe would work as written. She even tried to rework this recipe with disappointing results. Makes me wonder if any of the recipes are worth even trying. Nothing worse than hoping for a wonderful outcome only to throw it in the trash. Which by the way is where this book is going to go. My advise is to ask a friend what cookbook they use and then buy that book. NOT this one. My guess is the author just wanted another cookbook under her belt and didn't care if any of the recipes worked."},{"Title":"Cookin' with Home Storage","review":"Some of the neccessary ingredients are not listed in many of the recipes, which makes me wonder if the authors ever tried out the recipes themselves.

It is a basic cookbook, meaning it uses BASIC ingredients such as granny had in her pantry and garden, such as flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, eggs, milk, beans and garden veggies and fruits. Over 700 recipes, 300 pages plus index. This is the book for you to have if you are the typical American woman of today who knows NOTHING about baking and from scratch. No shame, it is a sign of our times that many women unfortunately were not taught how to bake and cook. Drive-thru window is so much easier. Get this book and learn how to do it from a few simple ingredients in the pantry. Get this book and keep practicing. These ingredients are not expensive and you can afford to make a few mistakes in the learning process.

Reitz prompts a similar question: why does a man volunteer to spend his youth and early manhood fighting? Is it the example of others, the ideals, the adventure, the comradeship? And can any of these compensate for seeing comrades blown apart time and again.The absence of the need for a reply is one of Reitz's great achievements. His chosen role is to describe with apparent total objectivity his experiences in conflicts of historic importance for Britain and subequatoriial Africa. How else but with the exclusion of self can such horrific events be described. And how else except in excruciating detail can such testimony be justified? A torn limb or exposed intestines, when suffered by those you messed with the night before, are not minor things. Through all these tribulations Reitz seems to keep his spirits up. He is always game to push on, to see the field of battle from a better viewpoint, to visit friends in neighboring positions. And all the while he must be keeping notes.Reitz describes both the banal minutia and the broad sweep of war. He records how men suffered and fought and died, and lost and triumphed, in some of the most important campaigns in Europe and southern and eastern Africa, before and during the first Great War.This was no mean feat. Reitz was 17 when he entered the Boer War. What stimulus drove him from such an early age to keep a detailed record of all he saw and did? Was it pure chance that he participated in so many theatres? How fortunate he was fluent in Afrikaans, English and, apparently, German, and that his position, as the son of a Boer leader, allowed him to come into close contact with key figures of the time. These latter ranged from Paul Kruger and Jan Smuts to Winston Churchill. And what luck he could write!After reading \\"Commando\\" and \\"Trekking On\\" so many terrible images stick in the mind: the Boers at the end of their war in the bitter cold, with clothes in rags, collecting fallen unused cartridges in the wake of British columns; the thousands of horses dying of sleeping sickness in the Tanganyika campaign; the violent surreal life of First World War trenches.Reading his account today a century and more later is an illuminating and thought provoking experience and one that generates both abhorrence of war and deep admiration for the man, his people and his brothers-in-arms.But why, in the House of Emslie edition of \\"Trekking On\\" are we deprived of the description of Reitz's time in Madagascar? And why is the CruGuro edition of \\"Commando\\" the worst edited book I have ever come across? Reitz, and readers, deserve better."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"The Boers were Dutch colonists in South Africa. England invaded the two Boer republics when gold and diamonds were found near Johannesburg. For several years these independent farmers held their own against the most powerful empire in the world. Only when their families were rounded up and put into concentration camps, where many died of malnutrition and disease, did the Boers submit. Deneys Reitz, a young man who fought through the entire conflict, tells a compelling tale of resistance against tyranny."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"Deneys Reitz's COMMANDO: A BOER JOURNAL OF THE BOER WAR is one of the best autobiographic works on war written in the 20th Century. It belongs on the same bookshelf with other nonfiction classics of war including Robert Graves' GOOD BYE TO ALL THAT, and Ray Neil Johnson's HEAVEN, HELL, OR HOBOKEN. Reitz, Graves, and Johnson make their experiences come alive since they write narratives which read like novels. However, these are not works of fiction which makes them even more intriguing to the reader."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"Commando is the first and best known of the Deneys Reitz trilogy. It autobiographically tells the story of his part in the Boer War. He started as the sixteen year old son of a prominent Boer politician and ended with him joining Jan Smutts on his raid on Port Elizabeth. This is a story of guerrilla warfare based on minimal resources, for instance they used to visit the abandoned camp sites of British Columns just to pick up ammunition that the Tommies had dropped. They then used this to attack the very soldiers who had dropped it.However, at the end of the Boer War Reitz was unable to accept British rule and went into exile and this is where the second volume, Trekking On starts. After a disastrous effort at hauling freight by ox cart in Madagascar which nearly cost him is life, Reitz is persuaded by Smutts to return to South Africa where he regains his health and enters local politics. At the outbreak of W.W.II Reitz joins the South African Army and takes part in the putting down of the Maritz rebellion and the campaigns in East Africa. Once the Germans are defeated in Africa he travels to England and , having decided firmly which side he would prefer to be on, joins the British Army as a private. Following a chance meeting with Smutts in London he experiences a dizzying rise in rank and ends the war, after seeing much action as the Colonel of a famous Scottish regiment.The final book in the trilogy, No Outspan, covers Reitz's life in South African politics between the wars and concludes with him as Deputy Prime Minister of South Africa sitting on an advisory panel to Winston Churchill. in London. During this time he is visited by an Englishman who returned to him the Mauser rifle he took from him when Reitz became his prisoner during the Boer War. The last time I heard this rifle is still in the possession of Reitz's son and is regularly shot by him.The Trilogy has been published by Wolfe Publishing as a one volume set in recent years and if you see a copy for sale, grab it!"},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"Written by a teenager, albeit, a resourceful, fit, intelligent son of a farmer and distinguished South African, it recounts in considerable detail the honourable soldiering on horseback and mule of young Deneys Reitz. His many encounters with the enemy; the harsh weather, difficult landscape, starvation and disease on a guerilla operation that lasted over two years, is testament in part to luck, but also to his survival skills, marksmanship, courage and tenacity. A great read which should be read with some advantage in conjunction with The Boer War by Thomas Pakenham."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"Deneys Reitz joined the Boer forces fighting against the English in the 1900 / 02 Boer War in South Africa. While still in his late teens he fought in the famous battles of Spionkop and Nooitgedacht and took part in the seige of Kimberley. His book is an account of the mobile &quot;commando&quot; war and is compelling for its humanity and the historical perspective it gives of a war in which the civilian dead matched those who died in action and a war in which guerrilla tactics were used for the first time."},{"Title":"Commando;: A Boer journal of the Boer war, (The Faber library -)","review":"As a student of military history Reitz's book is well worth the read.

It's well laid out, and the beginning of the book has a good explanation of how and why parliamentary procedure works. It was written with beginners in mind. The order of precedence for motions is painstakingly and clearly laid out for the reader, as well as an explanation of why one motion takes precedence over another. Explanations of exactly what a motion does and an example of its use are included as well. Chapters are also included explaining the responsibilities of the chair, secretary, and treasurer, as well as a guide to setting agendas. That said, this is not, nor was it intended to be, a comprehensive guide to parliamentary procedure. For small or somewhat informal meeting, this book is all you need. For a large, formal group with professional officers, however, a full copy of Robert's Rules is recommended. This book is a great intro to parliamentary procedure, and is all you need to run most meetings. Even with larger groups, this is a wonderful book to keep at your elbow at meetings to use as a reference."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"Our volunteer fire company decided to follow Robert's Rules a couple of years ago. Unfortunately the President quit and took the only copy with him. I ordered this book not because I run the meeting, but so I (as Treasurer) can help the new President and trustees in following the rules that we agreed to.Although a relatively small paperback, it packs a lot of information. As it states, this book develops the overall concepts and specific procedures for running a meeting effectively and efficiently. It may take more than one reading to really get a handle on the how and why of ranking of motions, etc., but after doing so, I will certainly be able to assist the presiding officer of our meetings.While our organization will certainly be buying the unabridged version of Robert's Rules, I will be recommending we also purchase several copies of the Plain English version for use at meetings."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"This book was written in simple English and easy to understand and a good introductory text to parliamentary procedure. Since it is an introductory book, one may not find the information or details required on some topics. After reading this book, if you want for more information, then go and buy Roberts' Rules of Order Newly Revised (9th Edition, 1990), the source of this book."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"This book is amazing for younger people who are starting out learning parliamentary procedure. I am involved in 4-H, and in our county, all officers of 4-H clubs are required to learn parliamentary procedure. I am going to incorporate this book into their training. It is very simple to read, very easy to understand, and the examples are concise and relevent. I would not recommend this book for someone who is older and is involved in serious meetings that require a more in depth knowledge of Robert's Rules, but it works perfectly for my purposes, which is to educate people who have never been exposed to this information before. It is an excellent book for the beginner who is interested in the basics without getting bogged down by the hefty rules and vocabulary of Robert's Rules Newly Revised."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"Let's face it: Parliamentary Procedure is nothing but a bunch of hard to understand red tape.

Unless you are a lawyer, I'd say this is all you need to survive a meeting in Parli Pro."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"This short book is certainly no substitute for the full Robert's Rules of Order, but it is a good way for the reader to get a good grasp and overview of parliamentary procedure. It is tempting to get so bogged down in the particular rules of procedure that the underlying principles of order and efficiency for the assembly are overlooked.The author says in the opening portion of her book, &quot;Parliamentary procedure should be used to help and not hinder decision making. Robert said, 'The assembly meets to transact business, not to have members exploit their knowledge of parliamentary law.'&quot; (p. 6).I recommend reading this work first, then referring to the full volume of Robert's Rules if more detail is needed. For most people however, this work should be all that is required to possess a working knowledge of parliamentary procedure. As a Baptist pastor, I see this book as being particularly helpful to church leaders and members for their participation in business meetings, board meetings, and other decision-making assemblies. The knowledge contained in this volume is well-worth the price!"},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"The book is a decent primer and is certainly more readable than Robert's original book. Of course the original and all of its editions remain an example of very incomprehensible and convoluted language even for its era. However, I have to handle large meetings of very strong-willed, intelligent people, so I found the \\"Plain English\\" book not very useful.

For example, Zimmerman recommends using unanimous consent whenever possible to expidite business, and gives concrete examples on how to do this.You will probably eventually want to buy the full &quot;Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; to complete your study of parliamentary procedure. If you read Zimmerman first, RONR will be alot easier to digest. On the other hand, you may not need RONR, as all the most commonly encountered rules are covered quite well in Zimmerman. Sure, if you run into disciplinary problems, or want more details about how to write bylaws, you will need to look in RONR, but for the day to day running of most club/association/church meetings Zimmerman's book is a great guide."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"When attempting to start as a novice on this matter of envolvement with a small board and how to be part of the monthly board meeting I was in total ignorance. I started by researching Robert's Rules of Order. To have to read or find important information tucked inside a 700 + pages was more then I had time for. I went to your web site to see if anything of a simple nature was available in print. Thanks for the information, reviews, and the speedy service in delivery of this book. It was easy to read and exactly what I needed to educate me on the rules of orded for my circumstances.I recommend all those in my situation to buy this book."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"Before reading this book, I had only heard of Robert's Rules of Order, but had never understood what they were or why they were so commonly used. As I read this, lightbulbs kept turning on in my head as it explained many things I'd seen but did not realize they were so formally described. It made me laugh at the farcical meetings I've been to in the past that were supposedly run according to Robert's Rules but were instead terribly managed. I appreciated this book's approach to showing examples, by using the same scenario and looking at it from different perspectives relevant to the topic being discussed, rather than using multiple scenarios that might have hidden or confused the point. The topic is somewhat dry, but this book succeeded in making me interested in using Robert's Rules in the future, and also in learning more details to ensure I apply them correctly. The book isn't perfect, but it's good enough that I could see buying more copies to give to others."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"It is very clear and easy to read"},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"Have NOT received this book - promised 3/25.

One of the troubles with our society and our young people today is that the more we seem to try to spend on them and teach them the more we move aways from basic critical thinking and basic knowledge requirements for success, towards merely using them as social or political tools for our own ends. They need basic foundational knowledge to survive in the world and the school systems are not giving that due to purely partisan curriculums on many campuses. This basic knoweldge of how meetings and debates/government should work is essential to giving our children the skills necessary to be active, participating citizens in our ever shrinking world.A great beginning book that even children can learn from.I have already given out dozens to organizations for both adults and youth groups as a means to enlighten them on appropriate processes in getting involved in groups, clubs, government and other entities."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules in Plain English","review":"I found the book as represented and easy to read and it has all the simple answers that you might need quickly.

Constantly emphasizing common sense and etiquette, it is a handy tool especially in today's world where passion tends to dominate reason."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Eco's problem with this book is essentially that he gives himself too much leeway. This is an extremely talented author who is aware that he is good and (more prominently) aware that he is intelligent. Consequently, he has a strong and rather arrogant tendency to believe that he can carry almost anything off and keep his readers interested. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not.As far as my personal thoughts go...well, Eco is definitely a treasure, a literary icon in some respects, and undoubtedly one of the truly groundbreaking stylistic authors working today. That's well-known and rather obligatory in a review. I won't deny it. To the general audience, though, I'll descend off of Highbrow Mountain (which we're all desperate to claim our place on) and say that this is a weird book and Eco is a weird writer. He's humorous but a bit cold, passionate but not particularly easy to relate to. Or perhaps that's Yambo. Who knows?At any rate, let's begin with the good, and go to the bad. So. The Good: Eco has a stunning knowledge of literature, and intertextuality is an omnipresent force in this novel. To pick up on a lot of the points he tries to make or the moods he tries to put across, you really need to recognize at least some of what he's quoting, or take some time to be a more scholastic than casual reader. As I've said above, Eco is very smart, and that's splashed liberally over nearly every page. His imagery is dreamy and eloquent, and Yambo's ruminations are expertly managed. Also, the book ends on a high note, with a bolt of surprising poignancy and raw emotional depth. Eco has the flame when he wants it, and he can call down bolts of literary lightning with a wave of his hand. Pity he doesn't unleash the storm until the last forty pages or so.Now for the Bad: Eco really isn't terribly good at plot, or if he has the ability in him, doesn't choose to exercise it here. The book lags in the middle, and even if, like myself, you're aware of a lot of the Italian history he goes into, you'll likely find yourself skimming over his excruciatingly detailed lists of books and comics Yambo goes through. I imagine that many casual readers will simply stop here, as Eco seems to rely on his flair as a writer to compensate for the fact that there really seems to BE no point to it all, no reason to keep going. Granted, Yambo's recovery from amnesia may be something, but there's no sense, at least for the majority of the book, that there's anything particularly interesting in Yambo's past anyway. It matters to him, but not particularly to us, the readers. Eco left me, at least, at a loss as to why I should actually care. Also, his characterization can feel a little cold, as I noted above. Yambo is a very intellectual man, almost to a fault. He reasons things over and over, to an almost absurd extent. There is not a single passage in the first two portions of the novel in which Yambo does not wonder if some triviality of his life might be writ large, applied to explain, psychologically, many of his later actions. This is natural to some extent, but Yambo is portrayed as a clever enough man that it really should just be a kneejerk reaction, quickly mastered: he should KNOW that the odds against a single poem he happens to find in his old textbook having shaped his life forever are astronomical. But he keeps making up new theories anyway, until I'm rooting for the next stroke to carry him away.Also, although this may be a problem with the translation, Eco really cannot write children. Yambo's papers written at age 10 and 11 are laughably verbose, and his portrayal of a child's thoughts and fancies are strained at best, almost as though Eco is desperate to let his customary scholarly style bubble back to the surface.So...all in all, an interesting, diverting little book. It may even be art. But it's unquestionably a triumph of style over substance, almost as though Eco planned it so for his personal ego project (and Good God, if there was ever a man to embark on one of those...) The text is strikingly well-done in metaphor and in theme and clever allusion. But is it a good STORY?No. Emphatically no. It's really not worth reading for the story alone, with little dramatic development until the very end and little or no reason given as to why anyone should identify with these characters, even the main character. These figures are not part of a story as such. This is not meant to be an account about fictional people that real people might sympathize with and root for. This is essentially a painting made of words. Eco is giving us a simple static depiction, lacking motion, and defying us to break the spell of his art and realize, like Yambo, that the whole thing is essentially pointless, an endeavor predicated on something that doesn't exist.I have a better solution: unless you're genuinely interested in literature for its own sake, as fine art rather than story, just don't pick the damn thing up. I'm serious. I have small patience for elitist experimentation unless you are genuinely interested in and have a passion for the style. If you are contemplating reading this book purely to say you read an Umberto Eco novel, or because someone told you this was what the clever people read, then I say to you...*Blows raspberry. Loudly. And with gusto*"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is a portrait of a dying man in a coma. From page one he never returns to consciousness, he only imagines he has. His loss of his personal memory, the aid of his wife and friends, and his journey to his boyhood home are all the stirrings of his own tortured mind. The key moment is when he discovers the priceless Shakespeare portfolio in the attic. In an earlier sequence the 'discovery' of such a book is depicted as always being a sham. He is dying as he anticipates the vision of the first instance that he beheld his childhood sweetheart(Beatrice) descending the school stairs. An avalanche ensues and he cannot see her. His mind is overwhelmed/confused by images of cartoon portraits of the 'eternal feminine', echoes of Catholicism and his wife who he loves in some form, but never as wholy as he should. His idea/l of woman had been distorted from childhood by cartoons that we in the 21st century would describe as mostly innocent compared to what is presented in the media today. Beatrice never appears and darkness enfolds. A poetic attack on cultural pluralism."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I've read all of Eco's novels, and \\"Flame\\" is another excellent read. I gave it four stars only because I too struggled with the plodding nature of Third section. But, this should not discourage Eco fans from reading this wonderful book. The blend of graphic images and text was extremely well done."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I have read most of Umberto's books whom I found to be one of the best writers of his time. Nevertheless, Baudolino and this book are in my opinion not even close to his higher standard.The mysterious flame of queen loana, lacks any sort of emotion, is boring, so boring you end up counting the pages to the end.If you are into comics, WW2, old book names and weird old music titles you might be interested on a 100 pages of it...there is no mistery so do not get your hopes up....simply a flat boring book!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I found this novel discounted down to $1 at a CLOTHING resale store (don't ask me which), and it's likely the best dollar I've ever spent! Like others, I was hesitant about starting this book. I think I owned it for about 3 or 4 months before I even took a look inside. It intimidated me, which sounds stupid (and likely is). I'm very cautious about trying new authors, new genres, and translated texts. I own Don Quijote in English and Spanish because of this (and yes, it does lose alot in translation). I'm one of those people who almost devours books like Cookie Monster (used to) devours chocolate chip cookies. That being said, this book is great!When I started telling people about this book, I'd only read part one. I referred to it as my \\"schizophrenic\\" book (ironic, since Yambo references chizophrenia often in part 2) because the language and jumping from one thought/memory to another made me dizzy and cross-eyed. I loved it, but it took some getting used to. Part 2 slowed down to a pace I enjoy and wasn't so scatter-brained. The entire book had me laughing out loud and gasping with surprise and awe at numerous parts (some of which I had to share with friends and family).This book is everything (on my list) that makes a great book. I don't like predictably happy endings or predictable plots, etc. There was very little predictablilty in this book (I won't share spoilers). I wouldn't say this book is for everyone, but it's like a Dickens novel... If you can hack the style, you'll love it! I'm planning on gathering an Umberto Eco collection for my library!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I recently heard Umberto Eco interviewed on NPR regarding his new novel \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana\\" and was intrigued. However, upon reading the book I was extremely disappointed. The concept was original, but the book was monotonous and unrealistic. What man loses his memory and then seems to accept blindly what others tell him? Although he returns to his country home of Solara to regain his childhood memories, at no time does he receive professional help or seem to be really bothered by living among strangers. He accepts everything as if it really doesn't bother him to not recognize or know anyone. He certainly is an emotionless character and the reader doesn't feel any empathy. The book was dry and emotionless. The most interesting part is when he is in a coma. I would not recommend this book. I feel like I wasted my time. Maybe his other works are better-- I just don't have any interest in pursuing them anymore."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"In the hands of any less accomplished writer, the idea of an illustrated novel might be reduced in the end to nothing more than a simple graphic novel, but Eco's polished prose and trademark intricate structuring and staging of his plot make the novel much more than an illustrated novel. The images are so instrumental in the unveiling of the story that I found myself a third of the way through the book feeling as though I was actually reading the images as if they were printed words on the page. I would also highly recommend this tale of an amnesiac, antiquarian book dealer journeying into his past to try to understand his present to those readers who might have found Eco's other novels, such as \\"The Name of the Rose\\", and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" to be too heady and voluminous to plod through. This novel is infinitely more readable than most of the author's other works."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Cut about 150 pages and this would be an interesting read.Eco uses a book collector's failed memory as an opportunity to explore what it was like to live as a young boy in WWII Italy. Of itself, that sounded like an interesting topic.What it turns into, however, is mind-numbing cataloguing of song lyrics, books, comic books, newspapers, etc. Where one or two examples might have been interesting, Eco gives us dozens. Yawn.I'm a huge Eco fan, but don't waste your time here: Foucault's Pendulum , and The Name of the Rose are masterful. Even The Island of the Day Before, not his best work, is more worth the effort."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Fans of Umberto Eco will undoubtedly find joy and wonder in THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA, but others may be less than enthralled by his latest book. I admit to not having read any of Eco's earlier books, having perhaps been put off by the hoopla over THE NAME OF THE ROSE. I picked up QUEEN LOANA on a whim, intrigued by Eco's use of 1930's vintage photographs and cartoon images so soon after Jonathan Safran Foer's similar (and critically much maligned) use of photos in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE.QUEEN LOANA combines two classic \\"search\\" themes into a single story line: personal identity and idealized \\"true\\" love. Eco's approach is unique. His main character, Giambattista Boldoni (known by his family and friends as Yambo) awakens in a stroke-induced fog, strangely attached to prose and poems about fog that he believes he has collected throughout his life. He suffers from a peculiar amnesia in which he can remember almost verbatim everything he has ever read, but nothing he has personally experienced. His name, his wife and children and grandchildren, his past lovers, his childhood - all are gone from his direct recall. He has to relearn who and what he is and what he has done.With his wife's consent, he visits his family's country home, Solara, where he both grew up and also survived Mussolini and World War II as they raged through the Italy of his boyhood. It is in Solara (sol, or sun, cutting through Yambo's amnesiac fog?) that he hopes to piece together his pre-stroke life from his grandfather's books, his childhood notebooks, and whatever toys, magazines, and records he can find in that old house. For the most part, Yambo's quest is a failure, yet events conspire to open more doors into his past even as he loses control over his own life. We slowly learn who Yambo is and why certain words and objects resonate emotionally for him despite his failed memory, and we come to know the story of his mysterious flame, his unattainable first love. Yet we are never sure if what we know is true, since memory is selective even in non-amnesiacs, creating its own version of the past for each of us. Eco leaves us to wonder if we know the real Yambo, or just the one Yambo wants, or wants us, to believe he is.The plot device of failed memory, of recovering one's amnesia-afflicted identity, is rich in metaphorical promise and plot potential. In QUEEN LOANA, however, we are asked to accept that an otherwise intelligent stroke victim, an antiquarian book dealer by trade, would rely almost exclusively on old books and music to learn who he is rather than draw upon friends, family, and business associates. Of course, such a presumption opens the floodgates for Eco to indulge in the cultural detritus of 1930's and 1940's Italy, as well as Europe and the United States to lesser extents. The resulting discourses on child literature, comic books and pop culture from that period begin as interesting but gradually send the story into a dramatic tailspin. The fact that virtually no other character beside Yambo has a presence, and that Yambo himself is drawn as singularly cold and socially distant, makes the story feel slow and rambling (although that is presumably consistent with Yambo's own experience trying to recreate his own life's story). Not only did I not identify with Eco's main character, I found him dry and shriveled, like an Italian olive left in the hot sun. His preoccupation with books and literary images to the exclusion of human relationships other than those he remembers, or perhaps only imagines, makes it difficult for the reader to sympathize with his plight or care deeply about his fate.As I read THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA, I repeatedly thought of Christopher Nolan's movie MEMENTO, a fascinating murder mystery seen through the eyes of a man who retains no short term memory. QUEEN LOANA suffers for the comparison. The plot drags, turns surprisingly predictable in places (does anyone not guess immediately what the boy Yambo's involvement will be when the Cossacks are trapped by Germans in fogbound San Martino?), and finally turns on the dual deus ex machinae of a hidden room and a rare Shakespearean folio. Eco's characters are surprisingly wooden, ranging from his all-but-invisible wife Paola to the philosophizing solder Gragnola to Solara's maidservant Amalia (who is translated into some sort of Brooklyn hillbilly spouting \\"Jumping Jehoshaphat,\\" \\"...them records...,\\" and \\"...what a noggin!\\"). True Eco fans will certainly find their pleasures here, but readers hoping for human drama, or even a compelling mystery on the level of THE NAME OF THE ROSE will, I think, be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I appreciate other reviewers' positive comments and ratings, since I appreciate Eco's technical skills and erudition. Further, Name of the Rose is still one of the most enjoyable and well written thrillers I have ever read. Unfortunately, I just couldn't keep plowing through page after page of reminiscence over obscure comic book or other literary references. I suspect those readers able to do so eventually were rewarded, but after the 50th such page I simple found the book unreadable and quit. I'll have to wait for the next Eco book for something more accessible and conventional."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Once again, semiotician-novelist Umberto Eco surprises us, delights us, but mostly plays with us in \\"Queen Loana.\\" It's premise is simplicity itself: Antiquarian book dealer Giambattista (Yambo) Bodoni has suffered a stroke at age 59.5 in 1991. As a result, as his doctor explains, he's lost his episodic memory--the episodes of his own life--even though he can speak and read, and he knows the identities of Napoleon, McArthur, Mussolini, etc. etc. But he doesn't recognize his own wife, and when he returns to work he has no idea if he's ever had an affair with his young assistant (she never explains).At the urging of his doctor and his family he leaves his Milanese home to return to his family's country home, where he unearths a treasure trove of Italian popular culture from the Fascist era. This allows Prof. Eco to journey through comic books (including Italian versions of Mickey Mouse), popular fiction, magazine illustrations, newspaper articles, photomontages of Il Duce, and the like--many of which are reproduced in this handsomely designed volume.It's part history, part fiction, part lecture on that wartime popular culture, and part a search for a lost love (alright--infatuation); and there's also a chilling wartime thriller lurking within. It ends (in a Deco daze of glorious color) with the Book of Revelation as told through the pages of Flash Gordon. And when it did, I could almost imagine the author, peering over my shoulder, seeing me smile, chuckling, \\"ah, you liked that, did you?\\"Yes.Notes and asides: Geoffrey Brock's translation is whatever's better than first-rate. Giambattista Bodoni (1740-1813) designed a typeface (a truetype version is likely loaded on your own computer). As is noted on the copyright page, however, Prof. Eco's book is set in Sabon and Interstate. Another of the author's winks and nudges?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"For me, the best part of the book was the view of everyday Italian life during World War II. This is a perspective that I hven't encountered often, and Eco does a brilliant job painting a small town that has gone \\"schizophrenic\\" in the eyes of the young Yambo.Eco creates such a wealth of characters and builds such intensity around a rather simple idea -- remembering the face of a first love. Unfortunately, I felt the ending was rather weak. Without giving away too much, I'll just say that I felt let down. The resolution was hinted at throughout the book, especially if for readers familiar with other Eco books.Still, I have to recommend this book because the journey through a person's memories, whether real or imagined, is so intriguing and well-executed. There is a lot to think about with this book. I only wish Eco had devised a more clever finale."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I recently read the Mysterious Flame of Queen Loanna, by Umberto Eco.I always look forward to reading Umberto Eco, ever since I read Foucalt's Pendulum, which is a masterwork of literature to which Dan Brown's efforts are pale shadows.In this book Umberto Eco tackles one of his favorite themes, the nature of identity and it's relationship to memory. The main character has had a stroke, resulting in complete amnesia, although no other impairment. Using the device of the main character's attempt to reconstruct his past, Umberto Eco explores whether the illusions and hopes of our youth are central to our identity as adults. The book meanders slowly towards what appears to be a conclusion, but ends up fogging out into thin air. This may be the conclusion of the book- that there is no answer, but then why write the book? Eco's books usually end in an ambigous way, but this was the least satisfying ending to an Eco book I have read.The Island of the Day Before did a much better job of exploring this question, and in my opinion Eco didn't really finish The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loanna so much as give up on it. The exploration of 1930s and 40s Italian contemporary culture was fascinating and engaging, and this is still a good book, but not Umberto Eco's finest effort.If you are an Eco fan, read this book. You'll enjoy it, and certainly it's better than the great expanse of trash you'd otherwise be forced to sift through. The wide ranging ideas and the courage to take on impossible themes are vintage Eco, and as usual invigorating. I just wish I hadn't finished the book. Which is ultimately my final judgement. This book is about a journey a well written, fascinating, and intriguing journey, but maybe it's a journey that shouldn't have ended yet."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Yambo is a 60 year old, rare book dealer who suffers an unfortunate stroke. Subsequent to suffering this terrible malady, he loses his memory of everything, himself, family, grandchildren. However, the words he has read: poems, scenes from novels, comic books, fashion magazines are to spark a flame.Yambo's psychologist wife Paola, whom Yambo has cheated on time and time again (yet he does not remember this also, tries to in the bare essentials of his family history, however she stops short because Yambo must make his own memories, or rather re-discover his own memories/past.In order to jostle his dormant memory-bank, Yambo embarks, alone, on a pilgramage of sorts to his ancestral home at Solara. This home is a veritable museum; an old employee of the family- a servant of sorts, who plays the role of the family currator, encourages Yambo to roam, at will, this large country house with an improbably intact collection of family papers, comic books, various and sundry works of literature, recent to ancient, propaganda from facist Italy, gramophone records, and old family photographs.Yambo obsesses with the minutest details of these artifacts, rereading almost everything he read as a school boy, blazing a meandering, sometimes misguided, often enchanting trail of words. Flares of recognition do come, like \\"mysterious flames,\\" but these only signal that Yambo remembers something; they do not return that memory to him. It is like being handed a wrapped package, the contents of which he can only guess.Perhaps the most poignant of all subplots in this work is when he contacts his friend Gianni wanting to know about a long-lost love interest he had in high school. The details of this, too lengthy to flesh out in this review, cause Yambo to have another stroke; his blood pressure, which is an issue throughout the book, fells him again and he is meandering throughout his psyche while in a coma, comfortable, yet coming to grips with the meaning of his existance.With the exception of the arcana of Italian culture circa WWII, this book is an enjoyable read and an adventure of the mind. One and one half thumbs up."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This book was certainly a first for me, both in the choice of author and also the format of the book. I have never before read an adult novel that was also lavishly illustrated with both colour and monochrome images of comics, record sleeves and other ephemera. Not only is the book unique, at least in my own experience but is also hugely fascinating and entertaining..Yambo, a rare-book dealer has had what can only be described as a selective loss of memory. He can remember every book he has ever read, but nothing else about his life.In an effort to remember his past life he returns to his old family home in the hope that something will trigger his brain into remembering things from his past. He searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics and records that have been stored in the attic and this way he begins to relive his youth.His memories begin to run wild and the life he could not remember begins to race before his eyes in the form of the objects he finds from his boyhood. Yambo struggles through the memories to capture one simple innocent image . . ."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Giambatista Bodoni, alias signorino Yambo, is a sixty-year old antiquarian book dealer. He suffers from retrograde amnesia and since there are two kinds of explicit memories, the semantic memory and the episodic memory, Yambo can remember things he read in books or was told - which are generated by the first type of memory - but not the things associated with his direct personal experience - which are stored in the second type of memory. He can't remember his wife Paola, his two daughters Carla and Nicoletta but he can recite countless quotations from the many books he has read.So Yambo gets slowly acquainted again with his surroundings, his relatives, his shop and his pretty assistant Sibilla. But he can't remember whether he fell in love with her although he hasn't forgotten all the tricks of the trade he needs for shopping at international auctions for rare books. He is shown family albums filled with faces which mean nothing to him so that his entire memory consists of the books he has read. Then Yambo decides to go to their country house in Solara to try to trace back his childhood with the help of his \\"paper memory\\" since it is there he can find all his early readings.Once settled in the attic of the Solara house, Yambo is surrounded by piles of books, magazines, cartoons, photographs and toys. He reflects on such topics as the articles in the \\"Nuovissimo Melzi\\", his favourite passages in books like \\"The Count Of Montecristo\\", \\"Huit jours dans un grenier\\" or the adventures of Buffalo Bill. He remembers the characters of his childhood, Captain Flint, Ciuffettino, Pipino, Sherlock Holmes, the Camicie Nere and the fascist propaganda. He listens to songs and anthems of the Mussolini epoch with the help of his grandfather's record collection.And one day he stumbles upon a \\"Tim Tyler's Luck\\" album featuring a story called \\"La misteriosa Flamma della Regina Loana\\" which brings back the memory of his first love for a girl called Lila Saba whose features have haunted him all his life.The story ends in a flurry or firework of literary protagonists, singers, film stars and cartoon characters descending a large staircase as though Yambo had lost control over his literary memories in a \\"radiant apocalypse\\".An imposing novel where Mr Eco shows what an erudite writer he is regarding matters of literature, politics, history and religion. The question of memory is important in this novel as Yambo realises that one cannot regard relics from one's childhood at the age of sixty in the same manner as one did when one was eight or thirteen."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I made it to page 150 before I decided to give up on \\"The Mysterious Flame.\\" I thought the book had a lot of potential as a mystery novel without all the cliche and overwrought plot. Instead what I got was a mumbling main character who never remembers anything of importance and asks himself the same questions over and over: Was this from my childhood? Did I make this memory up? Am I imagining a past for myself?Interspersed between the redundant self-doubt were descriptions of various toys, books, and pieces of art, most of which have pictures in the novel. Nothing much interesting about the descriptions; I could have just looked up the art on the internet if I were interested.Nothing wrong with the prose--Eco knows his words. Just a boring, boring story."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Like many other Eco fans I keep looking for books of at least the same quality as the Name of the Rose.The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is rather disapointing, except the first third which is well written and promising.Unless you are a fan of Ialian interbellic media you will find a lot of boring information and the rest is not so satisfying either."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"At first, I had trouble getting into this novel, but once I realized that the narrator is a stroke victim trying to reconstruct his memories and figure out who he is, it was easy to float in the swim of things. His memory is a wild jumble of all the novels, comic books, songs, and movies from his childhood. Once I realized it was not necessary to identify every quotation (We can leave that to the grad students into semiotics), it became an easy read. What makes the novel delightful is page after page of full-color illustrations of the books, comic books, match covers, movie posters, cigarette pack labels, and record album covers that he is discovering in the boxes and closets at his grandfather's old house. (He makes his own Proust references.) If you like Art Deco, you will love all of these colorful little pictures. As the narrator slowly pieces together his past as a boy in WW II Italy, things build to a great climax. Because of all the pictures alternating with short paragraphs, this book quite literally does become a fast page-turner in the final chapter. This is not a light breezy read. It's going to take some intellectual committment on the part of the reader, but the ultimate rewards will be worth it when you hit the payoffs of the final chapters. I certainly will not forget this book."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"\\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, Eco's fifth novel, follows Giambattista \\"Yambo\\" Bodoni, a man who loses his memory after an accident. In an attempt to deal with his amnesia, he travels to his childhood home, where he reconstructs his life through a collection of old newspapers, comic books, school papers, record albums, and his grandfather's diary. After a few days he is visited by another misfortune, and slips into a coma where he begins to have increasingly strange hallucinations. The work is heavily illustrated with accompanying images reflecting Yambo's collection of memorabilia.\\"Not as strange as The Island of the Day Before, but as compelling, Queen Loana gives us an Italian perspective of the war era through pop culture of the time. I was particularly fascinated by the translated comics, like Flash Gordon or Mickey Mouse. Many of the pieces come from the author's collection, giving us an intimate peak at Eco's own history.Yambo, the protagonist, is as hazy as the fog he is so fascinated with, and so are the other characters in the book, mere sketches as backdrop to time travel. This is especially evident during the coma section, where pop culture takes over as reality. Challenging, fascinating, bizarre. Pure Eco."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana details the life of Yambo; a Milanese rare book dealer as he recovers from a bout of amnesia brought about by a stroke. As Yambo wakes up, he realizes that the only memories left with him are those he picked up reading books.The book details the steps he takes to try recover his lost memories - from moving to his childhood home to spending days in the attic re-exploring books and comics from his past. This journey eventually leads him to one of the deepest and most touching memories, a memory around which his whole life revolves, that of his true love.Rediscovering that memory brings a flow of sentiments and deep feelings as well as a sense of accomplishment for Yambo. He now takes steps forward to try and piece together what happened to his first love; the love of his life...Umberto Eco's writing is incredibly clear and historically accurate; aided by illustrations and lyrics, he goes about exploring the small pieces of media that end up forming who we really are - from a comic book that first detailed the sensual beauty of a woman, to a song Yambo listened to when he was a child.However this book is not for the faint-hearted; Eco takes his time detailing the steps Yambo takes in discovering himself - often delving into minutae that might discourage even the bravest of readers - however in the end it is well worth it. Touching without being soppy, this book has climbed its way into a list of my most favourite.SELECT QUOTES:\\"For me, though, it was enough. Following Cyrano, line by line, with her in front of me, multiplied my vertigo. I no longer remember the actress who played Roxane on stage, because my Roxane was right before my eyes. I felt I could tell when she was moved by the drama... and I was utterly convinced that she was moved not with me, but over me, because of me. I could ask for nothing more; myself, Cyrano, and her.\\"The book delves into the reason for Yambo's existence: pure unadulterated love for a childhood crush. This girl, which he feels this life-consuming passion for, has such an effect on him that he still has feelings of love for her to this very day. The fact that he could never brush his fingers against her lips or even steal one kiss from her intensifies this and leaves the reader with the ultimate unanswerable question: Is it better to have loved and lost, or never to have loved at all?"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],G={key:0},E={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",G,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-3682c2ed"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/47.md","filePath":"library/47.md"}'),D={name:"library/47.md"},q=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,q as default};
