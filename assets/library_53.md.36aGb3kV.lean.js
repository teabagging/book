I highlyrecommend this as a book you won't want to put down!!!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I'm a big fan of Lee Child...his character is a man's man who keeps his cool in tough situations and is a very accomplished warrior...he is good at creating interesting situations for his protagonist...I've read most of Child's books and will read his new ones as they come out"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the fourth of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. It's a difficult book to review for me because I thoroughly enjoy the characters, the fast paced plot, and the intrigues. As an action/mystery novel this is an outstanding book. I could barely put it down. I've really enjoyed each of Child's novels.Here we find Reacher getting himself into trouble once again by being in the wrong place at the wrong time and winding up smack in the middle of the hunt for a serial killer. There are many plot twists and some great false foreshadowing. The end caught me completely by surprise. Child fooled me and had me going down the wrong path of who the killer really was.The huge downturn is that the plot and set up is so farfetched and so unbelievable that it really ruined my suspension of disbelief. Granted, this sounds a little odd since most novels of this genre, including previous books in this series, have some pretty outlandish unbelievable plots. However, here Child paints an FBI that takes corruption to a level that only the most hard core conspiracy theorist could ever swallow. I think police organizations in this country,including the FBI are morally bankrupt and corrupt -- but Child goes beyond that to fantasy. What's worse is that even if the FBI is as corrupt as what they are painted to be in the novel -- the motive of the FBI officers in this case make no sense whatsoever. In short, the setup is absurd on the grounds of logic, if nothing else. He could have written a better novel had he not take such an approach.Thus, yes I enjoyed the book -- but at the same time am irritated by it and give it poor rating."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action, originality and excellent storyline twists which keep you guessing right to the last page. Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Don't be caught out! I was eager to buy this book having read all the others in the series, but I see from other reader's reviews that this story is published under 2 different titles. In the UK this book is known as &quot;The Visitor&quot;. I find it a little strange that this one should be different as all the other stories are known by just 1 title. That apart this is just as gripping a story as all the others and I eagerly await the next one!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This was my first Reacher novel and I know that Mr Child is a popular author so I had a reasonably high expectation. I actually found Reacher a little irritating, although street smart he is too much of a loner and too inclined to be difficult. The FBI came over as more manipulative then I would expect of your premier law agency and, while the story moved me along, it was a little obvious at times. I predicted the methodology of the murders very early on although the who and why was a little less obvious. Overall it occupied a couple of hours and was worth the effort but this was not the top notch thriller I expected it to be."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"As I've indicated in my previous reviews of Lee Child's novels, his hero-with-an-attitude, Jack Reacher, former Army Military Police major turned vagabond-who-attracts-trouble, is one of my favorite squinty-eyed tough guys - right up there with Dirty Harry himself.In RUNNING BLIND, Jack finds himself being coerced by a very nasty and un-American FBI to help the agency track down a serial assassin of ex-Army women, who, while in service, had been the objects of sexual harassment and had subsequently complained. Each of those murdered has been found in her bathtub submerged in camouflage-green paint, with no evidence of a struggle or apparent cause of death. Initially, he FBI tries to enlist Reacher's co-operation by pretending he's the chief suspect. When that ruse falls flat, they indirectly threaten to have his current girlfriend tortured and murdered by a local sadist. I mean, is this the FBI of Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. that those of us old enough to remember all know and love? (The \\"FBI\\" was a TV series in the late 60's/early 70's, in which the House That Hoover Built was depicted as the righteous, square-jawed defender of God-blessed America from sea to shining sea.)Inasmuch as Child has Jack pursuing a serial killer, this latest potboiler swerves close to becoming a conventional who-dunit. However, the usual excellence of a Reacher thriller is achieved by Jack's ability to stare down and outwit the Feds, carry on relationships (of a sort) with three very different women, and nail the Bad Guy besides. With a Man's Man like this, who needs Harry? The latter is definitely pass&eacute; and out to pasture in Carmel.The absolutely very best thing about RUNNING BLIND is the plot twist identity of the Perp. Even Reacher himself is fooled for a brief moment. (\\"Say it ain't so, Joe!\\") Because of this, I must say that this is Child's finest effort to date. Bring on the next one \`cuz I'm ready to buy!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"What can i say about a book in which i can pick out the murderer a quarter of the way through it? I'm used to LeCarre, Ambler, Greene, Sandford and others of far better quality. Child wants the reader to believe the FBI is run by morons. While this may be the popular view, I don't subscribe to it and neither will countless others after they think about what this book suggests. I can't detail the offending matters without giving away the plot, but trust me: you don't want to waste your time or money on this. Contact me and i'll send you my copy. It won't be in my library long."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The latest book in the Jack Reacher novels, Lee Child has penned an enjoyable thriller. Ex-MP Reacher, although he was blackmailed by the FBI into taking the job, finds that his hunt for the vicious serial killer of young women who were at one time enlisted in the US Army, is a job he is more than qualified to undertake. Well developed characters, and what seems like behind-the-scenes knowledge of the subject matter make this an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The fourth book in the Reacher series lacks the action, pacing and plausibilty of the earlier novels. A careful reader sees the ending coming long before one should. Like Reacher, the book feels burdened by house, girlfriend and responsibility. Put him back on the road, before he stops being as entertaining as he was in the earlier books."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"RUNNING BLIND by Lee Child.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The story starts off in an exciting way with thugs demanding payoffs from a new restaurant owner. Reacher likes the restaurant and takes action. That was fun. But after that there was very little action, not enough. It was a long, drawn out process trying to solve the murders, but no one figured anything out until the very end. I'm reminded of the Michael Connelly books which have interesting discoveries along the way. That was missing here. For maybe the last third of the book, I had a good guess as to who and how, but Jack and others appeared kind of dumb because they never considered this. Sure, the author gave the reader more hints than Jack got, but I felt the characters should have been more open minded. Instead, I kept hearing it's impossible. The first third of the book was pretty good due to anticipation, but the end was a letdown.I really like the Reacher character and the series. Although I had problems with this book, it still kept my interest, and I plan to read the next one.The FBI does really bad things to force Reacher to work on the case. At the end, the FBI does more really bad things. I hated the FBI's actions and threats almost more than what the killer was doing. So I didn't feel good at the end of the book.I wanted the killer to suffer. So far in all four books, the bad guy is quickly killed at the end. I wanted to see them get caught, see them suffer, hear their words after they realized it was over. Especially in this book, I wanted to hear what the killer would have said about motive and methods. Without those insights and feelings, the ending was empty.I did not like the author throwing in one character as a red herring. The purpose was to confuse the reader. It wasn't explained, justified, or done well.One thing odd about Reacher is that he doesn't travel with clothes. He only has what he is wearing. He sometimes showers, but then he puts on the same clothes. He doesn't do laundry. I'm sure his clothes smell. In previous books he would buy cheap new clothes and throw away the old. He wasn't buying any new clothes in this book. This is one of those suspend disbelief items. Just don't think about it.STORY BRIEF:A serial killer is killing women who were raped or sexually harassed while in the military. The men who hurt them were put in jail or lost their jobs. The women left the military. The FBI profilers think the killer is someone like Reacher. Since the first two victims knew him, the FBI have Reacher under surveillance. They learn Reacher is innocent when a 3rd victim is killed while they were watching him. Now the FBI forces Reacher to help them solve the case. They believe his military contacts and experiences will be useful. They threaten Reacher's girlfriend to keep him in line.THE SERIES:If you haven't read any Reacher before, start with books 1 and 2. You do not need to read them in order. There are at least sixteen books so far. My ratings and order of the first four books are:4 stars. Killing Floor4 stars. Die Trying4 stars. Tripwire2 stars. Running Blind.NARRATOR:The narrator Dick Hill was very good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 13 hrs and 5 mins. Swearing language: I don't recall any. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: one referred to not shown. Setting: 1999 various other U.S. locations. Book copyright: 2000. Genre: mystery suspense thriller. Ending: Bad guy is caught, but there is no good feeling because other things are frustrating.POSSIBLE SPOILER:Michael Connelly published \\"The Poet\\" in 1995. \\"Running Blind\\" was published five years later. It's probably just a coincidence, but I felt like RB was a copy of or inspired by TP concerning the killer and methods used. TP was much better, I gave it 5 stars. I don't want to be too critical since there are thousands of books out there about killers and only a limited number of ways to kill someone. But the similarities were in my mind as I was reading this. I understand Agatha Christie has also used the same thing."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Most of the Jack Reacher books are above average, however...this one is NOT.I guess every book can't be that good.There is some good enough Jack Reacher action, but the method of serial killer is just silly.So if you have never read a LC book with JR, don't start with this one.His first book, Killing Floor was good, but too wordy and too much detail about the money. That doesn't seem to be a problem in his later books.I even liked Nothing to Lose - which got awful reviews."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Some Reacher novels are mostly \\"here is the dilemma, how is he going to get out of it.\\" This one is a real who-dunnit, and a how-did-they-do-it. He still kicks some butt, of course. All in all a fine member of the Reacher series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I recently \\"discovered\\" Lee Child and the Jack Reacher series. Fortunately with the help of Amazon and my Kindle it has been possible to read the books in order thus far. This does wonders for continuity and I never wonder who a character is. Mr. Child writes an action packed novel with a great story line. Maybe a little too much detail on some descriptions some of which almost sound repetitive, but this is true with a lot or authors and I have learned to overlook this. I have one major issue with the first four books and one gripe. First the gripe: Mr. Child does not know his gun lore. It seems as if he gets his gun \\"facts\\" down at the local pub. Glocks have no safety to click off, shotgun pellets do nowhere near the havoc and have a pattern completly unlike his descriptions. One nine millimeter pistol does not have any more knockdown power than another nine millimeter pistol. Maybe being a \\"gun nut,\\" I'm just sensitized to this. I've read worse. But by far the biggest problem I have with the whole Jack Reacher series is this: Does any one really believe that a sober, reasonably intelligent, attractive woman will co-mingle for longer than one day with a man who never changes his clothes? Come on! Take a shower or two or three in a weeks time and Jack is still wearing the same unwashed clothes? Really? I know he has the hobo spirit in him but hobos don't mix well."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"very angry, was told by friends to purchase books through amazon, being a jack reacher follower and having read all his stories, i thought i had a new venture in running blind only to read it is the same story as THE VISITOR!!, what's going on?."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I recently completed Running Blind during a trip to Las Vegas. I started on the plane ride there, consumed a few pages during some downtime over the weekend and finished on the way home. It was a nice way to go through the book. Although I probably would have been better off if I slept rather than read following a long weekend, I could not put the story down. Child kept me turning the pages. I started the Reacher series in the middle and am now working my way back through the early books in order. I never seem to grow tired of the character and the storylines. Running Blind is no exception. It may not be Child's best but I'm not sorry that I gave up sleep to finish. On to book #5"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This one started out well. I was soooo curious to know how and why the killer was able to kill 4 women in the same bizarre way (10 gallons of green paint in a bathtub) and getaway with no evidence left behind. It was a good setup.Other amazon reviewers have not recieved this book as warmly as others in the series written by Lee Child, and I too thought the set-up failed to deliver a good final end, but I haven't given up checking out other Jack Reacher stories, read excellently by Dick Hill...yet."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I see others give this a lukewarm rating, but I really enjoyed it. An unpredictable plot with a surprising end. Well done."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read several in this series and really enjoyed this one as well.

He kept commenting on the great shape it was in. Thanks, Amazon."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"A great read, if you like Jack Reacher novels, you will love this one. Full of twists, keeps you guessing, recommended."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"A good page turner. However there was little uplifting about the type of society the story exposed which makes for good escapism!Made me think why I would not live in such a society, but then it's only a story, right?The original title was \\"Running Blind\\" but then what's in a name?"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"When Jack Reacher sees a owner of a recently opened Italian restaurant is squeezed by local thugs, he can't help himself from interfering. A resourceful Reacher is able to rough up the goons without putting himself or the restaurant owner at risk. But FBI takes him under arrest as soon as he reaches his home. He is the prime suspect in a string of murders involving army women who had filed sexual harassment complaints. The profile of the killer matches Reacher.In the fourth book of the series, Lee Child casts Reacher in a role which he has long left behind; the role of an investigator. This time around, Reacher is not working for the military but teamed up with FBI. Like the earlier novels, Lee directly hurls the reader into the vortex of the events without wasting time. With a killer to catch, Reacher is running against time. This helps in building the pace and Lee can handle fast paced action with words. The events might be unbelievable but you are carried away. There are many times the investigation is sidetracked. This is the downside of the plot.Strictly for Reacher fans."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Great book as always. Teacher is right tough, smart, and dedicated to helping. Mr child keep up the fine work."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Not a literary masterpiece, but a fun read if you are into action books.

Not so for this masterful mystery/suspense &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; novel by Lee Child! I was so hooked by the on the edge happenings that the completely twisted outcome had me &#34;running blind&#34; til the very end! Superbly written & brilliantly laid out, this one will have you guessing as much as Reacher was in the novel!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Great book, fast paced and always keeps you guessing. can't get enough of Jack Reacher. Can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"We're big fans of Lee Child and his hero Jack Reacher, an ex-military police investigator who can apparently solve any crime! \\"Blind\\" is loosely a sequel to \\"Tripwire\\" in that Jack has just inherited a house, is busy loving star-lawyer Jodie, and is at odds with himself over \\"settling down\\" compared to his normal nomadic meanderings around America sans ID cards and luggage.After foiling a protection racket at one of his favorite little restaurants, Reacher is nabbed by the FBI, who promptly uses that \\"crime\\" and \\"threats\\" on Jodie to blackmail Jack into helping them solve a tough set of serial killings that seem to point to someone so exactly like Reacher he's at first the best suspect! Three women have been killed and found in tubs full of paint, yet their cause of death is unknown! A common thread is that all are sexual harassment \\"survivors\\" in prior military service situations.The mental meanderings and skullduggery of the FBI (portrayed rather poorly, a major detraction to the story) and Reacher combine to very slowly close in on the who, how, and why of the murders. The killer's identity and capture is a stunning surprise revealed only a few pages from the book's end, which, aided by a few red herrings, manages to sustain suspense and intrigue until virtually the last gasp of the pages. Child also manages to resolve the growing conflict over Reacher and Jodie's future, although in a manner that we notice has disappointed many of his readers. Still, we found this to be a fine entry in this growing series, and we look forward to the next fun and entertaining Reacher novel!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"In Lee Child's \\"Running Blind\\" we find ex-MP hero Jack Reacher entrapped by the FBI. Reacher was unwittingly observed by an FBI surveillance team using strong arm tactics in thwarting an extortion attempt against a restauranteur of an Italian place that he frequented.Reacher was reeled in on the pretext that he fit the profile of a serial killer who had eluded apprehension by the FBI. The cerebral killer had murdered a group of former female members of the Army who had filed sexual harrassmnet charges. They were all found immersed in bathtubs filled to the top with green Army camouflage paint. All victims were apparently not drowned but killed by a means so far undeciphered. There was an unprecedented lack of clues and no clear motive.Reacher was coerced into helping the FBI investigate using some thinly veiled threats to his girlfriend Jodie Garber. Garber, a high powered New York attorney and daughter of Reacher mentor, the late General Leon Garber, was on the verge of being made a partner in her firm. Throughout the book drifter-like Reacher who inherited General Garber's house was wrestling with the feelings of being tied down. While he and Jodie were very much in love they were both unwilling to follow in each other's lifestyle.Reacher, of course, is instrumental in ultimately solving the paradoxes behind the killings. Child in this work explores the inner workings of Reacher's psyche which gives \\"Running Blind\\" a more expansive picture into the human side of his main character."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Jack Reacher is enlisted by the FBI, most definitely against his will, to act as a consultant on a serial killer case. The case is baffling to say the least. So far, 3 women have been found dead in their bathtubs and the killer has left absolutely no clues behind, including how the women were murdered.This is a tense battle of wills between Reacher and the FBI agents, with continual antagonism between them setting the boundaries. This turns to frustration as Reacher comes up with theories that he presents to the FBI, only to have them repeatedly rejected. It turns into a battle on two fronts as Reacher is up against a killer who is sure to kill again and the FBI who seem incapable of accepting his ideas.The Jack Reacher books are frantic action thrillers starring a protagonist who is ultra-capable and prepared to push boundaries, whether it&#65533;s legal or moral. This particular book is no exception, although the pace does tend to get hampered by the unwelcome intervention of the FBI."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Mr. Lee Child has written another winner with his &quot;Running Blind.&quot; Jack Reacher once again gets involved in solving a horrendous series of murders. There are lots of twists and turns with an almost complete surprise ending. I will admit I was starting to suspect the true villin about 1/2 to 3/4 through, but it didn't detract from my reading enjoyment. Let me warn you though, this is a one sitter -- you will not be able to put it down. Mr. Child: keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have been reading Lee Child's books in order and this one was kind of disappointing. Knew fairly early who the killer was because I happened to remember one sentence in the beginning chapters.Fort Dix is NOT a Marine base! Heavens, what a boo boo!(My husband is a formr Marine)and his Mecca is much further south. And I really hope our FBI isnt similar to the protrayal in this story. Altho the premise was a new one for me, the ending left me wanting for some other explanation. Still, I will read Mr. Child's next. Jack Reacher is getting to be a cult figure!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"My first Jack Reacher novel and all I can say is WHAT A RIDE! Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, you're thrown a curve ball and it's off and running again. I can't wait to go back and read the previous books!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This story is all story - absolutely riveting and page turning. The mystery is a mystery like no other I have ever read, and the brilliant mind that is the killer's is fascinating. Women are dying, and Jack Reacher has a mind almost as cunning as the killers. For a long time, even the cause of death is not known, so clever is the M.O. It is a race against time as Jack Reacher has discovered the names of 11 women that are on this insane hitlist. Inside this twisting plot, lies another plot, that of Jack Reacher and his girlfriend, and yet another plot, that of Jack Reacher and the street mobs of New York. The author manages to weave it all together so brilliantly that you don't realize you have read three stories in one until you are done, and they all connect with a fluidity that is all too rare these days. It's a smash ending, leaving you breathless with excitement and waiting for the next Jack Reacher book. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I really enjoy the Jack Reacher stories. He is the best. This one was really compelling. It was driving me crazy trying to figure out what the victims were choking on. What a concept. Mr Child, you are an incredible writer. All I can say is bring on the next Reacher novel. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"You'll enjoy this one if you can willingly suspend your disbelief. A plus: you'll never guess \\"who done it.\\" But the plot is based on an incorrect premise and the author hopes that most readers will not know that the premise is incorrect. Also, in building suspense, and he does that, he gets a little tedious. Prose like, \\"She walked out of the house, unlocked her car, opened the door, got in, closed the door and locked it. Started the car, put it in reverse, etc. etc.\\" You think, \\"Yeah, yeah, get on with it.\\" Reacher comes to a major life-style decision in this one. Read \\"Tripwire\\" first, as awful as it is."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, and for the most part they are entertaining and well written. Reacher is the loner wandering the countryside making things right. He's tough, experienced, and practical.Running Blind tells a story of women being murdered in a most bizarre way. They are found dead in their homes lying face up in their bathtubs filled with green paint. The women appear to have a connection because they all were involved in military sexual harassment cases. The bodies have no apparent wounds, and there is no trace of any intruder.Up until the very end, the story moves at a good clip - keeping the reader on the hook. But... and it is a big BUT, the end is absolutely absurd. I'm all for surprising the reader, but the chosen method here is just ridiculous. Frankly, more than surprised, I was disappointed. Child surely knows that the method described is completely impossible. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I won't describe it. But I think many of you will find it to be so implausible that it adds a bit of amateurism to the book. If you're a first time Lee Child reader, definitely do not start with this book. The series is very addictive, and I'd hate for you to stop after just one book.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of \\"Process of Elimination\\" - a thriller that pits a martial artist against a world class sniper out to shape the Presidential election."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"It was a typical Jack Reacher novel, fast paced, lots of surprises and a satisfying ending.

If you're not, save your time and money."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I recomend this book to anyone who likes James Patterson, David Balducci or Lee Child. Great suspense, lofty characters, and quick reading."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I started reading this series because of the film, planning on continuing up at least through the book that was adapted. The first three in the series were okay, with some creative violence, but nothing really spectacular. Running Blind, however, was really really awful.The book followed Lee Child's Reacher pattern: Inside man, a pointless subplot, and an improbable romance.The biggest flaw of Running Blind is the total lack of continuity between the volumes. In the 2nd book, we had Jack Reacher risking his life to save a cherished FBI agent from a kidnapping, rooting out TWO corrupt FBI agents, fanning the fires of Romance between two FBI agents, and stopping a terrorist bomb. By any measure there should be a number of FBI personnel, including some high ranking ones, who owe Jack Reacher a great deal. But for some reason, the FBI is essentially able to kidnap and blackmail Jack Reacher into doing their work for them. Nobody mentions \\"That business out in Montana\\" and his friends/allies in the FBI somehow don't help him with no explanation. The character Deerfield is as corrupt as the agents that Reacher exposed in Die Trying, but somehow he gets away with all of this as well as trying to get a female agent to have sex with Reacher on camera to have more leverage over him. It's truly ridiculous and far fetched.Pushing the envelope further (and this is a spoiler if you haven't read it) is that the killer relies on hypnotism to coerce the victims into killing themselves. Yes, that's right. Mind control. I had to double check to make sure this wasn't a Stephen King novel or something.Finally, there is a ridiculous red herring point of view character who is manipulated to seem like the killer, but when he shows up finally he is there for a page and then never seen/heard from again. It's a POV that has nothing to do with the plot at all and serves only to make the reader think the killer is a male in the army.Other than a handful of scenes with some creative violence, this book is a huge mess."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The book Running Blind is just an old Reacher book that was written years ago.

I suspected who the real killer was fairly early on in the book, but loved seeing all the pieces put together. Plus, I just love Jack Reacher. All these people complaining about innaccuracy and how unrealistic this is, here's the deal: it's called &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; and is critical to any story that is not about our own tedious and boring lives. I do not care if Ft. Dix is a navy base (even though my dad and father in law were stationed there while in the Army, I was so into the story I never noticed that)or if it is even in New Jersey (yes, I know it is). No, normal people do not live in the same clothes day in and day out. No, normal people do not outsmart the FBI and hop from bed to bed. If you want to read about normal people I will be happy to send you pages from my journal about potty training, homework, laundry, etc. I read for a brief escape into a completely different life, for the mental challenge of figuring out &quot;whodunnit,&quot; and for the pure joy of a good thriller. If that's what you're looking for, buy this book. If you want an accurate accounting of military policies, I'm sure they have a fascinating manual you can pick up at your local Army surplus store."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I'm a horror buff but I dig a good mystery once in a while ( I happen to think the best horrorstories are the ones which have a mystery element to them. Like some of Peter Straub's books and the excellent 'Scream' movies).Anyway I picked this book up at my local library. It was an english edition which had the alternate title THE VISITOR (one I don't think is at all inapproriate, since the killer in this story is in some way invited into the homes of his victims). I haven't read any of Child's others books, but after this one I might read another one.I say 'might' on purpose 'cause although RUNNING BLIND is a good book I figured out the plot and the killer fairly easily and (I really hate that) early on in the story. And in my opinion there lies the problem with this book. It's good and clever thought of, but there are clues left all over the place and I don't think Child did that all on purpose. I think it's because (and RUNNING BLIND isn't the only mystery novel which suffers from this) when you start to read this book you just know the plot and motive are going to be so farfetched that you start looking for the least likely suspect and just assume he's going to be it...and voila!This book also has a so called 'locked door' element in 'how the murders are committed' is as important as 'who's doing it'. I also figured that out fairly easily, once again there's more than a fair share of clues for that.I'm not that all negative about the book though (Why else would I give it three stars? And as an aspiring writer I wish I could come up with a plot like this). It's because I really liked the character Jack Reacher a somewhat cliched hardman and drifter and it's great fun seeing your theories proven to be right.I read somewhere Child is a former tv writer and it shows in some parts of the book: the stereotypical portrail of the FBI and the gangsters, the beautiful woman FBI sidekick etc. RUNNING BLIND isn't at all realistic. But I think no reader would come in expecting that!Like I said earlier it doesn't make it a bad read though. Just not great."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Well, I have some good news and bad news.The bad news first. I am going on a driving vacation with some of the family and I thought I would save this book for the car, something to help pass the time. The bad new is.....I have already read it, I couldn't wait. It was sitting on my shelf calling to me and since I am a great fan of Jack Reacher and Lee Child, I couldn't resist. Now, the good news! It is a great book. How on earth did Mr.Child think of this murderer's m.o.? I could not put this book down. Bravo Mr. Child.....as soon as I see your next one listed on Amazon., I'll put in my pre-order. For anyone who likes a book with a great hero, a few laughs, lots of suspense and mystery and a twist at the end, read this book! If you haven't read the other Jack Reachers, do it now!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read 5 other Reacher books and thoroughly enjoyed them all. This one, however, was a bust. The FBI characters were absurd and the book had a very disappointing and ridiculously unrealistic killer and method for murder. When I realized what was going on in the middle of the book, I kept hoping that there was some other explanation, but the end brought disappointment with the realization I had been right all along. I would recommend skipping this book and sticking to the other Reacher titles."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"First, let me say I have read almost all of the Reacher series in a short time. Here in Thailand, I rely on used bookshops, reading well-worn copies dropped off by travelers. (Sorry Amazon, but when I'm in the USA it's You, baby, Only You, trust me!) I started with the one so many people gave thumbs down to, \\"Nothing to Lose\\", in which Reacher is bouncing back and forth on the plains of Eastern Colorado between the towns of Hope and Despair. The whole concept seemed pretty fresh to me, and I liked the character, so I started reading the series. Two more and I'm a Reacher Laureate.The Visitor (aka Running Blind) is pretty lame stuff. (Believe me, I'm a fan and hate saying bad things about the series BUT:) The FBI depicted in this book does not exist. They would not force an unwilling lone wolf (\\"bum\\", actually) to work for them by coercive threats, as depicted in this book, keeping him a virtual prisoner, even though he manages to slip away and \\"go Reacher\\" on those who need doing. My main beef (here's the SPOILER part, beware) is with the hypnosis element. In all of my reading on the subject, one thing comes up over and over...a hypnotized subject will at least balk at doing something which goes against their internal moral code. Also, a post-hypnotic suggestion has a limited life. You can't plant a suggestion that can be triggered months or years later.That wasn't much of a spoiler, really. Most people would see this shaping up early in the book. I hate writing negative reviews, and usually don't. Lee Child has created quite a great character here, and he keeps things moving along nicely. I especially like the little details he throws in about mechanical things. If Lee Child's name is on the spine, I'll read the book. But this one...I dunno."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am currently reading Running Blind and was thrilled to find some of the older Jack Reacher books on Amazon. Not thrilled to see an old book with a new title. Books cost too much to pay twice. I admire you Lee and would hate to see my favorite author do something that I know Jack would not think is kosher. Please rethink this issue."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have all of the Jack Reacher books on my Kindle. When I saw this title I thought I had missed one. Luckily I aways read some of the reviews and noticed it was retitled. Thanks to most of the reviewers, I saved a duplication. Dirty pool on the publisher.

It's up to Reacher to find the killer before another woman on the list is dead.Very inventive, very clever story...and so gripping that it kept me up waaay past my bedtime as it came to the conclusion."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Read this when it first came out and thought it was very good.

Just like Killing Floor and Die Trying, this novel flies along at a frantic pace that you try hard to keep up with.Reacher is the suspect in a bizarre series of murders in which ex-army women (who left the force because of a variety of sexual harassment cases) are left naked in their bathtubs filled with green army paint. The killer leaves no clues and what is even more bizarre, they have no idea how the women died.Even after Reacher's name is cleared, he is blackmailed by the FBI into unravelling this bizarre case. He must get to the killer before more women die, or face the consequences of the FBI's fury.Read and Enjoy"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"My thanks to the other posters for the \\"Truth in Advertising\\" warnings that \\"The Visitor\\" is really a re-titled \\"Running Blind\\". The Jack Reacher series for me is a \\"buy on sight\\" type of thing and I might have been misled if it was not for the other reviewers.That being said don't be put off from the original novel by the Publisher's shady marketing. Running Blind is one of the best Jack Reacher novels:Running Blind"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I was very disappointed when I realized the book, \\"The Visitor\\" was the same book as \\"Running Blind\\". Where is the integrity and honesty? They should be ashamed. Will make me think twice before buying another Lee Child book!!!!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have now read all of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child and I believe this one to be the best of them all. Not that it doesn't have flaws - some of the activities carried out by the FBI are pretty questionable, Reacher at times approaches super-human in his skills, and there are probably a few too many red herrings and digressions. Nevertheless, for what it is, this is an extremely fast-moving and exciting thriller. It is genuinely hard to put down and the ending will likely surprise you (though admittedly a careful reader will probably see it coming; there are clues aplenty). Child plays fair, however, and you buy the whole thing. I do wish Child's novels &quot;reached&quot; (pun intended) a wider audience; he is a good writer who has created an interesting and charismatic character. This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read every Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher and was set to buy this one. Thank goodness I looked here and found it is just RUNNING BLIND with a new title. The one star I gave it is for the publisher. RUNNING BLIND gets five stars."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Repackaged with the non-US title - You should pull this from sale since it the same as Running Blind. Shame on you for peaking my interest. I almost ordered it - wonder how many you will sell to folks who have already read it under the Running Blind title. Do the right thing and make it more plain that it is the non-US version. The book is great - the one star ratings is because I hate that Amazon seems to be attempting to mislead us."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is a very shady practice and if Amazon is truly concerned with protecting the best interests of their customers they should add an entry to their standard descriptive summary that shows the Copyright Date, as do all paper published editions.The Publishing Date alone can be more deceptive than informative. And yes, sometimes there are good reasons why copyrighted works aren't published immediately....but at a minimum at least it gives the prospective buyer/reader a clue that this may be a repackaged edition rather than a brand new release."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The only thing I don't like about one of Lee Childs' Jack Reacher novels is that they come to an end all too soon. Then you have to wait till he writes the next one. Have read the entire series and can't wait till the next one. If they ever do a movie, the guy that stars in the \\"Human Target\\" TV show on Fox would be a great Reacher.Steve Venghaus"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I started with book 12 and then decided to start from the beginning. Every book has started quickly and kept me hooked. Reacher Is certainly a charismatic character, but I have one question. How does he get all of those very attractive women, despite the fact that, after five books, he has yet to change his underwear. Traveling light might seem cool, but there has got to be a downside to that."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Running Blind by Lee Child and read by Dick Hill was an exciting and entertaining audiobook for a long car trip. Running Blind is the 4th book in his Jack Reacher series.Former MP Jack Reacher is recruited by the FBI at the beginning of Running Blind. A serial killer is at work and FBI profilers have identified Jack Reacher (or someone like him) as the likely killer. Once they rule out Reacher, they decide to recruit him because of his military background. The victims were all women who were once on active duty in the military. They all filed sexual harassment charges and then quit the service. Three different victims were found dead in bathtubs filled with army-green paint. There were no signs of a struggle, not a clue left behind and the medical examiners were unable to prove a cause of death.The FBI doesn't take Reacher's ideas seriously at first, and he's under the guard of young agent, Lisa Harper. But Reacher is coming up with theories faster than the FBI, and Reacher and Harper go rogue in trying to track down the killer. Although I guessed the killer's identity pretty early on, I had no clue as to the motive. Child kept us guessing until the very end.My husband and I are happy to have stumbled upon the Jack Reacher series and plan on listening to them all. It definitely helps to read or listen to them in order. We already have Without Fail lined up for our return trip."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is one of those mysteries where you keep reading to learn how the killer did it. You just know that knowing how and why will tie the whole story together. Unfortunately, Lee Child apparently didn't have a clue about how to pull everything together when he started this book. Child's explanation might make sense in some alternate universe, but certainly not here. The ending wouldn't have been any less believable if the crimes had been blamed on space aliens.Others have already commented on Jack Reacher's poor hygiene. Instead of carrying just a folding toothbrush, couldn't the poor guy at least carry a duffel bag? That wouldn't tie him down too much ... and he could at least have a change of underwear and socks. This should have given me a clue to what was to come ... a stinky ending."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The murderer becomes clear reasonably early, exposed by peculiar behavior and a couple incongruous factlets that the author pulls out of mid-air and tosses into the story. I am usually quite good at missing such clues, but not in this case - they were too glaring.Beyond this, there is the typical Reacher activity - chasing around, dealing with thugs, etc. And those things can be fun if you can gloss over the clues and accept the pretty much impossible method the killer uses to do in the victims."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I believe on average the book should show more stars than it does. It's been published in the UK & Canada under \\"The Visitor.\\" Some are rating on the premise it's the same book under a different title. It is true & it happens more than one thinks. But that's not a true indicator of this Lee Child book.Now for the book. It's a solid Jack Reacher thriller. Fast paced & a page turner. He's a biased FBI's suspect in the murder of former Army women he knew when he was an Army MP. He now sets out to find the real serial killer of these pretty bizarre murders. He has an ally in a rogue female FBI agent. Together they set about the task of proving who the real killer is.The sexual tension between the two adds a nice touch. The small twist at the end works as well. It's well written & worth your time"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have recently been turned on to Lee Child and his larger than life character Jack Reacher. He is larger than life but he is also grounded, realistic, and approachable. Thus far it is a great read, real diversionary and a wonderful escape from an ever increasing maddening and pressured real world; in fact Jack likes to get away from that same world."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"If you love a fast paced read, then you have to get to know Jack Reacher. Love the whole series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book is awesome. I finished it in two days. All of Lee Child's books are. I will read anything he writes.

More than one plot developing at the same time. Mr Child ranks among my favorites."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"For those such as myself, who were a bit disappointed with Lee Child's &quot;Tripwire,&quot; take heart! Jack Reacher is back at his very best; not too smart, not too slow witted, but just right. Also, he's still very capable of handling most adversaries and charming all (well, almost all) women and pissing off most men. It is a fast paced thriller in search of a serial killer which takes many twists and turns, but entertains all the way. It leaves you a bit exhausted, but exhilarated at the same time! No author seems to get along with the FBI, but this book has a lot of fun with their procedures, while bending a few military rules along the way. Read it!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Mr. Child could use better words to convey a deeper feeling or situation. He is so deep that makes other thriller writers appear an inch shallow and down under. Jack Reacher is so far one of the most(not too many) interesting characters that ever created by a writer, who are actually on a par with each other. What amazed me most is that Mr. Child's writing is such an internationally standardized modern English not just British English that used to be zigzagging and indirect. The flow of the sentences and paragraphs are so smoothly putting out that always makes you apprecitate his width of knowing how to choose a better and deeper word to describe a feeling or situation. This talent and knowledge are rarely to be found among other so-called thriller writers and making his every word worths the money you've paid for. The burden of relationship of his newly acquired secular belongings, either real estate property or romance, only makes Reacher more realistic. But the FBI people created this time seemed to be quite unconvincing. The way Blake treating Larma and the latter's insubordinate attitude is absolutely impossible and inprobable in FBI's ethics, unless they have some sexual relationship, therefore did not ring true at all. All of the other FBI's characters, well, Harper seems to be more acceptable as an FBI agent and more normal, others are just a fine line away from thugs; a situation Mr. Child should pay more attention to fine tune before or during writing. Also, a nation wide serial killing rampage is also fundamentally weak this time that made me feel a bit impatient to read along after two third of the book. Again, I jumped over those hateful and stupid itallic paragraphs and I can assure you, Mr. Child, lot of readers might be just like what I did. So please don't try to use too many lean to right itallic sentences, especially long and tiresome paragraphs. Also, how to realistically show the readers the way that the real FBI is dealing with a nation-wide crime, Mr. Child should do a deeper research before production; a more authentic and convincing task force or just of bunch thug-like agents? Don't &quot;running blind&quot; is what I would like to give to Mr. Child this time. A good book means that when readers think it twice, all the logic premises still could stand fast albeit bleaching the paper money."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"It is a refreshingly good thriller. One could consider it a tongue-in-cheek sequel to Silence of the Lambs, and it is way better than over-hyped Hannibal."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book grabs you right from the start and throws you into the tense atmosphere and tight action. It keeps you one the edge of your seat.Jack Reacher is blackmailed by the FBI to solve a series of murders that he's first been accused of and later been absolved of. Jack travels the country in an effort to solve these murders. Even at the end, when I just can't imagine how these murders are committed, Jack solves the problem and saves yet another woman.Jack is smart, interesting, well read and at times I even get a chuckle out of his comments and behavior. He is also hard and knows how to do what needs to be done in a tight situation. Jack takes care of the little guys and brings the big ugly nasties down to size. He is my new hero.This isn't my first Jack Reacher novel nor will it be my last. In fact, I even like the novels by this author that are not Reacher novels.Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I double if the FBI Blake and dearfield are realistic characters. It seems really stupid. I guess the hypnotism thing when the women can't remember what happen. The audio book reacher sounds slow and stupid too. Also mr child style is very naggy.

I would definitely recommend if you are a fan if the series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the fourth in the Jack Reacher series and Lee Child continues to develop the character. The irony was that while reading this book I saw the promo of the new movie &#34;jack Reacher&#34;. In this book Jack Reacher recalls that there came a time when he walked down the streets and he had become an intimidating &#34;scary guy&#34; that everyone avoided. The Jack Reacher in the series is a big guy, tall and heavy set. I can't believe they selected one of the world's puniest actors to play his role in the movie ... Tom Cruise. Go figure. The Visitor is a smokes and mirror book. Without giving away the plot it suffices to say that Lee Child has created many blind alleys which he takes the reader down before a final twist. It is a good read. I can't wait for the next Jack Reacher novel."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"You discover why excessive descriptives, but could literally skip read through much of this.

And I'd agree, if I hadn't guessed the perp after about a third of the way into the book. Child's Reacher thrillers are good because you are not supposed to guess what comes next. But in the Reacher mysteries, his clues are often pretty obvious. Read it anyway; see if you agree."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book had me guessing until the end. I have a couple of sticking points that bothered me however. One was how vicious the FBI treats Jack at the end. It was way over the top in my opinion and the bit about the priest that makes an appearance towards the end is never really explained. I don't want to add anything else that may spoil the book for anyone. Aside from those two things I would recommend this book. I like the character of Jack Reacher, he always stays so calm and cool. Definitely worth the price. Ree-views"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Of the 11 Reacher books I have read this is by far and away my favourite!The book starts out filled with action in typical Reacher fashion with a beating for some unfortunate thugs as Jack tries to fix the world one problem at a time and then leads the reader into a deep and complex mystery which is only pieced together in the final few chapters. A crime which looks to be unsolvable is put together perfectly, making you check back to see if you really did miss all of the clues that Jack has somehow joined up.The story also puts Jack in a somewhat unfamiliar position of being settled down and having a proper relationship which adds another dimention to our hero.I finished this book in 2 days and it would have been sooner if i hadnt been working. Would recommend this book to any one the best in the series!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The great thing about Jack Reacher novels is that they aren't really cumulative. Yes, there are some details about his personal life that carry over from one to the next, but for the most part, each novel's plot and characters are separate and each book can be enjoyed on its own, without the preceding novels in the series. For that reason, you should seriously consider skipping this one and moving on to the next.It starts promisingly. Such mysterious murders! The perfect crime! Why are the victims willingly participating in a bizarre, sadistic procedure before death? What is the actual cause of death? And, of course, whodunit?But the murderer will be apparent early on to any seasoned reader of murder mysteries. As for the other two questions -- the death ritual and the cause of death -- both are based on fallacious psychology and medicine and are so absurd you may throw the book or even a brand new Kindle at the wall. Until now, I had thought that Lee Child was a meticulous researcher, so I'm wondering why he thought he could use a murder technique that is beyond implausible. Apart from the hilariously bad psychology, the most essential physical element in these murders is, literally, medically impossible. You don't need to be a scientist to know this. Anyone with common sense will Google it and realize that Child has tried to pull a fast one on them. Now I'm wondering if his seemingly expert descriptions of firearms and other technical subjects are also nonsense.Some may want to read the novel just to find out what the ridiculous ending is. If that's your purpose, and you go into it with low expectations, at least you won't be disappointed or infuriated by it. But if you want a solid, logical, satisfying ending, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Like the Jack Reacher character..Jack is a fascinating character and the twists and turns keep you wondering who is the real bad guy."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"A disappointing end to the book. The plot built well but ended in an almost farcicle fashion. Left me with a feeling akin to many 3rd series TV dramas where the plot just gets silly."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This was my fourth Jack Reacher novel in as many books. Lee Child delves deeper into the psyche of Jack Reacher, exploring his need to wander, his desire for the freedom of the road. In the previous book, Reacher finds what could be the love of his life, Jodie, the daughter of the general who made his career and was like a second father to the big lug. But Reacher needs constant change. He doesn't want baggage or a mortgage. He's an unusual guy, a constant ass pain to authority. He gets things done his way. Not theirs. This theme permeates &#34;Running Blind,&#34; where the mystery of former women soldiers appears impossible to solve. Child takes it right to the end before he lets any of this make sense. Fun ride."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Again a well balanced story of Jack Reacher. The storyline is good and has enough dynamics. It has a surprizing final. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am re-reading all the Jack Reacher novels I can find on Kindle. He is one he bes characters Mr Childs has written about.

The Jack Reacher series is well worth reading. I will read the entire series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This was a good Jack Reacher but not the best I have read. Child used too much, in my opinion, contrived misdirection to keep the reader quessing. I say contrived because they really added nothing to the story but to throw the reader off the scent. The sections about the mysterious person in the pentagon is my main point. Other than that it was a good read and held my attention to the end but has made me a little reticent to jump right into the next one."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST COUPLE BUT STILL NOT TOO BAD.

When reading his other novels, you are sometimes uncomfortable with what you suspect are cliches. In this one he writes about my home state, and it isn't simply cliche, it is absurd.

I would recommend this book to my friends"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child is one of my favorite authors. What I didn't realize was that it was a book that I read shortly after it was first published as Running Blind in the USA. It was received on time and new and I was so hungry for a Jack Reacher novel, I was nearing completion of the book before it was scheduled for delivery. I find Amazon very good when it comes to delivering things on time or earlier."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Jack Reacher is the same violent loner that he was in the first, second, third... twenty-third book. Just too much violence and the end of the book is just as silly as the end of all of the Lee Child books. Lee Child writes so well, why don't the stories live up to the writer."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Running Blind was excellent, like all of Lee Child's books. The condition of the book was alittle less than I expected, but still very readable, not torn or pages missing."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is a great book and a great new author that I have \\"found\\" to read. But it could be an AWESOME book and it is PITIFUL that it is not. The problem is the mile-wide STUPIDITY plot potholes i fall into on EVERY book in the Jack Reacher series! Case in point: Reacher and Harper drive 6 hours to meet with Scimeca because she has a \\"item of interest\\" (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the book) in her house that they are looking for... one that logically would still have it's shipping label and thereby take them further in their hunt then they've been able to go so far. They find out that Scimeca had a roommate that took the label and they don't ask for her name, they don't call her from the room and ask Scimeca every detail about her they can.... THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LEAD UP AT ALL.... THEY JUST GIVE UP AND SAY \\"OH WELL, DARN, BACK TO QUANTICO.\\" That is completely illogical, and more to the point, NOT standard OP for these investigators. This type of author interference beyond the logical, just to sustain his plot eslewhere is EXTREMELY frustrating and almost makes the WHOLE BOOK fall apart. And it happens several times thru every book I've read so far. If they don't follow up on SO GLARING A TRAIL, then you have to tell the reader WHY and it has to be LOGICAL and REASONABLE. Not just blank and not there! WHY, WHY, WHY is your editor allowing you to get away with this! F-R-U-S-T-R-A-T-I-N-G and FIXABLE! These books are still worth the read, I mean, you had me at page 3 of your first book, Killing Floor, with \\"I wasn't going to lie on the floor. Not for these country boys. Not if they brought along their whole police department with howitzers.\\" The main character, Reacher, is highly intelligent and methodical, besides being a wandering gypsie, so when he lapses into these periods of illogical stupidity it really frustrates me, the reader, and pulls me right out of the story and instead of being engaged in the plot, i'm yelling at the author for leaving me right in the middle of an intelligent lead and closing in on it, and then just giving up for no reason, when it wasn't necessary."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"We have enjoyed listening to the Reacher series on unabridged audioboks. This one was on cassette tapes and they sounded like a distant echo chamber with muffled narration. In addition the story line was fluffed out with the meat being less than 40% of the time. I believe we have heard 5 others which were much better than Running Blind and suggest you skip this one, particularly if it is a cassette audiobook."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I just finished reading this novel, and of course, i was not disappointed. Lee Child never fails at intriguing and entertaining the reader from the first to the last word."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I love the character of Jack Reacher. So, like others I am reading through the series. Killing Floor was a great introduction to Reacher. I was disappointed after reading Die Trying and Tripwire. Those books were just boring in comparison to Killing Floor. All of the Reacher novels have action and suspense, but in Running Blind you actually get a more complex mystery than in novels two and three.Sure the blackmailing by the FBI is far-fetched, but this is fiction, right? If you overlook the unrealistic aspects of the book, then you will not be disappointed by the plot itself.On a side note, isn't it odd that Reacher being the genius that he is can outsmart anyone he faces. Yet, he is terrified of owning a large wardrobe because he can't figure out how to do laundry. Huh? That was actually in one of the previous books, but it just stuck with me."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child writes American fiction with English diction. His style is lithe and flexible. I found his book engaging and engrossing and very annoying.I wanted to write him a disgruntled email asking him why he took me out of my pleasant suspension of disbelief by making me ask questions that the book had no answer to. Why does his character take only a toothbrush and have no clothes to change into? Why does he concentrate in minute and loving detail on Lisa Harper's clothes changes and forget that his hero is equally human and in need of clean clothes? Surely a hero who takes two showers in an eight hour period has some notions of human hygiene.Lee Childs notably has no long and gushing list of thanks and praise for everyone from his turtle to his manicurist, and I presume he has no editor either. I suggest he hires one."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book contains things that are unique, exciting, and amazing."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child is a great writer and I highly recommend the Reacher series to anyone who likes well written and emotionally engaging stories."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"In Running Blind, Jack Reacher is caught up in a bizarre mystery when he's picked up by the FBI as a suspect in a string of murders. Someone very smart is murdering former military women across the country, leaving no trace evidence, in fact not even evidence of how they died. All they women have one thing in common, they were the victims of sexual harassment in the military and Jack Reacher was the military cop involved in their sexual harassment cases. There is another military link. All the women's naked bodies are found in their own bathtubs filled with drab green military grade camouflage paint. The lead FBI profiler seems to hate Reacher, saying her profile indicates either Reacher killed them, or someone exactly like him did. He convinces them he's innocent, and they pressure him to stay on the case by threatening his girlfriend. So, he joins the case, but in usual Reacher style slips away w/the help of military friends and makes sure his girlfriend is in no danger. Then in his usual enigmatic way, he pursues musings and hunches that lead him to a truly surprising killer. What was chilling to me was the way the killer enlisted the cooperation of the victims in their own murders. I thought the portrayal of the FBI as near criminals themselves, who threaten an innocent woman, was unbelieveable. Other than that it was riveting."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"If you haven't read Tripwire, I recommend that you precede any reading of this book with that one.Running Blind has more suspense in it than most of the Jack Reacher novels. Unlike the other stories where Reacher has it all under control, he has just the opposite here . . . everything is coming unglued.If the plot had made sense, this would have been a heart-pumping, five-star page-turner. As it is, the book was more of a puzzling, heart-pumping page-turner.In the beginning of the story, Reacher finds himself in the middle of unwanted attention from law enforcement authorities. The reasons for this don't make a lot of sense . . . and that inauspicious beginning (while revealing about Reacher's character) left me scratching my head.The story is one I've been dying to read ever since I finished Tripwire. In that book, Reacher rekindles an old love in a new way. How will Reacher handle a committed relationship? It's a good premise for this story, but most of that premise is unfulfilled in this plot.Someone's killing women who were sexually abused in the Army. The killer seems to be some evil genius whose very method is in doubt. I was kept busy trying to figure out the murder method throughout the book.I was profoundly disappointed when the M.O. turned out to be one that didn't ring true with me. Perhaps it will with you. If you see the M.O. as plausible, you will probably rate this as a four or five star book.As for the puzzle itself, Lee Child does a nice job of showing you enough to keep you interested but mostly holding back on what the real story is. I didn't find it hard, though, to figure out who did what to whom and why. He should have held back a little more. But it's a fair mystery in the sense that all the clues you need are there for you to identify the murderer."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book is very similar to \\"The Poet\\" by Michael Connelly...except for the Edgar Allan Poe references. For The Poet, though, it was homicide detectives instead of woman miliary officers. But there are many similarities that makes you wonder if Child ripped it off. I would name more similarities but don't want to spoil plot for both books that were both good reads. Ending was kind of disappointing but as always, this book kept me interested and had me laughing all the way through. Jack's lack of social graces are perfect and I always love when he makes other people feel stupid when they try to prove them wrong. This book is not as strong as the others in the series, in my opinion, but definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child has written seven novels about Jack Reacher, a former military cop with formidable combat skills. The strength of the Reacher novels is the plotting; Child is excellent at throwing red herrings and plot reversals in to keep the reader off-guard. The results are usually effective thrillers, with plenty of action.Running Blind fails as a thriller. All of the Reacher novels, indeed just about every thriller, have inconsistencies, coincidences, or illogical behavior by the characters. In effective thrillers, the force of the plot pushes the action at such a pace that the reader doesn't care about these problems. After all, no one readers a thriller for realism. Here, Child's plot has women who were sexually harassed being killed under bizarre circumstances, with no obvious cause of death, and without the killer leaving a trace of how the crime was committed. Enough clues are given that most readers will realize who the killer is and how the killer pulls it off half way through the book. And the means used to pull it off would not be believed in a comic book. The sheer impossibility was so great that once I realized what the answer was, I skipped to the end of the book to confirm my belief, and then gave up on it. Child painted himself in a corner with this book that he had to rely on something that might have been used in the B movies of the thirties, but is ridiculous today. I suggest skipping this book and going with the rest of the series. Certainly, any one who has not read the other Reacher books should avoid this one -- they may be so put off by the absurd ending that they will not read the others and thus miss some great thrillers."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Gripping and Exciting, a book you will not be able to put down. This is definately one of the best books in the Jack Reacher series yet! If you loved Lee Child's previous 3 Reacher novels, you will definately love this one. In this fourth book of the series Reacher is cohersed by the FBI into helping them track down a serial killer who is killing women around the USA and then placing their bodies in bath tubs filled with olive green army paint. At first a suspect and then a consultant, Reacher reluctantly aids them in their search. This book has it all... an interesting story line, great characters and plenty of plot twists and turns. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is my third of the Jack Reacher series, after Die Trying and Tripwire (have not read Killing Floor). Reacher is an interesting and likeable but highly flawed and frustrating character. Flawed not in the sense of human flaws, which always makes characters richer, but because the author--Lee Childs--has handicapped his own creation. We are told that Reacher, a former Army MP, is highly intelligent, magnificently large, strong and intimidating, a crack shot, an experienced and skillful investigator, and a creative, intuitive thinker; he is also an Army major who has mustered out and -- no other word for it --deteriorated into a bum. In Die Trying, Reacher explains that he lived his whole life on foreign bases and is traveling around the U.S. getting to know his own country; by Running Blind, he has no such excuse; he has simply become Willie Nelson--on the road again. No rhyme or reason for his restlessness and certainly no excuse for his reluctance to own anything, even an ID card or a comb. Any rational, intelligent, sensible man, no matter how relucant to be \\"anchored,\\" should be willing to carry something besides a clip-on toothbrush--a small bag containing clean underwear, an extra pair of jeans and a shirt or two is not a major hindrance to traveling light. And not carrying ID is just plain idiotic. Childs, in order to make his character iconoclastic and therefore more intriguing to readers, has made him seem almost simple, immature, unreasonable, and ultimately, unbelievable, especially when there is no convincing reason for it, and considering Reacher's repeated assertion that he is \\"always happy.\\" In Running Blind, I became very impatient with Reacher's stubborn refusal to assimilate even to the point of asking for and wearing clean clothes. I can't believe that anyone who grew up under military strictures as Reacher did--it's all he's ever known--could possibly be comfortable looking as disreputable as Reacher must look, wearing the same clothes--not to mention the same underwear!--for days at a time, and to appear finally, at a party important to someone he loves, in the same clothes, now smeared with paint! His lifestyle gives the Army and his army training a bad name and looks not so much like characteristics of a different kind of man as of an author's manipulation of the reader. I'm equally disappointed in Childs' unconscionable disruption of the one longstanding, terribly important relationship in Reacher's life, done for no other reason than to put him \\"out there\\" so that he can get involved in other cases, other bad guys, and, of course, other women. My quarrel with the character of Reacher aside, I can't help liking him and I find Child's writing imminently readable. Although I knew the identity of the villains in both Tripwire and Running Blind long before Mr. Reacher explained things to us, and although Childs failed to make clear the identify of the colonel who was reading and marking the list in RB--was that the padre colonel?--he manages to maintain good narrative flow and suspense. Still, I keep thinking of how the great Donald Hamilton would have handled this character. Childs should take a page (no pun intended) out of Hamilton's best writing and allow Reacher growth and change and maturity before he becomes ridiculous to the point of absurdity and wears out his welcome both in our towns and on our reading lists!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"What book is &quot;The Visitor&quot; from Lee Child? Looks like &quot;Runnig Blind&quot;. Under different titles same books??"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This was my first Jack Reacher book, and I think Lee Child's series is worth checking out, so I'll probably read the other three. I like Jack. He's a tough, no-nonense guy and you never know what he's thinking. He almost appears bigger than life, but the rest of his character is so understated that it seems to work. This thriller certainly has a different twist to it than most, but I must admit I figured it out about halfway through. That didn't detract from the story though because it moves fairly quickly and I wanted the time to get to know Jack. I too was a bit disappointed with the ending. I think it could have been done a bit better and not just left flat. The book would then rate a 5 in my opinion. Even though you could see the ending about halfway through, I thought the book interesting enough to finish. The paint thing was a bit \\"over the top\\" though. I enjoyed the previous three in the series more than this one, but I'm sure the next will be good again."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I made a mental note within the first 90 pages of this book &quot;I bet I know who did it and how&quot;.

This is my first &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; book, I did enjoy it enough to try the other two.One thing about reading a series about the same person is that you are familiar with their home, job, and city. Looks like with the Reacher books you can't count on any of those being the same."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"For me, Running Blind is amongst Lee Child's best Reacher novels. It was an exciting book, the plot was good and I really liked the charactrs. Usually, I am able to solve the Reacher novels quite early but this wasn't the case with Running Blind."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"In this novel, a serial killer is targeting female victims of harassment of the US military. With two dead bodies found in their own bath tubs full of green camouflage paint, No marks, no signs of violence and no apparent cause of death - somehow, Jack Reacher - our Jack Reacher - is the prime suspect.In this, the most untraditional Jack Reacher novel so far, our hero uses the most traditional detective skills and powers of deduction to track down the killer and save the life of an old flame.This one I give 4 stars out of 5, for another world class writing performance from Lee Child."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I had high hopes for this series. I started the first novel, Killing Floor, not long ago. It was a fun read, heavy on the action and the violence, but a little light on the plot and suspense. All in all, I thought it was above average and a good start. The 2nd novel had a really odd-ball plot, but over-the-top action. Reminded me of those 80's action movies. With the 3rd novel, the author starts going off track, and in this one, the 4th, I think he's crashed into the ditch.The \\"mystery\\" is a joke. A careful reader knows who did it about 1/3rd of the way into the novel. The \\"twist\\" can be seen far, far in advance. Maybe when the book was written this was considered a surprise, but nowadays many other novels and movies have covered this same ground. How the murders are committed can also be guessed early on, but most readers will hold back on that line of thought since it is so improbable. Events that took place in earlier books seem to have no meaning or impact here. For example, the FBI plays a prominent role in the 2nd book. But neither Reacher nor the FBI recall events from the previous book.This book is more of a \\"who did it\\" novel, and less of an action packed adventure. To me, Lee Child is a much better action writer than he is a mystery writer. Reading about all of the different ways that Jack Reacher can hurt or kill people is entertaining. Reading page after page of Jack Reacher, ace MP investigator, overlooking obvious clues is frustrating and annoying.EDIT: I thought about stopping after this book, but decided to try one of the books that were written more recently. I had read earlier reviews stating that the writing gets better over time. I took a look at the book list, and there were two books that jumped out: The Enemy, and The Affair. The were both written much later, but in terms of the events in the books, occur while Reacher was still in the Army. I felt it was OK to read these now without creating any \\"spoiler\\" situations.I liked these two books much, much better. The stories were tighter, with more plot, mystery, and investigation. Maybe it helps that it was Reacher's job, so there was a point to everything and not a guy in the right place at the wrong time kind of situation. I would gladly read more novels of Reacher's time in the military."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I really enjoyed this novel as I do all of Lee Child's novels.

You know your going to get a brilliantly constructed thriller, the quality of which is guaranteed, and you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

It just made no sense. It was fast paced and there were interesting twists, but it was fairly easy to unravel. Some of the irritating staccato dialogue was eliminated which is fine with me, but the book was still peppered with phrasing that no one in America would use. In general I enjoy the Reacher novels, but IMHO Lee Child needs to give Reacher a backpack with a change of clothes and a stick of deodorant. Female readers want to think of Reacher as a tough, sexy guy, but a week without a change of boxers gets in the way. Really!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Running Blind by Lee Child is another of the Jack Reacher series and pretty much what I have come to expect from any of them, which is tightly written, excellent murder mysteries. I have to admit that though in this one all the clues were there, the guilty character seemed just too obvious and I missed all of them! There is one other benefit to reading Reacher stories I'd like to mention. I am a poor traveler and generally expect the worst and over prepare and over pack. There's a lot of travel in this story and I read it just before leaving on a trip to cross the country myself. I was surprised that I not only packed much less for the trip, but did not suffer the usual anxieties either. Nothing bad ever happens on my trips and nothing happened on this one. The difference was I didn't spend so much time waiting for the sky to fall. I had my trusty toothbrush and was ready to take on the world."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Wow, I've put other things off that I should be doing so I could finish the latest Jack Reacher novel.

If you haven't start with &quot;The Killing Floor&quot; and work your way through the series. Each book gives us a little more insight into this Jack Reacher character.I do have one regret after reading the book though, now I have to wait several months for the next installment."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Okay, I've just finished this fourth entry in the Jack Reacher series, and I'm in a quandary. First and foremost, Lee Child is a very good writer, and although this one moves a little slower than its predecessors, it still maintained my interest---and also &quot;riled me up&quot; a little.I think Mr. Child definitely has a poor opinion of the FBI. This is the third of the series that has some really nasty FBI agents---bribing, blackmailing, insinuating absurdities, and even more! (If you've read the previous three, you will know what I mean!).The plot is great; the killer's m.o. is quite unusual and even if really far-fetched, works in that the reader never knows how the victims died! However, I must admit, that I had the killer figured out very early. Oh, yes, Lee did try to throw us some red herrings (including the enigmatic appearance of an Army chaplain, who comes out of nowhere, and disappears back, without any explanation!).And maybe I'm getting old fashioned, but come on, Jack. You have turned into a really self-centered, insensitive, self-pitying moron who refuses, yes REFUSES, to live in a civilized, realistic world. I know many readers think that Jack's meandering all over the globe makes him a free spirit, an independent guy, no chains to hold him down. It also makes him shallow and annoying. He says he loves Jodie--bull, Jack. You love the sex you have with her. If you really loved her, would you be so enamored with FBI agent Lisa Harper? And all this gobbledygook about commitments and normal living, it's just more self-centered crap focusing on your inability to live in a real world. And Child should be chastised for making Jodie the culprit in the end of the book. Oh, Jack, I had really started to like you, but even in &quot;Tripwire,&quot; I started seeing a side of you that made me respect and enjoy you less and less.You are a great detective, a remarkable physical presence, but society doesn't need guys who take the law into their own hands without any moral ramifications, and a man who uses women for his immediate pleasure but just can't bring himself to face the truth that he isn't worth their time.Now, with that out of my system, it's still an entertaining read, but I don't think I'll venture along with Jack any further. I enjoy escapist entertainment, after all, that's what it's all about. But don't give me a hero who breaks all the rules and invites us to see him as a hero.Goodbye, Jack!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"...you'd have to be to enjoy this book. Okay, I know it's fiction, but sooo many aspects of this book are ridiculously unbelievable. It started off with promise, but it seems as if he lost his way and just needed to finish the book. I've read the first three in this series so far. I'm glad I did, because if I had read this one first, I wouldn't have bothered with any more of his books. He's as awesome writer and his writing style keeps you on the edge of your seat, but I fell off while reading this one! Skip this one and move on to the next in the series. Hopefully, he recovered from his writer's block in his subsequent novels."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"He is a hero, trying to right the injustices in his part of the world. Though at times he goes outside the law, he always makes life better for the person he is protecting. At a new Italian restaurant in New York City, former MP Jack Reacher observes two thugs hitting on the owner for protection money. When they return to collect their fee, Jack provides personal payment, sending both punks to the hospital.FBI agents greet Jack with the knowledge that they believe he is a serial killer targeting female soldiers complaining about sexual harassment. Apparently, Jack knew three victims, but he has the perfect alibi since FBI agents had Jack under surveillance at the time the fourth murder occurred. The agents want Jack to help them uncover the identity of the killer because a department profiler insists that his personality is a match to that of the perpetrator. Jack refuses until they threaten his girlfriend. Jack begins his unique gathering of information that leads him to conclude that the FBI is traveling down the wrong paradigm, leaving former women in uniform in jeopardy unless he can persuade the department to change course.RUNNING BLIND is an exciting thriller starring a sensitive, honorable person struggling with keeping one foot in the civilized world. Anyone who has &quot;profiled&quot; F. Paul Wilson's &quot;Repairman Jack&quot; novels will realize the characters share many traits with the biggest difference being that Reacher is grounded in the physical realm while Repairman Jack deals with supernatural elements. The crux of this mystery lies in the intensity of the killer whose extraordinary energy matches that of Jack, thus freshening up the serial killer tale. With more novels like this one, Lee Child has the talent to become a superstar.Harriet KLausner"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Only good for light washclothes. Very flimsy. Not a good item at all.

This was an older one and I was very pleased to obtain it so easily."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Weak plot, thin characters, repetitive action. I'm sorry, but I actually believe that you can write action and still challenge your readers just a little bit (and though even more than that would be desirable I don't always expect it).As with the previous Reacher book I read, this one takes us around the US (did Mr. Child have a past as a geography teacher?), this time hunting down a serial killer. So smart is this Reacher that he has figured out the answer around the middle of the book and his childish \\"just-won't-tell-because-I'm-smarter-than-you\\" is probably intended to keep you glued to the book but frankly it's a cheap turn-off.The fact that all the characters, especially the FBI agents that he loves to hate, are one-dimensional stereotypes doesn't make the young blonde special agent he's partnering up with particularly attractive despite multiple reminders that she is or isn't wearing a bra (apparently depending on whether or not her plan today is to seduce Reacher or not). Not even the contemplating of whether or not, and ultimately why, to sell his house doesn't really give him much depth. Nice try, but try again.The only thing I will comment on regarding the plot [spoiler alert!] is voluntarily swallowing your tongue because you are under hypnosis. Oh, gimme a break!Due to the many positive reviews for Lee Child and his Reacher series I bought 3 books. The first was readable. This one, the second, kills time, at best. It will be a while until I read number 3. If you are looking for good entertainment, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I started on Lee Child's books with audio CDs in my car. Bad Luck and Hard Times introduced me to Jack Reacher amid other characters of Delta 10. As I advanced through the novels that came after that, I could see that Reacher had an interesting history that kept reappearing in many of the books. Some, like One Shot, The Enemy, and 61 Hours, were amazingly strong. I decided around Christmas to get those earlier books in the series to see how it all started. The Killing Floor showed me Reacher's connection to his brother, and it revealed that he was not always the existential hulk, big on principles and cold on consequences. I could see that Child had empathy, an interest in bad guys and what made them tick, and knew how to keep the story moving forward. Each book explored new territory, and each brought Reacher back to rediscovering an America he never knew growing up and helping small town Americans rediscover the values they had traded for entitlement and a life cut off from a concern for others. But, with Running Blind, Child seems to be stuck and running blind, himself. He moves into pure mystery, one designed to look at sexuality, Reacher's present relationship that forces him to consider settling down or moving on, and what are his personal priorities. But, to accomplish this, he gives us a novel where the killer is obvious from the beginning and the only way to keep his readers from knowing this all along is to throw cooked-up red herrings in their path. Then, he attributes bumbling attitudes to people who don't deserve to be slighted so easily just to make Reacher an outsider rather than the one who leaves everyone wondering, \\"Who was that masked man?\\" To, then, rename the book as The Visitor has repeated the error of getting Child's readers excited by something that is not what it seems. Let's be happy that the real novels that have followed have brought us a hero that addresses our need to straighten our spines, increase our empathy, and bulk up our principles to deal with the problems facing us today."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is a 5 star Jack Reacher novel.

None of the reviews tell you about the brilliant blot, the classic Jack Reacher attitude and approach to solving mysteries and the twists and turns that keep you awake at night.

I would say Tripwire was the best, and this was the worst. I gave this three stars because much of the writing is quite compelling and true to the character--but there is a major disappointment in terms of plausibility failure. I won't give it away (it's not quite as bad as \\"then he woke up and realized it was all a dream,\\" but not too far behind that). Let's call it a plot device you definitely wouldn't expect from a good writer. If you can overlook this big problem, and you like Reacher, then you'll probably enjoy the rest of the book. Two and a half stars, leaning a bit toward three."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"What woman finds a man who doesn't use toothpaste, deoderant, or clean underwear, and never changes clothes attractive? Maybe a cave woman. I couldn't enjoy the book thinking of the poor people in a car or on a plane with the reeking Jack. The ending with him, of course, with a single crashing blow breaking the neck of the killer and the F.B.I. saying \\"now we own you\\", well this part wasn't even a one star. The book had a lot of potential, but was disappointing."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Give me a break. I like Mr. Child's Reacher so I'm willing to suspend quite a bit of disbelief to get a good read. But the idea of the FBI threatening to let some mob person beat up your girlfriend if you don't serve them and then keeping you in a locked room while you're helping them? Hello Mr. Attorney General? Hello CNN? I don't think that's going to be happening in America. Not to mention them standing around watching as Reacher beat up a couple of hoods while under surveillance. I'm sure that broke a few laws too. Pull the other leg please.And then we have the MO. Please. I doubt that scenario could be pulled off once much less four times. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it couldn't be accomplished without the victim thrashing around and getting paint on the floor. Certainly wouldn't be a quite, peaceful death.And if Jack doesn't start changing his clothes and practicing some better hygiene all his women are going to be singing is Hit the Road, Jack.......OK, I'll have to say that even with one preposterous thing after another I still read every word. Mr. Child is a talented writer and I look forward to continuing improvement as he puts Jack through his paces. Maybe I should have given this one three stars afterall."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"For the first 300 pages, this is the best of the Jack Reacher novels. I am not a believer in series and this one proves my argument that one character needs one book and one book only. Jack Reacher is a walking nerve end, likely to take offense at almost nothing and likely to give offense for no good reason. He is a hero who is very hard to like over the course of a book, though we often root for him. He is almost autistic in that he knows a lot about fighting and police work and the military, but hasn't got a clue about how the rest of life works. And you just know a guy like this is going to get into big trouble.Though there is a nasty murderer and vicious gang members in the book, the FBI also comes off as a major villain. If the agency really acts the way it does in this book, then it ought to be deep-sixed immediately.All those gripes in place, the story is very compelling and Reacher's resourcefulness keeps your interest. However, the payoff, the ending where all of the terrific mysteries are explained, was totally unrealistic and an insult to the reader. That is pretty much all I can say without giving too much away, but, you have to be pretty gullible to believe the story could have happened that way.Lee Child has a ton of talent and I hope he puts Reacher to sleep for awhile and works on some books with new leading characters. And, hopefully, next time, he won't paint himself into a corner where a fantasy ending is the only way to escape."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"RUNNING BLIND, the newest novel by Lee Child, continues the saga of ex-military policeman and drifter, Jack Reacher. But wait! Reacher has settled down in this book. He now owns a house, a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and has the undying love of attorney, Jodie Garber, who fans will remember from TRIPWIRE. Is this our hero? Is this the life he was cut out for? Maybe not. Anyway, things kind of get disrupted in Reacher's life when the FBI suddenly pull him in for questioning with regards to the deaths of three ladies, each of whom was mysteriously murdered and left in a bathtub of green paint. The ladies had two things in common with each other. All three were involved in sexual harassment cases while still in the Army, and each knew Jack Reacher. One of the FBI agents, Julia Lamarr, thinks that the killer's profile matches Reacher to a T. If he isn't the serial killer, then it is someone like him with a military background. The FBI believes that the killer will continue his spree of perfect crimes, unless Reacher agrees to help. The only problem is that when Reacher finally joins the hunt, the Feds choose to ignore his advise. He doesn't think that it is a soldier, but they don't want to hear that. When another lady dies, Reacher knows that he must find the killer himself, or it simply won't get done. While he is visiting crime scenes and talking to potential victims, Reacher is also trying to decide the future of his relationship with Jodie. Does he want to remain a &quot;settled&quot; individual, or does he want to get back on the road again? The first half of RUNNING BLIND started off like a heat-seeking missile, but by the last quarter it kind of fizzled out for me. If the reader follows Reacher's advise about looking for motive and who has the most to gain, they will figure out who the killer is long before the FBI does. Mr. Child does throw a number of &quot;red herrings&quot; into the mix, trying to redirect the reader's attention from who the real killer is. One of the &quot;red herrings&quot; more or less appears from out of nowhere, then disappears, and is never fully explained to my satisfaction. It was something I didn't appreciate on Mr. Child's part. Also, I didn't quite buy the method the killer uses to murder his victims. I have heard of death occurring in that particular manner, but I just couldn't see using it to kill four different people. It seemed far-fetched to me. Finally, I felt that RUNNING BLIND didn't have enough action on Reacher's part, and that the ending was a simply a little too weak. Now, I'll say this. Mr. Child's first book, KILLING FLOOR, was one of the best debut novels I have ever read, and I still highly recommend to friends and strangers. His last three books, however, have not been in the same league as the first, which I find disappointing. DIE TRYING, TRIPWIRE and RUNNING BLIND are good reads, and I know that Mr. Child is certainly trying to write as good a novel as possible with each succeeding one. I wish he could just write another one as &quot;GREAT&quot; as KILLING FLOOR."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I would like to get my money back from Amazon.com.

One can appreciate the originality of the author's idea (there is great potential there), and I can see what Lee Child was trying to achieve, however, the manner in which he achieves is preposterous at best. Don't blame him. Blame his editor.There are so many things that don't make sense with the plot that you lose count after the first 50 pages. And to make matters worse, the book contains very little suspense. Chapter after chapter nothing much happens, except characters going around in circles, waiting. There is a deadline to aim for and people are dying or are in mortal danger but the protagonists are content to sit around and admit they've run out of ideas without making the slightest effort to think of something else. The manner in which Jack Reacher is brought into the story is bizarre and non-sensical.And perhaps the one thing that really is bothersome is the manner in which the author treats the FBI agents. Reacher is the anti-establishment. That is clear. And you can't get much more establishment than the FBI, but to portray all of them (except one, whose only role is to fawn over Reacher's manly prowess) as criminal and stupid, is lazy.The whole book betrays signs of laziness on the part of the author. The most blatant example being his complete lack of background or even interest in criminal profiling. He didn't do his homework and he covers it up with weak and silly arguments. And if he couldn't bother to work and develop a proper plot, action and suspense, at least he could have developed characters. Instead, these people are not even two-dimensional. They're one-dimensional, mere shadows. Heck, Reacher himself barely reaches two-dimensions. Bad, bad, bad! It's a good thing I didn't read the book on a flight or else I would have jumped out for sure."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I love Jack Reacher...I would however, love him more if he bathed more often. The man sleeps in his clothes with no more luggage than a toothbrush!In the past, Jack has been a larger than life hero and in &quot;Running Blind&quot;, he becomes a larger than life slob, vigilante and all around disgusting bully. He is handsome, smart and has powerful connections with the military, and I find it demeaning the way he resorts to solving all problems by either denial or violence. The way he treats Jody is obscene!I think Mr. Child was out of line in his portrayal of the FBI. I would like to think Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity still mean what they used to.I enjoyed the book, but, figured out the killer and the &quot;how&quot; very early on.

If you own that title,(good book, by the way), don't waste your money on this."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book is Running Blind sold under another title. Fortunately I read the preview of the first chapters and realized this before spending my money.Running Blind (Jack Reacher, No. 4)"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the fourth or fifth \\"Jack Reacher novel I have read and I enjoyed the others far more. I can't help thinking that this was actually Lee Child's first Jack Reacher novel that he hadn't been able to get published earlier, because there is a much more unpolished style to the writing and plotting. More glaringly, Reacher himself seems less mature as a person and we are to believe that he really would go weeks without a change of clothes or a shave, with no one complaining about the smell, and beautiful women still drawn to him.If this wasn't sophomoric and jarring enough, somehow Reacher has forgotten that all he has to do to get his FBI blackmail problem to go away is to call the head of the FBI and tell him about it. If this is really book four in the last couple of years in \\"Die Trying\\" Reacher has bailed out the FBI by rescuing a high level FBI agent and saving the FBI from a huge embarrassing scandal. We are somehow to believe that he doesn't remember this.In \\"Die Trying\\", FBI agents are appropriately quite bright and only realistically misled from within. In this book we are to believe that even in a high end Serial Killer task force unit, they are inflexible and totally unable to even consider a new idea from a man they blackmailed into helping them. This is as ridiculous as the murder method is impossible.You can see in this book the seeds of an excellent writer and if you let yourself go can be carried along for quite awhile (and I can forgive phony red herrings like the office in the Pentagon scene), but this is neither the quality of character or of plotting I have come to expect from Lee Child. This is a first novel kind of effort, not the polished output of a \\"Best Seller\\" quality writer.If this is your first Reacher book skip this one completely and start with \\"Killing floor\\". If not, jump to book five and let this one gather dust on the shelves as Lee Child's worst and probably first effort."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"As an avid fan of Lee Child's novels I leapt on this as soon as it came to my attention. Fortunately my enthusiasm was not without warrant. The plot is slightly more complex than the other 3 Reacher novels as it continues switching between characters throughout the story, however the twists and turns more than make up for this. The basic solution to the mystery comes early on in the novel although it's easy to miss, but when it sunk in a part of me wanted to turn straight to the back page of the book to see if I was right,(instead I called my father who'd bought me the book but sneaked a read first. Parents! ). Fortunately the truly genius twist had eluded me and I was forced to stay awake until 3 in the morning, determined to get the answer before sleep claimed my energy. Reacher's character is as usual, very much a 'don't mess kinda guy' and this can wear thin at times as he can be a little bit too incredible on occaision. HOWEVER, if you can suspend disbelief for just a while then the book is as thoroughly enjoyable as you could hope for, with gang warfare, invisible assasins and continuous murder, mystery and suspense. I'm now looking forward to the next one in the hope that mr child serves up more of the same"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the fourth Reacher novel I've read and they've steadily gone downhill from \`Killing Floor'. From Lee Child not knowing diddly-squat about the military life Reacher purports to come from to the unbelievable string of coincidences in the storyline, Child totally stretches the realm of credibility.Jack Reacher is coerced in to leading a FBI investigation of several murders, and all the while the FBI steadfastly refuses to entertain any of his ideas. If that isn't bad enough for Reacher, the FBI is persistently trying to blackmail and pin crimes on him. Of course, that cannot stop our hero, Reacher, from solving the murders. Heck, he even gets all the girls, but just temporarily.I guess what really turned me off about this book was that: Reacher is seemingly infallible, the FBI is an incompetent modern day Gestapo, and the egregious errors about the military i.e., Fort Dix, NJ being a Marine Corps Air station, C'mon!Jack Reacher would be a somewhat interesting character if Child didn't continually try to turn him in to a psychic superman who never changes his clothes."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"OK, so Lee Child isn't exactly Tolstoy or Dickens, and his hero is a misanthropic thug, but who hasn't daydreamed about being a non-person, wandering about using wits, wiles, and fists to right injustices and settle scores? And that's Jack Reacher who does not try to subvert or trick the system with false IDs and such. He takes the bus, pays cash, buys new clothing when the old stuff wears out. No family, no friends, no entanglements, no regrets - a strong, self-reliant character who floats on the surface, diving deeper only when he feels an injustice has been done. The premise is strained, no doubt, but the writing is just good enough to make it readable. I find it a guilty pleasure and enjoy watching Reacher get himself into and out of difficult circumstances, trying to make things right. So, yep, most of the one- and two-star reviewers are correct, but then they probably think James Bond is not entertaining. If you don't much care for Bond, Reacher won't please you much either, for Reacher is the crude American cousin to Bond. Who says sociopaths aren't entertaining?"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I bought this with the two \`Soft Target\` novels by Conrad Jones (electric thrillers!) only to find that the storyline seemed way to familiar to be a Reacher book that I hadnt already read...low and behold it is the same as Visitor but renamed and rebound.....not very fair really on Lee Child fans...there is no mention on the cover of either book that they are the same...which is naughty to say the least.Good job my two other purchases were brilliant!!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The first book I read of Child's was Without Fail. The book was brilliant with a wicked main character and plot. I immediately went searching for more. Other reviews have pressed the notion that Reacher's vagrant style is slightly unrealistic and anti-civilization. Although I'd agree that in Running Blind (aka the Visitor) Reacher's near sightedness when it came to his living was rather annoying, in the other books I liked it. It added to Reacher's personality and his character.However, Child has begun to take Reacher's need to isolate himself way too far. Running Blind made Reacher come off as slightly self centered and a rendition of the loose cannon hitman in the movie The Protector.I don't have as much respect for the plot of Running Blind as I did the other books (especially Without Fail). It was predictable and highly unrealistic (in the sense of motive and killer).I felt like the book built up so much and then just bombed completely in the end delivery.Child has established his pattern. Reacher meets girl. Eventually has sex with her. Kills some bad guys. Girl gets killed (or they split up undoubtably never to see each other again).It would be nice to see Reacher with the same woman for more than one book. Or to have him settle down even a little. Although it seems that this is the event which Child seems driven to never let happen.One other thing that bothered me in RB more than it did in other books was that it seemed to me Child used a lot of shorter sentences in clusters. ie Reacher sat down. It was raining. Got up and opened the closet. Pulled on his coat and shut the door.It seemed more pronounced in this book, but maybe it's just me.It is a little hard that Without Fail was my first book. It set such high standards for the following reads, but I'll still read the remaining books. I have faith that there's at least one more great book in Child's line."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Wow! My favourite Reacher so far.

Reacher has been coerced by the FBI to assist them with the investigation and he reluctantly decides to help the agency. Unfortunately, most of the agents on this assignment really do not respect nor like him with the exception of a very attractive yet inexperienced 29 year old named Lisa Harper. She also proves to be a valuable ally to Reacher in his search for this cold-blooded killer.Very graphic with intense language but very exciting book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child spins wonderful tales, convoluted and popping with curious and intriguing characters. his failing is he lacks pace. Long descriptive paragraphs are fine as he gets his plot going. He does them well. But when the action gets perking along he seems to forget the drama and instead lessen by long, needless descriptions that do nothing but clog up the pace. In Running Blind, he also makes one of his few factual mistakes. He has his hero Reacher say: &quot;You ever been to Israel? Women in the front line there too....&quot; I don't know where he got this mistaken idea. Women in the Israel Defense Force serve as secretaries and other noncombat roles, usually as the concubines of the officers."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"My sole and only problem with this book is that fact that it's a big mystery...that I figured out less than a third of the way into the book. All you have to do is ask yourself the right question about what seems to be going on at the right time, and both the ultimate motive and the perpetrator are obvious.Otherwise, the book is competently written and the protagonist engaging. Child also steps away from the previous book where he gave Jack a wish-fulfillment ending that threatened to remove all of his character."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Jack Reacher usually is a bit more physical than in this novel. Instead of busting heads, he's really figuring out a mystery. I'm not complaining though, I raced through this book as quickly as the 3 earlier Reacher books. I'm glad to see that author Lee Child figured out a logical way to get Reacher back out in the world and having adventures. At the end of the last book it looked like he might be stuck in a bucolic country life with his new girl friend. Fat chance! I personally hope the business of Reacher vs. the Feds doesn't continue into other books, though. I think that's a bit overdone, the evil feebs who will stop at nothing to protect their agency.

One of his best books."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is my fourth Reacher novel and the lone wolf business is wearing a little thin. I am halfway through the book and struggling. Our anti-hero has yet to change his clothes and must be getting a bit ripe. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, writers are not required to notify readers every time a character changes clothes--it's assumed. But, since the author makes a major deal out of Reacher traveling only with a toothbrush (fold-up, no less), it becomes an issue. I find myself waiting for Reacher to launder his clothes, or as is his custom, throw them away and buy new ones. Other irritants: Everybody (Reacher obviously excluded) wears \\"pressed\\" jeans. Who the hell irons their jeans these days? And what's with the braless FBI agent? Finally, our man of honor is becoming increasingly obnoxious. You simply can't say ANYTHING to him without getting a fairly lame, if snotty reply. His hatred of the FBI's use of \\"profiling\\" to catch serial killers borders on the pathological. Reacher has some real issues here. Sadly, I have a few more Reacher books in the Amazon pipeline and will have to slog through them, periodically stopping, sighing and glaring at the picture of the author conveniently placed on the back cover."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Ok, long time fan of Lee Child Reacher series. I only have 3 left to read (listen to). This one just too much FBI blackmailing threats without good ol' Jack finding a way, his way, to remedy the situation. Either Lee should have not had the FBI chief be SUCH a a-hole and somehow come around to give Jack props OR Lee should have had Jack emit revenge on this this guy in a way smackdown way or had him get fired/arrested. Jack rolled over way to easy on this guy and had a weak way of threating the FBI jag at the end. Otherwise, the plot was great. Keep up the normal great work, Pursuader rocked and I'm on Enemy another great writing."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Although Child takes the reader on an interesting ride that keeps him from putting the book down, much of the book is a bit over the top. After exciting the reader throughout the book, Child disappoints with an unrealistic half - baked ending resulting in a poor rating."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child writes a engaging thriller every time. I'd already read this Jack Reacher novel when it was first released and enjoyed it as much second time around on my new Kindle. Child creates a sense of slow burning tension, frequently defused by Reacher's deceptive laid-back manner, and manipulates the plot with such dexterity and finesse that, if you've not read the book before, the end will surprise. And if you have read it once, twice or thrice previously, it still delights with it's masterful deployment of intelligent twists and turns in the plot. What's not to love about each and every Jack Reacher story?"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher novels, but this one is by far my least favorite. Not believable in the least."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"On this book I have to get personal. I read five books of Lee Child's, this being the sixth. The others I would all rate four or five, this one is bad. What makes it bad? Well, I had selected the perp but as I continued reading I became confused. Good writer's share the protagonist's knowledge of the crime as it develops with the reader but in this case Child definitely tries to insert false clues. He uses italic type when he switches from Reacher's point of view, I will give him credit for that, he does use third person view point for one of his other characters but then inserts second person point of view for yet another, and I assume he thinks he is playing fair with the reader. We are supposed to know these two italicized inserts are two different people? How many people would know that? Not only that, they are so smoothly inserted I admit I was confused, thought they were the same and was forced to change my choice of perp. When the new one was unfrocked I had to admit I should have known, but that was only because I had taken creative writing courses. I would not think the ordinary reader would note the change in point of view, even I had to go back over the inserts and see that he really did maintain the point of view between the two. I felt cheated, and stupid. The story was interesting, why did he feel he had to use the inserts? They were not essential to the plot line except to confuse the reader.

Forced by the FBI to be their consultant, Reacher must find the murderer and also decide if he is willing to stay in New York with his girlfriend, Jodie, or continue his transient ways. The greatest part of this thriller is how the women die. They are all found naked in the bathtub coated with three cans of army paint. There is no evidence left at the scene, and the FBI can't even figure out how the women are killed. Reacher is the only one who does not believe in the FBI's profile, and he sets out to prove them wrong. Lee Child delivers another masterful thriller."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've only read one other Lee Child book: &quot;Killing Floor&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it.

For the sake of those of you who have not read the book, I won't elaborate on &quot;the subject.&quot; But that's my gripe. This scenario could not have happened as he wrote it.

But after finishing it in one day (I just couldn't put it down) I was very impressed.This thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire novel and makes you come back wanting for more.After reading the other reviews, I noticed there were some negative comments about the italic paragraphs throughout the book. Personally I loved them and couldn't wait until the next one appeared. There were also comments which I may agree with. The FBI does seem a little harsh in this book but that may be what it is actually like. Who knows?Despite very minor flaws like the one mentioned above, I think this book is another great hit for Lee Child and a smash read for anyone who likes a great thriller. I can't wait until the next Child book comes out later this year!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"i was so impressed with this book i read it in two days and couldn't wait to turn the page. usually i can figure out bites and pieces of who did it, in this book i only figured out a small piece at about page 300. then at page 340 when the book was almost ending i got it. this is really a big 10. now i want her to write more and for real readers to read this truly very good read. carl marciano"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"About 1/3 of the way into this book it's painfully obvious who the killer is.

Throughout the whole book obvious red flags should have... WOULD have caught the attention of any characters with enough brain power to scramble eggs. It's as if Jack Reacher's IQ is the only one high enough to add two and two together. This is a DUMB book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am a fan of the Reacher series and this is the fourth book in the series and the fourth I have read. And I will keep going with the series, but I might not have gone on if this one was number one. It is far below the quality of the others. Jack Reacher is a loner but in this one it is too extreme. Hope for better in number five."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Make this my fourth entry into the world of Jack Reacher, having already read the first three books in this series. Of those, I loved Killing Floor, didn't love Tripwire and enjoyed Die Trying. When I started Running Blind, I was just happy to be back with Jack Reacher, a character who guys can relate to and women can fall for. Who doesn't like the brooding bad boy type with the Robin Hood vigilante mentality?I was so caught up in this book right from the beginning. As a matter of fact, I emailed a friend of mine just to say how much I was enjoying the Child's book I was reading. At the time of that writing, she was already on his current book so I was far behind her. This book was everything Tripwire wasn't in my opinion. It was fast paced with Reacher helping the FBI, obviously under duress, and his relationship with Jodi is still in tact. As with all of Jack's appearances, things will start to fall apart shortly.While Jack is always chasing someone very smart, we all know that he is that much smarter. In this case, it's a serial killer bent on doing away with former Army employees who have left the force due to sexual harassment. The FBI profilers have narrowed it down to the exact type of person the killer is....someone exactly like Jack. This hunt will take Jack from the east coast to the west coast and back again until he figures out who the culprit is. We already know he's smarter than they are so we know he's going to be successful.I loved this book until......it got to the ending. I see many other reviewers have complained about this so just add me to the list. When are authors going to stop neatly tying up their books with ridiculous scenarios. I have something else to say and I don't want anyone who hasn't read the book yet to read what I'm going to say so please move on to the next review.I said move on to the next review or else you're going to read something you don't want to read. Okay so here's my beef. Am I crazy? Weren't there more than two paragraphs in the book where a colonel is sitting at his desk, forty to forty-five minutes away from Quantico, looking at the list of eleven women, four of which had already been killed. If this wasn't the killer, who the heck was he? Was he the chaplain who appears out of nowhere in the end. A chaplain who comes walking, not even driving, up a hill in the Pacific Northwest. And I'm so sick of authors making everything an inside job. It's like if a woman gets killed, the authorities first look at the husband. I'm now beginning to think that every time I pick up a mystery, I should just look at the cops investigating the case to come up with the killer. I'm sick of it, I tell you. Okay, enough of my rant. I'd love any of you who have read this book to please leave me a comment so I can know who the heck this colonel was and what part he played in the book.Up until the ending, this book was almost five stars for me....the ending dropped it down to three and a half."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have read several of the Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels and enjoyed them. Up until now. Child creates great characters (Reacher being preeminent) and has a talent for great individual scenes. His endings tend to be a bit clumsy, but I've forgiven that in the past for the joy of the ride. I can't do it with this one. The solution on this one, re. how the murders are committed, is so absurd that it has effectively ended my interest in the series. I figured out the probable solution early on during the book, but I kept telling myself I must be wrong as such a solution would be ridiculous. Unfortunately the ridiculous solution was the solution. I apologize for mentioning the ending without going into detail as to what it was and what specifically was wrong with it, but there's no way to do this without being a \\"spoiler\\" and I don't want to mess up the (already bad) ending for people who do choose to buy the book. If you like Lee Child, please continue to read him but know that he has done better work than this."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Wonderful book when I read it under another name.

This is absolutely wrong."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that this was a \\"retitled\\" book.

What a poor policy."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Author Lee Childs brings back the invincible ex-MP, Jack Reacher. This time, could he be the serial killer the FBI is after? Could he be the maniac that leaves dead bodies smeared with camoflauge paint in their own bathtubs?In, &quot;Running Blind&quot;, we are privy to an edgy laser paced thriller. After some shennanigans from the government with Jack's galpal, he willingly searches for a killer who leaves no clues. Jack begins with a few common threads; all of the victims brought gritty sexual charges against their military superiors, all won their cases, all then resigned, and then they were all found dead in their own bathtubs.I do not want to take up too much of your time with this review...when you can be engrossed in this blazing blitz of a book on your own!other reading suggestions: &quot;Messiah&quot; by Boris Starling and &quot;The Empty Chair&quot; by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the first Lee Child book I've read, which is perhaps unfortunate, as several of the other reviews indicate that this book is not as good as some of the others in the Jack Reacher series. (By the way, this book has two different titles: \\"Running Blind\\" in the USA and Canada, and \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK and elsewhere.)To start with the positive stuff, I love Lee Child's writing style. I'm a fan of thrillers, and this means I'm used to fairly mediocre writing, so this book was a very nice change.The basic idea behind Jack Reacher's character is also interesting. He's a sort of vigilante Robin Hood, righting wrongs around him that the normal forces in society don't take proper care of. And he's not just muscle and weapons and fighting techniques, he's also very intelligent and knowledgeable and observant.I also liked the basic story line, with a serial killer who has the FBI outsmarted and a motive that will come as a surprise.So all-in-all I found the book appealing in many ways.But now comes the list of problems that I have with this book, problems that are sufficient that it's doubtful if I'll ever get around to reading another book by Lee Child.The characters aren't really believable. Jack Reacher is supposed be a loner, but not wanting to own anything other than a folding toothbrush must be a bit problematic. Lisa Harper is having problems with sexual harassment in the FBI so she gives up wearing a bra. Jodie Jacobs has found her long-lost secret love from her youth, but still prefers to pursue a high-flying career rather than make the relationship her top priority. And the nasty FBI guys are so nasty that Internal Affairs would be after them if they were ordinary cops.On top of the unbelievable characters we have a story that lacks realism and seems contrived. The most unrealistic part involves the method by which the murderer kills the victims, which in my opinion is totally impossible on two different counts. Unfortunately, I can't describe this problem in detail without revealing too much and getting this review labeled as a spoiler.So I think I'll wish Jack Reacher good luck in his continuing lonely travels, and continue my search for thrillers that appeal to me on other shelves in the bookstores of cyberspace and elsewhere.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am a Jack Reacher fan and am currently finishing the tenth novel by Lee Child (The Hard Way). I was astonished to discover a Jack Reacher novel I had never heard of. But then, when I read the description of the plot, I am fairly certain that this book was re-published under the title \\"Running Blind\\" which is the fourth Reacher novel."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"While fairly well-written for the thriller genre, this book contains some of the worst use of psychology I have ever encountered since the early '40s, when people really believed that hypnosis was this terrifying, all-powerful technique that could drive anyone to do anything. However, the science has since then progressed and even we the hoi poloi now know better. The most cursory research should have informed this author of the basic unsoundness of his murder method. His insistence on its use grated on my nerves and utterly destroyed any enjoyment I may have derived from the book. Characters are badly fleshed-out, awkwardly motivated, and flatter than a stack of pancakes. I guessed the murder's identity and the murder method one-third way through the book, thought to myself, Nah, it's too ridiculous, flipped to the end and Lo, I was right! What a waste of time."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Continuing with the Jack Reacher series, I'm up to the 4th installment... Running Blind by Lee Child. Still liking the series a lot, and this one had me guessing until the end...Reacher is coerced into helping out on a case by the FBI. He happened to be in a restaurant when part of a gang came in looking for protection money. Jack took matters into his own hands to break it up, but he also stumbled into an FBI stakeout. Now if he doesn't help solve a potential serial killer, he might end up getting blamed for the deaths. The women being killed all were ex-military and had filed (and won) harassment cases against superiors. Reacher knows them, as he was part of the military police presence that was involved at the time. The women who are dying are all discovered immersed in a bathtub full of camouflage paint, and apparently have gone under voluntarily and without a struggle. No clues, no reason why, but they're still very dead. The FBI is relying on psychological profiling to narrow down the killer, but Jack figures that's all a crock. The struggle is to figure out if they'll listen to him before another victim shows up...Like the other Reacher novels, you're never quite sure who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I figured there would be a plot twist somewhere, but the one I got wasn't the one I was expecting. Definitely a page turner to see how it's going to unfold. The subplot at play here is the relationship between Jodie (from the 3rd book) and Jack, and whether his foray into the world of responsibility will send him packing back to his nomadic life once again. That came to an interesting point at the end, and I'm curious to see how it will play out in installment #5...Fun read..."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I strongly suggest that anyone who contemplates buying this book on the basis of the strong overall rating go immediately to the one-star ratings for a dose of reality--and nevermnd the fact that they contain spoilers.Those slashing reviews point out many of the outrageous faults of this book. I shall therefore limit myself to just two areas.Jack Reacher is a totally immature, highly disfunctional, neurotic thug who, for some wholly elusive reason, seems to be irresistibly attractive to most women. The fact that he owns just one set of clothes which he NEVER changes over the whole course of the book and for heaven knows how long before the book starts and after it closes strikes me as making that attractiveness more than slightly improbable--but, hey, maybe some women like a man whom they can smell before they can see.The killer's identity is painfully obvious about half-way through the book, not from any logical analysis--for their is no logic here--but from the endlessly unnecessary prominence given to the character, that character's relationships and that character's motives. If that is not bad enough, the killer's overall plan is an ancient wheeze that was executed with infinitely more skill by Agatha Christie in \\"The ABC Murders.\\" Finally, worst, is the actual method of killing, for which I have just one word: ridiculous!There is only one way in which to enjoy this sort of book: turn off all your higher brain functions and simply enjoy the rush. If you are of a disposition to do that, then this is a three-star book, otherwise it fully deserves its one-star (or lower) status.LEC/Am/1-10"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Running Blind is a definite step up from TRIPWIRE, which absolutely stunk, but that's still not saying much for this book.Frequent readers of this genre will figure out the motive, the method and the identity of the killer hundreds of pages before Jack Reacher and the entire FBI do. Sure I was momentarily distracted by some of the red herrings Child threw at me, not the ridiculous appearance of an Army chaplain from out of the blue towards the end, that was just lame.KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING remain my favorites in this series. The Jack Reacher character is getting annoying by now with his steadfast refusal to own anything that doesn't fit in his pockets. That includes any changes of clothes! Jack just sleeps in the buff and lets his clothes air out to wear day in and day out. I'm about the same size as Jack, six foot five and 260lbs, and believe me, if I didn't change clothes daily there is no way bra-less FBI agents or gorgeous Wall St. lawyers would be throwing themselves at me. Not that they do anyway, but that's another story.I may pick up another Jack Reacher story in the future but only if I can find it in my local library where I found this title.

Absolutely recommend this and all books."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Save yourself some time: skip to the last sentence of this review. There were always problems with the Reacher stories. I thought this one was new, and wanted to see if there had been some sort of improvement in Child's basic writing skills set, but no. Same old same old. Or that's what I thought till I realized I had already read it, long ago. Given that recognition, the clumsiness of the characterizations, the fantastic contrivance of plots, and the slavish devotion to vigilante themes were like former friends that we outgrew as adolescents. If there was some slightest shred of plausibility I missed it. Initially (when I finished reading it on Kindle) I gave it two starts because one way or another I did finish it. Then I realized that I finished it because I just couldn't believe there was any rational explanation for the plots, and it turns out there wasn't. I wouldn't have expected the depiction of the FBI to bear much relationship to reality (although anybody could do 5 minutes' research and do a better job) but Child's depiction of the Army, and of military matters, is so far removed from reality that it is a joke. These are vigilante fantasy stories that will appeal to the few who can suspend enough disbelief. I cannot recommend this book, and if I had paid for it (I got it through a library loan) I would be asking for a refund."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"First person in Killing Floor was a nice touch, I liked the dark character when we the reader could get inside of his head. Now I could be wrong about that, but the connection seemed closer. The second and third person narative in the resulting books is dryer, less visceral, less involving. Lee Child crafts a believable mystery with but a few stumbling points. His television series background makes for a visual style that moves along and shows the story rather than telling it. Childs's plots are good, well laid out and surprising.Reacher is a loner with a dark and dangerous nearly conscience free mode of action. Damn the consequences! Reacher blunders forward in a bigger is better method of intimidating action. I'll read another."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"A good air-trip novel.

I don't get those that thought this was something less than a wonderfully told mystery, but I respect their right to think that way.There is a serial murderer on the loose and Jack reacher gets roped into the search for him by the FBI who had actually considered him as a candidate for being the killer. Women who complained of sexual harrassment while in the service and who brought charges against the men who harrassed them are being killed in a ritual fashion. Because of his familiarity with the service (Reacher is a retired Army Major who served in the military police) and because while the FBI had him under surveilance they saw him banging the heads of two guys who were working the protection rackets and could charge him with a crime if they chose, Reacher agrees reluctantly to be a consultant on the matter.The leader of the group is very big into profiling and she believes she knows the type of person who would be doing this crime. Reacher has to battle her misconceptions during most of the book as he finally gets drawn into the hunt in earnest.The author has done a first class job in this tightly drawn mystery and I have to admit that when the identity of the killer was revealed, it was a total surpise. I have nothing but praise for this effort and found it very rewarding to read."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery. Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for. Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out.

He has inadvertently started a cult following with readers calling themselves \\"Reacher's Creatures\\" of which I am one. I love Jack Reacher. I will admit the first one I read I kept looking back at the photo of Lee Child thinking \\"this man wrote this big tough guy?\\" He looks so mild mannered and Jack Reacher is anything but mild mannered. He was a military MP and he was one of the best. Problem is Jack can't stop. He's wonderful and he is a true hero which we don't have many of any more. These are so well written that when you realize you are coming to the end I begin to slow down so it won't end so soon. He's rough, he's tough just as he has to be. But he can't settle down. Everybody that reads these wants to at least know him. He is a real character. We want him to be our friend. Lee Child made him come alive for us.

Reacher is completely infallible compared to everyone else. It's bad enough that his chest is bulletproof, but in this book an MP is smarter than everyone at the FBI. The Behavioral Science Unit is not perfect, but they are certainly smart. This idea that Reacher is the only intelligent person is ridiculous. Consider the scene where he tells the profiler/hypnotist extraordinaire that what she calls 'profiling' he calls 'common sense.' So, that means that although the art/science of profiling took years and years of refining, failure, attempts and effort, our little MP-turned-Navy Seal-turned Sherlock Holmes-turned Clarice Starling has the same investigative abilities because of....common sense. He isn't superman, don't make him out to be. By the middle of the book I hated Reacher, hated what happened to character and was legitimately rooting for him to be wrong at every turn.2. Learn the absolute most basic, fundamental information about hypnosis before writing a ham-fisted Manchurian Candidate plot. Ridiculous.3. The \\"just in time\\" ending is preposterous. Like a bad episode of Criminal Minds without the attractive people to look at. If you can't find a way to get Reacher/Harper in the same area as the murder fluidly, then don't do it. Let the murder happen and go about your business. The contrived deus ex machina of Reacher keeping things to himself so no one else can be involved and go check on the victim first is nonsense.Don't buy this book. Really. For the reasons above, and others, it is a weak, contrived book showing how the author's work must suffer when he cranks these out so quickly. Personally, I'm giving Reacher and Child one more shot. Unfortunately, I expect that Reacher learns to fly and becomes omnipotent in the next book changing this from some decent thriller fare to out and out superhero-fantasy."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Twice doing my frequent Amazon purchases I have purchased the same book or cd twice due to possibly? double clicking in error.The refund is not enough to justify the hassle and money to return.Thanks to all the CONSIDERATE reviewers here I avoided another double."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I read a lot, and some fraction of what I read is junk, but this book goes way past my junk tolerance level. Jack Reacher, the central character, is a mere cartoon. Some of the blurbs in the paperback edition compared Reacher to Dave Robicheaux or Spenser or Travis McGee, but each of these guys has a real, complex personality. Reacher just never comes alive. And it's hard to see how he could. He inhabits a book devoid of a single believable situation or person. It's an action comic for ten-year-olds, translated to prose."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help someone.This book revolves around Reacher being forced to help out the FBI to solve a pattern of gruesome murders. The serial killer seems to be 2 steps ahead of Reacher and the FBI, a very well planned out antagonist.I loved the way the story unravels; the evidence comes together without spoiling the ending and with plausibility. The only issue that I had was that the ending seemed a little rushed. The question throughout the book was how is the killer doing it, and at the very end the reader is told how in a very unsatisfying way. The how was very implausible and kind of a copout; seemed a little rushed.Worth reading, especially if you are a Jack Reacher fan, but not the book I would recommend for newcomers to the series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I love the Jack Reacher stories. I've read six or eight so far, and I'll keep reading them, but this one just didn't do it for me. As some others have said, it stated unravelling at about the halfway mark. I stopped believing in the characters or even caring what happened to them. Child's writing is always good, but the structure, characterizations and some of the action scenes just failed to come together, and stretched believability. I'm probably wrong, but it felt as though Child made some assumptions about his readers' going anywhere he lead them, believing anything just because his fans are loyal and he's built such strong stories before...resting on his laurels, I guess is a way of saying it. He didn't seem to try that hard in the last half."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"...meaning that in \\"Running Blind\\", Lee Child's stoic vigilante, Jack Reacher, slides a notch below Genghis Khan on the scale of body-count and mayhem. In \\"Running Blind\\", Reacher actually strings together more than two consecutive sentences, expresses conflicting emotions, and considers - ever briefly - \\"settling down\\". Yikes! Next we'll hear than Howard Dean is voting for \\"W\\". This is Child's fourth Reacher installment and, while definitely not his best, is still another fine example of Child's lean, unadorned prose, sticking close to the plot and keeping the reader in suspense. In a plot somewhat less believable than most we've come to expect from Child, Reacher is drawn into a series of bizarre murders of women all that've had a connection to Reacher. Most engaging is the manner in which these women died - no one can find a cause. The mystery involving the murders keeps the reader guessing to the end that, if a bit far-fetched, is certainly clever. If you're a Lee Child fan, you'll want to read \\"Running Blind\\". But if you've not yet been exposed to this fine writer of popular mystery/thrillers, I'd recommend becoming a fan first: start with \\"Tripwire\\", Killing Floor\\", or, my favorite, \\"Persuader\\"."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am a late discoverer of the Reacher series and gradually going through all of the books.

Lee Child is a great wordsmith; does everything right to build setting, characters, and develop the story without ever wasting any events or even details of setting. It all comes together from beginning to end. HOWEVER, I really don't enjoy reading his sexual events. Yes, he always gets the girl, but, please, just leave an illusion there. I'm not interested in the sweaty details."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I don't know much about the military or the FBI, but whoever is teaching Lee Child psychology needs to be reprimanded. I'm not a total expert in that, either, just a BA, but anybody who's had a year or two of psych knows that that is NOT how hypnosis works. I'm afraid that completely ruined this book for me. I read it through, but since I already knew who the bad guy was (in what was surely the most telegraphed foreshadowing I've ever seen), and I knew the manner of killing was completely unrealistic, it was hard for me to get into it. Thrillers are cool because they *could* be true -- there was just no way this premise could be true, that's all.I don't ask much out of thrillers. Consistency and coherence and some modicum of real-world fact -- that's all I want."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"with the reviewer who wrote \\"Did I miss something.

What world does the author live in, in the real world one call to the agent he saved would have heads rolling...\\"Reading \\"Die Trying\\" (the book referenced above) ruined this book for me. (Not to mention the far-fetched way the killer kills his victims.)"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"As usual Jack Reacher stumbles into a situation that has nothing to do with him, but he is a modern day night in shining armour and he decides to track down the culprits. A series of vitims fall foul of an unknown murderer. The killer's victims have only one thing in common--all of them brought sexual harassment charges against their military superiors and all resigned from the army after winning their cases. The manner, if not the cause, of their deaths is gruesomely the same: they died in their own bathtubs, covered in gallons of camouflage paint, but they didn't drown and they weren't shot, strangled, poisoned, or attacked. Even the FBI forensic specialists can't figure out why they seem to have gone willingly to their mysterious deaths. Reacher isn't sure whether the killings are an elaborate cover-up for corruption involving stolen military hardware or the work of a maniac who's smart enough to leave absolutely no clues behind. This compelling, iconic antihero dead-ends in a lot of alleys before he finally figures it out, but every one is worth exploring and the suspense doesn't let up for a second. The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader, and as Reacher strides off into the sunset, you'll wonder what's in store for him in his next adventure. Another great book in the series"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"... with R. H. Oakley's review, which said in part, \\"Enough clues are given that most readers will realize who the killer is and how the killer pulls it off half way through the book. And the means used to pull it off would not be believed in a comic book. The sheer impossibility was so great that once I realized what the answer was, I skipped to the end of the book to confirm my belief, and then gave up on it.\\"I'm halfway through now, and having figured out the ridiculous ending, I simply have no further interest in this book. I give it two stars because the first third held my interest and promised an interesting denouement. But once you realize who is guilty and why - and above all, how it's being done - you will probably decide, as I did, that the book just isn't worth finishing.Incidentally, does this author do any research, about anything, ever? He does not know the first thing about police procedure, criminal profiling, the FBI, or the military. Sheesh!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book falls far short of other books, such as Tripwire, which i could not put down.

He has the talent for making me do that.But the book was annoying because it lacked any semblance of credibility. I'm not a huge FBI fan, but the way Child has it violate Reacher's rights is beyond anything it would (or could) do. And give us a break: let the guy take a shower and a nap and change his clothes while traveling without sleep from East Coast to West and back again about four times in a week.Finally, the book also contains the kind of minor mistakes that add up to strained credibility. You do not take the Palisades Parkway to the Garden state. They run parallel. And Fort Dix is not a Marine base. It's Army, unless it's changed since I served there in the '60s. There are a few others, too."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have had one of these for several years and find it one of my most used gadgets in my kitchen.

I was given a bunch of Lee Child books and have been reading them in no particular order. I assumed this was the first in the series because of so many character discrepancies ... what a disappointment to discover it wasn't. For example, Reacher checks his watch (even though in other books he never wears one because he has an odd always-knows-the-time ability), he lives in a house and has a girlfriend (even though he's all about nothing to tie him down), and he's under surveillance for a week and doesn't know it (that's not the Reacher I know and love!).

I did stop and read The Enemy as that takes place before The Killing floor. I am enjoying these books more in audio book format than reading. I will agree with most of the positive reviews of this books so I am going to focus more on what bothered me. First of all his relationship with Jodi. It's hard to tell if it is \\"fall\\" right after he is shot in June in Tripwire or if a whole year has gone by. But Jodi didn't seem to mind Reacher's living by his own rules in Tripwire. In fact, she seemed to be impressed by the way he handled the thugs who were ripping off deceased soldier's parents. She didn't complain when he kept the car either. And when he saved her life and took the bullet for her she didn't seem to mind that. But all of the sudden she changes. Everything that represents who Reacher is now bothers her. Yet she loves him. That doesn't make sense to me. But suddenly what bothers her is his living by his own set of rules. But in Tripwire that didn't bother her at all. Secondly, the fact that Jodi got so upset with Reacher when he stopped calling her, yet she left for London merely hours after he left NY for Quantico. At no point does she tell him she might be going to London. So a trip to London comes up in a matter of hours, she leaves and she is bothered that he stopped calling her? Thirdly, the relationship with the FBI. It is not too long ago when he is working with the head of the FBI to save the Cheif of Staff's daughter and then we are to accept they now suspect him of being a murderer and they threaten him and Jodi? That really makes no sense at all. I think, honestly that is the biggest flaw in the book. I don't like the direction Child's took Reacher and Jodi's relationship. I understand Reacher's struggles but Child's treated this as Jodi's issue not Reacher's issue. And suddenly the love of her life is not that important to her. I am only on book four and have many more to go. I get that he is going to get involved with other women but if Child's is going to make this relationship in Tripwire remotely realistic he will bring Jodi back in future books. Hopefully in Reacher's self discovery and reflection Child's will reach out and bring back Reacher's memories of Jodi rather than just passing her off like another fling that lasted two books rather than one. I also hope in future books Child's (or his editor) pays attention to what he wrote in previous books. When you read them in sucession you pick up on the inconsistencies more and these inconsistencies can completely ruin the story."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Although I enjoyed the book, the killer's method revealed at the end was implausible to me. All through the book, Lee Childs gave clues and passages indicating that the victims were somewhat willing participants. I was expecting some mass suicide pact or that the killer might have some hostage or threat that would make the victims follow instructions. (I can't get around it. SPOILER WARNING!). I cannot believe anyone would ever commit suicide (with full knowledge that they would die) under hypnosis.Also, the military reverend was a cheap trick to make the reader doubt the obvious conclusion about the identity of the killer. The character played no other role in the book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Among the best of its genre...if you're looking for a page-turner, can't-put-it-down action book, this is for you.

I am at #4, Running Blind, and love them, BUT, being an Army Brat and having lived with my parents when dad was stationed at Ft. Dix New Jersey in the 60's, I did find it odd that Mr. Child referred to the sprawling Army base as a Marine Base? Silly of me to be so distracted I guess, but it stopped the story for me and I am having trouble finishing the book, but I will. I am a huge fan, though certainly disappointed to hear the rumor that TOM CRUISE will be playing Jack Reacher? I Hope that's a joke. I am a fan, and will get through this and on to book #5.

It is an exciting and intriguing twist on the serial killer genre, though I think the book went on a little too long. Perhaps that's because I figured out who the killer was fairly early in the book, and because there was no real investigating going on until late in the book.I do agree with the readers who find Child's portrayal of the FBI less than credible. I'm perfectly willing to accept that there are some corrupt agents, but could the entire agency really be this stupid? Nothing they do makes any sense. If they really thought ... was the killer, they wouldn't hire him as a consultant. If they want him as a consultant, why don't they listen to anything he says? Why not just ask him to help (for a modest stipend?) why threaten his girlfriend?"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Up until &quot;Running Blind&quot; I thought that Lee Childs' books were the best thing to happen in the genre since the death of Alistair Maclean. I read this one in a single day and was intrigued until the last 4 chapters. I kept hoping that Childs' untracable &quot;murder weapon&quot; would turn out to be something original and clever. Instead it is based on an old myth that holds no truth, no I will not give it away, but expect to be disappointed. I wish that Childs' had done a little more research since his whole premise is based on something that research has showed to be impossible. The writing and the characters are so clever and interesting that to be honest I feel cheated.

But really - the F.B.I. threatening and blackmailing Reacher? the F.B.I. shredding the Constitution in order to compel one retired MP into helping them? No. Never. Not in a thousand years.

And while riding in New Jersey, he sees Pennsylvania on his right.

And _Running Blind_ is the best one yet, which is saying something. Former military cop Jack Reacher is in New York City, reconsidering the impact his inherited house and relationship has on his beloved \\"vagabond\\" lifestyle. He happens upon a small-time protection racket and quickly, violently deals with the situation. Within hours, he is pulled off the streets by a SWAT team of feds.It turns out he was already under surveillance; he's one of the prime suspects in a serial murder case. Several retired female soldiers have been killed in their homes under circumstances that are truly bizarre. Since he had served with two of the women, he's one of the key suspects that the FBI profilers have identified.Proving his innocence, inciting a mob war, and tracking down the real killer are all on the agenda. Reacher is tough, sarcastic, and a completely entertaining character. And don't worry about reading the Reacher series in order - I didn't, and did not miss a beat. Each story seems to stand alone just fine."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"that Lee Child writes about his pseudo-hero, Jack Reacher, are less than satisfying.To be sure, I read both at almost a single setting, because Child has an uncanny way of absorbing your interest while reading the book. It is after you've finished, and think about your reactions, that you'll wish Running Blind was as good an outing as the first 3 Reacher novels.There's a killer loose in this novel, and the victims are three women, all of whom have a tie in the past to Jack Reacher, while in the military. Naturally, with crime scenes that are incredibly far-fetched, the FBI is sniffing around for a serial killer...and Jack is a prime suspect. Once he is off the hook, the FBI decides to use him to help find the killer. It's a plausible theme, with an interesting M.O., but Child loses his way in the story.To begin... Jack needs to be on the road, not settled down with Jodie; Child does find a creative way to take care of that. But, despite the excitement of the tale, the story is unsatisfying, much of the characterization missing or lacking, and there are the usual editing errors you find in each Child work.I'm hanging in there with the series, because Reacher is one of the more interesting (if over the top) leading characters developed in serial thrillers in the last few years, but Running Blind could have, should have, been a much better story."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child is my favorite author(hence my last name &quot;Reacher&quot;), and I am sure you can read all the other reviews to see what this is about. I think the only reason I dont give this book a 1 is because Lee Child wrote it. There isn't the action represented in the first three books. Reacher takes the long way of finding out who the bad guy is when it is staring him in the face. My favorite kind of book has me guessing who the killer is throughout the whole thing. The author should make me change my mind a million times, until i finally settle on one person, who turns out to be wrong(As Child does in his previous three books). I had the bad guy pinned within the first 150 pages, and nothing after that gave me any reason to doubt my hypothesis.

The characters came to life and made life seem that it could be worth living."},{"Title":"Five Terraces","review":"Art is at work throughout Ann Fisher-Wirth's second full-length book. The collection is brilliantly framed by the two halves of \\"Walking Wu Wei's Scroll,\\" a long poem about a work of art dating back to the Ming Dynasty. Fisher-Wirth steps into the scroll and leads us on an imaginative journey across its terrain. Thus we move into the twin worlds of Art and the Past. The second of seven sections contains \\"The Trinket Poems,\\" fearless and fascinating poems about a little-known Tennessee Williams' play, \\"The Mutilated,\\" in which Fisher-Wirth played the role of Trinket. In the poems, she mixes her character's life with her own as daughter, wife, mother, teacher, actor. By putting the spotlight on the various roles she plays, both on- and offstage, she sketches in the intersection between art and life and suggests that we are destined to replay the past again and again. This latter theme is further developed in poems about a father's death, a mother's death, and even a dying cat. A number of poems take a close look at marriage. In these, the speaker enjoys the security and comfort that come to the long married but regrets and longs for the lost passion and exhilaration of earlier days. Among the most poignant of these poems about loss are those about the speaker's first child, a daughter, who died at birth. Even years later and with other children, the speaker grieves for that child, a grief her other children inherit. In \\"Moth\\" the speaker recalls reading at night to her children:. . . and their sweetbodies and hair grew sticky with summer as theysprawled all over me, there was a mothat the window, a soft moon-splotched moth battering at the windowand that moth could never get inno matter how they openedand opened-Fisher-Wirth's grip on craft is flawless and evident in many ways, most interestingly in the artistic arrangement of her poems on the page. She gives us poems that butt up to the left margin, prose poems that take up the whole page, and poems that dance across the page. And she gives us a number of multi-part poems that in their divisions suggest a speaker seeking to know how the pieces of her life fit together to form a coherent whole. We cannot help but admire Fisher-Wirth's attempt to make something beautiful out of her life and ours, an attempt that beautifully succeeds."},{"Title":"Five Terraces","review":"Fisher-Wirth gives us beautifully crafted confessional poetry.

Digby Baltzell's first book has lost none of its relevance fifty-three years after it was published. This should be a must read for anyone interested in Philadelphia politics, power structures, the American class system, and sociology. Baltzell discusses in-depth the character of an upper class member from colonial times to the eve of World War II. He focuses his study on his hometown, Philadelphia. Once the American capital, the largest city in North America, and the financial capital of the United States, Philadelphia has lost most of its power. However, the traditions and institutions put in place during the colonial period are still held onto by the \\"old guard,\\" who frequent the Philadelphia and Rittenhouse Clubs, live on the Main Line, and worship at the fashionable Protestant churches. Instead of the \\"melting pot\\" ideology that so many second and third generation immigrants were raised believing, Baltzell clearly shows that the American power system from the 18th to the mid 20th century was held firmly by the white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant elite. Baltzell, who was listed in Philadelphia's Social Register and came from a wealthy family, believes that an upper class is necessary in American society. According to Philadelphia Gentlemen, the true goal of an upper class is to provide leadership and assume positions of power to guide the rest of the country. When an upper class way of life becomes an end in itself and stops absorbing the great men and women of different religious and racial backgrounds then the upper class has become a caste.Much has changed in American society since the book was published. We have our first African-American President, the Governor of Pennsylvania is Jewish, and there are three women and (for the first time in American history) no Protestants serving on the Supreme Court. Has the Old Establishment finally become extinct? One would think so. But Philadelphia has always been the land of the American gentry and a power structure instituted and supported since America's birth won't vanish over night. They may have lost their power but the Philadelphia Gentlemen lifestyle of horse racing, lunches of chicken salad and fried oysters, and games of sniff still continue on the Main Line estates and along the Brandywine River in Chadds Ford and Chateau Country. Meanwhile, the new elite has assumed the position of leadership once held by the WASPs and steer the country towards the future.Baltzell said in his afterword that a copy of Philadelphia Gentlemen was given to politicians and businessmen who came to Philadelphia from other cities in the nation so they could learn its social history and be better informed to make decisions based on the elite culture. Those interested in Philadelphia's social and political history would do well to pick up a copy too."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Star Wars, the world within our own, has been an escape and a fantasy for people around the world for 25 years. With the new prequels, a new breed of genius has taken the visual cues from Episode 1 and have developed an evolving world that leads into the dismal grey world of the original trilogy. Lead Art Director Doug Chiang, Ian McCaig, Jay Shuster, Ed Natividad, Ryan Church, Eric Tiemens and others bring together visual assault and appropriate culture cues to develop a wide array of designs and illustrations for Episode 2. If you are an artist, or are interested in the production level of film artistry, then this is a must have book. From the magnificent simplicity of the vehicle designs, to the flowing, organic genius of the character designs, this culmination of artwork is a glimpse into the world we continue to love and grow with."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"The book and art are beautiful! There is, however, one problem. The script printed in the book differs from the one put on the screen. Several entire scenes are cut for the actual film, and more than just a few lines of dialogue are striken in the film--and, in just about every case, very judiciously so! The scipt that was put out for Episode I also differed from the actual film. I don't remember this problem with the original trilogy. I wonder what the problem is. Maybe Lucasfilm should delay issuing the scripts/art until after they know what their finished product actually is. But I digress; I'm really into having an accurate version of the script of each film. The book is fabulous otherwise!"},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"One of the saddest things about seeing the Star Wars prequels taking such a drubbing from critics and fans is knowing how hard the artists and designers work to make these movies go from concept to the finished film. I admit it; I am one of those rare fans who apparently enjoyed Episodes I and II, and I owned this book several weeks before Attack of the Clones was released in May 2002.The book is beautifully designed and Mark Cotta Vaz's accompanying text to the conceptual art is authoritative yet accesible even to younger readers. The many designs -- even those not used in the movie -- evoke memories of the earlier trilogy's Art of...series, and one can see the \\"evolution\\" of the many ship and costume designs to what fans call Classic Star Wars. (To me, the most interesting \\"fact\\" is that Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter's lines will be echoed in the evil Empire's Imperial Star Destroyer.)The screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales (who also wrote the story for The Scorpion King) is included. It is the complete \\"before edits were made to the film\\" draft, which allows readers to catch glimpses of Padme Amidala's family and other scenes that were filmed but later deleted. (Those scenes are included on the extra features disc of the Episode II DVD set, but some fans may only have the VHS version instead.)For Star Wars fans and film art aficionados, this book is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"It misses him so much, I knocked it down three stars. Chiang did such a good job on the Episode I art, and in this one he appeared sloppy and rushed. I love the art of the star wars universe. And the best works are those \\"90% there, it's almost what the movie will look like\\" paintings by Ralph McQuarrie. And this collection had not one painting like that.I think the other reason I was underimpressed with this art was that the Original trilogy art really projected a pure creative pulling stuff out of thin air type art. THis art is less inspired and more forced. Almost a rationale \\"fill in the gaps\\" of how things would look between episode 1 and 4.However, the one bright part of the book is the conceptual art regarding what the Sith Lord of Episode II would look like. I am so sorry they didn't go with any of the concepts (with the exception of the curved lightsaber). These were AWESOME designs,That and the script gain back a star. 5 - 3 + 1= 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I LOVE THE BEHIND THE SCENES STUFF, LIKE PRODUTION ART AND CONCEPT ART. SOMETIME THE COSTUME DESIGN CAN BE GREAT TO LOOK AT. THE SHIP DESIGNS ARE ALWAYS GREAT TO LOOK AT.

I found it particularly interesting to see the development of the costumes. Recommended for anyone wanting to enhance their understanding of the artist's role in the making of films, or for those interested in developing their own artistic skills."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"lots of sketches on environment, and outfits for the queen, its really cool art book to collect"},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Sometimes is easy to forget the amout of design works that takes to make a star wars movie, with lots of designers hired trying to get the ship, landscape or character design that fits into the visuals and story of the movie.This book gathers lots of artwork, focused on the Star Wars Attack of the Clones movie and will satisfy both old and new star wars fans for sure."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"The first time I really started Really liking Star Wars was with The Phantom Menace. Personally, I don't go in for the dissecting crtisicm kind of thing. So Yea, there may be a some flaws, but to me there was more right than wrongs.So about this book; I am crazily into art, and my copy of this oneis starting to look worn out. It is an amazing collection of conceptual art (drawings, paintings, digital designs, ect.) arranged chronologicaly paralleling the script. I believe that whenI started studying the works of Iian McCaig, Dermot Power, and others; my ideas and artwork really took off, and seeing the quality and height of what I wanted to reach laid out inspired megreatly. Well, in all, this book is brilliantly executed and would be awesome to look at for any Star Wars fan or art fanactic."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Ok, I'm right now too short on words, but I have to say something... the Art of Attack of the Clones book is the best one in the series... probably the best designed one and the most comprehensive, containing images and descriptions, AND in the other section the full movie script. This hasn't been done before, adding several points to the book. The other books in the series only had or the descriptions or the script.Great, diverse artwork. I just hope that Art from Revenge would be as nice as this one."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"From paper to &quot;digital film&quot;, this book shows the reader how early concepts develop into what we see on screen. Amazing drawings by Doug Chiang and his desgin team leave you breathless. From the deep levels of Coruscant to the beatufil Naboo plains; from the Jedi outfits to the Superbattledroids, you'll learn how all characters and locales came to be in the new movie of the SW Saga, showing the progress in art and effects. Detailed explanations of each drawing add to the experience. A must for Star wars fans and art aficionadoes."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"It's always interesting to look at the conceptual design for Star Wars films, and this book offers plenty of sketches and designs and character studies-as well as full production notes and tons more info. Like Phantom Menace, The Art of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones has so many original concepts and fascinating notes on design, it's wealth of informative stuff makes you think about the effort that goes into making these films. Essential."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I debated on whether to buy the hardcover or wait until the paperback came out. I was more interested in the clothes designs than anything else. I'm glad I didn't wait! I loved all of it. The art work alone is worth the money for the book. I loved how they talked about the development of the designs from the sets to characters. This is a book worth buying and the hardcover will last a lot longer than the paperback book."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Having a previous background in computer graphics (CG), I really enjoyed the level of artwork that will be shown in this movie. The artists at ILM and Lucasfilm are some of the best in the world, and the work shown in this book verifies that statement.I've only gone through the first 20 or so pages, and the artwork is so reminiscent of the SW work done by Ralph McQuarrie, who created the original storyboards for the original SW trilogy. If the artwork is as good as the movie (and storyline) for EP:II, then this will be one of the biggest movies ever."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"'The Art of Star Wars' uses some of the best representations of the world that has become the Star Wars Universe: images. The 224 pages are packed with fantastic scenes with everything from ocean cities architecture to Padme's dresses. My interests in engineering and structural design were captivated by the detailed sketches as well as emotionally rich painted scenes. A great find for any Star Wars enthusiast who fancies an expanded look into the styles and genius behind the Universe."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I was hyped up for Episode 1 only to be let down by one 3-worded mistake: Jar Jar Binks. Of course, if you've read my review for The Art of Episode 1, the you know that I still thought well of that book, despite certain Gungan monstrosities. The Art of Episode 2 proves that the Stars Wars films are like leftovers from dinner, they just taste better and better. Aside from showing the reader sketches of returning locations (Such as Tatootine, Naboo, and Coruscant), it also expands on these locations by showing us things like Coruscant's lower levels, and new areas of Naboo. Added to this is artwork for two new planets in the Star Wars universe: the dry and desolate Geonosis and the watery and storm-shrouded Kamino. Also there are sketches of a certain army cloned from a certain bounty hunter whose son captured a certain Han Solo. If you're a Star Wars addict then get this book as soon as humanly possible because the only Art of Star Wars book better than this will probably be The Art of Episode 3."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I been wanting this book since it came out and yesterday my mom bought it for me. It is a great book with tons of ilstrations and paintings, if you liked the art of the lion king or the pearl harbor book last year you will like this. The only thing I don't like is I think they should have given us more art instead of the screenplay word for word, I already have the novel and find this kind of pointless unless you plan on putting on play of the movie, like you really could for something like this. Still I highly suggest this book ..."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"After having seen a lot of the work for the film and seeing what has made it into this title, I think that a lot of Star Wars, Effects Art Direction and Design fans and students should think they've been let down. It's hard to believe that the group put together to continue the work of Phantom Menace has produced work that's all over the place in terms of quality and effect. Some pieces are staggering; solid designs beautifully drawn and painted with great direction. Others are as simple and cheesy and poorly done as the schlock era of SF illustration and comics. And I'm sorry, but 'poorly derivative' comes to mind a lot... too much. Granted, it's tough to say what stage all of the work here represents in the design process, but if anyone were to tell me all of the sketches and drawings were considered complete before they were put up for review, I'd laugh. The talent of the group in the Art Dept at the Ranch and in support of the film is undeniable, but to see this as the cumulative, public face of their output is sad. Decent book if you want to study what to avoid as well as where to aim. The inclusion of the script isn't necessary, and perhaps would have been better as an Illustrated/Storyboarded screenplay in its own title."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"great book for previz artists and star wars freaks like me.includes script with deleted scenes"},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"As excited as I was about getting this book, I ended up being a bit disappointed in it. I'd recently purchased the &quot;Art of Episode I&quot;, and, based on the reviews posted here, I was expecting more of the same. Unfortunately, that didn't quite happen. Most of the artwork in this Episode II book is final production art, showing only the *last* piece of concept art, as it was approved by George Lucas. I've seen the film, I didn't need to see drawings of those same characters. Rather, I wanted to see the *concept* art, leading up to the final designs. Does Cotta Vaz expect me to believe they drew only ONE picture of Dexter Jettster, and George approved it? The Episode I book had an entire chapter devoted to the development of the Gungans, but here we get only a page or two per character/location/ship. There are only a few instances in the book where we actually see concept art that differs from what was shown in the film.Comparing the two, there's a lot more writing in this one, interviews with the artists, etc. This takes up quite a bit of space that could better be used for more artwork.As for the artwork itself, I was quite impressed. The drawings maintain the same high level of professionalism and detail I came to expect. I wasn't too impressed with the digital paintings, I would have preferred more concept work.The script in the back of the book certainly takes up space. I've seen the film, and I have the novelization, I don't need the script, especially in a book that's not about the script. In answer to the observation below about how this script is different from the film, well of course it is. The shooting script NEVER matches what's on-screen, it just doesn't happen. In regards to the Original Trilogy scripts, those are reverse-written based on the films themselves, that's why they match perfectly. From Lucas' own mouth, he's said that some of the lines in ROTJ were improvised right on-set, so how could they be in the shooting script?Anyway, to close about this book, I guess I was spoiled by the Episode I book. I expected more of the same, which is exactly what I wanted. Folks' reviews here indicated I would get even more, but I found I got a lot less. It seems another example of the publisher assuming that they know what the audience wants to see."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"This book should be absolutely a must for art students, directors (especially art directors), illustrators, designers, fantasy and science fiction readers, writers (current and future) and visualists of all genres and mediums.While the movie looks pretty good these ideas in sketches and designs and character studies-as well as full production scenes-are more inspired and potentially more appealing than the film ('potentially' because most artists and art students will get this more than most people who just watch the movies).Some of the technical work while well designed is a bit flat. Even that is a small nitpick. This book is a well researched view into the behind the scenes ideas that make the visual essence of the film. I don't think a person even needs to like the Star Wars stories to enjoy this book on a visual level.This hardback edition is a beautiful addition to unique coffee table books. It's a blast to browse through all these artists' heads as the ideas of forms, lines and color spill out onto the paper, boards, canvas and digital screens.The compositions contained within these pages are wonderfully inspired, strange and mythic."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I just picked up &quot;The Art of Episode 2&quot; a couple of days ago and I have to tell you I am once again excited about the SW saga. Like a lot of people who grew up with the original trilogy, I found &quot;Episode I&quot; disappointing not only thematically but aesthetically as well. I know it was a prequel, but shiny canary-yellow starfighters and floppy, clumsy Gungans seemed like a betrayal of the design motif that helped make &quot;Star Wars&quot; compelling. Now, without commenting on the plot, it is obvious that &quot;Episode II&quot; will see the start of the SW universe's evolution into the battered, gritty, &quot;lived-in&quot; worlds that are fantastic yet somehow relatable. Here are the evolution of a host of new characters, creatures, and vehicles, as well as two entirely new worlds (three if you count Coruscant, too briefly seen in &quot;Episode I.&quot;)If this visual feast is any indication, &quot;Episode II&quot; will be an exhilarating return to the galaxy Star Wars fans fell in love with in the first place."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"I really loved the Art of Episode I when it was released in late 1999, and didn't think it could get any better than that, but well, it has. The Art of Episode II is a masterpiece, by far the best movie production art book I've ever seen.It was nice to see so much work included by the new artists at the Attic at Skywalker Ranch: there is some classy work in this book. This is definitely not only for Star Wars fans: anyone who loves art should have this book, for that is what is on display in it's 224 pages: art of the highest caliber.There are a startling amount of digital production paintings in the book, paintings that are every bit as artistic and moody as more traditionally rendered art. These intense, moody paintings are offset by slick sketches of vehicles, creatures, anything you can imagine.If the movie itself is half as good as this book suggests it may be, it will be a winner."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Nice art.Small text and caption numbers.Read in bright light.Nice tie-in of illustrations to screenplay that may be missed by some.

These boks give an interesting insight to the huge effort that goes into Star Wars films, with many visualisations that never made it to the screen, and poster art by Star Wars veteran Drew Struzan. The best part is, you get the entire screenplay, including all the deleted scenes and dialouge. The provided info on the entire evolution of production artwork, to models to visual design and then to film is endlessly fascinating, with a wealth of amazing sketches and design artwork."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones","review":"Length:: 0:22 MinsThis art book is noticeably better that the already good The Art of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.This time round, even more details are added to the concept art. Most of the sketches are now coloured. As usual, the pages are filled to the brim with character designs, environment paintings, storyboards, sculptures and ships. All drawings are captioned by the individual artists on the idea they are trying to bring across.In some ways, the character designs and sketches look better on book than in the movie. The environment paintings are just epic.Included also, at the back of the book, is the full script for the movie.This book is highly recommended to sci-fi artists, concept artists and of course Star Wars fans.(More pictures are available on my blog.

That said, it's valuable for much, much more. Mark Cotta Vaz has compiled a diverse sampling of the hundreds and hundreds of drawings/paintings/sculptures created for designing the latest entry of the Star Wars saga. All five planets from the film - Coruscant, Kamino, Naboo, Tatooine, and Geonosis - are featured prominently from character designs, to location designs, to costume designs to lighting designs. A notable addition since Episode I is Dermot Power, noted for his work on Judge Dredd and Batman, whose comic book style contributions will make this book valuable to comic fans as well.In addition to the script and the varied high-res artwork, Cotta Vaz fills the remaining space with blurbs detailing the production from start to finish.

In my desire to make a full transition to vegan right away, I bought several cookbooks, looking for ways to introduce my husband & I to a diet so foreign to us. But, I was frustrated with so many of the vegan cookbooks out there. I'm a pretty good cook (even if I can't make original recipes, I can definitely follow them!) Yet I found many of the other cookbooks difficult to use - the recipes were difficult and/or time-consuming (not easy for my busy life) or the required ingredients couldn't be easily found.But, with Robin Robertson's Vegan Planet, I found my salvation! This cookbook is chockful of excellent recipes, easy-to-find ingredients & clear instructions.Now, thanks to this cookbook, I find vegan eating as easy as it was when I was a meat-eater.

I was interested in virtually every recipe in this book. I've been a vegetarian most of my life, but have only recently gone vegan. My husband and children, however, are neither - so it is very important to be able to prepare meals that they will all enjoy and not miss meat or dairy. I do own a handful of vegan cookbooks, but this is by far my favorite. It's a beast of a book, with over 500 pages. There are not images of the various recipes, but that does not bother me in the least. Normally I do prefer to see what it will look like, but I don't need to with this book. She does an excellent job of describing the meal. I love how she has included inspiring quotes here and there throughout the book. And I love all the chapters. My family's favorite recipes so far include black bean and sweet potato enchiladas, portobello mushrooms stuffed with chipotle mashed potatoes, and the broccoli rabe and white bean pizza.

Through reading and cooking the recipes in this book I learned what vegetables to put together, how to flavor foods better and adding more variety to foods. 8 years later this book is still on my self and I use it for favorite recipes and, now, inspiration for healthy, balanced baby food."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"The recipes are very easy and tasty. Many are spicy hot with some hard to find ingredients. Many recipes use the same ingredients and they start to all taste the same after awhile. The soups and salads are good."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I came back to see what other people thought about this book and since everyone seems to love it, I would have to recommend it for those who are already vegetarian or vegan minded. I still find it preachy in places as I stated below but with all the good reviews, it seems to be right on target for vegans. My original review is:I bought this book because I have a vegan friend and wanted to be able to cook things that she could eat and enjoy. There are plenty of recipes and plenty of good information on alternative proteins. HOWEVER, some of the reasons the book lists to become a vegan are a bit preachy and misleading. The author has definitely stated the truths that are convenient to promote veganism and not completed some of the phrases. For example, the book states that beef contains growth hormones. Period. While that is definitely a concern, beef without hormones does exist, you just need to search for it sometimes. That said, the rest of the information is good, especially if you are a meat loving person like myself but want to be able to make sure you treat your vegan friends with the respect and hospitality they deserve."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"My husband is a vegan who got this book as a gift. If you do not enjoy foods with strong spices, or different ethnic foods, this is not a book for you. As a non-vegan, I was expecting the vegan foods to try to closely imitate the tastes of their non-vegan equivalents. This is not the case and it left me quite disappointed."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"It is hard for me to understand how a book with the title Vegan Planet totally ignores the planet's predominant vegetarian tradition. The Buddhist vegetarian practice has been going strong for well over two thousand years, with far more practitioners and much greater experience than Western vegetarianism. Rooted in Hindu vegetarianism, Buddhist vegetarianism, also called su vegetarianism, forgoes not only all animal products, but also the fetid vegetables: garlic, onions, leeks, scallions, and so forth. Buddhists know that these rancid vegetables hold back progress in meditation; long before Buddhism arrived, Chinese doctors knew that these are bad for your health.Unfortunately, Robertson has not bothered to look into this rich experience, so many of the menus in this book would not be considered vegetarian in Asia. Needless to say, there are many great recipes to be found here, and you can just remove the offensive foods from most menus, although I don't know what to do with the three onion pie or scallion pancakes.I personally believe that Western vegetarians would do well to see if they can't learn something from the su vegetarian experience. There is more to the planet than the North Atlantic."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have had this book for a couple of years now, and it is the one that I turn to time and again for simple, delicious, guaranteed-to-turn-out-well recipes. It is by far the best vegan cookbook I have ever used (and I've used lots of them!), though it is true that I wish it had nutritional info along with the recipes, to tell one how many calories, how much iron, protein, fat, etc. is in each dish.There is a lot of very helpful general nutritional information in the first chapter, however, that I found useful for vegans and omnivores alike. Robertson discusses everything from protein sources, to B12 requirements, to vegan Omega 3 and 6 sources. She also includes in this chapter (called \\"Vegan Basics\\") names of hard to recognize animal products and tips for \\"stocking the vegan pantry.\\" There are many more sections throughout the book that discuss the names, flavors, uses and nutritional content of a variety of grains, beans, vegetables, etc. which introduced me to wonderful foods I had never tried before, such as quinoa or sea vegetables.\\"Vegan Planet\\" is perfect for staple recipes like chili (among other chili recipes, there's a Black Bean and Butternut Squash Chili that is one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted!), Mashed Potatoes (even these are special, because of the parsnips she has you add; these potatoes have consistently earned me rave reviews), or Vegan Shepherd's Pie (my favorite recipe in the book and a big hit with my super meat-loving in-laws). There are also great breakfast recipes (for e.g. French Toast and Tofu Scrambles), an interesting \\"world cuisine\\" section with recipes for Chinese, Indian, etc. food, and a very complete dessert section. Soups, salads, appetizers, and faux \\"meaty dishes\\" or \\"creamy dishes\\" (e.g. the wonderful Alfredo Style Fettuccine) are also included.The recipes are so easy that the lack of pictures never bothers me. Last Christmas I was cooking dinner for my family with such a bad cold that I literally could not smell or taste anything I was making. Nevertheless, my mashed potatoes and everything else from this book still came out perfectly (or so I was told :)). Everything I have tried to make from this book has come out well, and I'm not an expert cook by any means. \\"Vegan Planet\\" always uses simple and common ingredients that almost anyone will recognize and be able to find at their local grocery, and on the other hand I also think it does a wonderful job of introducing great foods that many Americans don't typically eat (e.g. quinoa).I LOVE this book and give it as a gift all the time, to vegans, vegetarians, and relatives who ask \\"what can I cook if you're coming to dinner?\\" I have also given it to relatives looking to lower their cholesterol (since cholesterol is only found in animal products, and vegan diets have been proven to often dramatically lower people's cholesterol and even reverse heart disease!). My mom, whose high cholesterol prompted me to gift her with this book, has told me several times how much she appreciates having a source of delicious, cholesterol-free recipes at hand, although she is not vegan.My other favorite vegan cookbooks: If you're a real foodie or into gourmet cooking, I would recommend the \\"Millennium Cookbook\\" or \\"The Artful Vegan;\\" if you like funky, fun recipes try How it All Vegan\\" or \\"The Garden of Vegan.\\" If you just want a general overview of veganism, try John Robbins' \\"Diet For A New America.\\""},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am not vegan, but this cookbook is the one I use most often. Every recipe has turned out great -- well seasoned and delicious.I especially appreciate how the book is organized. The chapters are broken down fairly narrowly, so if you know you want to cook with beans, for example, or pasta or rice, you can go right to that chapter. Very well done."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"For a person who lives to cook and owns dozens of cookbooks, \\"Vegan Planet\\" is the one I use most often and the only one I couldn't live without. Every recipe we try, we love! Our family decided to become vegetarians about a year ago, though most of the time we eat vegan, and this cookbook has made the transition simple, delicious, and satisfying. We couldn't be happier with these recipes. I wish I could give this cookbook 10 stars."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan Planet, by Robin Robertson, is a terrific cookbook for anyone who wants to be able to cook some great dishes without a lot of fuss, and it's indispensable for anyone interested in going vegetarian, whether for health or ethical reasons. This book is the answer to the question often raised when someone finds out you're vegetarian (or better yet, vegan!): Then what DO you EAT?!?The recipes are generally simple and typically use very common ingredients. (I have no interest in becoming a chef in any sense of the word!) It's great to be able to pick up the book and find a recipe that uses whatever happens to be in my refrigerator and pantry (no matter how empty they look!) using the index to find recipes with those key ingredients. And the best part is that the result is delicious! Last week I found some sweet potatos in the fridge, so checked the index to see what I might be able to do with them and found the Red Bean and Sweet Potato Curry, which indeed turned out to be excellent, even without the green bell pepper. Now, if I don't have an ingredient a recipe calls for, I add it to the shopping list because with this book, I know I'll be able to put it to good use.As vegans, my wife and I have several vegetarian and vegan cookbooks, but this one quickly became our favorite and has made us more adventurous and expanded our repertoire considerably. The beauty of the recipes we've tried so far is that even our carnivorous friends don't miss meat when they dine with us on the sumptuous meals prepared from the recipes in this book. Since becoming vegans, we've found dining out much more challenging, but this book has come to our rescue with an incredible variety of easy-to-prepare recipes that ease the pain of cooking while adding amazing flair to our mealtimes. This cookbook is a worthy addition to anyone's kitchen bookshelf."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have happily been a vegetarian for 9 years and was interested in becoming vegan but was frightened that there would not be enough entrees to feed my family. I have tried about 20 recipes from this book so far and they are all unbelievable. The balsamic glazed carrots, linguine with sage and white bean sauce, and jasmine rice with cashews are my favorites. Even my pre-school son eats these recipes. This is now my main cookbook."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I got this book out of the library along with many others. This book was the only one that my boyfriend and I used time and time again. We're cheap students, so the library has always been our main option when it comes to books, but for the first time, we realized we would have to purchase one, and it was this book (I'm sure the library missed it for the 8 months or so we had it.) My favorite recipe in it, out of the 100 or so we've made, is the Pan-Seared Seitan with Crimini Mushrooms and Red Wine (pg 347 in the hardcover edition.) It's absolutely incredible."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If your just starting out in the Vegan cooking or have been Vegan for a while, this is the book to have.

The Strawberry-Topped Cheesecake is one of my favorites! This book has it all."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I'm an omnivore. However, my husband is vegan, so all of the meals we make at home are vegan. As a result, I own many vegan/vegetarian cookbooks, and this one is by far my favorite. Virtually every recipe I've tried has been absolutely delicious. My husband practically bribes me to make the Ultimate Shepherd's Pie. Mom's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies are heavenly. The consistency of the dough is unusual (compared to traditional chocolate chip cookies), so I was skeptical the first time I made them. But they turned out great. The seitan recipe is so simple and so tasty. I've made a few of the dishes for my meat-eating family, and my mom has even asked for the recipes! There are many recipes I have yet to try because I now have so many favorites that it's hard not to keep making the same things over and over. I highly recommend this cookbook for vegans as well as non-vegans looking to cut back on their meat and dairy consumption."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If you are a vegan or a vegetarian trying to make the cross-over or a carnivore wanting to eat healthier YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THIS BOOK!!!In addition to all of the excellent, varied, extremely tasty recipes are numerous helpful tips--from how to soak beans, to making non-dairy whipped topping, to an acceptable substitute for grated parmesan cheese.Before purchasing this book, The Meditteranean Vegan was my favorite Vegan book, and while I'd still recommend it, Vegan Planet just has sooooo many, many recipes with varied Ethnic inspirations (Indian, Hispanic, Italian, Middle Eastern, American) you just cannot not go wrong. There is something here for everyone's tastes as well as something here for every meal--breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts, drinks (alcoholic and non).Personally, I love to bake and to share my baked goods w/ family and office mates. In the past, my vegan baked goods left much to be desired PLUS, people hear \\"vegan\\" and are immediately turned off. That's not been the case w/ the desserts I've made from recipes in Vegan Planet. So far, all of my vegan \\"goodies\\" have received rave reviews. My non-vegan co-workers have been quite impressed w/ the taste and generally cannot believe they are enjoying a treat that does not contain butter, eggs, or cow's milk.Get this book. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"My family and I recently became vegan. We've been vegetarian before but never quite took the step into veganism, so I had few recipes and only one suitable cookbook. (The Compassionate Cook, also top rate) I picked this book out of the lineup because it had good reviews, lots of recipes and I was able to get it cheaply... it would have been a good value at twice the price. It covers all the bases for types of meals/foods, and the recipes are wonderful! I can't wait to make dinner every night because it means trying out a new recipe. I have yet to see one flop.I reccomend it to anyone who is venturing into veganism.

I go to my shelf of books, my hand glides up and down... and invariably rests on this great book.The recipes are easy to make, lots of extra hints and tips throughout the book, the results are very worthwhile...

This book is so fantastic that you don't even need that! Why it is so great:* Every recipe I've tried so far is fantastic, and we all know that sometimes vegan dishes can sometimes (I stress sometimes) disappoint. You must try the Fettuccine with Red Lentil Sauce, the Corn Chowder, Chocolatey Peanut Butter Brownies, and the Veggie Pot Pie.* The ingredients aren't anything crazy. You can find what you need in the grocery store.* The book is sprinkled with sidebars that give you great health/diet information. Examples: reasons to go vegan (from a compassionate standpoint), why soy is good for you, why avacado is so fabulous, etc.* The intro gives you a sort of \\"vegan 101\\"--quite literally everything you really need to know from vitamins to why dairy can be eliminated from your diet.I've spent enough time with my borrowed copy and I'm going to purchase this right after I finish this review! It will pretty much become my \\"bible\\" going forward. Honestly, you don't have to call it your \\"vegan\\" cookbook. You can just call it your \\"favorite\\" cookbook."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I own several of Robin Robertson's cookbooks, but this one is my favorite. It is, in fact, my favorite cookbook period. Everything I have ever made from it has turned out well and been eaten happily by children. There is no higher cookbook praise than that. This book is so exhaustive in its repertoire that there is always something for any occasion. I also like (and use) the many sauces and dairy replacements (like the creamy whipped topping and egg-and-butterless hollandaise) even if I'm not making something specific from the book. This cookbook is exhaustive in scope so it is my go-to for just about everything. It even prompted me to write a fan email to the author which I haven't done since, gee, I don't think I've ever written a fan letter to anyone before Robin. If you want a good vegan cookbook then look no further, buy this book."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have tried about 10 recipes so far and each one has been fantastic, esp. the black bean & sweet potato enchiladas and the black bean chili with cilantro pesto.

Even my omnivore sister loves this one. In fact, she's often requesting that I come over, with supplies, and the book to prepare dinner for her and the kids. ^_^ I'm glad that they enjoy it as much as I do. I think it's because the recipes are so unusual, and at times what they consider \\"exotic\\"... My favorites are the stromboli recipe, and the Sweet Potato and Black Bean Enchiladas (which EVERYONE likes apparently)... and omg, the desserts and smoothies will RUIN you.

I have looked through it quite a bit, and I noticed a few things that I liked:-the recipes aren't usually over complicated-the author doesn't include a lot of strange or hard to find ingredients-the layout is clean, simple and easy to read-there are a lot of little tidbits, tips, facts and how-to's scattered throughout the book-the index is easy to useThe main thing I don't like about this book, is the lack of photos of any of the foods. It's definitely not necessary, but for more visual people, it really helps. Even just a section of photos in the middle for inspiration would be good. Overall though, it's a great book!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am so glad I found this book. Robin Robertson proves that you CAN eat an elegant AND tasty vegan meal and still make it an easy meal to put together. This book is full of SO MANY recipes and every single one of them I have tried with HUGE success! I borrowed this cookbook from the library 6 times before I finally bought it - my husband told me just to spend the money and buy it for myself. Being vegan in a meat-eating, cream and cheese and fat-indulging country is not easy, so having this cookbook has been a huge lifesaver! So much useful information and tips are included. Did you know that red food coloring is mostly made from crushed beetles? I didn't until I read this book. How do you stock a vegan pantry? It's all in there. There are many global recipes in the book to help you expand your vegan horizon. Sauces, dressings, pasta, veggies, beans, grains, desserts (yes - VEGAN DESSERTS!!!!!!), grilling, saute'ing, stir frying, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, breads, smoothies, and most importantly - THE BASICS - all included in this book! You can't go wrong. I live in a mixed household, myself being vegan, my husband a pescovegetarian, and my daughter who, unfortunately, enjoys the occassional chicken strip while dining out(most definitely NOT in the home). I have easily satisfied every one of us in the house using this cookbook. None of us ever feel as if we are missing anything at our meals. Our favorites: Maple-Pecan French Toast, Not-So-Dirty Rice, Strawberry-Topped \\"Cheesecake\\", Three-Nut Burgers and the Cajun Spice-Rubbed Tempeh. I could go on. Sorry, this book does not have pictures, but the recipes are all easy and the pictures just aren't so necessary in this book. You'll see for yourself after your first indulgence! There is just so much USEFUL INFORMATION you just can't find in most other vegan cookbooks. You can't go wrong with this cookbook."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am a relatively new vegan. This is the first cookbook I purchased after much research. My first recipe from this book was \\"Tempeh and Eggplant Moussaka.\\" I followed Ms. Robertson's instructions to a T. Two packages of tempeh do NOT simmer in 1/4 C of tomato paste mixed with 1/2 C of dry white wine. Not enough liquid. I doubled her amounts of each and it barely simmered. I continued on with the recipe, dubiously. Her last instruction to \\"bake until hot and bubbly\\" was never going to happen because even with the \\"sauce\\" topping, there wasn't enough liquid. It was a very time-consuming dish that ended up dry and rather tasteless. I am very disappointed and a little angry, frankly, after reading all the glowing reviews here on Amazon. Are you all paid to say these things?****I was so upset, I wrote to the author. She responded IMMEDIATELY with deepest apologies and a promise that she is rechecking the recipe. Proofreading ain't what it used to be, folks! She told me about another typo on p. 37 of this book: ginger amount is ONE tbls, not NINE. This is an author who cares about what she is putting out there. I am leaving my low rating, however, to alert readers that this book has errors and to let publishers know that if they're going to cheap out on the publishing process, they'll suffer sales."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan Planet is a wonderful cookbook.

She presents a vast array of recipes; there are 20 chapters covering all aspects of a meal, including appetizers (\\"Love at First Bite\\"), \\"Soups that Satisfy\\", \\"Salads and Slaws\\", \\"Veggies in the Middle\\", \\"Going with the Grain\\", \\"From the Stew and Chili Pot\\", \\"The Global Oven\\", \\"A Bakers Dozen of Breads\\", and \\"Desert Heaven\\", to name a few of the chapters.The recipes are uncomplicated, using ingredients easy to find in almost any grocery store. Although a few recipes call for using tofu, tempeh, etc., most of the recipes focus on the abundant varieties of vegetables, grains, and beans that are readily available.There are multiple dishes that could stand alone as a complete meal. For the ambitious cook wanting to create a meal of multiple dishes, one can almost randomly select a variety of dishes from several of the chapters to create a meal of dishes that seem to naturally complement one another.In addition to being healthy for ourselves, the animals, and our planet, the recipes also taste great. Each of the recipes I've tried thus far have been wonderful. At this point I've made enough of the dishes that I feel confident that I could make any of the recipes in the book for the first time and serve it to company, knowing that each of the recipes is sure to taste great. The dishes are also very visually appealing due to the color combinations of the various ingredients.This is a great book for either a novice or a long-standing vegan. It's also a terrific book to give others who are exploring a vegan diet as all the recipes are certain to please. Some of the recipes I've tried (and loved!) thus far include: Here's My Heart Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette, Ancient Grains on Wild Greens, Rosemary-Lemon Potatoes with Black Olives and Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Caribbean Rice with Red Beands and Chiles, Alfredo-Style Fettuccine, Mediterranean Bean Ragout, Grilled Portobellos with rosemary Roasted Vegetables, Spiced Apple-Walnut Muffins, and Mom's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies- Only Better."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Well, I suppose you could count the number of recipes in this book, but the exact figure would honestly be beside the point. I have never seen SO MANY enticing vegan choices in one volume. Not only intriguing while reading, these recipes fulfilled my high expectations after cooking/preparing, as well.To start from the beginning, this book was a gift from a friend who visited me about 2-3 months into my being vegan (after being vegetarian 5+ years). While she was here I started having some doubts about my new choice, and had started feeling like I had resigned myself to deprivation foodwise - when we went out to eat I was feeling far more restricted than I ever did while vegetarian. As a thank-you for her stay here, she sent me this book (especially thoughtful considering she is not any kind of veg*n!). I started cooking from it immediately, and have been amazed ever since.Things that I would have been thrilled to try as a lacto-ovo-veg are here, only slightly healthier (and much more cruelty-free) - and NOTHING has disappointed. Everything has been as great as I was hoping it would be, which is rare for any recipe collection for me. A few examples? For my birthday, we recently made the Lasagna Primavera. I was skeptical during the cooking, but oh my gosh, I LOVED the result. It was what I hoped it would be - so delicious, I will make it again (which for me, is saying a lot). I've also been highly impressed with the pizza recipes I've tried (Pizza Bombay - with plenty of spinach and Indian spices, and Broccoli Rabe and White Bean Pizza), the Three-Seed Lemon Tea Bread (which was very much enjoyed by all of my non-veg*n lab mates as well), the Basil-Scented Fennel and Tomato Gratin was amazing, and I am sure there are more I can't recall at the moment. The point is that all of the recipes so far have exceeded my (high) expectations, and at least 99% of what's left in the book looks awesome, and I can't wait to try them (I've now been completely vegan ~6 months, and this book has definitely helped).So whether you are a vegan who could use an overwhelming amount of enticing options (...and who couldn't?), or just anyone who loves to cook (especially whole foods!) and are looking to expand your repertoire, I highly recommend this book. It also has a ton of nutrition and food related info along the way, if you are curious or just starting out in the dairy-and-meat-free-world. Honestly, I am not sure that I would have bought this book for myself, but I could not be more pleased with owning it. I hope this helps anyone who is considering it, but is still on the fence!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I got this book for Christmas and I'm so happy that I did!

I like to bring this book to bed with me, go through it slowly and mark the recipes that I would like to give a go. The recipes seem fairly easy with ingredients you can easily get at your local grocery store. I highly recommend this book for all vegans and vegetarians who yearn for creative and inspiring dishes. I also recommend this book to omnivores who want a change of pace in their diet every now and then and also for those who wonder what exactly vegans eat. Trust me, not just salads!

I also very much appreciate that the recipes are quick and easy to prepare, with not a lot of unnecessary or fancy ingredients. This is a practical cookbook for people who may not have all day to plan and prepare a meal. The variety of recipes is great. I also like the ethnic flare to many recipes. Robertson seems to draw on the best of vegetarian cuisines from other countries. There are many menu options that use soy meat substitutes - I'm not a fan of that, but many people might enjoy her creative uses for soy products. There are plenty of recipes without soy as well. The baked goods I have tried, like muffins, are outstanding, which is often hard to do without eggs, milk, butter etc.. The muffins were the best I've ever had anywhere!

It has hundreds of recipes, and is perfect when you have a particular vegetable or grain and think \\"what the heck should I make with this?\\" There is a little of everything, and most recipes do not involve hours of prep. I give this book 5 stars for those reasons.However, I do think there are other books out there with more interesting recipes. This is a fabulous starter or staple vegan book, but for longer-term vegans, more adventurous cooks, or special occasions, I reccomend adding additional books to your collection (including \\"Voluptuous Vegan\\" and Millenium Restaurant cookbooks)."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"As a vegitarian going on vegan, this book was nothing like I expected. There were so many delicious recipes. This covers beverages, lunch, dinner, breakfast, snacks, and treats. \\"Vegan Planet\\" also gives you some nutritional information along with Robertson's (author) opinion. This was an amazing buy and worth three times the price. If I could change anything about this cook book it would be to have pictures of the prepared meals."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I'm an aspiring vegan, and always on the look out for cook books that give me the cheat sheet to making unique and healthy vegan food. And when I found this book in the shop, my journey to find one comprehensive guide was over. The big book - as i like to call it - has neatly grouped chapters and covers every kind of food you might ever want to eat. Cuisine wise (Italian, Eastern, Middle-Eastern, even sandwiches!!) and meal wise (Brunches, lunches, desserts, dinners). And the best part about this book is there is always something new to try. The index is quite detailed and very useful - when you have ingredients in the fridge you want to use to indulge yourself in a gourmet meal. It inspires you, which is also a plus. I would not necessarily recommend it to a starter cook book, but if you want to be inspired, this is the book!!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"The recipes in this book are delicious, easy to prepare, do not require a pantry full of exotic ingredients, and offer tastes from various ethnic cuisines, as well as, basics like \\"tofu sour cream\\", \\"seitan\\", etc. When I decided to give up (and eventually eliminate) animal products I was totally lost as to how to cook without animal products! As I entered this new world of different products, this book gradually became my \\"Bible\\"; in it I could find tasty dishes to satisfy my meat eating husband and myself. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"My first contact with this book was from the library. Since I own quite a few vegetarian and vegan cookbooks, I prefer to have some first-hand knowledge of a book's usefulness before buying it. I enjoyed the recipes in this book so much, I decided to purchase it. Vegan Planet is now a staple in my cookbook library and I often include one of its delicious recipes in my weekly menu. I highly recommend this book to both vegan and lacto-ovo vegetarians, or anyone interested in vegetarian cuisine."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"When I need to just thumb through a big book and find something new and different to try, this is the book I choose. It has plenty of recipes and it covers a fairly broad spectrum.But nothing here really floats my boat. I think because it is too broad. Very few of the recipes I've tried are exceptional and a lot of the recipes are filler that I know I'll never make and don't know anyone who would.Overall it is a very solid cookbook with more than enough recipes to get you going and help you figure out what your particular vegan niche might be. Sort of like vegan with training wheels."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I've only made a few recipes from this book so far: Bowties with Buttons (i eliminated the kasha as my family is picky, but it still made an interesting side dish!), the Chocolate Chip Cookies--very good and didn't require any esoteric ingredients!, and the Lasagna Primavera, which was admittedly a bit time consuming but well worth it as both my husband and 4 year old enjoyed it. I think i'll be making quite a few recipes out of this book, if only to expose my family to more ethnic flavors and dishes. I gave the book four stars just because i have had to tweak seasonings--the vegan bechamel sauce was a bit bland without some garlic and salt, and the tofu filling for the lasagna called for parsley which is fine but not very flavorful for an Italian dish. I would rather she had exact measurement for salt and pepper instead of &quot;to taste&quot;."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I bought this book skeptically because I wanted to know what eggless and dairyless recipies would be like and if I could conceivably go &quot;vegan&quot; if only for a short time. Well I was pleasantly surprised. This is my favorite cookbook. I've liked almost every single recipie I've tried and that has never happened before. Well, I'm not vegan yet, but almost everything I cook for myself is."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If your vegan, you know that its tough to make or find good food. Every single dish (and there have been plenty of them) that I have made from this cookbook has been 100% delicious. The consistancy is impecable. I have many cookbooks and this one is by far the best. The recipes are easy to follow and the varity of dishes is what keeps me opening it up night after night. I recommend this cookbook to anyone who is interested in having GOOD vegan food.

Most of the recipes I've tried have come through like a charm. However, a couple are flops (the &quot;sour cream&quot; is so not right!).The main thing that I like about this cookbook is that, unlike so many vegan cookbooks, its recipes don't rely on nutritional yeast. So for vegans who don't like the stuff - you won't find it much here!But, it is more complex than a basic 'how to make toast' kind of cookbook. My favorite recipe is, by far, the ginger-spiced cashew scones. mmmm.amy"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I live in a fairly small city, so we only have the basic big brand grocery stores here.

The food is deliscious though, so if you don't spending a little (time and money), you'll probably be quite pleased with the meals."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Wonderful cookbook.

Many of my vegetarian recipes didn't taste good without the dairy products. I happened upon this book at Half Price Books and have been in love with it ever since.

The recipes for the most part use ingredients you can find at any larger supermarket. They are so easy that the lack of pictures don't bother me one bit.

I love it!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"In her newest cookbook Vegan Planet, Robin Robertson creates the culinary equivalent of worldbeat music: an intriguing fusion of elements from diverse culture. Like worldbeat, her recipes interweave the familiar and exotic in surprising, enjoyable harmonies.This global trek takes many colorful excursions into less-charted cookbook territory: &quot;Chutneys, Salsas, and Other Condiments,&quot; &quot;Food that Sizzles,&quot; &quot;Simply Stuffed,&quot; and &quot;New World Pizza.&quot; Robertson also makes numerous side-trips beyond the recipe border, with sections on nutrition, food selection, cooking techniques, serving ideas, menus, and much more.Every recipe I made produced a flavorful result. The &quot;Tuscan-Style Pasta with Chickpeas, Zucchini and Rosemary&quot; was deliciously seasoned. The &quot;Balsamic-Glazed Carrots and Kale&quot; and &quot;Quinoa and Pan-Fried Corn with Orange Zest and Chives&quot; complemented each other as parts of one meal. Combining corn with quinoa is a great idea, as it adds much-needed textural interest; the orange flavoring works beautifully in this. The &quot;Ultimate Shepherd's Pie&quot; was so good, we could hardly stop eating it.I did make the occasional adjustment due to personal preferences. For the &quot;Farmhouse Vegetable Soup,&quot; I felt the vegetables were just-right after simmering for only twenty minutes, rather than the recommended forty. I reduced the tempeh by one-third in the &quot;Curried Chickenless Salad Sandwiches.&quot; The resulting ingredient balance seemed perfect, and still made four generous servings. Finally, the &quot;Curried Lentils with Carrots and Peas&quot; turned out both very tasty, and Indian-restaurant hot; I'll cut back on cayenne next time.I enjoyed all the recipe results so much, that I'm sorry to interject a less-positive note -- but for me, the book was somewhat hard to use. For one thing, the ingredient lists -- in tiny, mustard-color print -- were very hard for me to read, especially while trying to work fast. Moreover, Robertson's basic ingredient palette is quite different from mine. Parsley, celery, olives, chipotles, shallots, alcoholic beverages, shiitake and oyster mushrooms -- all common in these recipes -- are rarely on hand in my kitchen, which meant a number of extra trips to the store. Finally, a lot of the recipes are labor-intensive, with much chopping, parboiling, and making separate sauces; none of them took me less than an hour to prepare.But these are minor quibbles. They may mean that Vegan Planet won't become my first choice for weekday dinners, but I'll certainly turn to it often when I entertain. Here's the bottom line: every recipe I tried was delicious, looked attractive, and worked."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This book makes an excellent gift for someone just starting to explore the vegetarian lifestyle. Surprisingly, it is also an excellent resource for the tried-and-true vegan.For those just familiarizing themselves with the vegan diet, the author explains all potentially new terminology and describes common ingredients used in vegan food preparation: tofu, seitan, and miso for instance. For the most part, his recipes use readily-accessible ingredients, available in most supermarkets. In the rare cases where exotic ingredients are called for, the appendix lists mail-order sources for those who may not live near a natural food store.The book starts with an excellent first chapter on nutrition. The author notes that a vegan diet provides all essential nutrients, though without proper supplementation it can be deficient in vitamin B12. This deficiency is often considered by those reluctant to switch to a vegetarian diet as the &quot;Achilles Heel&quot; of a vegan diet. In fact, having just one easily-remedied deficiency makes the standard non-vegan diet look pretty awful in comparison. While a standard dairy-and-meat-based diet may not be deficient in vitamin B12, it is certainly problematic in its propensity to cause heart disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and a wide range of other serious illnesses. In fact, as the author points out, a comprehensive set of long-term studies on diet and health done at Cornell University indicates that 80 to 90 percent of all cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other forms of degenerative illness are directly linked to the consumption of meat and dairy products. Talk about an Achilles Heel!Interspersed between the recipes in this book are lots of hidden gems including lists of 10 environmental reasons to go vegan, 12 really great health reasons to go vegan, 7 great reasons to eat soy every day, and 9 compelling ethical reasons to go vegan. The author provides useful kitchen tips, such as stove-top cooking times for 15 kinds of grains and for 13 different beans. Nutritional profiles are provided for many foods, including the vitamin, mineral, and fatty acid content of 16 different nuts and seeds and 10 different kinds of sea vegetables.For those interested in switching away from use of white sugar, the author introduces the alternative natural sweetener called stevia. He also provides guidelines for using maple syrup in place of white sugar in baking (indicating how to reduce the liquid in your recipe when you use a liquid sweetener instead of sugar). Furthermore, the author explains how to bake using egg alternatives.Gosh, I haven't even mentioned the recipes themselves yet! The collection of tempting tasties covers the whole spectrum from A (Adzuki beans) to Z (Zucchini). 20 chapters of recipes provide great ideas for tasty chutneys, gnocchi, curries, pizzas, burgers, pancakes, &quot;cheesecake&quot;, and so much more. This is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook I've ever come across.This book is a great addition to any library of cookbooks, helpful to vegetarians and soon-to-be vegetarians alike. (Even meat-eaters won't feel deprived by the very creative recipes in this book.) I can't resist giving Vegan Planet my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I'd been a long-time lacto-vegetarian and recently decided to take the plunge and cut out the dairy as well, and in doing so, decided that I needed to find some new cookbooks to go along with this lifestyle change. Though many of my vegetarian cookbooks offer some vegan recipes as well as some vegan alternatives for non-vegan recipes, I was still finding that I didn't have much to draw from. Not every vegetarian recipe can be easily substituted for, and not all vegan substitutions come out tasting all that great. After hours spent at bookstores sifting through vegan cookbooks and asking myself \\"how many of the recipes from each will I actually, truly try making?\\" I settled upon Vegan Planet, and I'm quite glad that I did.I love that this book is more than mere recipes. For example, the whole first chapter is called \\"Vegan Basics\\" and includes several worthwhile informational tidbits. Robertson includes descriptions of differences between each of the various meat alternatives, such as seitan, TVP, and tempeh, and various ways to buy and cook each. Also included in this first chapter are sections on stocking the vegan pantry with a list of staples every vegan should have in their kitchen, a section on what it means to buy organic, and a section on how to avoid hidden animal products. Robertson also addresses vegan health concerns such as making sure you're getting enough protein, and the infamous vitamin B12 issue.As for the recipes themselves, with 400 recipes to choose from I'm sure everyone could easily find dishes they enjoy in this weighty tome. Some recipes I would recommend are the Udon Noodles in Shiitake-Ginger Broth, the Tofu and Vegetable Lo Mein, the Yuba-Wrapped Seitan and Vegetable Rolls, as well as the various pizza recipes. Most do not require any hard-to-find ingredients, and many do not require an excessive amount of time in the kitchen to prepare, making this a great cookbook for those with busy lifestyles (though I would recommend a food processor to cut down on prep time) who don't want to sacrifice colorful and flavorful foods from their diet. So many cookbooks on the market have a few great recipes that one might turn to over and over again, but this one has several.Some small downsides to this book, though far overshadowed by the pluses, include the lack of pictures and lack of inclusion of nutrition facts. Furthermore, as with any cookbook, there are a few recipes that are not going to appeal to every taste. For example, I had to throw out the vegan macaroni and \\"cheese\\" as my husband and I found it simply inedible (though I believe it's just difficult to find a truly enticing vegan substitute for that particular dish). However, as was previously stated, these minor quibbles should not be a deterrent to picking up this great addition to anyone's kitchen.Overall, this is a great cookbook for someone making the switch to veganism, the \\"occasional\\" vegan looking for healthy, low fat recipes, or the seasoned veteran looking to add a few new dishes to their repertoire. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I've made a load of the recipes in this book and many of them are very decent indeed. Nonetheless I think there are some things about this book that haven't been touched upon by other reviewers that you need to know...1. No pictures. Maybe because I'm used to more lavishly illustrated British cookbooks (Delia Smith, Jamie Oliver, Gary Rhodes etc.) that the complete absence of pictures hits so hard, but I do think the book would be better with some nice photos. It looks so dated without them, like the sort of cookbooks my granny has...2. No nutritional information. Which I thought was odd for a book espousing the health benefits of a Vegan diet. It would have been very useful to have some kind of nutritional breakdown for each recipe.3. Authenticity, or lack thereof. The 'Fantastic Flavors from Around the World' have been desperately Westernised :-( The Thai soup is nothing like a Thai meal, the Indian foods contain celery and sweet potato... Personally I would have preferred to see recipes more sympathetic to their country of origin. In the breads section for example one of the side notes babbles on about some traditional flatbreads from around the world, however NONE of these are offered as recipes and instead the usual variations of banana/seed/nut breads are trotted out again. The sesame &amp; cumin flatbread is fantastic mind you but once again it's a poor interpretation of an Indian naan bread.4. 400 recipes eh? More like 300 with a number of variations. Shame that. Still most of those 300 are good."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"The recipes in this book are great, I think it gets more creative than a lot of vegan recipes I've seen and they usually turn out great if followed closely. That being said, I find that this cookbook suffers from the same issue I find with a lot of vegan recipes, which is that often the recipes call for a lot of ingredients. Often the recipes will have ingredients such as a vegetarian worchestire sauce that you need to turn around and make. In other words, I find these recipes time intensive. I think another good measure of how time intensive some of these recipes are is the number of ingredients required to make them, which is often around 15. When I have the time and feel like cooking, I bring out this book. But most days when I'm looking to make something fast I don't have the time."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"My wife and I have found this vegan cookbook to be one of the best that we own. Our reasons:1) It is concise and the recipes are generally simple2) The recipes call for well-known ingredients3) The recipes are generally not expensive to make4) The recipes always \\"turn out\\"5) The results are deliciousI'd recommend this cookbook to anyone, meat-eaters and vegans alike."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"As a lover of food and cooking, when I became vegan nine months ago I began experimenting with a wide variety of new recipes and new ways to make old favorites. I bought several vegan cookbooks and scoured the web in search of ideas and advice. I made 3 or 4 new dishes every week. This was one of the first books I bought and despite later purchases and the wide variety of recipes available on the web, I come back to this book again and again. Many cookbooks, vegan and otherwise, contain a few gems, some recipes that are interesting looking but which I couldn't really see myself making, and quite a few that I'm simply not attracted to. This book is cover-to-cover great recipes (more than 400) that I could see myself making if I haven't already. As well as familiar items creatively done like sandwiches, salads, soups and various veggies, many recipes borrow from different ethnic cuisines (Thai drunken noodles, baked sweet potato and green pea samosas, etc.) but are accessable and easy enough to prepare that they're not daunting. There are recipes suitable for parties and entertaining, special occasions (including a chapter on desserts), and casual every day meals. Overall this is just a really fantastic cookbook. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This book is great for anyone who enjoys variety. There are many dishes to choose from and divided into categories to make it pretty easy for you. I enjoyed the curry dishes in here, the Red Bean and Sweet Potato Curry is fantastic. I did not care if it had pictures because I do not really need them. (But if you like to follow pictures of each dish this is not the book for you) Once you have been cooking for some time you like to ad lib on recipes to add your own extra flair and you can do that with these recipes. I did not think they were bland at all. You need to have great spices and fresh ingredients for any recipe to turn out in any cookbook. Most items (except for some of the oriental dishes)can be found at your local supermarket.The majority of recipes are really easy, and there are a few more time consuming for weekend meals. I definately recommend this book to anyone who enjoys vegan cuisine, with simple ingredients and great flavor."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Dear Robin Robertson,Thank you for writing your wonderful cookbooks. I have both Vegetarian Meat and Potatoes and Vegan Planet. I have been a vegetarian for 11 years and a vegan for a year and a half. Your cookbooks have truely enhanced the quality of our meals! The Black Bean and Sweet Potatoe Enchiladas are the most amazing things I have ever eaten. Last night I made the Pizza Bandiera and it was so good we ate the entire thing! Thanks for making it a pleasure to be a vegan and cook healthy, quick and easy meals. I have made ten recipes from the book so far and all have been outstanding.

Someday I hope to try all the recipes in here, because every single thing I have ever made from this book is great. My favorites include the Alfredo Style Fettuccine, Fettuccine with Red Lentil Sauce, the cheesecake recipes (i modify them using their basic method to make flavors like cookies and cream), Baked Samosas, Pierogies, Gnocchi, Not So Dirty Rice, and basically the rest of them too. Buy it now!! I only wish there were nutrition facts for the recipes, but I can hope for a reprint some day with that info.Updated 11/11/07 to mention that although my favorite cookbook award now has to go to Veganomicon, I still adore this book. I don't use it as often as I used to due to my dinners being taken over for almost a year testing recipes for V-con, but I will go back to Vegan Planet! I still love every recipe I've made from this and there are so many more I still can't wait to try. I've now had this book for 4 years and this is one that I will never phase out."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"All I can say is wow! The recipes for the most part use ingredients you can find at any larger supermarket. So far the prep has been comparable to most cookbooks, from start to actually eating it seems to be 30 - 60 minutes. The Italian Wedding Soup, Thyme Scented Wild Mushroom Bisque, Ultimate Shepards Pie, Cheesy Potato Chili Gratin, Maple Pecan French Toast and the Apple Cinnamon French Toast are all fabulous!!! The only thing I don't like about this book is the lack of a nutritional analysis for each recipe. This is definitely my most used vegan cookbook.The recipes in this book tend to be of the \\"stick-to-your-ribs\\" type and leave you feeling very satisfied. I personally am not a fan of the type of vegan or vegetarian cookbooks that give you nothing but recipes for odd things like \\"quinoa with barley and dandelions\\", that just does not appeal to me and while this book does occassionally make use of some whole grains like quinoa, there are plenty of recipes that are \\"normal\\". Things like the recipes mentioned above for gratins, pot pies, chilis, pastas, and other vegan versions of foods I grew up with.I highly recommend this book for vegans and vegetarians."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Truly a must have for anyone enjoying a vegan diet. So many exquisite recipees with unique flavors, textures and visual appeal. When I first told my husband I wanted us to go vegan, he said no way. But I bought the book anyway and have been cooking out of it for three weeks almost every night straight and my husband has been delighted with every meal and has not complained once and doesn't even know he's eating vegan! These are unusual meals that are not too hard to prepare if you have a well stocked kitchen, you need the right tools for the job and you need to be willing to shop frequently as a vegan for the fresh foods these recipees require, but the results are well worth your effforts guaranteed. As an experienced cooking enthusiast, I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If you're only going to buy one vegan cookbook, this is the one to get.

I am not a Vegan, but most vegetarian cookbooks rely so heavily on milk and cheese I don't find them useful. This book is great for both beginning and advanced cooks.

Of all the recipes I tried so far, they are better than good--they are absolutely delightful! In fact, I don't even think about the fact that they're vegan--the dishes have a full, rich taste without tasting \\"absent\\" of flavor in anyway. The vegan pancake recipes are great, and although I do prefer pancakes made lighter and fluffier with eggs, the vegan versions in this book were still satisfying and tasty."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I love this book!

The first one I tried was the African Sweet Potato and Peanut Stew which was wonderful. There are many recipes incorporating tempeh which I have not seen too much of in veggie cookbooks.

It looked good, and there were lots of things to try.Problem is, a lot of the recipes aren't very good. Example: the \\"Three Bean Dal\\" (page 285) makes a pretty good chili, but certainly isn't Dal. The obligatory chocolate chip cookie recipe (page 510) uses way too much liquid (maple syrup and corn oil) resulting in a cookie that has a hard time setting up, and whose texture just isn't right.There are some good finds in here, but nothing that's knocked my socks off. If you need a semi-encyclopedic book that'll have a recipe for almost anything, this could work. If you're looking for books with good recipes that will guide you in new directions, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Ok first of all- I am a vegetarian/ aspiring vegan that doesn't have the time to write reviews.But for anyone who is willing and open minded enough to go vegan- this book is one you will reference for years to come. I am the kind of cook who opens three cookbooks and pick what I like from the recipes and create my own concoctions- and this is the basis of all my thoughts.I live in Germany- and don't speak german so it's difficult to find weird ingredients- well this cookbook is one you can find many recipes that don't call for nutritional yeast, miso- or seitan. Although I have now claimed seitan as my favorite gyro meat!!!!!To those of you who are being compassionate mindful eaters- my children thank you :)"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am not a vegan. I am not a vegetarian. But I love this book more than any of my other cookbooks. First, the recipes are easy. I need only read the recipe once, shop for one or two of the fresh ingredients, and get started. Second, the result is amazing. Every time I've made a dish from this book, my guests have exclaimed that it tasted wonderful (this is not always the case with other cookbooks, especially when it's the first time I've attempted a recipe). Third, vegan ingredients are usually cheaper than meaty ingredients.So with those three parts, there is no reason not to buy (or borrow) this book. Ease, Pleasure, and Cost are all favorable factors. Buy this book.As for the lack of pictures, whoever complains about this should go to a shop and buy a coffee-table book. Seriously. Do you really need a picture to show how to mince garlic? Isn't that what the internet's for? You're crazy."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have been using this cookbook for years and have yet to find a bad recipe or get tired of it. Even with all of Isa's great talent and books out there, this is still my Vegan cookbook of choice. The recipes are easy to make and the ingredients aren't hard to find. Try any of the soups or casseroles for comfort food. I love the 3-Way sesame with broccoli or the Ultimate Shepherd's Pie which all my non-veg friends drool over too. 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan Planet has tons of wonderful, not too complex recipes along with great info on many ingredients. Very informative. I have made several dishes and even my carnivore husband ate them."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I first checked this book out from the library when I had just become vegan. I had never really learned to cook anything that didn't come from a box. When I went \\"cold-turkey\\" to veganism, I realized I was gonna have to figure out what to do with all those newfound organic veggies and \\"whole foods\\".Three years later I still remember the first recipe I made- \\"Shredded Seitan with Green Beans and Shallots\\". Was probably the best thing I had ever cooked. I then went nuts, creating huge shopping lists for a few new recipes every week. My boyfriend couldn't believe that the stuff I was cooking was vegan. Actually he couldn't believe I was cooking.After renewing the library book twice, I finally bought a copy. It's so full of bookmarks now that it's hard to even choose what I like best. And in the process of all these recipes I actually learned what kind of spices and other ingredients work together, and would call myself a pretty talented vegan cook at this point.Highly recommend this to anyone who is going vegan, or learning to cook, or just wanting to change their meals up a little. So much variety in the recipes. I also like that it's not full of regular recipes substituting in \\"vegan cheese\\" and \\"vegetarian sausage\\". These are great VEGAN recipes--they never seem like an imitation version of the real thing."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have already found many great recipes in this book. It is also great for people who are not used to vegan cooking. It gives a lot of tips and general information about vegan cooking. A good book for anyone interested in healthy eating."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This Vegan Cookbook is full of absolutely delicious recipes. I would recommend it to anyone looking for variety and tasty recipes!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I had this book for quite a few years. I had to get another one because my original book was falling apart I used it so much. Great and unique recipes. My husband is a vegetarian so he was thrilled with all the recipes. Everything was just delicious. The strawberry topped cheesecake is the best I've ever tasted - just as good as the real stuff!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This is the best vegan cookbook I've found so far. I also own Veganomicon (which has received rave reviews) but it doesn't compare to this one. Every recipe I've tried in Vegan Planet is AWESOME. I especially like the Pumpkin Pie Pancakes, Pad Thai, and Baked Beans. This is a must have cookbook for any vegan, and ESPECIALLY aspiring vegetarians and vegans. Get out there and buy it now!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have found this cookbook to be extra great because the ingredients are easy to find. The items simple to make and not super time intensive. It does a good job with cooking instructions and produces reasonably well seasoned dishes."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This is a great vegan cookbook. The sheer number of recipes alone is a feat. However, there are a lot of creative ideas and delicious recipes, along with some easy classics to cook on a busy day. I recommend this book to anyone interested in vegan or vegetarian cooking."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This cookbook gets many things right. The recipes are tasty, healthful, easy and relatively quick to make, and they do not require exotic ingredients that the average person would not have in their kitchen. It has good variety, with 12 different types of chili recipes alone!This book was given to me as a gift, and it is the most useful out of several vegan cookbooks that I have sampled. I've been pleased with every recipe I've tried. I am by no means a gourmet cook, but this cookbook is not geared for the gourmet audience - it is just good, basic, simple cooking, with a helpful introduction and many helpful tips interspersed throughout.The book would be even better if the author had included estimates of cooking times for each dish. I am a pretty slow cook, and I have tended to spend between 30 and 90 minutes on the recipes I've tried (including prep and cleanup). It also does not contain any photographs, although that does not matter as much to me. While photos can be inspiring, they also drive up the cost of a cookbook, and take up valuable space that could be devoted to recipes.Those who are looking for more of a \\"gourmet\\" cooking experience (e.g. more time spent cooking, longer and more exotic lists of ingredients) might prefer the popular books Veganomicon and/or any of the Moosewood Restaurant cookbooks. On the other hand, if you are mainly looking for \\"quick\\" recipes that are maybe not quite as good, there are vegan cookbooks that offer that too (I am presently experimenting with \\"The Pretty Darn Quick\\" vegetarian cookbook for that). Vegan Planet is in the middle between those extremes.Overall, Vegan Planet is a very good cookbook, my favorite, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for basic, straightforward vegan recipes!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Got tired of getting it from the library.It's a great volume to have in the house.It came in time for the holidays too."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Lots of recipes containing soy/meat substitutes. I wasn't thrilled with that aspect (gave me a tummy ache), but I can't say they aren't good. A really great helper when I started my journey into being vegan."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am not a vegan, but this is the cookbook I use the most (and I have many!). It has tons of very doable and quick recipes and they don't require expensive and hard to find ingredients (or substitutes). All recipes are nutritious and tasty (people like them - even meat eaters) and a lot of thought has gone into making balanced meals that will provide the necessary nutrients without the use of meat. Combinations of vegetarian ingredients provide those nutrients and there is often a brief explanation of that so you know how to apply this knowledge in other recipes. So, if you want to reduce your meat consumption and want to do it right, you should get this book. Another added bonus is that there are recipes from all over the world, which is nice if you like different cuisines..."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"All of the recipes in this book are very simple to follow and each recipe that I have tried is delicious. So far I have made Seitan from Whole Wheat Flour, Wheat Meat Stroganoff, Make Mine Mocha Smoothie, Peaches and Cream Smoothie and Thai Peanut Butter Wraps. I like that the recipes don't call for a lot of ingredients. This is a good book for new vegetarians and also for those of us that have been veg for a while.There is a chapter dedicated to vegan ingredients and an explanation of what to avoid. The chapters are appetizers, soups, salads, sauces and dressings, condiments, veggies in the middle (just veggie recipes, no meat subs), grain recipes, pasta recipes, beans, stews and chili's, food that sizzles: grilling, sauteing, and stir fry recipes, the global oven (casseroles, pies, gratins and lasagnas), simply stuffed (manicotti, pasta shells, stuffed veggies, stuffed seitans), new world pizza (pizzas, calzones, focaccias and strombolis), sandwiches, wraps and burgers, a baker's dozen of breads, dessert heaven, smoothies shakes and other quenchers, and don't skip breakfast.I am looking forward to trying the 5 Spice Chocolate Layer Cake with Maple-Chocolate Icing, Seitan Reuben, Portobello Fajitas, Triple Soy Roast with Double Mushroom Sauce, Seitan Roast with Chestnut and Cranberry Stuffing, Hoisin Drenched Garlic Seitan with Baby Bok Choy, Pan Seared Seitan with Cremini Mushrooms and Red Wine, Tuscan White Beans with Garlic and Sage, Middle Eastern Lentils and Rice with Carmelized Shallots, Cuban Style Black Beans, Tofu and Vegetable Lo Mein, Bourbon Spiked Barbecue Sauce, Pseudo Caesar Salad Not So Dirty Rice and Ziti, Artichokes and Olives with Spicy Tomato Sauce."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"As a \\"new\\" Vegan, I found this book to be a wonderful resource. The author explains in detail the principle of a plant based diet and her directions for recipes are precise. I have made several dishes and have been pleased with each one. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in living healthy."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"My daughter gave me Vegan Planet as a Christmas gift several years ago. I really like this book. Although I myself am not a vegan (vegetarian, yes please!), I think a lot of the recipes are quite tasty and anyone would enjoy them. The Curried Chickenless Salad is one of the recipes I use quite often. The Pad Thai has also been a huge hit for entertaining. I recently made the Spiced Banana Pancakes and thought \\"these aren't bad for vegan pancakes.\\" I have to admit to tweaking that recipe a bit but with a few minor adjustments, the pancakes turned out light and fluffy.I think this would be a good starter cookbook for anyone venturing into the vegan way of cooking and eating. Have fun and eat your veggies!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I love this book! I took it out of the library originally and made several recipies and they were all easy enough for everyday but very tasty. (They even go over well with non-veg*n's.) I liked it so much I purchased a copy. If you're looking for non-meat recipies this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Although I have only made three of the recipes in this cookbook but so far, so good. I made the 3-nut burgers, the brown gravy, and the pasta (macaroni) salad. My husband who is a vegetarian,(and adamantly not a vegan! He likes to slather everything with cheese, and generally hates vegan cooking) loved the burgers with the gravy. He said it reminded him of Thanksgiving. Indeed, it does taste a bit like stuffing with gravy, but is obviously more nutritous (cashews, walnuts, and almond butter). The macaroni salad he found a bit bland, and perhaps next time I make it, instead of a tofu-mustard, lemon juice mix, I'll experiment more with the ingredients.Anyway, I have tried many cookbooks, and I hope that this one turns out to be a real winner. I like that on the bottom right hand of the page, it tells you what section you're in. That is very helpful when you're in the middle of cooking, and are flipping around in the book trying to make multiple recipes.I have decided to try the other recipes that were recommended by the other customer reviews.Cheerio!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Everything I made was mediocre at best and there are so many other vegan cookbooks out there that I got rid of this one after it sat unused for years so that I could make room for better vegan cookbooks. Don't waste your money, get Vegan with a Vengeance and Veganomicon and start from there."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I got this book as a birthday gift. I am not a vegan, but I like to try different kinds of food so I thought it would be a good book. Overall, I like it a lot. I think that most of the recipes are really tasty, and easy to prepare. I love the miso soup with baby spinach, it is by far my favorite recipe in the book. I am not as impressed with the desserts, however. The smoothies and drinks were really good, but a lot of the cakes and stuff were not. I especially thought the vegan chocolate-chip cookies were awful. I will stick to my traditional recipe with butter and eggs, thank you.Interestingly, i find that a lot of the side dishes go well with meat. I know this is not what the author intended, but I find that the lemon risotto goes well with salmon. I also think that the indian-spiced quinoa goes well with (horrors!) lamb. I also like to add shrimp to the thai coconut soup, I find that it complements the tofu and mushrooms in the dish very well.My only real complaint about this book is that it's very preachy about animal rights and how bad animal products are for you. I think that these sections are unnecessary as they are unlikely to convince carnivores and are basically preaching to the choir for the peta crowd. I think the sections on nutrition are very useful for those who are adopting the vegan lifestyle, and for those of us who just want to eat a more healthful diet.A couple of other great books by this author are Fresh From the Vegetarian Slow-Cooker (another of my favs) and the Vegetarian Chili Cookbook. The recipes are wonderful, and those books don't contain the lectures on animal rights."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I can't imagine a better cookbook for one to have on the kitchen counter than Vegan Planet. Robertson has outdone herself in assembling this huge collection of recipes (her 10th cookbook!) encompassing everything from traditional comfort foods to exotic cuisine from around the world. And as impressive as Robertson's recipes are in Vegan Planet, her discussions on the benefits of vegan cooking are even more so. Are you worried about your cholesterol level? About your waist line? About animal suffering? In a non-preachy and friendly manner, Robertson discusses how each of these topics-and many, many more-can be remedied with a sumptuous and healthy vegan diet.Robertson makes it easy to flip to the recipe you want by organizing her impressive recipe collection into 19 straightforward chapters. Her choice of ingredients focuses on fresh foods and readily available items-you won't need access to a gourmet grocery store to prepare these gourmet recipes.It's rare that I find a cookbook that is so all-encompassing. For example, she includes recipes that are great for packing the kids' school lunches (such as grilled vegetable wraps) or for a special dinner party (such as pesto-stuffed tofu steaks with summertime tomato sauce).Whether you are a meat eater looking to include more vegan food in your life or you are a vegan looking for new recipes, you'll find Vegan Planet to be an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I found this book largely disappointing. The savory dishes I tried were uniformly bland. I made it a practice to double the spices, and still found them bland. I tried one dessert, a fruit cobbler, which contained an unfortunate typo. (do not put 2/3 cup sugar in the fruit, they are supposed to get only 2 tbsp) This cost me a large amount of fairly expensive fruit, plus an extra helping of frustration.Those looking for a comprehensive vegan cookbook would do better with \\"Veganomicon.\\" I also like \\"Vegan with a Vengeance.\\""},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have to say that this book is kind of like my vegan bible. There are just SO many recipes in here. It's definitely a big book! However one thing I wish it had were SOME pictures, it can get sort of intimating and overwhelming looking through it trying to get a meal planned. If you only want to buy ONE book- then I suggest this one because it really touches everything. Or if you aren't intimidated by so many choices, then this would be great for you too. However if you want a collection of vegan books, I'd suggest maybe getting specialized books first and maybe this one later on."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am a recently converted vegan (also gluten free) and this has been my vegan bible. I use it on a daily basis for recipes. Some of my favorites are the spicy soy and veggie scramble (p537), coconut macadamia cheesecake (490), asparagus sushi rolls (41), and tofu yung (342). These are just a few! Besides providing fantastic recipes for every meal of the day, Robertson supplies cuisines from all over the world, including Africa, India, Indonesia, and Japan. This book is full of useful information- how to get enough protein, which vegetables have this or that vitamin, a glossary of nuts, and much, much more. I recommend this book to aspiring vegans, or anyone interested in making healthy and delicious food!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan Planet is by far the best Vegan cookbook I've gotten to date. I'm not a Vegan, but i am a Vegetarian (ovo-lacto) and my husband is pure carnivore. So far, every receipe I've tried he has loved and I thought were easy to follow, easy to amass the ingredients and excellent. The only thing I'd like(which I found through further Net research) would be substitutions. I found out that since I was unable to find \\"Miso\\" I was able to substitute Tahini. That would have been helpful had it been in the book. But, the recipes were really good and easy. If you get obly one Veggie book get this one."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have several good vegan cookbooks, but this is - hands down - my favorite. I like to try dishes of different ethnicities, and this book has many. Most of the recipes are simple. My only \\"negative\\" is that some of the dishes are a bit high in fat, but I have adjusted them on my own to make them less so."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have enjoyed reading and using this cookbook. When I need an idea or inspiration, I turn to Vegan Planet. Another reviewer wrote that if you are only going to buy one vegan cookbook this is the one to buy. Absolutely.The author provides a good amount of basic information and the recipes I have tried have turned out wonderfully; however, I give it four stars rather than five because I have found that some recipes needs to be tweaked to make them come out just right. For a new cook or for someone who likes to follow recipes exactly, it could be frustrating to find that a recipe seems to call for too much or too little of something - in my experience it is often liquids and seasoning. I enjoy working with a recipe rather than \\"to\\" it, so it is fine for me. I like the ideas it gives me.In my house Vegan Planet lives on my nightstand rather than in the kitchen because I constantly read through recipes and tag ones I want to try. This book is good enough to give as a gift to someone who isn't vegan or vegetarian just to provide them with new ideas and recipes."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan planet is a comprehensive, well organized cookbook I refer to at least once a week. I found the index very convenient and handy. The recipes are easy-to-follow and my family has enjoyed most of the recipes I've prepared from this book. I've been able to cook several dishes without having to drive to different specialty markets. Many of the recipes include variations and even when I substitute, add, or omit ingredients the dishes still turn out good. The author includes several ways (roasted, steamed, saut&eacute;ed etc.) to prepare vegetables in a wide variety of recipes and also helpfully describes unfamiliar or uncommon ingredients. Two things that would have made this book better: pictures (there are no pictures of uncommon ingredients or finished dishes in the book) and spiral binding (I can't keep the recipe in front of me without tucking it under something). I highly recommend this book for beginning cooks or for anyone looking to include more vegetables in their diet because this book really showcases vegetables not herself or vegan politics."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Like other reviewers have stated, this cookbook is severely lacking in the photography and nutritional information departments. On top of that, the general book design looks a bit tacky and thrown-together; I would describe it as unprofessional.Very few of the recipes grabbed my eye and the dozen or so I tried were extremely mediocre. I got this book as a gift years ago and haven't opened it much...and when I do, I heavily modify the recipes. Save your money and either buy used or check it out at the library - for inspiration only."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Tasty, easy to make recipes. Ingredients are easy to find. I've shared this book and others have enjoyed it as well."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"The best compliment I can give this book is that I've used it for so many years that chunks of pages have fallen out and I have to keep the book closed with a rubber band to keep it together. Not to mention that many of the pages are stained with whatever food was flying around while I cooked. We're not vegan in my family we just love good, simple, down-to-earth dishes and this book delivers."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"So far I've made 20 or so recipes from this book - they've all ranged from really good to delicious. The Spicy Jasmine Rice with Carrots and Cashews, African Sweet Potato and Peanut Stew, Sweet Noodle Kugel with Apples and Almonds, and the Pan Bagna are all amazing.Having read the negative reviews on this site, the typos mentioned have been corrected in this newer version.I think this cookbook would be fine for both new-ish vegans and long-term vegans. It has a decent index and contains a great deal of information on the how-to's of preparation, including definitions and descriptions of cooking terms and ingredients.There aren't any pictures, which doesn't bother me, but for some that's a must in a cookbook.There are plenty of options for both dishes that contain substitutes for meat and dairy and dishes that are all vegetation-based.Overall, I highly recommend Vegan Planet."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I'm vegan and really liked this cookbook but I feel like anyone who enjoys cooking would appreciate this book.

Definitely gets a thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"For a non-vegan & non-vegetarian this book was ordered only because of a command by a doctor. But I was so surprised and impressed by the number of receipes and the thoroughness of information. Everything I have tried so far has been delicious and easy to make. You don't have to use ingredients you've never heard of before. I ordered a second copy to give to a vegan relative who also loved the book. I say order it today!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I picked up this book from the library; as an lacto-ovo vegetarian with a family of confirmed omnivores (one of whom has tastes that could in no way be described as \\"adventurous\\"), the search for a good single resource for recipes that will please the whole family has been quite a frustrating experience. Who would have thought the fulfillment of that search would have come in the form of a vegan cookbook? (Not my family, who looked at the book on the counter with a mix of suspicion and dread! :) )I've used several recipes from this wonderful resource, and every one has received rave reviews (although the Thai Coconut Soup calling for mushrooms *and* tofu was a bit too much for my ten year old :) ). The recipes are imaginative, flavorful, and *numerous*. A real find."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I've had this cookbook for several months now, and every recipe has been fantastic. I was pleased by the number of recipes that use easy to find, inexpensive ingredients. And, there are plenty of recipes with unusual ingredients, but worth the specialty store search. What I really like about this cookbook is the vegan basics listed at the front of the book, such as: how to stock your pantry, nutrition information for the vegan, and how to make egg substitutes. Information about the basic protein foods used in vegan diets are given in detail. Not only that, but it also tells you how to make a vegan protein staple, wheat gluten (seitan). Didn't know you could actually make it yourself.This is a cookbook I use every week. Well worth it!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"The recipes are excellent. The format- one recipe per page- makes it easy to put your cookbook in the stand and go to town without having to turn pages with messy fingers. The typesetting is easy to read. It's generally fabulous!A prior reviewer has criticized this cookbook for being \\"preachy.\\" I think what they might really mean is that the author presents some uncomfortable (but true) facts about certain food products, such as honey. Just because you might not like reading about these topics doesn't mean she's being preachy. Information regarding honey (and why vegans don't eat it) can be quite helpful for those who are new to veganism or are considering it.I often think those who call vegans \\"preachy\\" are really just uncomfortable with the facts presented. Heck, I don't like reading about animal abuse any more than the next person, but that doesn't change my belief that this information is necessary. Sure helped in the beginning when I'd have a craving for meat, you know?Anyway, back to the cookbook. The recipes that I've tried are delicious and, for the most part, use ingredients that I wouldn't consider exotic (and I frequently use exotic ingredients). However, you can only read vegan recipes for so long before you come across an ingredient like quinoa or umeboshi vinegar, both of which are familiar to most vegans but which might make a midwestern meat-lover raise an eyebrow. It's all about context, and almost all ingredients can be effectively substituted for something similar but more familiar if the need arises."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This was my first vegan cookbook. It's functional and has some pretty good recipes (my favorites are the smoothies and breakfast foods), but overall I'm disappointed. Some recipes that sound fabulous, like the Cool Cucumber Soup with Cilantro and Lime, turn out unpalatable no matter how many times I try them. And many of the recipes I've tried have come out bland and, consequently, not very tasty. That said, it is a huge cookbook and there are still many recipes I have not tried (the problem is that I'm not inspired to try them!). If you're looking for a great vegan cookbook, I suggest Vegan with a Vengeance."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"This book may have a lot of good information about being vegan, which I appreciate wholeheartedly, but so far I have tried 3 recipes and they are all very juvenile and extremely plain. For example, I tried the Tempeh Simmered with Tomatoes and Sauerkraut on pg. 346. This was so boring tasting I couldn't finish it. Then I tried the Three-Way Sesame-Coated Tofu Strips and Spicy Broccoli on pg. 341. The tofu was not marinated in the least and the tahini sauce with sesame seeds, ended up falling off and practically burning in the pan before the cooking time was done. The \\"spicy\\" broccoli was just steamed broccoli with chili flakes thrown in. I could have thought of that myself.There seem to be a lot of reviews that are positive on this book, so maybe I just ended up with the dud recipes. But shouldn't every recipe be a good one if you go to the trouble to publish a book about them?I would just hate for newborn vegans to try these recipes and think \\"yuk! vegan-eating is for the birds!\\"Vegans do NOT have to settle for plain boring food choices.How do I know?Try this book: ExtraVEGANza by Laura Matthias. Now THIS is a GOOD vegan recipe book. Perhaps she spoiled me and I could settle for nothing less delicious than her book. I keep waiting for another one to come out with more recipes, but no luck so far.Anyhow, I'm stuck with this book (Vegan Planet) for now, and not sure if I should try anymore recipes. I already wasted a bunch of money on gross, plain jane combinations."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If you are going to buy only one vegan cookbook, make it this one. The recipes are inventive and varied without being too complicated. Even though we use it frequently, there are still so many good sounding recipes that we have not yet made. The groupings (e.g. \\"oven dishes, bean dishes, stuffed vegetables, stews) are helpful and the index is fantastic. There's a great short and simple introduction to teh basics of vegan cooking (e.g. egg replacers, soy).The recipes are mindful of fat content without being overly strict. I've been disappointed in some other highly recommended vegan cookbooks but this is the real deal; my husband and I both love it.

Well after the first few recipes I bought the book. The recipes WORK and are delicious. There are not crazy hard to find ingredients which with some vegan cookbooks seem to be the norm. Who wants to spend eons looking for some weird food item. If you are starting into the Vegan world get this cookbook it will introduce you into a world of delicious easy cooking.

It has by far more variety than any other cookbook I own.Even though the recipes are vegan I would recommend it to everyone, even omnivores.I also like that it offers substitutions for ingredients that may be harder to find for those of us living in small towns."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"this is the first vegan cookbook that I purchased on my 2nd day of veganism. Ever since then, I have, with unprecedented delight, discovered the new joys of cooking and eating. I'm eating better than I EVER did, and am completely cured of my fast-food loving and binging tendencies. This book, more than anything, contributed to that.First of all I love that it is SO comprehensive. It's like the Bible. Everything from the basics (vegetable stock) to the more complicated stuff. Everything from the good old American classics to more \\"exotic\\"\\" foods. All the recipes are incredibly accessible.I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs good vegan recipes. Or anyone who thinks vegans just munch on celeries and lettuce all day. WRONG!! It feels great to be liberated from the idea that there is noI do agree with other reviewers that photos of the recipes would have been nice, but I think the volume is already so thick and comprehensive that I don't know how the authors would incorporate them into the book."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have been vegan for about 4 years and this is by far the cookbook we use most often. Everything we try is a winner. Mango-Coconut Bread pudding, Portabella fajitas, Indian lentil patties, dried fruit chutney, Autum veg stew, szechaun green beans are some of our favorites. Recipies aren't excessively complex and don't take hours and hours to prepare like other cookbooks. This is an everyday, comfort food cookbook that everyone in our family loves. And there are enough recipies to keep our palates interested for years to come."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Not only are there hordes of recipes, but also a wonderful section on vegan lifestyle and helpful things to know for new vegans (like vegan egg substitutes, where to buy vegan shoes, and how you are helping to save the planet). It's written in a friendly, fun to read style, but without skimping on the hard facts of the omnivore diet and it's global implications. Also buy How it all Vegan, Garden of Vegan, and anything by John Robbins."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I went from being a non-vegan, non-cook to being both with the purchase of this book. It made becoming vegan look and taste easy. My friends, mainly non-vegans, have enjoyed every single dish I have made (and many desserts)from this treasure of a cookbook. Text boxes with notes about various topics are scattered throughout, and are always very helpful and insightful. I had never used my oven when I bought this book, and now I make fresh meals regularly. This book is wonderful."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I am not vegetarian, let alone vegan, but I wanted a change from the meat-cheese-cream-laden dishes in the Midwest part of the US and in many cookbooks. Vegan Planet has provided an amazing array of easy-to-prepare and flavorful dishes ranging from traditional &quot;meat and potato&quot; kinds of vegetarian dishes to those with more adventurous palates. Each and every recipe has been easy to make and tastes WONDERFUL! If more people knew how to cook vegan food as Robin offers in her recipes here, there would likely be a lot more vegetarians!"},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"Vegan Planet is a wonderful example of the variety of delicious foods that comprise the vegan diet. With more and more people opting for vegetarian meals, it makes sense to offer unique and different culinary tastes to expose everyone to the joys of the vegetarian and vegan table, and Vegan Planet does just that. While Ms. Robertson uses many everyday ingredients, making all the recipes easily accessible to everyone, she has a way of combining them into very creative and different dishes, for example Pesto Polenta with Saut&eacute;ed Portobello Slices. I give this cookbook five stars for creativity, for inspiration, and most of all for the compassion contained in each and every recipe, as no animals were harmed in the making of this cookbook."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"If you were going to purchase one vegan cookbook for your home library, this would be the one that I would recommend. With 400 recipes, you're sure to find something that suits you! I like the categorization (makes it easy to browse) and I like the originality of the recipes. Every recipe that I have tried has been delicious and very easy to prepare. Most recipes call for items that I typically have on hand or items that aren't hard to find (or super expensive). This book keeps me from getting stuck in a monotonous dinner routine."},{"Title":"Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World","review":"I have experienced several vegan cookbooks in my lifetime. This is definitely one of the better ones. I was looking for vegetable recipes, but came away with so much more.Seriously, You will never even have to think of using animal products again with this cookbook. Ms. Robertson takes a vegan approach to classic recipes like New England chowder and Italian wedding soup.There is also a huge variety of recipes from different countries and cultures, all meat/dairy free. I cannot wait to try the scallion pancakes with sesame seeds.Vegan Planet is wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I really enjoyed the analogy of the Dharma of Star Wars. It's useful to have a contemporary model to illustrate parts of the Dharma. One limitation I experienced was that I am just a casual fan of Star Wars, so I did not connect with a few of the references. But overall a fun read and a fresh angle from which to consider the Dharma."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I'm not new to Buddhism, and also I'm quite a fan of the Star Wars saga, but anyway I found this book fun and easy to read. It's not a deep analysis of Buddhism, and doesn't say anything new about the Star Wars universe, however the analogies are interesting and the author's style is refreshing. A pleasant experience!"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"Matthew Bortolin is spot on with this book. So glad that someone put everything into easy to read yet deep perspective! THANKS!"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"A three and a half star book - good, but not spectacular. This book is very readable, written in accessible prose, and making (for the most part) defensible arguments about the connection between Star Wars and aspects of the Buddhist faith. Those people already familiar with Buddhism and Star Wars will feel Bortolin's argument and analogies click into place, for the most part. Those familiar with Star Wars, but not Buddhism, may not exactly realize where the Star Wars ideas leave off and the Buddhism picks up. Though some of his arguments and characterizations may seem flawed, overall Bortolin does a convincing jobs of showing the connections between the dharma or discipline of Buddhism, and the religious philosophy of the Jedi knights. Since it is very readable, and fairly informative, I guess I will lump it towards the 4 star category."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"A great beginner book on Buddhism and for fans of Star Wars like myself. My only gripe about this book was the extreme number of typos and one trivia error."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I liked this book when I had it. The I got convicted that I shouldn't of bought it to begin with. So, I don't remember a whole lot, but I am going to buy this book again eventually. And then pair it up the Wisdom of the Jedi that I have now."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I will start by saying that I am a Star Wars junkie (action figures, books, posters, t-shirts, I am considering a rehab program). I also have a basic knowledge of Buddism (I am not a Buddist, but I understand the basic principles and have read a book or two and been to a couple of lectures).That being said when I saw this book I immediately wanted to read it. I thought it would give more body to the conclusions and parallels that I had already drawn. It didn't. In fact all it did was point out all the observations I had already made. This, of course, made me feel quite clever, but that wasn't really why I had bought the book.The writing is good and sound, but I found it to be quite elementary and very bogged down with Star Wars vocabulary (if it's too much for me it's a lot). It was almost as if the writer was trying to impress me with his knowledge of Star Wars, not gonna happen.I would recommend this for a young Star Wars fan, whose parents want them to stop reading comic books. For anyone over the age of 17 I would recommend reading a introduction to Buddism , watching the movies again, and making your own observations. You would probably enjoy it a lot more, and learn a lot more."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Matthew Bortolin uses the story of Star Wars (across all six movies) to illustrate Buddhist concepts and uses Buddhist concepts to highlight deeper themes in the Star Wars saga. The result makes Star Wars more profound and moving and Buddhism more accessible. Avid fans of Star Wars will appreciate all the detailed references provided by a true fan devoted to the series, while more casual Star Wars viewers will find the movies much more compelling after reading this book. Those new to Buddhism will learn a lot from Bortolin's accessible, human way of presenting these ideas, while those with more familiarity will likely experience new insights from Bortolin's novel approach. It's nice to read something that is funny and entertaining yet also contains real wisdom and insight. I find myself thinking about things mentioned in the book as I'm dealing with various situations in my life. And now I'm really looking forward to seeing Episode 3!"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I immediately bought this book when I saw it on display in the bookstore, without needing to flip through and read passages. I believe that the \\"Star Wars\\" films are the most spiritual films ever made, as the story is soaked in classic mythological motifs with heavy borrowing from Buddhist ideas about how our universe works. This book is written by a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, so he knows his material, and because he's also a Buddhist, he is able to write the main tenets of Buddhism in easy to understand concepts for anyone familiar with the Star Wars characters.When I saw \\"The Phantom Menace\\" in 1999, I was baffled by the amount of backlash that film inspired in fans. The film expanded our knowledge of \\"the Force\\" and I remember getting chills when Qui-Gon Jinn told Anakin: \\"remember, your focus determines your reality.\\" That line sums up my spiritual beliefs in a perfect phrase and I'm glad to read that the author of this book mentioned that several times as well. Another thing that the author brilliantly picked up on was the character of Jar Jar Binks, which so many fans HATED with an unbelievable passion. I happened to love Jar Jar Binks and I don't think it was accidental that Lucas made him as annoying as he was. The name \\"Jar Jar\\" should clue anyone in to Lucas' point...being so close to the word \\"jarring\\". This book will have you seeing Jar Jar Binks in a totally new light and I'm glad someone pointed it out so Lucas doesn't have to spell it out for everyone.In \\"Attack of the Clones\\", my favorite of the new trilogy, I got chills when I saw the ethereal glowing blue in the Jedi library and the scene where Obi-Wan tries to find Kamino with his three dimensional galaxy map. Those scenes are some of the most spiritual-intuitive scenes I've ever seen in ANY movie. For one thing, I believe the library in heaven looks similar to the Jedi library and I look forward to perusing its database someday.This book makes a great introduction to Buddhism and I certainly will refer back to highlighted passages because I believe in the Eightfold Path, especially being mindful of our present and calming the mind before we panic or jump to hasty conclusions. Anyone who thinks Buddhism is a false religion simply hasn't investigated it and tried it. The world would be a vastly improved place if people attempted to live its principles and practiced mindfulness.I also appreciated the author writing a chapter on the Jedi's tendency to kill...as that isn't a spiritual principle but I think for the sake of the movies, Lucas had little choice but to use that for his story. The good thing is that he doesn't show the violence. The author is correct, though, about how a spiritual person simply cannot take another human life, no matter how compassionate we may think we are in the act. Killing is still depriving a person of changing...thus makes Luke Skywalker's decision not to kill the Emperor or Darth Vader all the more profound.This book will make an excellent companion to \\"Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters\\" and \\"The Tao of Star Wars\\"...as all three books pick up on the ideas, scenes and characters of the greatest film series in the history of humanity and present the spiritual concepts in an easy to understand manner. But I think this one is the best of the three...because its closer to \\"The Force\\" than the others."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"The Dharma of Star Wars is, simply put, many of life's little lessons wrapped up in Jedi robes. You don't have to be a believer in the Buddhist way of life to appreciate some of the wisdom that emanates from these pages. Author, Matthew Bortolin, seems quite qualified to write the piece and it shows in the writing and the examples he uses, pulled straight from the Star Wars films.This book, much like The Tao of Star Wars, was a learning experience for me. I enjoy reading about the parallels between different religions and Star Wars. George Lucas went to great lengths to make sure that his films were not religion-specific, meaning that they didn't cater to any one belief system outright. You can watch the films and find elements of Buddhism, Catholicism, Judaism, and more. Therefore, just about any belief system could be the basis for countless books comparing it to Star Wars, and I feel that this book won't be the last.Bortolin never fails to impress you with his knowledge of Buddhism and of Star Wars. He colors each page with many phrases from the film or replaces the more cliche every day words you might use with some kind of Star Wars reference or term. That's where Star Wars fans will have the most fun here - relating the important lessons learned within the pages to their favorite films. Sometimes it's easier to teach something to someone by using familiar examples. Jesus did this with the parables he told and likewise, Buddha told many similar stories, some of which you'll read in this book.This book definitely caters to fans but I feel anyone can read this work and learn a thing or two. There's a lovely section near the end called \\"The Padawan Handbook\\" that contains \\"Zen Contemplations for the Would-Be Jedi.\\" In that section you'll find short one-liners that you might hear Obi-Wan Kenobi telling his young apprentice, Anakin, on any given day during his training, (\\"Ambition and desire lead to the Dark Side. Be wise, my determined apprentice, there is no happiness like the happiness of having few desires.\\")Bortolin not only does a good job of tying Buddhism to Star Wars, he also gives you some background into the faith and does a wonderful job of explaining all its concepts like Dharma itself, nirvana, and meditation. I know that I personally took a few of the concepts in this book and tried to adapt them to my personal life. When I feel my kids are getting on my nerves, I stop and try to breathe before exploding into an angered rage. If the book can help you in little ways like that, then this is a good thing. It's by no means a book that's trying to convert anyone to the Buddhist faith, and I certainly won't be doing that, but that does not mean there aren't concepts and lessons inside which can help you in your daily lives.For those who aren't aware of all the Eastern philosophies and concepts that are embedded within the subtext of the Star Wars films, you'll be pleasantly surprised when reading this book. You'll look a the films in a different light, especially The Phantom Menace which is loaded with Buddhist references, (\\"...hate leads to suffering.\\") In fact, there's a lot of talk about \\"suffering\\" in this book but, like Luke, you have to unlearn what you have learned and not take suffering literally, or at face value. There are many forms of suffering described in this book and it's supposed to be a part of life, not something you get rid of. Learn about it, accept it and deal with it, are the things you must do. This is wonderful and insightful advice.The Dharma of Star Wars is definitely a book worthy of your attention if you're interested in learning more about both Star Wars and one of the belief systems the films are based on. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised...and hopefully enlightened."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I'm a Star Wars fan. Not a crazy, angry, I know more about STarWars then anyone you ever met, I spend 18 hours a day on Fanboy message boards Star Wars fan, but a fan. SO when I saw Bortolins book \\"The Dharma of STar Wars\\" I had to flip through it. AT first I thought \\"this guys just yanking us into his hokey Religeon with the everpowerfull starwars tractor beam\\". But the first lines of the book \\"Snaphiss! the red-bladed lightsaber arches through the air toward its target. At the last instant green-blade rises to meet it, locking the two into static tension. The battle of the Jedi and the SIth is rejoined\\" made me keep reading, and reading and reading. My first instinct about the book was right. BOrtolin does use Star wars to talk about Buddhism, and I'm glad he did, because I probably wouldn't have read a Buddhist book otherwise. SOmehow using jar jar binks to describe how my mind is always running off in a million directions rather than being \\"concentrated on the here and now where it belongs\\" made perfect sense to me and I started to appreciate that I could get to know Buddhist practice and enjoy myself at the same time.."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"This book was so easy to read, and was entertaining with the way Star Wars characters and scenes were used as examples. The Buddhist concepts explained were the clearest and most easy to understand yet, even on the topic of emptiness.I highly recommend this book if you want to learn about Buddhism, whether you're interested in Star Wars or not. For those who do love Star Wars, you'll really enjoy the Jedi Order compared in Buddhist terms.Just a great book all the way around. A few typos, but a very good read."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"A dedicated Buddhist practitioner won't be offput by the news that author Matthew Bortolin owns a set of Jedi robes. It's hardly unusual for a Buddhist to own ritual attire anyway. Bortolin is a Jedihead. He's also a member of Thich Nhat Hanh's Buddhist community.At first it seems like THE DHARMA OF STAR WARS is short on Dharma and long on STAR WARS. There are 150 or so direct references to STAR WARS in the first thirty pages (count them!). Some of them are gratuitous (\\"Your mind, like an out-of-control podracer...\\"). By the end of the first chapter---Okay! We get it! This book uses the STAR WARS universe as a paradigm!It's clear that Mr. Bortolin must have written Chapter One last. A college student swigging caffeine drinks trying to stay awake all night to write a term paper will be as tweaked as Bortolin is seemingly tweaked on STAR WARS. It's understandable. Matthew Bortolin must have watched each STAR WARS movie scores of times and spent countless hours in study, in rewriting, and in meditation to create this book, which is clearly a labor of love. Fortunately, Mr. Bortolin must have been drinking decaf throughout most of the writing process. His ability to tie sometimes unfamiliar Buddhist ideas to sometimes obscure incidents in the STAR WARS scripts is quite an accomplishment.Getting past the first chapter, we discover that THE DHARMA OF STAR WARS is a thoughtful, intelligent, well-written generalist explanation of basic Buddhist concepts. Bortolin uses well-chosen incidents from the STAR WARS films (and books) to colorfully illustrate and explain such Buddhist core concepts as Karma, Nirvana, meditation, Dharma, and the Five Aggregates (also known as the Five Conditions or Five Skandhas).Mr. Bortolin avoids using much \\"foreign\\" Buddhist terminology and doesn't reference the Heart Sutra or any of the other thousands of Buddhist writings. Far more importantly, he refuses to get lost in windy theoretical discussions. Sitting meditation (zazen) is referred to throughout as \\"sitting meditation.\\" \\"Monkey Mind\\" becomes \\"Jar Jar Mind\\" (very appropriately!). Let us thank the Maker that Bortolin isn't interested in being a Buddhist recruiter. Rather, he wants the reader unfamiliar with Buddhism to use its concepts and precepts in a practical fashion to live mindfully. If references to Luke, Leia, Darth, and The Force do it, that's just fine by him.The end of THE DHARMA OF STAR WARS has a section called \\"The Padawan's Handbook.\\" A collection of aphorisms, thoughts, affirmations, and Buddhist (and other) commentaries rewritten in the STAR WARS idiom, \\"The Padawan's Handbook\\" is an intelligent guidebook to issues confronting us all as human beings. Each line in \\"The Padawan's Handbook\\" is a meditation in and of itself.Perhaps Mr. Bortolin should consider expanding this section into an independent volume. And why hasn't George Lucas endorsed this project?Gassho, Mr. Bortolin, and I look forward to hearing from you again.FOUR AND A HALF STARS"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"This little gem of a book captures what many of us enjoyed most about the eastern spiritual subtext to the Star Wars Series.This was a long overdue addition to other published insights into the deeper levels of the Star Wars Series.It has also been used in several colleges in Philosophy 101 as an introduction to eastern thought and meditation.One need not be Buddhist to appreciate the author's keen grasp of esoterica mixed with jovial delivery.Katherine Rosengren"},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I just finished reading The Dharma of Star Wars. Before I procrastinate let me write a bit about this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this; a very engaging introduction to both Star Wars and Buddhism. Both are subjects that I was not very familiar with, so it was educational for me and others will likely learn from it as well. A recurring idea throughout the book is that we all have both good and evil in us. This idea is also found in the teachings of Christ as illustrated in Matthew 7:1-5 where Jesus talks about trying to remove a speck from another person's eye while you have an even bigger thing in your own eye. Another idea was that we are all simultaneously both victims and perpetrators of evil; which from my own observations, I would totally agree."},{"Title":"The Dharma of Star Wars","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my mother, a chaplain of many years, with twice that many devoted to the study of world religions. I am a Star Wars fan first and foremost, but this book touchs on so many levels that I felt compelled to get it for her. This book gets to the micro-makeup of our favorite Star Wars characters, why Darth Vader was following his path, why Obi-wan was found wanting.

It tells you how to use them, and lots of tips. It has a section on Perspective, something VERY nifty. No &quot;wrong&quot; stuff, and has a section on drawing people,( of course ) which is pretty good. And 2 Interviews with manga artists Takao Yaguchi and Toru Fujisawa.

However, I only gave this book 4 stars because...-It doesn't describe how to draw people very well. If you've mastered that (which I haven't), the book's fine.-It barely has any information on paneling.-The first few pages are colored digitally. A bit ironic that there are pages colored digitally in a book that gives instructions on how to draw traditionally, don't you think?Overall, if you're still a beginner, this book is not for you.

I have a few \\"how to draw manga\\" books but i gotta say that this book is by far the one that has motivated me to keep drawing Anime/manga.This book is divided in 6 parts(chapters).1.Interview2.Draw your own Manga: All the basics3.Lesson 1: Materials4.Lesson 2: Drawing Characters5.Lesson 3: special effects6.Lesson 4: Background.Part 2 tells u alot about materials and how to finish a draft while part#3 explains in more details all the materials you need and alot of variety you can and should use if you are serious about profesionaly final drafts. This chapter its very good because it gives u alot of insight on materials and how to take care of them!!!Part#4 Drawing Characters is very good as well for a beginner. The only thing is that it focus only on the body proportion, the face/head position and the eyes, of course. Nothing about ears, hands, feet, clothe, chibis,fairies, dragons, etc.Part#5 Special effects its all about what it says. Very good chapter and a lot of basic techniques to make your drawings look very cool.Part#6 Background. This chapter is more about \\"Perspective\\". There is no how to draw a Beach, Forest, Sky or any fancy background.Overall: Half of this book is informational and half Instructional.

So I guess it's good for me to tell you what this book really is and where its strength lies. This book isn't a gossipy account of interesting people; it isn't (only) an account of what KKR did. It's certainly not a moral debate of whether Henry Kravis is a 'Barbarian'. My opinion is that this is a book which seriously attempts to tell us what leverage buyout really is; and the mentioning of KKR, its deals, its organizational strucuture etc, merely (in a sense) serve as illustrative examples. In other words, I think despite the fact that the authors have very meticulous account of things about KKR, they have something else in mind: the 'leverage buyout story' instead of 'the KKR story'. This is the main difference between this book and others belonging to the same topic. So if you are serious about learning something about leverage buyouts, read on.The choice of topics and the quality of exposition of the book is truly unmatched by practically any business books I have ever read. That's the main reason behind the five stars. The analysis throughout, especially the middle chapters, is not yet, but close to academic. But wait, before destroying the online sales of the book by using the word 'academic', I must add that the usual attachment of being boring is absolutely absent. It is so well-written and you'll learn so much from the book that chapter 2 alone (or chp 3 or 4) is worth more than the price.Finally, to give you more information, this is not a book of pathbreaking insights. But who cares? Every new business book claims itself to be a revolution: the 'everything you previously know about xxx is wrong' kind of slogan. In an age awashed with the chic of being new, Geroge Baker offers the rare gem of simply 'putting things into the right perspective'. You want to know somthing about buyouts? Here you are, crystal clear exposition, abundant historical background, good examples, careful documentation, serious analysis, and, well, maybe a little bit of gossip afterall."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"This is an outstanding academic treatment of the investments made by KKR, all of which were some kind of leveraged buy-out. The authors focus their attention on the transactions themselves, not the way they were viewed by society or on the people that put them together - in this regard the book is a rare gem. It treats the period up to 1990 in some depth, with some very interesting case studies that show pretty good financial detail with outstanding qualitative descriptions of the transactions that were put together. As you walk through the various case studies, you are able to sit alongside with the KKR team and watch as the LBO goes from an unusual financial instrument to a mainstream product that is widely accepted in the marketplace. While growing acceptance of financial products is an established facet of Wall Street, to follow this evolution through the work of a single firm really is quite interesting. The manner in which the complexity, leverage and size of the transactions grow is laid out in plain English, making this a fascinating read.Only Chapter 5 \\"KKR as an Institutional Form\\" focused on the firm itself, and even this treatment was not nearly as obsequious as many other financial books (most notably \\"Goldman Sachs: the Culture of Success\\" by Endlich). Mr. Baker and Mr. Smith take a very level-headed approach and document the growth of the firm in a straight-forward manner, although they do inject a good deal of \`positivity' to their view, i.e. the revolutionary introduction of Monday Morning Meeting's at KKR in the 1990's (this is commonplace at most banks).I particularly enjoyed the second chapter \\"Recasting the Role of Debt\\" which talks about some of the earlier transactions that KKR did in some depth. The description of their LBO of Houdaille is very much worth reading, if only for the fact that traditional \`Old Economy' companies are again garnering such interest. Indeed, that is a very noteworthy aspect of the whole book, KKR focused on established companies with real cash flows. The one transaction which involved real growth financing was a near bust. This is very different than all of the financial maneuvering that has gone on over the past two years, and it is interesting to compare the sustainability of the two efforts (the many years of KKR's existence surely triumphs over venture capital's recent 15 minutes of fame). Chapter 4 on \\"When Risk Becomes Real\\" talks about some of the failed KKR transactions, EFB Trucking and Eaton Leonard in some detail. The reaction of KKR to these hiccups is very impressive, and while it is told with the same \`positivity' of the authors as mentioned above, the authors still do a good job of telling the story in an objective manner. The efforts of the partners to maintaining KKR's reputation in the marketplace is nothing short of heroic, and while there was a clear financial incentive over the short term it is clear that the longer term reputation of the company also played a clear role in motivating their actions.It really is rare to get a book as good as this with detailed financial information (even if it is more than 10 years old) and a mostly unbiased view of the Company. Where the authors are biased, it is easy to pick up and interpret. This is very much an academic treatment of the firm, with some detail as to what the rest of the market was doing, but not a whole lot. There are just the right number of graphs, which is very nice. I would think anybody working in finance would enjoy this book, although given the depth in which it describes the transactions, it might not be the most leisurely read. This is an outstanding book."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"This revealing book covers a highly charged and controversial period of American investment history. George P. Baker and George David Smith study the emergence of the investment house Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts (KKR), and follow it during the decade KKR ruled the world of leveraged buyouts. The authors begin with the early days when the partners worked together at Bear Stearns. They track the men as they build their own firm and create their own success. In clear, straightforward language, the book presents KKR's intentions and the economics of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). It discusses KKR's role in structuring and managing the deals. We [...] recommend this book as a must read for anyone interested in LBOs or the history of KKR. Executives at all levels will find the KKR saga interesting and useful."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"Very interesting and professionally written with significant technical aspects. Extremely useful to understand LBO's rationale and their key success factors."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"Although the text is written in a nearly academic tone which sometimes gets boring it contains the wealth of factual informatiion not available anywhere else. Full of details on deal structuring."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"I finished this book a year ago, and have referred to it numerous times since. That speaks volumes about both the authors and the subject matter. Chapter two (Recasting the Role of Debt) is by itself worth the price of admission. You will never again see corporate finance in the same light. The New Financial Capitalists is a wonderful addition to the financial layperson's library."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"If you're relatively new to the subject and want a good primer/introduction to LBOs, as well as some background history on the leveraged buyout and on KKR, this is a good read. It's reasonably quick and easy to read without being too dumbed down. I think that, among others, one group that would really benefit from reading this book are college students (or even MBA students) who are interested in eventually working in private equity but who don't currently know much about it.As a brief summary, this book includes:1) A discussion of the rationale for leveraged buyouts - from the standpoints of both the economics (to the buyer) and corporate governance (LBOs as one solution to the classic principal-agent problem)2) A history of KKR and of the leveraged buyout in general. It goes back to the founding of KKR and to very early LBOs.3) A discussion and brief analysis of a number of real world LBOs - both successful and failed. This is probably the most useful part of the book, as it gives you some feel as to the factors that can lead to a successful (or failed) LBO and helps you learn from some of the mistakes of the past.I was interested in the subject from the perspective of an equity analyst interested in identifying potential LBO targets. The book, naturally, doesn't provide a framework for identifying LBO targets (nor did I expect it to), but it was a very good introduction/primer on the subject that, when combined with other reading and research, helped me develop my own framework for identifying potential LBO candidates."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"KKR was the first name I heard while researching the Private Equity marketplace for a college paper. It also became the name heard mostly afterwards and rightfully so. Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts are obviously extremely smart and confident guys, fortunately the book exhibits moments of vulnerability; which is helpful for any financial entrepreneur. The only shortfall is that the book isn't longer. I was excited while reading some of the chapters, keep in mind that this is a finance book not the Lord of the Rings. This book is terrific. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"I bought this book to learn more about how to acquire and manage highly-leveraged companies.

I learned much that I know will be useful in my acquisitions."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"As a Wall Street investment banker, I found this to be an excellent look inside the fascinating world of LBO firms and investment banks.

It also provides good definitions of some of the technical terms. Towards the end of the book, specifically the last chapter, there is too much cheerleading."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"Baker and Smith have accomplished two objectives in their short book. On the surface, they have expertly captured the key elements in the development of KKR as the frontrunner of the LBO firm. However, on a deeper level, they have also captured many of the elements that managers and entrepreneurs should consider when running or starting a firm. In this regard, the Preface and Chapter Five are worth the price of admission. For anyone interested in the evolution and history of modern American finance, read this book."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"When I thought about buying this book, I was looking for several things. First, the technology of the private equity business--comprehensively discussed case studies of real buyouts, successful and failed. Second, the history of the business-I wanted to understand hidden laws and tendencies. Finally, I wanted to learn about other great players on the market.Well, I found all the above plus much, much more. What's more, it took me just two weeks to go through the book-the language and style are light and interesting."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"The book, The New Financial Capitalists, provides the reader with more than just a cynical rant of corporate America, management, corporate finance, and corporate restructuring. It is a refreshing read in that it offers the reader with a logical understanding of the problem(s) facing corporate America and the solutions provided by KKR - i.e. the LBO - which attempt to remedy the problem(s). The book is well worth the price."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"KKR is a truly unique institution. Are they merchant bankers, acting as fiduciaries in behalf of their clients? Or is it accurate to derisively call KKR takeover specialists, rapacious and always on the lookout for corporate prey? It is indeed difficult to pin a generic label on what KKR is doing--it depends on which side of the political fence you are in--but what we do know is that KKR is the acknowledged leader of the leveraged buyout, a branch of private equity investing which allows investors to profit from sizeable anomalies between a company's potential value and its current value, in part through the introduction of substantial levels of debt in a company's capital structure. As Baker and Smith explains: \\"By employing high levels of debt...they minimized the cost of buying the equity, which they shared with the target companies' managers. Assuming that the cash flows of the acquired businesses would be more than sufficient to repay the borrowing, [KKR's] success depended on a combination of timely debt reduction and the promotion of longer-term efficiency.\\"\\"The New Financial Capitalists\\" is by far one of the best books dealing with KKR and LBO finance in general. Apart from providing an inside track with regard to understanding the raison d'etre behind buyouts and their critical success factors, this book has a wealth of information regarding specific transactions led by KKR, of which the $31 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco is undoubtedly the most well-known. The authors conclude that LBOs and, by extension, the existence of private equity takeover specialists such as KKR, yield long-term benefits to the economy which are far in excess of the intermediate costs such as employee dislocation and onerous debt servicing.KKR sought to break new ground in enhancing shareholder value: it compelled investees to maintain a focused business strategy and to divest or spin off underperforming operations, and it was highly instrumental in making corporate America realize that capital is a scarce resource which must be judiciously employed. As an instrument of financial and managerial reform, KKR helped reconcile the interests of corporate managers and shareholders, by requiring senior executives to have a direct economic stake (i.e., become stockholders) in the companies they manage.The analysis of some of KKR's failures underscores that, by using leverage as its weapon of choice, KKR is in effect a high-wire act. However, the presence of debt in the capital structure is also extolled as a disciplining force for managers who have become used to high free cash flow levels and low debt. Thus, what KKR and other LBO practitioners are in effect saying is that a company's operating and investment decisions are not completely independent of its debt-equity ratio.This book deserves to be read because it is an absorbing study of leveraged takeovers seen through the lens of a pioneering firm."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"When in 1976 Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis, and George Roberts left Bear Stears to form KKR, Wall Street realized these three dealermakers might become a major force in the restructuring of American big business then beginning. What could not be predicted was the heights KKR would achieve. It has risen from the ranks of upstarts to become a major player in &quot;The New Establishment.&quot; While KKR has been the subject of other books and articles, none could be considered &quot;definitive,&quot; as is &quot;The New Financial Capitalists.&quot; It is more than a history of a bank, however. Baker and Smith have addressed the problem posed by the separation of ownership and management delineated in 1934 by Adolph Berle and Gardner Means in &quot;The Modern Corporation and Private Property,&quot; indicating how the leveraged buyout programs of the 1980s helped resolve it."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"BAker and Smith have a love affair with KKR. It's now wonder after reading this book. This book is easy to follow for beginners and rewarding to more seasoned LBO professionals. Baker does well to highlight the drivers of these dealmakers and their thought process without muddling it down with toomuch technical analysis."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"KKR was one of the major players during the LBO movement of the 1980s, and an understanding of that phenomenon is not possible without a knowledge of that company's history. Baker and Smith is not the first book on the subject, but it is by far the most important and revealing. In addition, the authors have dealt perceptively with the matter of the separation of ownership and control, which has concerns students of the American economy for the past half century and more. Highly recommended for anyone concerned with the subject."},{"Title":"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value","review":"A very education and interesting book. You will definitely learn about the LBO market.Don't expect to read anything negative about KKR. Of course, its nowhere near anything as self-gratifying as Eisner or Bloomberg's books.All in all, a good book."},{"Title":"The Fugitive: A Complete Episode Guide, 1963-1967 (Pci Collector Editions)","review":"Of the three books that have been published about &quot;The Fugitive&quot; television series (my favorite of all time), this one I would rate as the most flawed. &quot;The Fugitive Recaptured&quot; by Ed Robertson and &quot;The Official Fan's Guide to The Fugitive&quot; by Mel Proctor are both much better.Cooper's book is largely a series of summaries of each of the 120 episodes in the four-year series. The problem is that careless factual errors pop up again and again. And I am basing this on checking the summaries of only the 60-odd episodes (just slightly over half the total) that I'm familiar with. Who knows about the others!For example in Episode 27, &quot;Never Stop Running,&quot; the author doesn't even get the name right for the character played by Claude Akins. He said it was Jim, when in fact it was Ralph. In Episode 63, &quot;Crack in a Crystal Ball,&quot; in which a wife of a phony clairvoyant drives Kimble to a certain destination, Cooper says, &quot;She leads him (Kimble) to believe that she is in trouble and asks him for help....They arrive at the agreed-upon location, but Mrs. Mitchell tips off Kimble and he escapes before the police arrive.&quot; Wrong. She drove Kimble because she said she had a lead on the whereabouts of the one-armed man. SHE was the one doing the helping (or so she claimed). She also did not tip him off. She just dropped Kimble off and drove away. He learned about the trap from a friend on the phone.Sometimes the errors are small, but they still count as errors. In Episode 25, &quot;Taps for a Dead War,&quot; the book says, &quot;The police arrive. Joe and Millie hide Kimble in the house.&quot; I just saw that episode recently on video. In fact, he hides behind a tree outside.Perhaps the most egregious example of an inaccurate summary is Episode No. 53, &quot;The Survivors,&quot; (one of my favorites) in which Kimble secretly visits his financially troubled in-laws. The book first says Kimble wanted to help them find &quot;a savings passbook, part of his wife's effects.&quot; In fact, what he was looking for was any information recorded on paper about a forgotten bank account. Eventually they find some hand-written notes inside a regular book. Cooper also says that Kimble's father in law &quot;believes him innocent.&quot; Actually the father in law is uncertain.When asked about his opinion on Kimble's guilt, he says, &quot;I don't know.&quot; Also Cooper says that at the end of the story &quot;Mrs. Waverly (is) now thinking that perhaps Kimble is not guilty of murdering her daughter after all.&quot; There is no hint of this in the story. The ONLY reason Mrs. Waverly helped Kimble was because she was trying to heal her damaged relationship with her daughter.Another example: in Episode 14, &quot;The Girl From Little Egypt,&quot; a story that starts with a woman hitting Kimble with her car, the book says, &quot;When he awakes, Ruth sneaks him out of the hospital.&quot; Not true. They left openly together.I think John Cooper should do a second version of this book with the various errors corrected."},{"Title":"Who Will Rock the Cradle?: The Battle for Control of Child Care in America (Reprint)","review":"This book was so inspiring, it is a shame that this book is not on the best seller list.

Though I am sure many women doctors find it possible to juggle both, I knew that I wanted to be home for my children and that there was no way that I would put them in daycare.Then, after four children I found myself as a single mom with no support from their father. I was sure I was going to have to put them in daycare, but due to prayer and determination (knowing deep in my heart that daycare ruins children), I was able to make enough money tutoring and again my children were spared.All this determination was without reading this EYE OPENING book to the dangers and destruction of daycare in our society. I have seen the damage daycare (and simply not being with and bonding with their mother) with many children who are now needy and unable to bond properly as adults in marriage.Before a child is sent to be cared for outside the home, and away from his mother, the parent should be required to read this book.

This book by David Wilkerson takes no prisoners -- and that includes heresy hunters and \\"lukewarm\\" churchgoers (notice I didn't mention Christians). I believe one must be spirit-filled to fully agree with this book. The mood echoes that of a 20th century Jeremiah or Ezekiel -- and the finger of woe is pointed directly at America.I, for one, believe that America is in great danger. I do not claim to be a doomsday prophet; I take notice of the signs of the time. Yes, you don't have to be a spiritual giant to see that TV is immersed in total trash. The author wrote this book back in 1985, and television was bad enough then. Now, just about everything on the screen is coated with sensual sinfulness and dipped in blasphemy and arrogance. And TV has become an undeniable idol for this nation. Nothing at all glorifies God on the big screen (or the \\"Babylonian idiot box\\", as the author writes).Popular music and its artists bow down to the whims of society rather than to the Living God. I challenge anyone to dispute the fact that both music and television have slipped even further away from God since the 80's. Things have gotten worse dramatically since Elvis' 1950-ish gyrations -- now the hip-hop artists glamorize cop shootings and drunken orgies. Rock stars perform their shows under the influence of narcotics and intoxicants. The cross meanwhile is tattoed on their arms and worn around their necks. I've recently been to a so-called Christian concert and heard some of the bands that stood for Jesus. Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between Slayer and Pillar. It was all head-banging and moshing. The lead singer grunted and growled and wore ripped-up, grungy jeans. His body was covered with tattoos. If Jesus Christ was being glorified during the all the moshing and stage diving, I must have missed it.I say David Wilkerson is right on the money when he prophesies God will judge this nation for such foolishness and rebellion -- and most of all, for making a mockery of His name. Remember, God will not be mocked. Hosea 4:6 says that God's people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge. Very often I see some supposed \\"born-again\\" Christian artist get on television and sing for Jesus in a video. But I notice the cherry-red lipstick and seductive eye liner and I see her strike lewd glances at the camera and blow kisses, and I say \\"Wait a minute! Isn't this supposed supposed to be all about Jesus? Why then do I need to see all the close-ups on her pretty face and slender physique?\\" That, to me, is a stumbling block for young men. All I see is cleavage, muscles and hair gel. Just insert \\"God\\" in the lyrics or a \\"thank-you, Jesus\\" and the artist becomes an instant Christian role model for some kid.And as for Russia destroying America...it's not too late. It's never too late for stuff like that to happen. Cold War, Shmold War. All the reviewers here who automatically labeled the author of this book a false prophet when the USSR became the Russian Federation ought not to jump the gun. Ever heard of Gog and Magog? Read the book of Daniel. Remember, nobody knows the day or hour. It could happen tomorrow, or in another 500 years.All in all, Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth is an unpopular warning to all America, a warning of God's condemnation and subsequent punishment for all her harlotries. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God will obliterate our society (in one hour) by virtue of a Russian nuclear assault (hydrogen holocaust).Take it or leave it. I choose to take it, and cling to holiness. However it happens, we know this world will pass away according to Revelation, and tribulation is unavoidable. If you're washed in the blood of Jesus Christ none of it should matter anyhow. Books like this one, after all, are geared towards the unrepentant sinner and unsaved."},{"Title":"Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth","review":"This book greatly assisted me in further delivery from the world system.

For example, he goes into a discussion about television and it's impact on our society and us as Christians. After reading that section you'll want to put your TV out curbside on garbage day. He also talks about God's pending judgement on America and quotes scripture that talks of destruction (as in wiped off the face of the Earth). After reading that section you'll be on your knees praying for our country and that God will turn things around. Certain areas of the book focus on what pastors need to do, however the information contained in these sections is applicable to all of us (e.g., being lukewarm Christians, focusing on things that don't really matter, being more concerned about the buildings that we worship in than evangalising, etc.) The main premise of the book is to call Christians to action, to get off the fence and to do the things that Jesus wants us to do.

Those who like to criticize his prophetic books are hiding their heads in the sand! The scriptures back up his statements plus current world events are validating his them. The tests of true prophecy are 1. Is it scriptural? and 2. Does it come to pass? His writings pass both tests.

I hoped that it would be a follow-up to Wilkerson's book, The Vision - I was disappointed. Although a call to holiness is good (it will produce a wonderful and peaceful life), it is Jesus' holiness and righteousness bought with His precious blood that covers the Church - not our performance. No one is going to get any approval from God through performance (e.g., constant repentings, altar calls, tithes, fastings, prayer marathons, and other gimmicks - too many to mention here). It is trusting and (get this)BELIEVING that the blood (and nothing else) is enough. Through Grace we no longer act from fear and liability but from love and responsibility. We evangelical Christians need to forget about the old testament and move into the new one if we are going to convince others that our Jesus is &quot;The Real Deal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth","review":"It's amazing how wretched a person becomes after making previous false prophecies (The Vision), and not being repentant of them.Wilkerson in this book takes so many OT prophecies of judgment, and applies them to America who he says will be destroyed in a nuclear holocoust. He takes OT (and NT) prophecy after prophecy after prophecy out of context and constantly applies them to America. He see's America as Babylon (as many do, but well as bad as America is, it's not sound doctrine.)This book has a great call to holiness...however as much as I believe in holiness, Wilkerson goes beyond holiness to straight out legalism. Wilkerson somehow ends up mixing this &quot;book of prophecy&quot; that he has written with his opinion.He tries to show folks that all Christians who watch any tv (or even own one) are idolaters (and indeed, it is an idol to some), and that all rock music (and I do mean all) is satanic, and is straight from Hell. And remember, Wilkerson wrote this book quite a few years ago, when TV had some decent programming on it. Remember show's on TGIF (on ABC) like &quot;Full House&quot; or &quot;Family Matters&quot; (that show with Steve Erkel). I guess all those shows were and are abominations.Of course, false prophets &amp; legalist often seem to forget the truth that is taught in the scriptures...sanctify all things by means of the Word of God, and prayer...Wilkerson- like in his other books, is above accountability. He has the &quot;I don't care what you say, this is what God says&quot; attitude. Granted, I believe in the authority of geniune prophecy, and modern prophets that still speak &quot;thus says the Lord...&quot;, but none are above accountability. Wilkerson says some very good things, but in his books he makes it clear that he will not hear anything against what he says is the word of the Lord, even though it is him speaking- not the Lord.If you are like me, you will have a difficult time getting past half way in this book, it's just so crammed with false doctrine it's sad. Mature Christians will probably find their spirits grieved after reading this book."},{"Title":"Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth","review":"From a European point of view it is interesting to see how American Christianity tries to deal with its weaknesses and sins. For over a century many of the world most influential revivals and missionary movements have originated in the US. The results are the salvation, healing and discipling of literally millions across its borders. One just has to wonder what the world would have looked like without the American Christians who no doubt have many weaknesses and sins. Just like anywhere else in the world and in church history, by the way. The main question is: How does God deal with the sins of his people? Does He first save them by grace, then tell them to deal with all their sins as quickly as possible and if his patience runs out, pours out his anger? I don't see that in Scripture where God's patience is said to be a powerful agent for change for the better. This is what Romans 2:4. speaks about. I can testify to this truth in my own life (almost 27 years born again now) and in the lives of many children of God around me. If this is how God deals with individuals it follows that He does the same with groups of individuals in just the same way, including the United States of America.God has been developing his Church worldwide for 20 centuries now. Simple statistics prove it. Anyone knowing church history will confirm it. Yes there may be temporary setbacks like in the book of Judges, but the overall line is one that goes up and not one that goes down.God loves America, just like He loves the Netherlands (where I am from), Belgium, Germany, Russia you name it. Predictions about a nation's future first need to be held against the light of the Gospel, especially the nature of God as revealed in Scripture, to prove their validity.Is God going to destroy America? No. Neither is He going to destroy the Netherlands, England, Russia. Instead He will continue to call and empower people to set the nations free, i.e. the people who will not allow themselves to be discouraged by books that are contrary to the nature and plan of God in this era of the New Covenant."},{"Title":"Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth","review":"Throw rational thinking right out the window if you want to like anything Wilkerson writes these days. After reading his earlier book, &quot;the Vision,&quot; you'd think he'd have learned that his ability to prophesy the future was non-existent. But no, having learned nothing from the errors he made there, he's back to try again. This time he tells us that America will soon (note: he wrote this book in 1985) be destroyed by a nuclear attack by Russia. He then goes on to decry such evils as watching TV and listening to Christian rock music, twisting logic and scripture to such a degree that I doubt God Himself could recognize it if he read this book. Wilkerson used to be a rational thinker, more focussed on ministering to addicts and gang members. Now all he cares about it making one false prophecy after another, seemingly without the shred of honesty he would need to know that they aren't coming true."},{"Title":"The golden warrior: The story of Harold and William","review":"There are a lot of dates that every well educated person knows and, at some point, we actually learned what happened and why they were important: 1492--Columbus sailed the ocean blue; 1620--Pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock; 1776--Declaration of Independence; 1929-Great Crash. There are also plenty of historic events that you think you know something about, but what you know is totally wrong (see my essay on David vs. Goliath). But then there are those dates and names and phrases that you pick up as you go along without ever even having a mild clue what they mean or exactly what they reference. Here's one: 1066. Yeah, I know. You recognize the year. You may even remember that it was the year of the Norman Invasion. If you got that far, you might remember that William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings and took over Britain. But I was a History major and I sure as heck couldn't tell you any of the details. Actually, I couldn't even remember who his opponent was and I sure couldn't remember why he had a claim to the throne.So I was enormously intrigued when, several years ago now, I saw a reference to The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz as, \\"the greatest historical novel ever written\\". As is the way with such things. I promptly saw two or three other mentions of this book which I had previously never heard of before. I looked it up on Amazon and couldn't find it. I even tried Amazon UK, but no luck. Then one day at a local booksale, I found a copy. It still has most of the dust jacket intact and the cover blurbs are by the great British historian G.M. Trevelyan and the novelist Vita Sackville-West. I don't know if Muntz knew him personally, I actually haven't been able to find any information about her, but her dedication is to Winston Churchill. All the bells and whistles are here; it seems like it must have been a significant book when it was published. I have no idea why it is out of print. (The link above will take you to a book dealer website where you can find copies ranging in price from a few dollars to $15 or $20.) Now, after reading it, I am even more mystified.First of all, the true historical material that Muntz had to work with is really interesting. As the story opens, King Edward the Confessor sits upon the throne of England. William (...), of Normandy, has just helped him drive off Godwin and his sons. Godwin, a descendant of King Canute, is one of the most powerful noblemen in the land. His daughter Edith is Edward's Queen. Eventually, Godwin and his sons return and though Godwin dies, his son Harold appears likely to become king, as Edith has chosen to lead a cloistered life rather than produce an heir. Meanwhile, William lusts for the throne himself and rests his claim to it on a promise that Edward made years earlier. So it is Harold's great misfortune when he is shipwrecked on the coast of France and William secures possession of him. The two get along famously, but William will not release Harold until he promises to support William's claim to the throne upon Edward's death. Harold swears this oath and leaves his own brother as hostage. This infuriates his other brothers, upon his return to England, and is one of the precipitating factors in his eventual falling out with his hot headed brother Tosti.When Edward dies (January 5, 1066), Harold, who is the most popular man in the kingdom, renounces his oath as having been secured under duress and he takes the throne. The Pope rules in William's favor and the Normans mount an invasion with Rome's blessing. Tosti, with the help of the Norwegian King Harald Sigurdson, attacks from the north and takes York. But Harold defeats them at the battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25th. He then has to wheel south, with a badly damaged army, and march to meet William. On October 14, 1066, William deafeats him in the Battle of Hastings and becomes King of England.The author does this story proud. She wields a light hand in judging the motives and actions of the characters. Both Harold and William come across as great men. If we root for Harold, it is because he seems the better person and true patriot, even while he shares William's tremendous ambition. Muntz tells the story in episodes. Each chapter is headed Of... (Of Harold and Tosti, Of the Fight at Stamford Bridge, etc.), which, combined with judicious use of archaic language, conveys the feeling that one is reading one of the ancient sagas. She manages to retain the sense that this is fundamentally a tale that is close to a thousand years old, yet keep the telling modern enough to appeal to the contemporary reader.This is a really fine novel (though probably not the best historical novel ever written) and will amply reward the effort necessary to seek it out."},{"Title":"The golden warrior: The story of Harold and William","review":"I reviewed this book once some time back but amazon apparently cleared it off so the original text is now lost. Still, Hope Muntz' tale of Harold and William and their epic tug-of-war for the throne of England which ended in the bloody Battle of Hastings in 1066 is worth writing about again. I'm a lover of historical fiction and have never found any book in that vein better than this one. Written in a terse saga-style which evokes the original time and place of the events recounted, THE GOLDEN WARRIOR offers a time-warp experience which puts us directly in the medieval world on the eve of the final fall of the last of the English kings. Some have found the style of the text a bit off-putting and distant in its early stage but I have never found anyone who, once having read beyond the cool, objective saga-like beginning, has failed to admire the book at the end.If there are failings, and there are, they revolve around Muntz' portrayal of Harold, Earl of Wessex and later King of the English, as a man who is almost too good, too perfect to be believed. And yet he is vividly brought to life here, along with an entire cast of brilliantly rendered folk including his beloved common-law wife, Edith Swan Neck, and his relentless rival and, finally, foe, William of Normandy. In fact it is William who seems more fully shaped, though Harold, in the end, is the one we cry for. And cry we do, or at least I did, finding tears on my cheeks when I came to the final battle . . . and this more than once. There are not many books, I think, which can do this but here is one which does it over and over again.For those who love historical fiction, especially set in medieval England, and for those who admire the old sagas or tales of vikings and such, this book is to be sought and treasured. But it is less an adventure than a tale of real people in serious times. The fall of Harold has never been better told than in this veritable English Iliad and I cannot urge it strongly enough. But if you've already read it or if you have no luck in finding it, you might try another which, while not quite as good (I regret to admit) may also be of interest to readers of this one. It's THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA by Stuart W. Mirsky, also available on-line and currently in print.

The only copy I was able to obtainwas dog-earred with many pages coming loose from the binding. It had obviously been a classroom textbook in earlier days as there were underlinings and pencil comments in a schoolgirl hand all over the margins. I actually found these \\"annotations\\" helpful in clarifying some historical references which I would otherwise not have understood. Even absent such helps, however, I would have loved this great history of the Norman invasion and the life-or-death conflict between two men of destiny. The thing about historical novels is that the reader already knows \\"how it will come out.\\" Interest derives from how able the author is to make past events and long dead people come to life. Ms. Muntz succeeds brilliantly. Even though I knew who the ultimate victor would be here, I still read with avid interest as the story unfolded and found myself rooting for King Harold, knowing full well that he would be vanquished in the end. The tone here is reverent and somber - perfect to establish the mood of impending tragedy and the loss of the old Saxon England. I don't know if Muntz's depiction of the psychology of William and Harold is accurate - how could anyone know the true character of people who lived 1,000 years ago? - but she does a masterful job of bringing these men, their ambitions, their fears and their humanity to vivid life. The dignified writing style and measured pace of the language is hypnotic. There are no flowery flights of descriptive prose here, yet the very austerity of the writing captures the feeling of the time. As with most excellent historical fiction, I was intrigued to learn more about the participants in this pivotal time in Britain's history and have found wonderful resources on the Internet.

The style is basic without elaborating, which left me wanting more, but the story is clearly and succinctly told and compelling enough to keep the reader (or me, at least) engaged and wanting to find out what happens next.

However, upon his return he learned that another man, Dr. Cook, was claiming that he had reached the North Pole nearly a year earlier.This book was very well written and engaging. It was written in a storytelling fashion rather than a dry recitation of facts and details. Since reading the book I have been reading about the controversy of who reached the North Pole first, which I find to be fascinating. This is a quick read, one I think teenagers could enjoy.

Professor Tauger empirically examines all environmental and human factors causing one of the most studied - and misrepresented - human catastrophes of the 20th century. The \\"Holodomor\\" has become politicized as nationalist mythology, and questioning this near-divine truth has now become an actionable crime in The Ukraine. Yet to smear Professor Tauger's short but thorough study as another form of \\"Holocaust denial\\" merely shows the shaky basis for an official dogma as narrow-minded as Stalin's \\"Five Year Plan in Four.\\" Natural disaster in the form of drought, unseasonal rains, pests and rot would have produced famine or near-famine conditions anyway; the haste, waste and mismanagement of the early kolkhoz system - combined with an uncoordinated but self-destructive peasant backlash - guaranteed it. A useful corrective to the propaganda now claiming hold as orthodox \\"history\\", but unfortunately one shunted to the sidelines in favor of politically correct mythology.Note: This title is still directly available from the publisher."},{"Title":"Natural disaster and human actions in the Soviet famine of 1931-1933 (The Carl Beck papers in Russian & East European studies)","review":"This is without a doubt the most thorough analysis of the causes of crop failure in the harvest of 1932 which led to the famine that killed about 2.5 million Ukrainians and another couple million non-Ukrainians. Cold War propaganda has long-maintained that the crop of 1932 was perfectly adequate to feed people and that famine only occurred because of the exports of food. This line has been further advanced by willfully distorting the facts about what was exported and when. In fact, most of the grain exported in 1933 (about five-sixths of the total) was exported after the 1933 crop was in at a time when the famine was essentially over. Yet hoaxers like James Mace and Robert Conquest used to imply that most of this was exported during the time of famine in an effort to suggest that the famine could have been almost entirely avoided if only such exports had not been done. In reality, actual crop failure was the principal source of the famine. The Soviet government can be charged with having underestimated the extent of the problem as a case of real crop failure. But most of the charges circulating claiming that the famine was deliberately conjured up in an effort to destroy \\"Ukrainian nationalism\\" are without foundation.Tauger here provides a clear analysis on how and why the crop failure of 1932 occurred. He discusses a myriad of causes, the most important of which was plant rust. Rustic plant diseases had the capacity to reduce the quantity of grain growing within an individual stalk, while the stalks themselves grew and hence created the appearance of an abundant crop. This was what fed the rumors of a plentiful crop and consequently the paranoia that someone (kulaks, communists, etc.) had taken the crops away and thereby created the famine \\"artificially.\\" As Tauger establishes in detail, the famine was in no way artificial but was the result of an actual natural disaster. That natural disaster was then aggravated by the human failure to identify natural disaster as the root cause and to see that only massive imports of food from abroad could reduce the famine.Tauger's work is representative of the real benefits which have come from opening up many archives from the old Soviet files. It's unfortunate that many people hold to the misconception that THE BLACK BOOK OF COMMUNISM is representative of what the archives have revealed. In fact THE BLACK BOOK simply repeats Cold War versions which were already being debunked by the newly opened archives at the time THE BLACK BOOK was published. Studying Tauger's work will give people a better grasp of what the archives have actually shown."},{"Title":"Peony.","review":"I hadn't read anything from Pearl S.

The book is good, well-written, and enjoyable to read. I only wish that one of the points of tension had been something else - or that the family had been something besides Jewish. One of the major points of tension was whether or not David, the son of the family, would be able to take Peony as his concubine or as his second wife. Had the answer been that he could not take her as his second wife because she was a Gentile, it would have been accurate. However, David makes the statement, \\"In my religion - the religion, that is, of my people - a man is allowed only one wife.\\" That is not accurate. It is not known through the course of the story whether the family follows the Ashkenaz tradition or the Sephard, but it does not really matter as they are not living in Ashkenaz and, therefore, the One Wife Ruling does not apply. The One Wife Ruling was only for Ashkenazim living among Christians! Should one return to the Holy Land (prior to the re-establishment of Israel) or otherwise leave the lands of the Christians, the Rule no longer applied as long as both parties were in agreement.

Based on true events, the novel chronicles the life of Peony, a bondmaid who was sold to a wealthy Chinese/Jewish family. &quot;Peony&quot; can be considered a work of historical fiction, as Ms. Buck's excellent research provides accurate and extremely interesting information on Jews in China.The story takes place over a century ago in K'aifeng, the home of the largest Jewish colony in China. At the time, Jews were rapidly assimilating into Chinese society and culture, and losing their Jewish identity. &quot;Peony&quot; tells the story of one particularly prominent Jewish family through the eyes of the ethnic Chinese bondmaid, and how the problem of assimilation effects each family member individually. The topic - Jewish identity in China - is fascinating and not commonly discussed.Ms. Buck's amazing ability to create depth of character is in strong evidence in &quot;Peony,&quot; and all of the characters are extremely well developed and realistic. While the story incorporates a historic element, it also includes interesting subplots of unrequited love, familial strife, and the age-old Chinese (and Jewish) concept of filial duty and respect.This book is indicative of Pearl Buck's genius and gift for storytelling. Ms. Buck doesn't need to resort to hyperbole to get her point across - the words are carefully chosen and the story is beautifully constructed. Her writing style is gorgeous and evocative. The author's famous love for China and its many cultures is evident in her delicate prose - she treats the characters and the plot with utmost respect and historical accuracy.

She succeeds brilliantly in making the speech patterns of each character suit their role.The story is wide-ranging, from inside the walls of a Chinese-Jewish household with its extended family and servants, all the way to the Manchu court of the Western Empress Tzu Hsi. The story of the Jews in China is well-told and interesting.And of course Pearl Buck is first and foremost a wonderful story teller.

The title, the topic and Buck's reputation helped me decide to read it. I am so glad that I did.Other reviewers have told of the understated, beautiful use of language. They have spoken of the interesting juxtaposition of the Jewish and Chinese cultures, the gentleness of the story, and Buck's decision not to satisfy our need for a Hollywood ending.All of these wonderful aspects allowed me to focus on other layers of the novel. The fact that the Jewish community in Kaifeng eventually allowed themselves to forget their own culture was fascinating. Their acceptance of and integration into the Chinese culture is portrayed as inexorable. Most slipped away easily; others faced the loss with overwhelming grief. Buck describes the Chinese characters in this book as being accepting of others while being a bit hedonistic themselves. They choose to seek pleasure and temporal fullfillment while the Jews focus on the horror of oppression, complex ritual and the absolute truth of their history and destiny. In other words, it seemed that the Jews were willing to give up their faith because it was difficult to maintain personally and for the community as a whole.The final destruction of the core of the Jewish community is, ironically, a product of being a \\"chosen people.\\" Kao Lien (a business associate of the Ezra family) tells David ben Ezra (Peony's young master) that the Jews, \\"were hated because they separated themselves from the rest of mankind. They called themselves chosen of God.\\" This is David's first inkling that the world has alternate views of the Jewish people. This is a pivotable moment in the novel. This conversation gives David enough distance from his own culture to allow him to choose a Chinese wife and to move farther from the religion of his mother. Because he chooses not to become a leader of the Jews in his city, the Temple and the culture eventually fall into ruin.More than most novels, this one is a rare combination of attributes. It is entertaining, informative, thought provoking and good literature.

My ancestry is from Spain and I clearly found some Jewish roots in my mothers' anscestors. And so, this book offered some answers to questions that I've always had in the back of my mind. In the end, you'll learn that, today, we are a world of diverse peoples' who must work together lovingly and happily. There is a great love story intertwined in this wonderful novel, too. it was a great reminder of how the peoples of our past have blood-lined the present populations while we will, henceforth, be a part of future generations."},{"Title":"Peony.","review":"This is a wonderful story with well-drawn characters the reader can empathize with. When reading, you feel as if you have been picked up and plopped down in China, in the middle of this Chinese/Jewish household. I wanted it to go on forever. This book is profoundly sad and profoundly joyful at the same time, while also being interesting and informative. I was never before aware of Jews in China and now have a jumping-off point from which to do some research. Fascinating! The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was how quickly the end of the story came; near the finish of the book, the years pass too fast and everything is wound up. Mrs. Buck does not give us a \\"Hollywood\\" ending, however. She was a tremendously gifted storyteller, and I so look forward to reading her other works."},{"Title":"Peony.","review":"Peony is a book of great detail and drama. You could picture every scene and action that each character takes with the descriptive words written by Pearl S. Buck.Peony has been a bondmaid in the House of Ezra all her life.

Due to traditions it is forbidden for Peony and David to wed. Now during the years as a servant by David's side Peony must try to resolve her love for him.Peony is a realistic fiction book that is full of tragedy and despair that keeps drawing you in with each chapter and page you turn.

The book is rather small -- no long, drawn-out story, but it communicates the story well, with a beautiful sort of grace.I felt I understood the culture better, and the characters were very real to me. Their story was touching. The ending, which is the type which normally would leave me feeling dissatisfied, did not. It's not the perfectly happy, romantical type ending, which I normally like, but instead it shows that even when the fairy tale does NOT come true, life can be blessed and well worth living.My children will read this one for sure."},{"Title":"Peony.","review":"Pearl S. Buck's \\"Peony\\" is a lovely story that both touched me and informed me about an era of history of which I was unaware. The copy I found was a hardback published by the John Day Company in 1948; so I'm glad to see the story is currently in print. The story is an episodic tale that covers a number of years. Peony is a bondmaid that is apparently a well-treated slave. Buck's text discusses how her owners have the right to sell her, even separate spouses. Peony was sold by her parents as a baby and raised in one of the few Jewish households in China. As the Jewish families have blended with the Chinese, their Jewish identify has become less pure, eventually resulting in the abandonment of Judaism for Chinese philosophy. As Buck traces this, it is due to the welcoming nature of the Chinese whereas Jews in other parts of the world were separated and shunned. Through the wise Chinese merchant character of Kung Chen, Buck indicates that this is due to their own philosophy that theirs in the only God, which encourages their separation. The unrequited love of Peony for her master David and his development as he grows is quite beautiful. When Buck changes gears with the violence in Chapter VII, it happens so swiftly and abruptly that I felt literally stunned as a reader, unable to believe it had happened, much as one probably feels in life after a tragedy. As the story unfolds with David's marriage, the trip to Peking and the consequences of that visit, I found the ending strangely peaceful as Peony's love for David turns to a universal love for mankind. Peony is a masterful work 60 years after it was first published. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Peony.","review":"I have not read this e-book at the present time.I anticipate loving the book.

While we see the assimilation, we have no sense of why it is happening just at the time of the novel.

One thing leads to another, and, of course, Nancy saves the day once again, not excepting an offered reward. This, like many of the later re-writes in the 70's, is dull, lifeless, and stale. The writing is bland and there is no charector development whatsover. I have read every yellow-spined Nancy and have to say that about only half the set is any good. If you possibly can, try to read the originals written by Mildred Wirt during the 30's and 40's....the golden-age of Nancy Drew, although (most) of the revised and later ones are not bad (some of them classics), the originals are the best...."},{"Title":"The Clue in the Crumbling Wall (Nancy Drew, Book 22)","review":"\\"The Clue in the Crumbling Wall\\" features Nancy, Bess, and George on the trail of another exciting mystery.

Resourceful Nancy finds a way to escape and to free Hannah, and sets off on a re-invigorated search for the criminals.River Heights, Nancy's hometown, is the scene of this mystery, and as usual, Nancy, her father Carson Drew, and her chums, cousins Bess and George use common sense as well as a little uncommon intuition to solve the mystery and to bring a happy ending to the victims.

When I started reading this outstanding book I couldn't stop because visions formed in my mind. It was so descriptive and creative. Also, the author used similes, metaphors, hyperboles and personification. I was amazed at how realistic it was. This story is even descriptive enough to be able to be read more than once. I definitely loved reading The Clue of the Crumbling Wall because everything came to life and this is only one of the very many other great Nancy Drews I read. The story is about, smart as a genius, Nancy Drew, the main hero in the book. Her friends, cautious Bess, curious George, and of course her caring father. They have to find the missing dancer, Juliana. They also go through hard times, being traped, and much more. They find tons of treasures including a huge one.

Desperately wanting to help a poor little girl and her sick mother, Nancy races against time to locate the woman's missing sister. The missing woman, named Florianna in the original version and Julianna in the revised edition, was a talented dancer who disappeared many years before while engaged to a wealthy businessman. Before the man died, he willed to Florianna/Julianna his large estate, Heath Castle, with the stipulation that if she doesn't come forward to claim the estate within a certain amount of time, it is to be turned over to the county for a park. Nancy now has only three weeks to find the missing heiress, but her efforts are being thwarted by a group of men who have apparently been searching the now overgrown estate looking for something. This book is easily one of the ten best of the set, at least the original version is, I never read the revised edition and, although the books tell the same story, the revised editions lack the vibrant writing which characterizes many of the originals. The mystery is interesting and the book moves along at a good pace. I particularly enjoyed the book from about pages 70-100 in the original volume. At this point, Nancy, Bess and George have gone to Heath Castle to investigate, they become separated and each one has her own adventure.

I enjoyed the format and the author's writing style. I had previously tried to read other books, including the text of A Course In Miracles itself, and found them very technical and hard to understand.Many people would define this book as \\"New Age\\". I found it to be pretty down to earth, describing a philosophy or a way of thinking that could be used in whole or in part no matter what your religious beliefs. The author asks you to merely consider the ideas she presents, to try them on and see if they ring true for you and fit what you want for your life.The book is only just over 100 pages, but it really is a great introduction. The back of the book includes web sites for ACIM and a list of recommended ACIM authors and their books.I may adopt some of the ACIM ways of thinking...or I may not...but I can tell you that I felt sooo good, sooo calm and peaceful and filled with an experience of God's love for me after reading this book. I read it two days ago, underlined and highlighted much of it, and then read it again really slowly today, just to let it sink in deeper.If you are a seeker looking to explore a different way of thinking than what you currently have, you will probably like it. If you aren't really open to new ideas, then the \\"10 Radiant Ideas\\" won't be too attractive to you. Nevertheless, I think it's a great book, and the author succeeded at her goal: to explain ACIM to someone totally unfamiliar with it, and to do it in a way that gives the reader a real sense of what it might be like to believe in this way.*****"},{"Title":"10 Radiant Ideas (Big Heart Miracles Study Guide, 1)","review":"This author sounds like a modern day saint. They have all been peaceful and uplifting. They weren't killers. This is along those lines. People may say Jesus was angry when he overturned the money changers and scorned the Pharisees, but he TOLD US TO LOVE EACH OTHER AND LOVE OUR ENEMIES. Hate to use capitals but the occasion is fitting if anything deserves capital letters. This woman is a saint. Jesus also told us to NOT HARM EVEN OUR ENEMIES BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE SATAN. Karen Bentley is right on line with that gospel request also. To me Karen Bentley is doing exactly what we're all supposed to do. Good Book Karen. She believes in Jesus Christ. Jesus also said there would be greater ones even after him who CARRIED OUT his messages or requests for humanity to follow. Do you really think he meant they would be greater, richer, more powerful or maybe, just maybe he meant they would be the sheep who didn't fight back, JUST LIKE HE TOLD US TO DO if we want to follow him.

Ethan's wife was a very miserable woman and it seemed to me that she was only happy when other people were more miserable than she. She was sick and dying when everyone else was healthy and capable, when Ethan and Matty were injured then she took charge and took care of them, a little too unrealistic for me that she would take care of her husband and the woman she thought he wanted.

If this tragic ending had happened to characters I felt attached to or involved with, I would have been so moved, but I wasn't. I liked the book, but I didn't &quot;love&quot; it. I didn't get involved in it. That's what I look for in a book."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Wharton's 'countryside' and 'cold' novel, is both a place to start and a place to reflect on her literary gift. Ethan Frome is not a statement or vision of the lives of American and European society, its excesses and its tragedies, this is American tragedy before automobiles and refrigerators, it is sexual and Puritanical- but unforgettable. This tale of adultury and the nature of the impossibly unhappy and ruthless female is one that I feel I am constantly reminded of. (Yes, I am a premier example.) That kindness is often 'accidental' and completely circumstantial is only exceeded by the knowledge that sexual love is the briefest and most likely to reverse its attraction. The book is also a statement about being an invalid and thus a master of those who must keep you. This is a story of plain people, people with little but their desires and the pleasures- like sledding- and youth that are free and short-lived. It is a spectacular irony and lesson in attachment for survival, for lust and for hatred. A complex and multileveled gem that is incredibly spare and complete. She was quite a lady."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction. People can fall in love, but rarely do things turn out well.But but few of even her books can evoke the feeling of \\"Ethan Frome,\\" whick packs plenty of emotion, vibrancy and regrets into a short novella. While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality. Not a stereotypical shrew.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a true tragedy -- as beautifully written as it is, it's still Wharton's description of how a man merely survives instead of living, hopeless and devastated."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a farmer in Starkfield, Massachusetts, at the beginning of the 20th century. He is unhappily married to Zenobia (Zeena), a suspicious, hypochondriac, bitter, narrow-minded, ignorant and discontented woman. He is strongly attracted to Zeena's cousin Mattie Silver who shares their household and is entrusted with all the chores which Zeena refuses to do. Ethan's tragic fate begins when Zeena peremptorily decides that they need a \\"hired girl\\" which would of course imply Mattie's departure since the Fromes don't have the means to employ two girls.A novel of great intensity with its slow developing tragedy and characters plunging towards their destiny. The author's masterful economy of language vividly renders the oppressive \\"silent ache\\" that permanently hinders communication between Ethan and Zeena. The vision of the three main characters is done in an almost cinematic way as they are trapped indoors in the severe Massachusetts winter. The narrative pattern is original too since the whole plot is told by an unnamed narrator who met the taciturn Ethan many years after the events he is about to tell us. The reader has moments of doubt when the narrator tells a story in all details and long passages of dialogue he could not possibly have known or heard during his meeting with Ethan. But Edith Wharton's extraordinary craft makes the story break away from the contingencies of the frame and it comes to moving life for the reader. A superb novel, one of the finest and most intense narratives in the history of American literature."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is one of the best novels I have ever read. It is about an unsuccessful Massachusetts farmer named Ethan Frome, who has a smashed-up face, and is quiet and unsociable. Frome is married to Zeena, who is ill with kidney problems, and is crabby and tyrannical. The plot twists when Mattie, Zeena's cousin, moves in with the Fromes. Ethan and Mattie fall in love with each other, but keep it a secret, mainly because of the harshness of society. Ethan would have gone off with Mattie if it hadn't been for the following three reasons: (a)he is poor, (b)he feels compassion toward his sick wife, and (c)he feels he owes his wife because she cared for his parents before they died. The plot twists again when Zeena comes home from a visit with her new doctor and says she has hired a new 'maid' and Mattie would need to move out. When Ethan and Mattie head to the train station, they stop to sled at a special spot. Mattie broke down and admitted she would rather they die with him than be separated from him, so she suggests they go down the hill again and sled into a giant elm tree. They do that and end up in pain and broken at the end of the novel. Mattie at the Frome's home and Ethan at the minister's place. I recommend this novel for a reader who is interested in twisted romance and can understand the symbolism in the story."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Don't read this one if you're looking for a happy ending. Luckily, I knew ahead of time that it was comparable to a Greek tragedy. I probably wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been such a short book (99 pages). But, I figured that I could easily give up such a small amount of time for a classic. I enjoyed Edith Wharton's writing style, and will probably read more of her works."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Half romance, half psychological horror story. Has an unexpected, unusual ending. Ethan Frome's wife is the wicked soul-destroying villain I'll never forget. Definitely not for the reader who is in the middle of a depression. Author has great powers of description and tension building skill."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton's \\"Ethan Frome\\", is a wonderful book and can be read with little effort. The story, which takes place in early 20th century, is based indirectly on a man's inability to achieve success-in spite of the number of hardships he is faced with through his young life. However on the surface, the book is directly based on the same man's infatuation with a young woman. Thus the plot. The style in which Edith Wharton uses is at times direct, simplistic in nature, and at other times technical-leaving the reader yearning for more depth and imagery. The reader is also left with some insight onto how this story may have come about. Midway through, the story scantly begins to resemble a dairy entry. Though based on somewhat actual events, the story is written as a diary entry with underdeveloped dialogue and character depth. Edith Wharton does however do a great job of transitioning from one story's layer to another.Personal Insights:I have had this book in my collection for 12yrs and only until recently decided to open it up. Lucky for me it was a book that I was easily able to fit in my back pocket and read on the bus back and forth to work. Though it might be a nice story to read and take in, the author does butcher the ending-leaving the reader confused. If stylistic imagery and immense character depth filled with entertaining dialogue is what you desire-then prepare yourself to be disappointed. But if you're an avid reader, such as myself, then do read this book for the sake of experiencing the trails and tribulations this couple experienced in Starkfield."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction.

It was delivered sooner than estimated and in excellent condition; my daughter \\"loved\\" this book."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is set in Starkfield, Massachusettes, where everything is very stark indeed. Much of the story also takes place in the winter, when the Puritan New England town is covered in snow and bitter cold. At the heart of the story is, of course, Ethan Frome: a farmer who has been dealt a bad lot in life. He had been living away from Starkfield, at college, studying to become an engineer, when his father died and he had to return home to the family farm to care for his ailing mother, Zenobia. He ends up marrying Zeena, the nurse who took care of his mother, more out of duty and gratefulness than love or passion. Before long Zeena becomes a hypochondriac, inventing illnesses and perpetually seeking possible cures for them.Into this depressing scene steps Mattie, who is quite the breath of fresh air for Ethan. A distant relative---she was the daughter of Zenobia's cousin---Mattie's father had squandered all of the family's money, a fact which was only revealed after his death. Mattie's mother apparently dies of the shock and shame, leaving Mattie a penniless orphan. Zeena's doctor suggests that Zeena find someone to help with the household chores, so Mattie comes to Starkfield to do just that, and also ends up winning Ethan's heart.The story is so depressingly tragic that at times I wanted to stop reading it. But it was like watching a scary movie or sitting down on a roller-coaster: you want to stop, kind of, but you also want to keep going. The story starts out by revealing that Ethan was in a freak accident, and then goes back in time, so you know things don't end up well. The entire feel of the book is incredibly ominous and its pace marches you right on from the sweet tale of a simple and down-on-his-luck farmer who falls in love with a young, care-free girl, to the bad ending you know is coming. The language is simple and no-nonsense, yet it alternatively scares you like Stephen King and pulls on your heart strings like Jane Austen.There's a scene near the beginning in which Ethan has gone to pick Mattie up from a barn dance that puts you right there in the middle of their budding relationship, which is technically illicit and wrong, but feels so right that you find yourself rooting for them, even though you know it will end horribly. Ethan watches Mattie dancing, yearning for both Mattie herself and the simple innocence and hopefulness of youth, which is long-lost for him. When the dance ends, a young boy flirts with Mattie and offers her a ride home, and Ethan thinks that soon Mattie will get married and leave him. Yet, she is so surprised and happy that he is there to pick her up, and she reassures him that she's not going anywhere. The tone of the relationship between Ethan and Mattie is light-hearted, casual and happy, in the middle of this otherwise entirely depressing book.Despite its tragic subject matter, Ethan Frome is a gem of a book I plan to re-read again and again. I also want to read more of Wharton's work. This is the first book I've read by her and I know that most of the rest of her works deal with the upper class New York society from which she came. I don't know how she can write so well about a poor New England farmer, so I can only imagine what she writes about those characters that comprise her own element. I give Ethan Frome four and a half stars and highly recommend it to anyone.For more book reviews and other posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my blog Voracia: Goddess of Words."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction.

After I barreled through the three introductions, I was admittedly not wild about reading a romantic tragedy set in Industrial, rural New England. But every page seem to be alive with Wharton's prose! I would put the book down and suddenly realize how quickly the story was going, how engaging it was, how subtly I was getting sucked in. There were very few \\"aha\\" moments where I noticed the skill at prose, but whenever I paused from reading I'd realize just how engrossing it had become.This book is just barely over 100 pages, and the entire story takes place in but a few days so it is quite a quick read. I immediately contrasted it with the ubiquitous Romeo-Juliet stories, and found much that was refreshingly different and some that was comfortingly the same. And what a unique take on the ending!This book is great for a rainy day!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton; afterword by Alfred Kazin. Highly recommended.Ethan Frome is a powerful story about powerless people. The title character is held in thrall by his parents, his land, his poverty, and his lifeless and loveless marriage. His wife, Zenobia (Zeena), cannot escape the confines of her narrow mind; her imaginary illnesses and the status they give her in a small village like the aptly named Starkfield, Massachusetts; and the meanness of her own life (symbolised by her attachment to her pickle dish and her refusal to use it, even for visits by the minister). Finally, there is Mattie Silver, the relative who has come to help care for Zeena and the house and who has nowhere to go. Interestingly, the three prisoners are related; Zeena is referred to as a cousin of Ethan's, while Mattie is Zeena's cousin. Zeena is, literally and figuratively, the central figure who connects them all and who keeps Ethan and Mattie apart.From his youth, Ethan's impulsive, reactive nature leads him into trouble. When Zeena helps him out with the care of his mother, who dies and leaves him alone and lonely, \\"before he knew what he was doing, he had asked her [Zeena] to stay there with him.\\" It is soon thereafter that he discovers that his loneliness gave him selective vision and that Zeena is more than a good nurse; she's an excellent hypochondriac. When someone asks him if he lacks money, \\"'Not a bit,' Ethan's pride retorted before his reason had time to intervene.\\"Ethan is hindered from all he desires, whether it's his technical education, his potential career as an engineer, or the arms of Mattie Silver, by his prevailing sense of duty and honor. Although he feels trapped on his land and in a farming life with which he is not happy because he has had a succession of people for whom to care-first, his father, then his mother, then Zeena-Ethan tells Mattie, \\"I want to be there when you're sick and when you're lonesome.\\" Later, his last thought before unconsciousness will be about his responsibility to his horse: \\"I ought to be getting him his feed . . .\\" He struggles constantly with his need to be free of Zeena and his obligation to take care of her.Zeena and Mattie are contrasted throughout; Zeena's lashless lids are nothing like Mattie's fully lashed lids, which Ethan observes \\"sinking slowly when anything charmed or moved her.\\" Her laughter is seen \\"sparkling through her lashes.\\" While Zeena is thin and hard, Ethan sees Mattie (in Zeena's overnight absence) as \\"taller, fuller, more womanly in shape and motion\\" than when she is under Zeena's watchful eye. Light, which brings out the sharp hollows of Zeena's face as in a horror film, \\"threw a lustrous fleck on [Mattie's] lips, edged her eyes with velvet shade, and laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her brows.\\" Is this Mattie as she really is, or is this Mattie as Ethan's loneliness and imagination needs her to be.Around Mattie, Ethan is often overcome by the strength of his emotions. When she serves him dinner, with the cat lying drowsily by the stove in a carefully drawn domestic scene, \\"Ethan was suffocated with the sense of well-being.\\" This sense of being overcome recurs throughout their encounters. He doubts that he inspires such a glow. \\"Could it be his coming that gave her such a kindled face?\\" He is jealous of every man Mattie encounters, particularly the wealthy Irish grocer's son, Denis Eady.Whether Wharton is writing of society New York or rural New England, such an illicit romance cannot succeed, and Ethan's fails spectacularly-leaving behind people who are emotional and physical wrecks. Zeena is transformed into reluctant caregiver, while Mattie is transformed into yet another part of the trap that keeps Ethan on the farm, impoverished financially, intellectually, and emotionally. His emotions about his fate and that of his would-be lover are never revealed other than through an indescribable look that haunts those who witness it. In life, all are more dead than the Fromes in the graveyard. Ethan Frome is the literary embodiment of Wharton's quote, \\"Life is the saddest thing, next to death.\\"Ethan Frome's framework is awkward; a narrator from outside Starkfield manages to get into Ethan's home and learn the whole story, which then is improbably told in great detail in third-person omniscient. This detracts only slightly from the novel's wintry, claustrophobic atmosphere and evocative powers. In her introduction, Wharton calls the reader \\"sophisticated\\" and the people of whom she writes \\"simple\\"-as stark as the New England backdrop. Yet Ethan Frome, for all his \\"simplicity,\\" is a rich, fully realised person as memorable as Newland Archer (The Age of Innocence)-and as tragic as Lily Bart (The House of Mirth).Diane L.

Ethan is a pathetic character who has to deal with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. By trying to escape his shrewish wife, he only tied himself to her more completely.

Edith Wharton does a great job of characterization and with the telling of the story. The story takes place in New York in a small town of the western part of the state. This sets up most of the actions and conflicts throughout the novel and fits the plot very well. The novel, Ethan Frome, is a very good story about the struggle of a man who is torn between his wife who is sick and needs attention and care and a young woman who comes to help and he falls in love with. Zeena, his wife, knows about his secret but is helpless to do anything and focuses all her energies on trying to recover from her illness. Mattie comes to the house innocent and falls for Ethan just as he does her. Through out the book there are many times where they find themselves in a situation where they do not know what will happen next. In Ethan Frome, the characters used are very believable and fit their parts well. The characters, Mattie, Zeena and Ethan fit together and contrast each other enough to create the right amount of conflict. All of the town's people fit the story just as good as the main characters. Mattie seeming innocent and Zeena being all-knowing gives an interesting combination that leaves Ethan to fill in the open areas. New York is the perfect placement for the novel. The weather and climate creates conflicts for Zeena and her medical condition and sets up the ending of the story for Mattie and Ethan. The cold weather and snow create an environment that makes for slow and tedious travel that allows Ethan and Mattie spend a good deal of time together. The conflicts created are very good and follow through the whole story. The story is very well described and never left a question about why something happened or how it did. Edith Wharton describes the story very well and gives us characters that we can relate to and understand. The setting she used is also described to help us relate to what it was like. In all it is a very good book that most people will probably not want to put down."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The novel, Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton, is set in a snowy landscape of New England in the nineteenth century.

I understand that it is based on an event which actually occurred, and I can sort of imagine a situation in which it would occur, but Wharton has written a story in which the incident would not have happened. It is an incident which is false to the characters she has pretty vividly created, so it felt very, very forced and I really broke with the novel when I read it.The book, otherwise, is well written and pretty observant -- and a very quick read -- but I can't recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction. People can fall in love, but rarely do things turn out well.But but few of even her books can evoke the feeling of \\"Ethan Frome,\\" whick packs plenty of emotion, vibrancy and regrets into a short novella. While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality. Not a stereotypical shrew.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a true tragedy -- as beautifully written as it is, it's still Wharton's description of how a man merely survives instead of living, hopeless and devastated."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The Romeo and Juliet of its time, Ethan Frome is a suspenseful story about a man shackled by marriage to the lady of his nightmares, and when he finds the love of his dreams he is torn to shreds by what he should do and what he needs to do. An excerpt from the story that best summarizes his predicament is \\"With the sudden perception of the point to which his madness had carried him, the madness fell and he saw his life before him as it was. He was a poor man, the husband of a sickly woman, whom his desertion would leave alone and destitute; and even if he had the heart to desert her he could have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied him.\\" As you can see the story has an intricately designed plot that keeps you wondering until the end."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome was a pretty good book. I really liked the way Edith Wharton described things in the book. Instead of Zeena's house being dark and gloomy, she wrote, \\"the shutterless windows of the house were dark. A dead cucumber-vine dangled from the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death.\\" I actually felt cold when I read the descriptions about Ethan and Mattie walking home in the snow or when they were sledding. I also liked how the characters seemed real and believable. Zeena is negative, sickly and unpleasant. Ethan is trapped and looking for happiness. Mattie needs someone to care about her. I also think the plot was interesting and very ironic because instead of escaping his unhappiness, Ethan and Mattie make things much worse in the end.I did not like the book in some ways because it is very slow moving and seemed to get too romantic. It's a pretty depressing book, too. There are a lot of references to death, and I felt really bad for Ethan at the end of the book. His life was miserable before Mattie, and much worse after trying to escape his life with Zeena by trying to commit suicide with Mattie. I'm glad it's only a book and not a true story.This may be a good chick-flick book, but it only rates a 3 as a book for a guy."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a superb tragic love story that unfolds as the most pivotal moment in Ethan's life.Ethan falls in love with Mattie Silver, the daughter of one of his wife's cousins, who came a year earlier to help with the house chores while his wife convalesced. This love becomes the only bright spot Ethan can ever remember having. He had to give up his barely begun career as an engineer to go back to the family mill to take care of his invalid father,before he died,and then his mother,who became sick and invalid as well. It is during this time he met his wife Zeena and,after the passing of his mother, they were married.At the time he falls in love with Mattie, he is hopelessly in debt, teetering on the brink of ruin, and trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman he really only feels a sense of duty toward rather than love. Edith Wharton's description of these pressures and the longing love he has for Mattie make this a story that immediately engrosses the reader, pulling them into an exhilirating tale of the one true love finally found that is at the same time torturously, maddeningly beyond all hope of attainment.Wharton's best work in this story, however, is the ulra-tragic twist she gives it at the end. I won't say anything more about it. Its just one of those things that makes reading worth doing.The novella is only 81 pages long but packs such a furious punch in each of its' pages by forgoing the overly descriptive scenery and doubling up its' focus on the characters. The story moves along quickly at a great pace. Take the 2 hours to read it. What else you gonna do, watch Seinfeld? You've already seen it."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I liked this story alot because it contained many moral lessons. One of the lessons was not to rush into situations without completely understanding all the details about this situation. Ethan and Zeena got married but Ethan didn't care for Zeena at all. He was trying to simply repay her for taking care of his mother during her sickness. During the course of this marriage, Ethan's heart falls for another woman. The woman who steals his heart is Mattie ( Zeena's cousin), who was summoned to the house to care for Zeena during her sickness. Zeena later discovers the relationship between Ethan and Mattie and tells Ethan to send Mattie away, saying that she wasn't much help. Ethan takes Mattie to the train station, they get on a sled and intentionally crashes into a tree, in an attempt to kill themselves. This plan was not successful and soon Zeena has to care for Ethan and Mattie on a farm. This book displays the characters being trapped in emotional prisons. Some are romantic, very violent, and simply harsh. Personally I would refer this book to someone who's in a relationship and isn't positive if the partner feels the same way he/she feels about the other partner. Sometimes \\"Love is blind\\""},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I have to admit, I found this book a slow go when I had to read it as a Freshman in prep-school. But the fact that it was set in New England and that it dealt with a depressing winter landscape and a remorseless cast of characters, such as I was then encountering made it unbelievably relevant at the time. I can relate, however, to the preponderance of young readers at this site who have expressed their displeasure at having to read it. I would not wish this vision on a young audience unless I were trying to impress them with the bleakness of a snow-bound, New England existence circa 1900. This is a pretty unrelenting picture of the region, outdoing Frost or Hawthorne or even H.P. Lovecraft for that matter. The sledding scene is probably one of the most famous set-ups in modern literature. Wharton is definitely at her most masterly here. She was an exceptional writer. The question remains, what is the authorial voice saying in terms of adressing the existential questions raised here? Even the bitterest denunciations of cosmic forces have some kind of address of reply from 20th century authors. What is Wharton's here? There is very little mirth in this house."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"A great story of wasted love, compassion, and the eagerness of men to escape from their &quot;prisons.&quot; Description of the landscape in relation to the mood of every scene is masterful. The unspeakable pain Ethan and Mattie have to suffer is unbearably heart-wrenching. Surprising and revealing ending."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I love classic novels. One of my favorite things in life is grabbing a book, getting settled in for the night in my chilly bedroom, and not just being swept away into a story, but also to an entirely different period in time. Classic novels are the most beautifully written time machines.That said, Edith Wharton's \\"Ethan Frome\\" is beyond a doubt beautifully written. Since I live in New England, I can say with 100% assurity, she writes paints a picture of our frozen landscape and doesn't forget to sprinkle it with bits of beauty alone the way. I feel engaged in this story from its very first pages.The most haunting part of this book is the author's way of letting the landscape describe the characters. Zeena is cold, gray, white just as a winter landscape, just like her calico wrap. Mattie is always compared to the sun, summer, the melting of spring, or sunshine itself just like her cherry red scarf and lips.Still, I must say, I did not find any sympathy for the main character, Ethan Frome. Ethan embodies absolute and total cowardice to me. A man who lets circumstance dictate his life instead of his own mind. I'm reminded of David Copperfield's first line, \\"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.\\" Ethan's first line would be more like, \\"I will never be the hero in my own story.\\"He takes care of his parents instead of striking out and making enough money to have a hired girl do this for him. He marries a woman who cares for his mother and instead of taking the time to do better for himself that she now provides, he did nothing much at all. Mom dies and instead of being along in wintertime, Ethan asks Zeena to marry him. That's always a great reason to ask someone to marry you! It's always a terrific reason to not finally go on and get busy living life. Remember, he does not marry Zeena because he owes a debt to her, but because he did not want to be alone in winter. He said if it had been spring, things might have been different. Totally ridiculous.Then Zeena becomes ill and to me, she is the person deserving pity in this novel. She had no idea Ethan didn't really love her at all. His proposal was not, \\"I don't want to be alone.\\" Zeena marries him, found out soon after of his cold demeanor, then became ill as a way to probably get some sort of attention from him, but he could not give her any. She was now just a familiar burden. He could give her young cousin, Mattie, attention, but not his own wife. He could also feel pity for Mattie, but never for his wife.To add insult to injury, instead of leaving Mattie alone and maybe securing her a place in the home or elsewhere in the world, he must tell her how he feels, he kisses her, he gets jealous of anyone speaking to her, and basically behaves exactly opposite to the way a husband should behave. She is young and silly, naive, and should have been treated as a family member, not a romantic prospect.Maybe this story's first line should say: \\"If you are too cowardly to do anything at all with your life, you'll feel right at home with Ethan Frome.\\" I love this book, but am always a bit blown away when a large number of people feel sympathy for a character that is morally bankrupt and emotionally a coward. A character who had opportunities to be so much more than he was, yet wasted his own life and two others in the bargain."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"this was a great and beautifully written story... i'm not someone who is into romantic books but this was one of the few i love!

I suppose if what you desire to try and experience is darkness, despair, and pretty much complete abandonment of what makes the human spirit a thing of beauty then perhaps this is the book for you.It focuses on characters who choose, when a \\"sledding accident\\" occurs, to wallow in the very depths of self-pity. What a wonderful (not) story to read... This book is effectively a \\"crime against the human spirit\\" and I find it hard to imagine how any author could pen such bleakness. I suppose that is the \\"attraction\\" of this book, those who desire a journey into the lives of people who have really chosen to not live anymore, just to exist and spread as much misery as they can. The fact that people do read this kind of \\"material\\" is a concern all to itself.I've read literally thousands of books in my life, in all genres, and I can say without hesitation that Ethan Frome is one of the worst books I have ever read.Recommendation: Avoid"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I hated this book and everything about it. His wife was annoying, her cousin was a ditz, and he was a loser. The plot was predictable and the only suspense was if Zeena would kill Mattie over the Pickle Dish. This whole book was one terribly acted out soap oprah that had really no plot twists at all, no action of any kind, or any really flavor. Ethan and the gang were in a story that was little more than mushed up pasty muck. The only real unpredicatable part was the end, which actually livened the book a little...but that's at the end of course. I'd tell you the ending, but I don't want to ruin it, you'll have to waste your own time to find out."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"While I appreciated the germane theme of &quot;life is short -- so make the most of it,&quot; I did not, however, particularly appreciate the utter despondency and insufferable malaise of Wharton's storyline. The morose setting of a fictitious New England town in the cold winter adds to the gloom and dreariness of an already hopeless milieu engendered by the abject despair of title character Ethan and the incorrigible antagonism of his wife, Zeena.I didn't know whether to pity Ethan - or to laugh at him. His weak lack of resolve against the insufferably truculent and extremely annoying Zeena as well as his glaring inability to make his own decisions both contribute to make this book to be anything but a &quot;page-turner&quot; -- to put it mildly. Ethan is nothing short of pathetic. I empathize with Mattie to a certain degree, yet the ending (with Mattie) of this short novella is so pathetic that I was left shaking my head -- at how stupid they all are.I gave it a generous 3 stars for its pertinent message of &quot;hey, don't be like us because we're morons.&quot; While I highly enjoyed Wharton's The House of Mirth, this book, in essence, is no House of Mirth - in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading before AP English Language. Basically, it is a cold and depressing novel with a cold and depressing setting. It does have some suspense, such as towards the end, when they are on the sled, you really want to know what will happen. Could they be crazy enough to run into a tree?!All in all, I did not enjoy this book. However, I enjoy contemporary literature more than older books. It is a romance novel, although Ethan and Mattie are never together as a couple. His decrepit wife Zeena returns to her role as a caretaker in the end, but Mattie is still the third wheel in a sense.Ethan Frome is a fairly quick read because it is only a 77 page book. However, it took me a few days because reading is was pure drudgery! I want something that is uplifting and will make me smile and feel better after I finish it. Ethan Frome will NOT do that. It will however, make you appreciate the modern convienences we have such as lighting and air travel.If you are looking for a good romance read, try Message In a Bottle! That is a book than had some great romance and a tear jerking conclusion!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I read Ethan Frome because my school requires it. However, I can't imagine why.

I can't imagine why. It has all the emotions of a rock, has no depth, nor did it strike my interest in any way.

It is now taking up space somewhere in a corner, and will probably remain there until it turns to dust. There was only one good thing about this book: it was short."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I hate this book more than any other I've read. Edith Wharton indulges herself in a meticulous catalog of imaginary human misery.

Read it and you have wasted precious hours of your life that you could have spent seeking real joy."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"We chose this book because it was on the classic list...but it is definitely dated.

Ethan Frome is a poor farmer, who is married to an unhealthy wife that he does not love. Zeenie, Ethan's wife, is a hypochondriac but fails to realize it; she loves taking care of people when they are sick. Although when she has no one to take care of she acts sick to get attention from Ethan and others. While at a dance, Ethan spots a beautiful young women by the name of Mattie Silver. He immediately falls in love with her without even knowing it at first. One winter day, Mattie was forced out of the Frome household because of Ethan's wife Zeenie. That afternoon, Ethan asks Mattie for one more night together. Ethan decides to take Mattie on a sled ride on there last night together. While going down a hill, Ethan miscalculates a rock ahead of him and hits it. Sadly, Mattie is knocked unconscious after a blow to the head. Thirty years later, Zeenie is taking care of Mattie at the Frome household due to her condition after the accident. Now Ethan spends his life not only with his wife, but with his love as well.

The fascination the world has with a forbidden love is a popular theme, but Edith Wharton weaves magic into the familiar plot by adding a flair for charming description, intricate detail and symbolism that chills every reader to the bone.

Although this may be so, those particular students must be the ones who neglect to have an open mind, or who have little taste for old-fashioned romance. Ethan Frome is a terrific novella, describing the three most important days of three main characters lives. The plot may lack the more modern-day romance and a fairy-tale ending, but this only makes the book more unique and realistic. Almost every situation that was presented in this book could also happen to an Ethan Frome of today, and these situations are much more likely to occur than the overly dramatic and sappy situations presented in many romance novels. There are numerous morals and lessons to be found, all of which should be appled to everyone's life, especially the lessons learned by Ethan Frome.

Although it was tragic, it left a major impact on me, like most tragic novels do. I never thought I would encounter another book as depressing as Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, but Ethan Frome most certainly was. This novel expresses the power of love and what love will do to one's actions. The actions of the two main characters, Ethan Frome and Mattie Silver may appear shocking and foolish to the reader, but eventually the reader can acknowledge the fact that love makes one desperate; desperate enough to what ever it takes to attain love. This is a story of a simple man who desperately wants true love, but who eventually realizes love is hopeless. Ethan Frome's love for Mattie Silver causes the two to partake in an unthinkable act. I would love to share the ending of this novel, but it's an experience one should do on their own. Read this book and it will leave an impact on you and when you look back at this book you will almost feel the pain and isolation of the two characters.

Rather it was the lowest possible form of fiction about a man who thinks he is in love, but is not. His life is merely so depressing that he would jump anything that came along. I did not find any value or enjoyment out of this novel what-so-ever, and that is not just me being cruel, because I am trying to be as kind as i possibly can. So if you have time on your hands and you are looking for a good read, I suggest the local phone book would be a viable alternative to the novel Ethan Frome."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Many people read this in school, which is a shame if it isn't taught right. Those who don't appreciate the novel, don't understand how compelling love can be. Ethan is a man caught between two world - one where he is trapped by duty and obligation, and another where he is led by love and desire. He is a man who is torn. His tragedy is his inability to choose. This novel teaches us all that in our struggle to choose between duties and desires, the only true failure is the one where one attempts to escape the choice. This work is easily read in a couple of hours and is rich in its understanding of human nature. I feel sorry for those who write it off without fully attempting to understand its complexity."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I feel that this novel should be condidered one of the absolute best books of any age. It is a very sad story of how the local conventions of an area can smother a man's happiness. &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is a slow moving story, but it is a very short book and does speed up at the end. The characters (particularly Ethan) are some of the most real that you will ever find in literature.

After all, how much bleakness can one person take? While I was perusing this one, I kept thinking to myself \`what a shame, if only these people could have been born nowadays...' For in the Frome's little world, the early 20th century world of rural New England, divorce was rarely on option. Instead it seemed to be a privilege almost solely reserved for the extremely wealthy and/or celebrities. Also, Ethan's sickly, hypochondriac wife Zeena is obviously suffering from depression, which of course back in those days was about as treatable as all those phantom illnesses Zeena incessantly griped about.So our ill-fated protagonist with his altruistic, caring nature is trapped. He is trapped because he is poor. He is trapped in a loveless marriage with a gloomy, woeful wife who does nothing all day but whine. He is trapped in a star-crossed love affair, with both participants knowing full well their heading down a one-way sled-ride to perdition. Ergo, I now know why Edith would pen a quote like the one above? All you have to do is read this short, sorrowful story and you will plainly see for yourself.The million dollar question obviously is this: Why on Earth would anyone want to read such a melancholy tale about three people doomed to such an unfavorable fate? I am being 100% honest when I tell you folks that I did not think I was going to care for this one at all. I didn't think I was going to care for it after the first two chapters either. However, I couldn't stop reading it... I tried to stop, but I couldn't. The prose, as depressing as it is, is still loaded with charm and at the end of the day there's just no denying that Wharton is one hell of a great writer!This is NOT a novelette that should be required reading for high-school or even college students. Most of their budding brains have not had enough experiences in life to appreciate and fully comprehend this one. This is a very adult yarn, as are most of Wharton's works, loaded with symbolism, while possessing her favorite theme of illicit love. And of all her heartsick idealists, Ethan Frome is without a doubt her most tragic character. In fact, move over Jude Frawley, Tom Joad, Clyde Griffiths, et al... cause Ethan Frome is arguably the most doomed of you all!Again, my interest never waned while reading this one. It was very beautifully written and extremely thought provoking. What more can one ask for in a book? To say I was pleasantly surprised would be like saying Monet was a pretty good painter. 5 Stars despite myself!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The narrator, who is nameless throughout the story, comes from New England. The carpenters happened to go on strike and left the narrator, a labor negotiator, jobless. He becomes stranded in a small town called Starkfield and eventually he boards with Ethan Frome. The narrator is mystified by the mysterious local townsman called Ethan Frome. Ethan Frome, the protagonist of the story, lives on an unpretentious farm in Starkfield, Massachusetts. He hastily married, his cousin Zenobia Pierce, to fill a void from the premature death of his mother. His spouse soon develops an illness that seemingly traps him in a commitment for life. Ethan's luck and efficiency runs low as the farm soon begins to deteriorate. Ethan's only refuge from his arduous life is his fantasy about his wife's cousin, Mattie Silver. Mattie Silver, the antagonist of the story, comes to assist the Frome's during Zeena's illness. Mattie comes from a poorer family, which shows as she becomes a burden to the Fromes. She had never had any formal house training or nursing skills. Mattie served as pleasure to Ethan but was a nuisance to Zeena. Zenobia Frome (Zeena) assisted Ethan while his mother was dying. After her marriage with Ethan she had become ill. Zeena is interested about treatment for her illness but in the future refuses an operation because she is skeptical about hospitals. Zeena is alienated by the undesired company of Mattie in her house. She is jealous of the time Mattie and Ethan spend together. Significant settings in the novel are the Frome house and Varnum Hill. The Frome residence serves as an important part of the novel because it houses all of the main characters. It is technically a house, but it also serves as a prison cell. It is a cell to Ethan because of his responsibility to keep the farm in good shape as it has been in his family for generations. Zeena considers the house a cell because she is isolated there with her illness in there as she watches her body and marriage slowly but painfully deteriorate. Mattie also finds the house to be a prison because it reminds her of the fact that she could never open-heartedly have Ethan. When Ethan and Mattie finally are alone, without Zeena, the house reminds them of their guilt because of Zeena's illness. At the end of the novel the cell theory proves true. Ethan, Mattie, and Zeena are locked in the house together rarely having visitors or speak of the incident that happened between them. Varnum Hill is the most significant setting in the novel. It serves as the setting where we first meet Ethan and Mattie and they reveal their attraction to each other. It will also be the last time we see any attraction between the two. It represents the beginning and the end of their relationship. Varnum Hill also represents where we encounter the romance in our story. All of the real intimate moments such as when Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum were kissing and Mattie and Ethan proclaimed their love, always happened on the hill. Varnum Hill is a romantic symbol in the book. Symbols play a big role in the Ethan Frome tale. When we initially were introduced to Mattie in the book, she was wearing a distinctive cherry red scarf. Later in the book she wears a red ribbon in her hair during dinner. The red color on Mattie shows reality to Ethan. The red scarf reminds him that he cannot be with Mattie because he is married to another. When she wears the red ribbon to dinner, he feels as if they are a married couple but the ribbon always shocks him back to reality. The cat in the story represents Zeena's venom even though she is not present. The cat oddly sat in Zeena's vacant chair during dinner and broke the pickle dish. The cat also secretly watches Ethan and Mattie's every action when they are alone. It almost seems as if the cat is Zeena's eyes. When Zeena scolded Mattie for breaking the pickle dish, it really was not over the pickle dish itself. She really was upset about her marriage and how it seems as if it broke too. The story carried an implied metaphor about a sleigh. The sleigh represents fate and how you can only steer your fate so much, but when there are bumps one cannot avoid, you end up taking them head on. Ethan has a variety of different conflicts throughout the book. Ethan battles his desire frequently. Every time he tries to ward off the desired Mattie, he constantly has to remind himself of Zeena. In the end, his desire was too strong and he proclaimed his love to Mattie by taking the plunge down the hill. Ethan and Zeena are subtle about the way they quarrel over Mattie. Instead of fighting they would take hurtful jabs at each other. Zeena wants to get rid of Mattie because she harbors evil feelings over their affair. She cleverly does not speak plainly about those feelings. She instead states that Mattie is an incompetent worker and wants a new nurse. Ethan knows Zeena's plans and tries to come to Mattie's defense by complaining that they do not have enough money to afford an another nurse. Zeena gives the final blow by explaining that if Mattie is replaced the expenses would remain the same. Ethan has no rebuttal and therefore backs down for now. The most obvious conflict is in the end when Ethan tried to hit the Elm tree head on. As they were gliding down the hill at the last second, the sled swerves slightly so that they hit the tree, but not head on, or hard enough to kill them. Ethan does a lot of fighting in this story but unfortunately he also does a lot of losing. The story of Ethan Frome is bittersweet. Mattie and Ethan ended up together but it was not what they were expecting. It strangely resembles the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The lovers both could not be together or apart without hurting themselves or someone else. Both pairs of lovers thought that taking their lives was the only way out of their sad state of affairs. Sadly, this is where the stories differ in the fact that Mattie and Ethan did not die, they were deformed together forever. My only question to the author Wharton is why did Zeena in the end let Mattie and Ethan back in the house to live together again? I think she sees the guilt in Ethan but despite that fact still wants to care for her husband in his time of need. Even though he committed adultery when his wife was very ill, I feel pity for him by the end of the novel. My pity or sympathy comes from the fact that Ethan is a human being with faults and vulnerable human emotions. I relate to his indiscretion and do not judge him as a caring person."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The story of Ethan Frome is a wonderful story that pretty much everyone can relate to. A love for something, or in this case, someone, which cannot be proclaimed due to responsibilities that society has outlined. This book delves deep into the meaning of these two ideas, Passion vs. Responsibility and actually makes you rethink both of them.When I first picked up this book, I figured it would just be a quick easy read. This was true for the most part in that it was a quick and easy read, but the way Edith Wharton has been able to take everyday simple elements and turn them into something so much more was simply extraordinary. I soon found myself not being able to put the book down until I had finished the entire thing and I was very pleased with the roller coaster of emotions this book presented me with. Once you start reading, you actually feel as if you have taken the place of Ethan Frome and are always just waiting to see what will happen next. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a nice easy read or for anyone interested in symbolism because there is plenty of it. Ethan Frome is simply put... a fantastic story and a must read!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I thought that Ethan From was a very good book. I was very interesting and suspenseful. Even though it was a shorter story I thought that the character were developed well and I thought the plot was very good. It was a good tragedy. I like the characters in Ethan Frome. Edith Wharton does a good job of developing the characters. The characters were very compelling and real to me. You feel sorry for Ethan because he can not get away from his farm and his life. Wharton make the characters like Ethan and Mattie very sympathetic characters. She does a good job of making you feel connected to then and sorry that things were so tragic for them. The plot of Ethan From was very good. It was very sad and ironic especially at the end. Wharton wrote in my opinion a good tragedy. I thought it was very beautifully written. It was full of symbolism though some of it was hard to catch. I found that the story was very interesting you kept reading to see what would happen next in the story. It was a sad tale. The book deeply affected me. I found it so sad and ironic I especially was affected by the scene where Ethan and Mattie go down the hill in the sled. You know they will not succeed but you still hope it will happen for them and that thing will work out. I believe that Ethan Frome is a good book. I would recommend it to any one who like and emotional tragedy. The characters and plot are bother very good. Wharton proves why she is known for being such a good author. At the end of the book I felt truly sad for Ethan and every thing that had happened to him."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"In my English class we had just finished reading the book The Scarlet Letter, a so-called classic. Well, when I first picked up this book I thought to myself, not another boring book, but as I began to get into the story I really started to like it. I love the irony of the ending."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Though normally she portrays the filthy rich of New York City, Wharton here takes on a love affair between two abjectly poor people in a small rural New England community. It is a hopeless affair which must prove ultimately sterile given the society that produced it. What Wharton doesn't do is as interesting as what she does do. She isn't judgmental about the social structure, she avoids making the poverty so severe that it gets in the way of the story, and she doesn't confuse poverty with dullness and so make any of her main characters unable to be sufficiently articulate. Like Nevil Shute in &quot;The Far Country,&quot; Wharton is gifted at making each sentence of dialog shine, each look, each touch, the weather, the cat. Everything is so genuine, it springs from the page. The result is (like Shute's) a romance novel you actually care about. It's great American art. One note: There are a lot of student reviews below mine. Just remember, if a kid resents having to read a book, that kid will give the book a bad review as a way of getting back at his/her teacher. So take the rating average above with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is a sad tale of lives gone terribly wrong, and people who had potential but couldn't use it due to illnesses. The unrequited romance between Ethan and Mattie, the sickness of Zeena, the botched suicide attempt, and the life on a cold, unproductive New England farm made the book very very depressing, and overall was a representation of stagnation.A very hard book to get into. I had to read it for school, and found it to be a chore. Despite the tragedies that are otherwise interesting, yet disturbing, Edith Warton unfortunately presents them in a bland, and rather impersonal manner. It has been hailed as a great novel, but I wouldn't call it essential reading."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"While I have no objection to this book's ultimate chilling conclusion about justice (or lack thereof) in life, I found Edith Wharton's style deplorable. In short: &quot;Here. I just thought up an excellent symbol, and it's really obvious what it stands for. But still, because I'm oh-so-proud of myself, let me tell you exactly what it means.&quot;The only use for this book is as an instruction book in identifying symbolism -- but even for that, it's a bit too basic and clearcut. Basically, don't bother, unless you enjoy seeing examples of bad writing. It is disgraceful that a work so lacking in literary quality is read in numerous schools.A multitude of films and other books mock Ethan Frome. It's not hard to see why."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I THREW UP ITS SO BAD I.

While married to Zenna, Ethan shares a secret romance with their young house maid, Mattie. Ethan and Zenna slowly start to fall apart from each other, all the while Ethan and Mattie start falling madly in love with one another.Edith Wharton fills her book with passion to love and be loved. Zenna slowly learns of Ethan and Mattie's \\"secret romance\\" but does nothing about it, because she's too worried about being superior to them. Zenna being the manipulative women she is pretends to know nothing about their \\"secret romance\\" and pretends she needs the two of them to take care of her throughout the years. Then, after threatening to send Mattie away and hire a new house maid, Ethan and Mattie fall into a depression because of the fear of losing each other. On their journey to their \\"new world\\" without one another they get into an awful accident crippling Ethan and paralyzing Mattie. All the while, now Zenna must take care of both Ethan and Zenna.Although I think Ethan Frome was an interested book there is one barrier. I feel that Edith Wharton could have gone into further detail amongst certain situations. I also feel that Edith Wharton could have gone further into the book instead of ending it the way she did. But all in all I feel that the book was filled with emotion, passion, and the consequences emotion and passion can sometimes bring.Jessica CothranLandrum High School"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I think Ethan Frome is a pretty amazing book. I thought that by reading an older book, I wouldn't be able to understand what's going on or that Edith Wharton was going to use big English words that I didn't understand. But she didn't. I didn't want to put this novel down. I read it in 3 days. All I could imagine was what was going to happen next and especially how it was going to end. These are the kind of stories I like to read about. Although I loved the book, I must say I hated the ending. First of all, the last line was horrible. What am I supposed to take from that? What does it mean? And I was very disappointed in the fact that Mattie and Ethan tried to commit suicide but she became paralyzed (or something-I'm not even sure) and he became detached from the rest of the world. I think the ending could have been much better. It was very unexpected. But other than that, I loved the book!

The book, although seen as depressing, is uplifting in its truth to life. Life is not perfect, so why should stories be anything different from life?The Greeks created two genres - the tragedy and the comedy - and although tragedies will make us cry and leave us with a saddened heart, they bring us a sense of accomplishment. Afterall, our lives are not as bad as our friends who are living the story of a tragedy.

Though I must admit it has an interesting theme, as well as a good moral, and Wharton's foreshadowing skills are superb. But this book is still extremely depressing. It is also rather boring at times, and one can find oneself reading the book, yet finding yourself lost, because it became so boring that, even though you were reading it, you weren't taking it in, and when you stared to get back into the book, you found yourself lost, not knowing how far away you were from where you left off. Overall this book loses most of its readers after the first few chapters, and therefore shouldn't be on the top of anyone's list."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This review refers to the New Millennium Audio Tape of \\"Ethan Frome\\" by Edith Wharton.....Edith Whaton's \\"Ethan Frome\\" read by Richard Thomas is absolutelymesmerizing.

It was very interesting, and it can relate to a lot of people these days. My opinion is that you have to fall in love with somebody first and then think about marriage, and Ethan didn't love Zeena at all, he just did it because he didn't have any way to pay her back for taking care of his sick mother. Later on in the marriage he fell in love with another girl(Mattie) that came to help out in the house because Zeena was sick.

Edith Wharton writes a haunting tale of one man's inability to gain a more fulfilling life because his integrity will not allow him to escape from the duty and burden of caring for others who depend upon him. While this novel lacks the verbal gymnastics and the twists of plot that might attract a younger and more modern audience, the simplicity of the story is one of the novel's strengths as it powerfully evokes Ethan's powerlessness to change his fate, reflected in the stark and overpowering winter landscape. The story does not rely on plot and action to move the story forward but relies on the development of mounting inner tensions both within and between the few characters that populate the book. The difficulty in this novel is that the climax - which depicts the full scope and depth of Ethan's tragedy - occurs decades later, in the outer shell of the story as told by the narrator rather than in the tale of Ethan's young love for Mattie, which may be why some readers were disappointed with the book. A sensitive reader should not fail to be hit by the longing, the powerlessness, the stillness, and the tragedy depicted in this short and simple but elegant book."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"In this beautifully orchestrated novel by Edith Wharton, we learn that cold, bleak environments are as brutal to the human soul as to the human body. We learn from Sartre (Being and Nothingness) that being double-minded is no cause for celebration. In fact, what we do learn, is that double-mindedness is the structure of despair itself. An inauthentic existence permeates Wharton's novel of a husband who is unfaithful to himself, his wife, Zeena, and his beloved, Mattie. \\"A house divided cannot stand\\", Lincoln once wrote. In this house divided only tragedy can hold the fragments together. Whether Ethan had other options than suicide, we'll never really know. In fact, he never openly discusses his options with those individuals who were involved. In the throes of despair, one naturally exaggerates every possibility of failure so no consideration of success naturally emerges. Only Zeena is capable of grasping the tragedy of the situation whose climax she rescues from total ruin. Perhaps there is a moral to this story by Wharton. It goes like this: Every time you think you have it really bad, consider Ethan Frome's fate, then think again!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I only read this because my daughter had it as assigned reading, but it blew me away.

A simple story and easy read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I recently read \\"Ethan Frome\\" for the third time for a book club selection. I can never forget this story. It is so powerful. Starkville is just that. The winter, the dark, the parochialism. I'd say this was the finest psychological drama ever written. I'll be reading it again for sure."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Although I'd read the book for which author Edith Wharton became the first woman to win the Pulitzer prize (in 1920), I'd never even heard of this book when a friend gave it to me recently. After reading it, my only regret is not having happened upon it sooner.This short novel (77 pages) would probably be classified as a novella and is as brilliant as it is brief. The book is narrated by a man who spends \\"the best part of the winter\\" in a small Massachusetts town, due to a work assignment and becomes intrigued with the title character, who, he describes as \\"the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man\\" because of community members' comments about a \\"smash-up.\\" After enlisting the services of a reticent Ethan Frome for transportation to and from the train station and spending (mostly wordless) time with him, his intrigue only increases. But just when you think you are to be let in on the secret, the author flashes back almost twenty-four years prior to chronologically cover the events that ended up leading to the incident (and taking up three-fourths of the book's pages). It's safe to say (without providing spoilers) that the story is about the interrelationship between a (then) twenty-eight year old man, his thirty-five year old hypochondriac wife of seven years, and the woman's approximately twenty-one year old (first) cousin (once removed). Over the years' time that the young woman lives with and works for the couple, Ethan Frome's feelings for her change from mild resentment (being tasked with chaperoning her to and from social engagements in town) to daydream-inducing romanticism. Once again, the denouement seems imminent, but instead the reader is brought back to the present to learn, along with the narrator, the result of Mr. Frome's actions. The back cover calls the ending, \\"both shocking and savagely ironic.\\" I agree.Wharton's perfectly descriptive writing, character development and plotting make this one of my favorite books of the year. Also good: The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton, The Lottery by Shirley Jackson and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Though the book itself is light and easily pocketable, the story is much the opposite. The weight of this story sat with me for days while I tried to decide if I thought it was a hopeful or tragic story.I've decide it's somewhere in the middle...the underlying hope that the main character, Ethan Frome, has makes the story that much more heart breaking. (You may not find it easily on the first read, but read it again, and it starts to shine through)In Ethan Frome, Wharton gives us a tremondous lesson about obligation, loyalty, and most of all about love minus rose colored sunsets and happily ever afters.I highly recommend this book to everyone.Word of warning, though when I tried to read it a few years ago, I was daunted by it's bleakness. After picking it up again, I've come to cherish it. If you don't immediately love it, read it again and let it sit with you."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This story is the type that you could read when you are bored. \\"Ethan Frome\\" is intresting and you do get attached to the characters. The story plot is alright, but it could have expanded more. I liked the moral it was trying to teach. I got the idea that the moral of the story was to be careful of who you marry and marry when you are really in love. The ending had alot of irony in it. I mean, Zeena was barely capable of standing her own illness, and than she was left incharge of taking care of both Mattie and Ethan. If Ethan was smarter and would have thought of the situation more throughly, he and Mattie wouldn't end up the way they did. He has always lived a bitter, miserable life, and his actions with Mattie weren't any better. Overall, the story was pretty decent. I did enjoy it some what, but I really didn't like the ending."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is just too depressing. But those who say (like Louis Gallo above) that Ethan would just have gotten a divorce are missing the point. The world was not always so free of social constraints as it is now and that is why the characters are stuck in their destructive situation. Today we all just do what we want free from strong senses of obligation but that was not the world that this book is taking place in!! One has to LEARN about the time setting and have some notion that the world has changed! But this book goes over the top for depressing and I would not read it again."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"As it could be said about any one of Edith Wharton's novels, Ethan Frome is a great book. Ethan Frome is the story of one winter in the title character's life told in flashbacks. Ethan is in love with his wife's cousin, Mattie Silver, and is tortured by the fact that he cannot be with her out of duty to his wife.The most interesting part of this book, as in most classics, are the themes that are explored. The most important of these is the issue of how much a person has control of his life and how much does fate control his destiny. The truly fascinating part of the way this issue is explored in the novel is that the answer to this question is truly left up to the reader. One could argue that what happens to Ethan was simply destiny, or was a result of his inability to take action.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ending is truly depressing. It is characterized as a tragedy from the onset, but it goes beyond even the label of tragedy into what could be characterized as a cruel ending for the readers who care so deeply about Ethan and his love for Mattie. However, I believe that this ending is entirely appropriate for the novel. As well, if you are not interested in slow-paced romance you will be deeply bored with this book until the last ten pages."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Don't read this novel if you need to be cheered up, but Edith Wharton's &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; entertained me. The narrator first sees Ethan at a local post office in his gloomy New England town- walking like the &quot;jerk of a chain,&quot; scarred, and looking depressed. As the narrator meets Ethan, and talks to the town about him, he is able to uncover Ethan's tragic story of his two loves in life- his wife, whom he feels a deep about of commitment to, and her cousin, who is like a fresh spring field of flowers he needs in his dark, cold life. The novel is FULL of symbolism, and at the end you'll suddenly realize what all of it meant. I can't tell anymore without ruining it. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a well written book, with surprises everywhere. The outcome of the story is unexpected, like many of the events that take place during the course of the novel. The story is a basic love story, but with a bit of a change to the ending. The ending is to good to give away, but all that can be said is that it is unexpected. It could be happy or it could be sad, it really depends on the way you look at it. The story starts off by introducing the narrator, which really has no change on the outcome of the story line. Then it goes to a flash back of twenty years ago, and that is where the story mostly takes place. The main character, Ethan Frome, and the protagonist of the film fall in love with one of his helpers. The person who stole his heart, Mattie Silver, loves him too. But there is one problem, and that problem is that Ethan is already married to a women name Zenobia Frome, but people call her \\"Zeena\\". The two forbidden lovers are forced to be split up. \\"Zeena\\" is forcing Ethan hire a new worker in place of Mattie, due to \\"Zeena's\\" health problems. Ethan was told to take her away, and on the way they decided to stop. When they stopped they decided to sled, because they had already made previous arrangements. Going into their second run, Mattie proposes an idea, which is to run into a big tree together. By doing this they would escape their lives of heartbreak, and they would be able to die together. While Mattie is moaning, Ethan realizes he doesn't want to die. The story cuts back into present day, when the narrator is at an overnight stay, at the home of the Frome's. The narriorator is introduced to two woman. One of them is his wife, and one of them is a crippled woman named Mattie Silver. I think that this book has a very memorable ending, and is worth reading. Mat Freeman"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I really enjoyed the novel Ethan Frome. The style that Wharton uses really gets the reader involved. The words she uses to describe the way Ethan and Mattie feel about eachother touch your heart. The way she makes Zeena seem, really makes you hate Zeena. Zeena is one of those characters that you just can't feel sorry for no matter how hard you try. Overall, the novel was very well written and really keeps you interested throughout."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I am a student at Lyman Hall High School in Connecticut. I read Ethan From as a project for English class. I loved this book, except it was a little slow to start. I thought Edith Wharton did a wonderful job of describing the love between Ethan and Mattie. I could feel the intensity of their problems and their emotions caused by Zeena. When I was reading the introduction, I had no idea that this was going to be a love story, because my teacher told me little about the plot. I almost didn't want to read the book, because I thought the entire book was going to be about Ethan transporting the narrator back and forth to work. I am glad I went on with the book. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was so tragic when Ethan and Mattie felt so desperate they tried to committ suicide. I am glad they lived, because it would have been so sad if they died. I thought it was so ironic that Zeena rose to the occassion of having to take care of Mattie and Ethan when they were injured, even though she was &quot;sick.&quot; Throughout the entire book, I knew Zeena really wasn't that sick. She just was so wrapped up in herself, she thought she was sicker than she was. What do others think? All in all, I did enjoy this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who like action."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Kind of a Romeo and Juliet......I had to do an author paper on Edith Wharton, and luckily I chose to read Ethan Frome 1st--before any of her other books--or else I would'nt have read any more! It was boring, yet still fast enough to read in a few days. If you've read any other Wharton books, you're probably already scared away--don't be, this is her best."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book reminds me forcefully of the Greek tragedies one reads in college. From the very first pages you can see the calamity coming, but there's nothing anyone can do - not Ethan Frome, the tragic hero of this tale; not the tale's author, Edith Wharton; and certainly not the reader - to prevent it from unfolding.Like a short story, the novel limits itself to just a few characters, a single plot, and a single theme - one even older than Greek tragedy: Ethan Frome, a simple Massachusetts farmer, finds himself married to one woman but in love with another.You see the tragedy coming because such tales never come to a good end in real life either.Frome's tragic flaw (Aristotle requires a fatal flaw, after all) is one that most of us probably share - believing that we have some sort of right to happiness. Alas, as this tale reminds us, fate doesn't always work that way.Edith Wharton delivers the tale starkly, handing the narrative over to her characters and then stepping back to let them tell the tale in their own way. This has the effect of intensifying the feeling of mounting dread, because it eliminates, early on, any hope or expectation of intervention by an empathetic narrator. And since this isn't actually a Greek drama, there isn't much hope of divine intervention either.If catharsis is as good for your soul as the Greeks posited, then you're bound to feel thoroughly cleansed after this well-crafted but bleak tale."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a compelling mysterious tale that takes you back to the days when Ethan Frome was in his early 20's. The book unfolds into a story aimed to explain the cause of a horrific accident. Although this book was captivating, some parts were lacking especially the ending."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is tremendously [bad]. The main character is whiney and unintersting and for some reason Wharton expects us to care about what happens to these whiney self indulgent charaacters. Rediculous. There is no pain except the unnecesary pain the caharcters put on themselves because they are so bored they have nothing better to do. New Englend must be awful.The ending with the sled has to be the most triumphant and undoubtedly funny scenes in all of literature. I personally cheered and laughed out loud. Unfortunatly Wharton wrote it with a straigt face intending none of the humor that is there."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I love Edith Wharton's work. I read it mostly for the mellifluous prose. This book, however, is dull in every sense. The prose are flat and spare. The story is flat and spare. And I hate it. It was boring. Usually her stories are engaging, interesting, and hard to put down. I knew when I bought this book it would be bad. I asked myself, \\"What the hell does Edith Wharton know about indigent peasants?\\" And after reading \\"Ethan Frome\\" I realized she knew nothing! Stick to the glittering affluent New York life that you knew and were a part of. I admire Edith Wharton's attempt to branch out and I'm sure she meant every word she wrote (since apparently her own marriage was falling apart), but the book is still boring. Read any other book by her, especially The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I thoroughly enjoy reading this novel. It is one of the few that I have read more than once. It is short, but it is dynamic. One can read it in an afternoon. The main character is such a pitiful ruin of a man. He had so much potential, but was trapped by family obligations and his strong sense of duty to a dying farm and a cold, unfeeling wife. His last chance for love is destroyed when his selfish, bitter wife decides out of jealousy and revenge to send Ethan's true love away. The lovers decide to die together and even that plan goes awry when the sled they are on does not hit the target properly. The outcome is devastating and heartbreaking. Ethan is even more trapped after the accident and his lover becomes worse than his wife ever was. This story is wonderfully written. It is a story within a story and is a must read for anyone. One can not help but get lost in Ms. Wharton's sad tale. Perhaps this particular story is a bit autobiographical if one chooses to read about Ms. Wharton's life. She, too, lost at love. Look for lots of symbolism in the setting and in her descriptions."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This is probably the worst book I have ever read (in terms of entertainment, I'm sure it might have some good lessons, but what's the point if you don't want to read the book?) I could not even finish it because it was so bad. Slow, depressing, and boring."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I was required to read this book in an English class, almost back-to-back with the Crucible and the Scarlet Letter.

Much cheaper than the school's chosen company to purchase books."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I was simply surprised to find that so many reviewers found this book to be boring! This book is anything but, and the beauty of it is that it's short and easy to read (for all of those with extremely busy schedules)It is a tragic love story but, so goes life. I found the characters to be wholly believable and their trials to be something most of us can or will be able to relate to at some point within our lives.I say, if you are looking to read something that appeals to a vast array of emotions,without having to commit to a 900 page novel, this is worth a try. It only took me one day to read for Christ's sake...what do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome was written by Edith Wharton. I thought the bool was slow going at first and i did not think i was going to enjoy the book to much. The author had teh book moving slow, because the first part of the book was coming from the narrators point of view and mind. The narrator took his time telling us who this man Ethan Frome was and why he was important in the story. ethan was a quiet and odd man to me. He had a smashed up face and was not very sociable if you were to pass him on the street. Ethan had a hard life as a farmer and where they lived farming was not a big part of life, so why he was a farmer wa unclear to me. I did not enjoy te book as much as i had inticipated. I heard the book was good so i was expecting something different out of the book. Zeena was quite crabby so when she was in the parts of the book i did not enjoy it to much either. this is because she seemed to make the other characters around her crabby as well. I did not mind the book once it got going ad had developed more of a setting and inttoduced more characters. Ethan fell in love with Mattie and I was disappointed that they did not end up together. I thought it would have been a good ending. The way the book ended made me mad because it went from them drivig to the flats to them all living miserable together. It was wierd that Mattie went along witj attempting suicide because it was nto of her nature usually. overall the book was not the worst but I expected more of the book. I was suprised too that Zeena was not ill and that she ended up taking care of Ethan and Mattie as well. I guess if nothing else came out of this ending, at least Zeena realized how hard it was to look after someone and that they all survived. Even though they all were miserable, I enjoyed the book when it was faster paced. Ethan Frome was not my favorite book but the ending had a twist that was unexpected. i would have liked it to end with them all finally being happy with their lives."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Before getting to the first page of reviews, I anticipated reading responses from two camps: high school English teachers who adore Ethan Frome, and high school students who wish it were never written. I was amazed to see a range of responses. Some people have written that the novel changed their lives. Some have commented that it's actually a decent read. Others question its emphasis in high school English classes. And some people just plain hate the book.Though I learned to respect the novel, I can understand why others haven't, particularly younger readers. The book is so vastly removed from the lives of most teens that it usually takes a really dynamic instructor to make reading it a successful classroom experience.From the outset, it seems like such a tempting choice to teach. Here we have a classic case of a short literary work that has all the goods: effective imagery, a classic plot line akin to Romeo and Juliet, vibrant symbolism featuring a pickle dish that sits on a high shelf, and above all, the overwhelming sense of tragedy that is so often a popular item in works chosen for high school English classes. And yet, for all its literary panache, thousands of high school students year after year are left puzzled by Ethan Frome, asking: so what?I think one answer to this question is clear. The novel is an effective means of exploring literary devices. It doesn't have any objectionable material, and because it is so short, it is safe and easy to teach. Whether this answer helps to form new generations of avid readers remains a key issue."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I have always had this strange obsession about Ethan Frome. It's very different from Edith Wharton's other novels. This is a very depressing story about love, marriage, duty, desire, and morality. It's a quick read and unbelievably gloomy. But, it's amazingly well-written and captivating. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"\\"Ethan Frome\\" is unlike any other Edith Wharton novel, yet it is perhaps one of the most widely read of her works, and for good reason. Not to shortchange her other novels, but \\"Ethan Frome\\" holds a unique place within American literary history and it is a story, simple in concept and feeling, that has universal appeal. A bleak and lonely tale of tragedy, \\"Ethan Frome\\" is both beautiful and haunting, a story that will stay with the reader long after they have finished reading it.The story begins (and ends) with a sort of narrative framing device. An outsider to the town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, longs to know the tragic tale surrounding Ethan Frome, a scarred man who drives the narrator around town. Pieced together from what other townspeople have to say and a bleak winter night spent in the Frome household, the narrator pieces together the tragedy that befell Ethan. Ethan, seven years younger than his wife Zeena whom he married after she had nursed his dying mother, has begun to feel the insularity of their isolated life. Zeena is constantly sick and Ethan can barely scratch an existence out of their meager farm. Yet when Zeena's cousin, Mattie Silver, comes to stay with them, Ethan is awakened from his langor by an unexpected love for his wife's cousin. Doomed to keep his love secret, Ethan finds that he cannot do so, especially when a suspicious Zeena threatens to send Mattie away. Ethan has few options, for he doesn't have the money to run away with Mattie and support her, nor does he wish for anyone within the town to think poorly of him. The actions he does decide to take change the course of all three lives forever.Readers know from the very beginning that something very tragic has happened to Ethan Frome, yet it is only as the narrator pieces together the tale of his loveless, cold marriage and his budding love for Mattie, that they begin to sense what may have happened to this shattered wreck of a man. Wharton's story is fast-paced, as if the words were being told to readers direcly by Ethan himself, and there is a lyrical beauty that underlies the bleak, desolate lives of these three unhappy creature. It is easy to see why \\"Ethan Frome\\" has had such an enduring legacy within American literature."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Here I am at age 75 and had never read this book, though I had read House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence--both since age 65! I was introduced to Wharton by my wife and took to her immediately (as I was introduced to and took to Willa Cather late in life. Of course, my wife is not a professional academic and can read what she wants. This novel took me over from the first page. Wharton's masterly inweaving of the metaphor of snow and bitter cold into the tale of a bitterly cold relationship between a generous and kind husband and his bitter, hard, manipulative wife gripped and overwhelmed me, as did the role of the hapless and innocent Mattie. In 150 pages we have one of the great works of American fiction. Why do I let people talk me into reading trash, like the Da Vinci code?"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Last week I joined, at the urging of Love at First Book, the Classics Club. What this means is that I vow to read at least 50 classics in 50 years (see my list here). Because classics come with the stigma of being heavy and daunting, I started out with Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton because it's short and I've never read her. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the classics (Pride & Prejudice and Tess of the D'Urbervilles are in my top ten favorite books), but it has been a while since I have read one.Ethan Frome is a story that pits love against duty, demonstrating that the two are not necessarily the same thing. It is, quite possibly, one of the most depressing stories I have ever read. There wasn't anything catastrophic, per se, but the quiet desperation of Ethan and Mattie was palpable and it broke my heart. Because the story was published in 1911, I imagine the outcome is very different than what it would be if it were written today. This is not a book with a predictably happy ending, and yet it will draw out your sympathetic side.All in all, it was not a bad way to start off the Classics Club."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Literature, in 1921, the first woman to win the award, for her workThe Age of Innocence. Most of her works, and she wrote over 40, including the Pulitzer Prize winner, concern New York society. Ethan Frome is a notable exception, set in rural western Massachusetts, on a farm not all that far from the fictional, and aptly named village of Starkfield. This book was first published in 1911; the novel's time period is unspecified, but must be around the turn of the century (yes, that century, the commencement of the 20th.) The setting, the weather, and the people are bleak and morose. It is a hard-scrabble existence, with financial calamity never far away. As stereotypical New Englanders, the three principal characters are taciturn to a fault: a grunt here, a monosyllabic answer there. There is Ethan Frome, his wife Zeena, and her cousin, Mattie Silver.This book is a good introduction to Wharton. It is a novella that can be read in one setting. It is a well-structured and finely woven story, with a thread of dramatic suspense that commences on page 2, with a denouement not until the very end. It is a story within a story. At the very beginning one learns that Frome has been injured in a \\"smash-up\\" that occurred 24 years earlier. He must be around 50, but looks twice his age. Then the flashback tale is told, from the earlier time, of the events that led to the \\"smash-up.\\" Frome is still in his 20's; his wife is seven years his elder, and \\"sickly.\\" They met when Zeena was caring for his sickly mother. Mattie Silver is Zeena's youthful cousin who has come to help on the farm, and assist Zeena. As all good wives can, she can sense the threat from a more youthful and vivacious rival, and commences a plan to remove the \\"competition.\\" The plot evolves against, and reflects the dire climate, and the direr financial struggle of eking out an existence on the stony land. Wharton presents a sympathetic portrait of Frome's dilemma, as well Mattie Silver aspirations. Zeena comes across less favorably.Ah, the ending, is both predictable, and then it's not, a real reflection of Wharton's story telling ability, as well as her insights into the human condition, and the need to be, well, needed. This is one of those \\"school assignment\\" books, as reflected by the current 36 1-star reviews (ah, I can get the teacher back...!). If the teacher could only assign these 1-starers to, say, pick lettuce in the Imperial Valley of California for a year, and learn something of real life, and then read the book. It could be an effective program of remediation, and even raise Wharton's star score, though she is long beyond caring. I AM glad I dodged this as a school assignment, learned something of life, and can now appreciate Wharton's skill and insights. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Few books capture New England as well as this one does. Moreover, it captures the innocence of youth with the reality of maturity. This is a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is not considered typical of the Wharton oeuvre. Published in 1911, it is short and the rural setting is as much or more of a factor bearing tragedy than the rigid social convention Wharton skewered in The House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence. And there is something else that sets Ethan Frome apart from Wharton's other novels: the author addresses the reader in a preface in which she sets out the risks she took in portraying a character who is a product of the harsh winter landscape of New England and the difficulty of revealing the story of a man seemingly as silent as the granite outcroppings that surround him. She needn't have worried.What she did was to use a narrator who arrives on the scene as a stranger to the rural outpost of Starkfield, Massachusetts. A civil engineer working on a power plant project, he is struck by a silent, limping figure about town--that's Ethan Frome. He gets sketchy details about Frome from his landlady and the postmaster, something about a tragic smash up years before, but it isn't until the engineer and Frome are caught in a storm together and take refuge in the latter's farmhouse that the story comes into focus, one that begins shortly before the accident, when Frome was still young but honoring marriage vows to a controlling hypochondriac wife. When her young, pretty relative arrives to attend to her, Frome's heart is tempted.Wharton delivers a long ago America in shattering clarity, defined by the terrain, the isolation and a code of morality that are as much fully drawn characters in this drama as are the human beings. Wharton's style is clear, and her exercise of symbolism, setting, character, plot and perspective are brilliant."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"\\"Ethan Frome\\" is easily Edith Wharton's most accessible work, and I believe her most relevant. I challenge any reader to read this text and not see a bit of themselves in some of the plot devices.Wharton sets this frame story in the middle of a desolate and dreary landscape and her evocation of the harsh environment easily surrounds the reader and forces us to succumb to the numbing depression and pain that the main characters feel. This text is essentially a three character study and although there is little \\"action\\" to speak of it carries the reader along at a good clip. I have never read this book, or talked about it with other readers, when we were not all gripped from the beginning with the novel's ambiguities and tensions.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is also a novel that is endlessly debatable and regardless of one's final perspective it will leave you casting about with a void in your heart. Beware; a reader will feel the pangs of recognition, or the fellowship of sympathy, upon completing this text. Either way, it will stay with you long after you set it down.This is an excellent choice for students or book clubs. It is not a long or difficult read and the novel is wonderfully symbolic and suspenseful in just the right places."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton is best remembered for the classics, The House of Mirth and the Age of Innocence. Ethan Frome is a short work (130 pages) that details the tragic life of a simple man. The book begins with an untitled chapter which shows Frome in middle age as a man defeated by life. He goes about the town of Starkfield, Massachusetts in a grim and largely silent fashion. This chapter, narrated by an unnamed character, mentions his \\"smashup\\" and sets the tone for the story to follow.The story itself begins with the next chapter and starts with the young Frome, a struggling farmer and mill owner, unhappily married to a slightly older woman, Zeena. He married her largely out of gratitude for her caring for his sickly mother until she died. But Zeena herself becomes sickly and theirs is a marriage in name only. Into this drab situation comes Zeena's cousin, Mattie Silver, to help Zeena around the house. Mattie is joyful and innocent and Ethan grows to love her and their relationship, although not overt, grows. But Zeena resents Mattie and criticizes her constantly. Then Zeena leaves to visit a doctor and Mattie and Ethan have one evening alone. They spend it quietly but it is clear they love each other. On Zeena's return she states that the doctor told her she is very ill and needs a \\"hired girl\\" and that Mattie must leave. The stage is now set for the tragic results that follow.While unrelievedly tragic, Ethan Frome is well worth reading. The scenes between Mattie and Ethan are touching and show an innocence that is rarely found in modern novels. It bears some resemblance to The Scarlet Letter in that it is set in New England and involves a forbidden love. But unlike Hawthorne, Wharton gives us no hope at the end except a lonely and broken man living out his days."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is the downer of the century. Just when you think something is going to happen BAM!!!! the book is over. I accidently finished the book. Thats pathetic! Most fiction has a rising action that is not present in this book. Its a great book about nothing."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I believe this is one of if not the worst book ever writen. The stroy goes no where.

I was forced to read this for my English class, and that was the only reason I even finished it. I kept expecting it to get better. I was mistaken. This is definitely Wharton's weak point. There was no real story to this book. If you enjoy short, meaningless, redundant tales than you will like this book. No offense to the countless others who like this book; I guess I'm missing the appeal! DON'T READ."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"It was allright, I liked when that thing happened to that guy"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This stands as the longest work of \\"literature\\" I have ever been forced to read. Not due to the page count, as it is actually rather (mercifully) short; it is merely the most monotonous and plodding work of fiction ever published, in any language. When I read the book, I had hoped for a punchline - at some point the story would actually take form and progress. Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch. Its only merit is that it is a prime example of what aspiring writers should NEVER produce. If this book were distributed in Guantanamo, Amnesty International would object, and rightly so. This is the pinnacle of academic torture, and those who assign it should be investigated, very closely."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book sucks. If this was the first book by Wharton that someone has read, they probably won't read any of her others, which is totalluy wrong, because she is a great author. This particular book however, is far to depressing and boring to be on the top of anyone's list. It is so boring that sometimes you can be reading the boo, yet not taking any in, and when you &quot;wake up&quot; you find yourself lost, not knowing where you are in relation to where you left off. It is my beleif that this book probably loses most of its readers after the first few chapters."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Sometimes look at the thousands of generic love novels resting on a shelf in K-mart. They are almost identical in form: each cover has a beautiful girl, and a well-built man with his shirt off. When you read them, all of the discriptions and allusions are the same, and the characters always have sex at the end.

Many people can relate to Ethan's situation of loving someone else, when they are already married to somebody. This plot is very captivating and because of this the reader connects with the characters. The characters in the story are very relatable, for example Ethan's shyness toward telling Mattie that he loved her, this relates to some guys today. To make the story more interesting Ethan should have followed through with his plans of running away to stay with Mattie. I also thought it a surprise that all three of the main characters Ethan, Zeena and Mattie ended up living together at the end of the book. I recommend this book to anyone but more toward women because its a love story."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I am in High School and between having to read such junk, yes junk, as Great Expectations and To Kill a Mockingbird, I squeeze in as much of my own reading as I can(I have been reading a lot of Hubert Selby Jr. lately, he is simply one of the best authors to ever live.) I chose this over some other old book and to my surprise I loved Ethan Frome. Classic usually means crack-pot author griping about humans in a boring way to me, but Ethan Frome is not your average &quot;classic.&quot;The best thing Frome is comparable to is the atmospheric and moody inde films of today. Films such as Panic, with William H Macy, who would make a good Ethan From by the way, since Frome is imploding the entire time...anyhoo, this book has a mood, an atmosphere, a set tone, that is very odd in classics.

It is one of the only books that I can actually say I love having been forced to read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"&quot;Ethan Frome&quot; kept me in the dark the entire time I was reading until the very last page. The narrator, who remains nameless throughout the novel, introduces the reader to Ethan Frome, the main character, and tells the reader of his &quot;smash-up.&quot; He describes the scars on his face and how Ethan's right leg is shorter than the left, and I was compelled to read the entire book to find out what the &quot;smash-up&quot; was and why it happened. After the introduction from the narrator's point of view, chapter one takes you twenty years back in time and begins to tell the story of Ethan's poor, miserable life, which is the main portion of the book. You learn about his wife Zeena, whom he quickly married when his mother died because he couldn't imagine being alone. Mattie Silver, Zeena's cousin, comes to the home to care for Zeena when she becomes weak with prolonged illness. Ethan quickly falls in love with the younger, more beautiful Mattie, and is surprised to find she loves him too. But he is unable to pursue a relationship due to his marriage and his poverty. At the end of the novel, Ethan and Mattie make a desperate attempt to avoid having to separate forever. The outcome of this final attempt results in Ethan's &quot;smash-up&quot; and ends up binding them both to Zeena for the rest of their pitiful lives.

An objective narrator gradually learns the excruciating details of the wasted life of Starkfield's loneliest recluse. Ethan Frome at 54 is a physical wreck of a man--an impoverished farmer, who bears unspeakable burdens in his tortured heart. He has sacrificed everything to honor what he considers family responsibilities.Torn between loyalty to a sour, hypochondriac of a wife, Ethan struggles hopelessly against the tide of his mounting attraction to youthful Mattie--his wife's poor relation who has come to live with them. Does the delightful girl return his love? Does cruel Zeena suspect and plot to separate them? How can a professional invalid compete with the zest and fire of her cousin? Facing a lifetime of crippling emotional loss, in a lover's despair Ethan finally rebels against the harshness of his fate by seeking to shape his own destiny. But the &quot;smash up&quot; results in shocking and unexpected consequences for the uneasy &quot;menage a trois.&quot; This tortured tale of forbidden love will capture the imagination of mature readers as a grim, psychological novella about the desperate needs of the human heart."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"If you've read other Wharton works, you suspect her denouement in a case of forbidden love, but nonethless, &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is compelling to read.

Let me tell you this was a very book but what I didnt understand is what the red pickle dish symbolized.I will remember through high school and I hope to purchase this book as soon as possible. If you have read this book and would like to fill me in please do and e-mail me at jet396@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is not an exciting or thrilling novel, but it was interesting. It was an interesting book because the author would often add in new informations to the story of Ethan's life that the readers would not have expected. The author goes into great details to explain what it is like for Ethan to live with both Zeena and Mattie. The details make the readers to really imagine what is going on in the novel. The imagination causes the novel to be more realistic in a sense that people can relate to the problems Ethan has in his life. He's problem started after his mother died and when Mattie came to help, which led to his problem his love life, which everybody can relate to. The book was also interesting because the way the author wrote the novel. The author made us think about why Zeena, Mattie, and Ethan end up doing what they did. In order to understand the chapters, the readers had to analyze it thoroughly. This novel was also boring because there was no excitment in the plot. The only thing that made the book less boring was when Mattie and Ethan was considering to attempt a suicide and also when they do actually crash into palm tree. That was the only thrill in the novel."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Plowing through this novel was as arduous and monotonous as the long snowy carriage rides from Ethan's homestead to the town of Starkfield. Did I just complete a grueling meditation retreat? It was mercifully short, though, not even 140 pages, and it does offer glimmers of intellectual satisfaction amidst the text's long zazen session. Most of the character descriptions pop off the page with vividness. Mattie's way of \\"throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out\\" was pure literary gold, and the various ponderous descriptions of Ethan's countenance, that he had a \\"moral isolation too remote for casual access\\" and could feel \\"huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things\\" served as charitable descriptions of a man with Job-like tragedy in his life. Overall, if you are budgeting just one Edith Wharton novel for your reading list, I wouldn't choose Ethan Frome."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is very well written and heartfelt, but realize this is NOT a book you read when you need cheering up! If you wish to explore human emotion, however, this is a great way to explore that through fiction. Good read!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome was given to me many years ago, and remains a favorite. Probably the most spare, relentless and incredibly human story of unrequited love in American literature. The male point of view of an unfulfilled marriage is impeccably drawn by Edith Wharton, and the reader's sympathy for Ethan Frome grows with each page. Of course the New England winter setting adds the grip of cold and darkness to the fictional town of Starkfield, and the character of Mattie Silver so bright and warm in contrast to the worn and manipulative Zenobia -- one can not read this book without strongly felt heart activity."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton is a pretty good book. It is about a young man working really hard to make almost nothing. He has a bitter, \\"sickly\\" wife named Zeena who brings her cousin, Mattie, in to help her around the house. With Mattie being a young, beautiful, vibrant girl, Ethan, of course, falls in love with her. When Zeena decides to let Mattie go, Ethan can't stand the idea of her leaving. The pair run into a tree while sledding in an attempt to die together so they never have to be apart.The plot of this book was very interesting however the constant describing of things I didn't care to hear that much about, such as the landscape, made the book difficult for me to get into. I was also hoping the story would be a little bit juicier. Until the end there was nothing that really surprised me or stood out.I did like the way the book was set up. It starts in the present with a woman who tries to find out the story of what happened to Ethan years ago. When she ends up staying at his house one night because of a blizzard is when she finds out the story. I liked this because it gives the reader a view of Ethan after everything that happened to him. It made me more interested to find out what caused him to be this way.Although I didn't enjoy this book a ton, it was well written. For readers who do enjoy a lot of description, Edith Wharton did it very well. She had a great choice of words that create a vivid picture in your mind. For readers who are more like me and prefer to hear more about what's going on and less about what the scenery looks like, this book is pretty good but not so good I would want to read it over and over."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This is a short story of a love triangle forcing a man to choose between his sick wife and her cousin. For being written in 1911, it is not the worst book ever published, but today's readers who are experiencing it for the first time will find it dull and lifeless. Compared to other writings of the time, it is enjoyable and succinct, not adding extra fluff in an attempt to make it more interesting."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Sometimes love can be frustrating, as illustrated by this classic tale. A man locked in a loveless marriage finds passion with another woman, but must restrain his feelings."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"published in 1911, this, i can guess, was no feel good hit of the summer. this is dark stuff about the loneliness of a man ensnared by the hard life of a turn of the century farm, with a hypochondriac wife who allows no place for joy in their lives. enter a ray of light: the wife's cousin, hired for household duties. ethan frome is smitten. things do not go well. for all the sadness this work radiates, it is beautifully atmospheric and captures a time and place with vividly drawn characters. edith wharton is a masterful novelist who you should certainly read. this is just not a cheerful tale, for sure. like many of life's tales."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Also, it's quite a quick read for anyone wishing to re-enter the world of classic literature.

He falls in love with Zeena's cousin (Mattie) who is staying with them in order to help out, and because she needs a place to live. Tragic results ensue when Zeena attempts to rid herself of Mattie and take on a new hired girl.I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The novel, Ethan Frome, by Edith Wharton is a very exciting and eventful story. It tells of a man, Ethan, who is destined to a life of caring for others. Before their deaths, he cared for his ill parents and now is caring for his seemingly ill wife. His wife's cousin, Mattie, comes to live with he and his wife and Ethan falls in love with her. Seeing this as his only way to escape his fateful life of taking care of his spouse, they dare to leave together. I believe that Edith Wharton's novel is full of suspense and passion, which also contains an ending that is unforgettable.The author is telling the story of a very unhappy man. Mattie gives him a sense of youth and fun that attracts Ethan to her. When his wife comes to the conclusion that Mattie may be a threat, she sends her away. When Ethan realizes he cannot live and be happy with Mattie, they decide that they will die together. In their attempt, something tragic and unsuspected happens. This shows that when one is faced with a problem, many people believe it is easier to avoid it than actually deal with it. Wharton's theme shown here is very evident and true. This is just one theme of many that are present in her work.Wharton's work is very well-written and has made me a big fan of her writing. Her way of expressing the themes of her writing is very unique and informative. I believe that Ethan Frome is a wonderful novel with great themes and concepts."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"&quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is the story of a married man who is in love with another woman, but it has an ending so shockingly original and confounding that any review that mentions the premise risks giving the wrong impression. In setting and characterization, it is far removed from Edith Wharton's normal milieu of the New York upper class, but it is just as thematically grave and as beautifully written as her best work.The place is a small town in rural Massachussetts called Starkfield and the title character is a relatively poor and unassuming man who owns an unprofitable farm and a sawmill. He is unhappily married to a woman named Zeena, his cousin actually, an obvious hypochondriac who complains of an unidentifiable illness and is almost always bedridden. Ethan is attracted to her younger cousin Mattie, who is living with them to nurse Zeena and perform the household chores, and the interest is mutual but the prognosis is bleak. Zeena stands in the way of their illicit love and, after an incident involving a broken dish she treasured dearly, gives Mattie her walking papers with the intention of hiring a new girl. Ethan considers that he could run away with Mattie, but he is too conscientious about Zeena to leave her alone on the farm unable to support herself. How he and Mattie decide to resolve this dilemma is startling and even a little sickening, with an outcome that is as unforgettable as it is unforeseeable, for the lovers as well as for the readers.Wharton's cleverness is evident in this short novel's highly effective structure, which maximizes suspense without introducing much extraneous detail. The &quot;main&quot; story is sandwiched by that of a nameless first-person narrator who, while sojourning in Starkfield, becomes fascinated by Ethan's mystique and the legend of his &quot;smash-up&quot; and, befriending the man, imagines in flashback the events that explain his present state. As expected with Wharton, the writing itself is a model of effortlessly mellifluent but economical prose which endows the story with a satisfying brevity and a palpable tension among its desperate characters."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome is one of modern fiction's great short works . This is true not because of the story, which is the age-old one of forbidden love, but because of the stark, bleak, but ultimately beautiful way in which it is told. Set against the dark backdrop of the late nineteenth-century New England countryside, this novella tells the story of the title character, a splendid and complex creation; his domineering, tyrannical wife; and her cousin Mattie, whom Ethan falls for in his despair. Ethan is a wonderful creation, a multi-faceted person full of emotion, complexities, and the inherent contradictions that make up all of us. He is a distinctly human, believable character, and Wharton makes us feel for him. The strength of her characterization and the beauty of her prose make us feel both sympathetic to the character of Ethan and to the growing love between him and Mattie. It is also a testament to Wharton's virtuosity that she makes us positively loathe Zeena, Ethan's Wife, even though she is not, when one stops to actually think about it, a very despicable character! This story, though short, is loaded with the kind of piercing psychological insight that has led many to label Wharton a female Henry James. This is selling her short, however; she has her own worthwhile style. She must also be commended for not taking the easy path as a female writer. Writing part of the book in the first-person from a man's point of view, featuring a male character as the protagonist, and making one of the main female characters an antagonist were all daring and brave. Her prose is starkly beautiful, describing the barren landscape and navigating the minefield of Ethan's mind with equal ease and latent beauty. The ending, though, is an absolute shocker. I was emotionally turbulent for a long while afterward; the denouement affected me in the way that no other book has save Nevil Shute's On The Beach. This is a great piece of art and one of the classic short works of American literature from one of the greatest female writers of all-time."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Yes, yes. No kidding. Found this book this year. Maybe four months ago. No one mentioned it to me. Just one of those random choices at the bookstore during a random visit. Just a random choice of a book I'd not yet read.

She paints such vivid, lovely, yet desperate images with words; you can envision the blue colors of the snow of New England so clearly. The greatest strength of this novella is its character portrayal. Wharton makes the reader care so much for Ethan and Mattie...and even feel the great sadness of Zeena's life. The reader leaves this story with a greater amount of compassion for the needs and longings of fellow humans."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a novel carved from black ice. It is a tragedy unalleviated by humor, with nothing to ease the iron grip of a malign Fate. Superbly written, uncompromisingly tragic, full of striking and memorable winter landscape imagery, with an ending that is unexpected and thought-provoking, it is undeniably great literature. I just felt that the profound sadness of the tale somehow compromised the artistic integrity. Edith Wharton experienced much sorrow in her own life and I think this somewhat narrowed her vision. So be prepared for a novel that will move you, impress you and stay with you, but is not likely to put a smile on your face or a spring in your step!In the same vein, look for Gillian Anderson's astonishing performance in the movie version of Wharton's \\"The House of Mirth\\" (a misnomer if ever there was). Not always easy to take, it is tragic acting at its brilliant best."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This spare, brilliantly observed, psychologically astute, and mercifully short novel by Edith Wharton (who \\"writes like Henry James if he were a man,\\" to quote Northampton poet Connely Ryan!) is an acute observation of hopeless love between eponymous heroEthan Frome and Mattie, his wife's cousin, a girl struck with poverty when her ambitious father (who moves from the hilltowns to Connecticut) dies in debt. The action is pieced together in a \\"vision of [Ethan Frome's] story\\" by an intelligent , relativelysophisticated visitor to the small town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. (Wharton, who writes an introduction only to this of all her books, describes her use of this literary device to make plausible the narrator's unwinding of the tale.) Frome's handsome but totally dejected looks, and limp, captivate thevisitor/narrator--we know something horrible has happened, but not what, and the suspense thus created is happily unwound by the reader turning pages. Wharton's simple story of mutual unrequited love is indeed a masterful combination of time-encapsulated New England vernacular, emotional insight into the taciturn, easily bruised male ego, and Chekovlike descriptions of frozen landscapes that nonetheless have more life in them than the majority of Starkfield's sickly inhabitants. She impresses upon us the way the awful landscape literally sucks the townspeople in, turning them in the end into tombstones, nature's bookmarks above the dead and frozen bones. Ethan Frome would like nothing better than to escape from his wife, a kind of sallow-faced silent henpecker, a sickly woman, expert in home remedies, seven-years-older than Frome but \\"already an old woman.\\" The contrast between Wharton's descriptions of ugly Zenobia and beautiful young Mattie are striking, and the unrequited love and lust between the forbidden lovers, although it dies on the vine, is presented with such masterful delicacy that the very absence of sex here is more sensuous than many a modern graphic display. Heartbreakingly poignant, this perfectly realized novella, despite its simplicity, captures the indomitable power of the 19th century landscape to turn to ice even the most ardent hearts and truest tears."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome was well written with some great symbolism, but didn't really have much of a story. This book could have been summed up in 20 pages. It had this little story that was stretched out for about 200 pages, which made it really boring. It goes by really slow with little going on. &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; by Edith Wharton is much better. If you're going to read one of her books, you should read that over &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Trapped in a loveless marriage to an invalid wife, New England farmer Ethan Frome's colorless existence changes when his wife's enchanting cousin, Mattie Silver, comes to visit and help out on the farm. Ethan finds himself paying attention to his appearance and wanting Mattie to admire him. The forbidden attraction grows when Ethan's nag of a wife, Zeena, leaves home for a brief period. Wharton makes Ethan and Mattie's plight achingly optionless, and her observations of human behavior are, as usual, dead on. Although Wharton is best known for her novels about New York high society, &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; remains not just my favorite Wharton novel--but also one of my favorite &quot;classics.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This classic by Edith Wharton features two powerful lessons for young people: 1) Don't be in any rush to get married - someone better might come along, and 2) Suicide is not necessarily the free ride that people make it out to be. These lessons aside, there really isn't much to the story. Ethan is a proud New Englander torn between his loyalty for his sickly, antagonistic wife, and the fresh and desirable young Mattie with whom he is falling in love. Overall, the story moves pretty slowly, building towards one final, selfish act. There really isn't a lot of subtle insight into Ethan's personality - he's far more one-dimensional than is commonly recognized, and the novel suffers from being overripe with melodrama. This book might be popular among teen-aged 'drama queens' who may be impressed with the way that Ethan's deeply felt emotions and weakness for the Grand Gesture echo their own personal longings for a passionate life (or possibly mate), but many readers will find this story either pointlessly depressing (the romantics), or an exemplar for brutal divine justice (the moralists). With its excessive seriousness and self-importance, no wonder so many high school students are turned off by classic literature. This story's setting seems as far removed from the 21st Century as Robinson Crusoe, and the plot scarcely merits more than a good short story. Understandably, the modern high school needs to teach books that make valid points and use literary devices, etc., but if these books completely fail to entertain, we risk raising a generation of young people for whom reading fiction is a tedious chore rather than a treasured opportunity."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton is a pretty good book! Ethan marries Zeena, because Zeena was taking care of his sick mother. Ethan had no way of repaying her for her work, so he married Zeena.

Zeena has some clue that their is something going on between them. She tells Ethan that she is going to send Mattie away and bring someone who is more helpful. Ethan doesn't want her to leave and he wants to leave with her, but doesn't have enough money. While Ethan is taking Mattie to the train station they stop and get on a sleigh one last time.

At the novel's inception, he is in love with a younger woman living with them, and this relationship constitutes the bulk of the novel. Wharton explores the psychological dimensions of the relaitonship as they try to work around their awkward circumstances while trying to engage their powerful emotions for one another.To me, I think the strength of this book rests flat out in its brilliant portrayal of what it is like to be a man, trying to connect with a women he loves. I think this is an excellent book for both men and women, and I firmly believe it can even improve relationships by enhancing couple's understanding of each other. Wharton presents the characters in ways that I think women can relate to. As I read this, I felt none of the shallow quarrels we typically find between men and women in popular culture, and I left certain that both genders can learn about each other much more if they would only take novels such as this one seriously."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is short enough to be read in one sitting, and is probably best enjoyed in one sitting. It portrays a turning point in the lives of three people, a married couple and the young attractive woman who has come to live with them.The novel covers only a few days in their lives, but captures the sad suffocating life, the way in which their weakness traps them into making decisions which instead of freeing them, will further ensnare them.The beauty of the novel comes in the portrayal of the characters and the town that they inhabit. The language Ms. Wharton uses is lovely and heavy, perfectly suited to her characters and their ultimate downfall.This is the first book I've read by Edith Wharton, but I'm now looking forward to reading &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;House of Mirth&quot;. Although the author seems to specialize in unhappy endings....her writing is so good, you'll keep coming back for more."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I believe that this story brings you into a different setting that you might not be in at the time. When I first started to read the book, it became very uninteresting and I couldn't concentrate at all.

The plot, like so many of her stories, centers around an impossible love which ends without consummation of any sort. The book drags in a vast white expanse of New England snow and hopelessness. In a time where women are usually the ones &quot;trapped&quot; into marriage, it was interesting to see the tables turned for poor Ethan, but overall the story seemed contrived and predictable with an overly melodramatic end. I feel very lucky that I tried other Edith Wharton novels after reading this one first, as I would have missed out on a fantastic view into the inner workings of high society through the Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth. This is arguably her worst novel and I would advise steering clear. The most interesting aspect any of us in our class could light upon was all the color symbolism. In the white snowy expanse of the environment every color had a meaning even down to the color of Mattie's hair ribbon. Still not enough to justify the time spent unfortunately.

The ending is so shocking, the reader will be left absolutely stunned. A must read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"As much as I enjoy reading it was only recently that I read \\"Ethan Frome.\\" So WHAT IS IT in a nutshell?Wow! A tale of a good man who can't seem to get a break. I believe the author would have us walk away from this novel assuming that Ethan earnestly strove to do what was right. I don't want to give too much away for those who may not as of yet read this book. I'll just say that I felt that had Ethan Frome been a REAL man rather than a fictional character that in the real world I would have loved this man and felt his life was a true tragedy.I indeed intend to re-read this great story. I would say it is one of the better tragedies I've read. I would say that my least favorite character would be Ethan's wife Zeena. The author does a fine job of painting a portrait of Zeena. Obviously a review is but one's opinion and there may assuredly be those who would disagree with me. While Zeena's character herself is a tragic character...the way the author tells Zeena's story evoked little compassion from me. However with that said I should add that Zeena's character finds a degree of redemption in my mind by the way this tale finally unfolds.Ethan Frome really should be read by ALL. Whether literary tragedies is a genre you like or not...THIS should be A MUST READ for all who truly value great literature. I'll add also that I really expected at some point for the unnamed narrator of this tale to be REVEALED by some name but was not. I am now interested in checking out other works by the author.Again...I really enjoyed this story but I concede that \\"some\\" may see the beginning to start a little slow. Eh! That too is a matter of opinion. I couldn't think of anything I would have CUT from the story. I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone. If you're looking for a light-hearted & happy story then PASS ON THIS ONE but if you're looking for a story of years gone by that is more realistic than so many \\"happy ending\\" tales...a story that could be read by 3 friends & presumably all 3 have different opinions of the major characters...a story that is a bit dark...then THIS is the tale for you to check out.Ethan Frome...thumbs up to this great character and great tale."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Wharton delivers a mastery of stone-cold character development that illustrates what isolation, guilt and love-lust can do to our souls. Brilliant novella."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I read about three dozen books a year. This is possibly the most beautifully told story I've ever read. I read it about 6 years ago and I still feel the tug of my heart whenever I think about it."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction. People can fall in love, but rarely do things turn out well.But but few of even her books can evoke the feeling of \\"Ethan Frome,\\" whick packs plenty of emotion, vibrancy and regrets into a short novella. While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality. Not a stereotypical shrew.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a true tragedy -- as beautifully written as it is, it's still Wharton's description of how a man merely survives instead of living, hopeless and devastated."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"When trying to figure out what book it was that I wanted to read, I looked for certain qualities such as: emotional roller coasters, secrecy, romance, and turmoil. For those reasons, it is why I chose to read Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton.Ethan Frome is the type of book that will keep you in suspense for the entire book, and have you dying for more.Written in first and second point of view, Ethan Frome is about a semi-young man who lives a miserable life with his sickly wife Zeena. Meanwhile, Ethan is living a fantasy in his mind with his wife's younger cousin, Mattie.At first, when you begin reading Ethan Frome, you notice that there are many instances of silence occurring. I never seemed to pay attention to it, but when I noticed it finally I realized that it was for major significance. For example when Ethan told Mattie that there was a possibility that she would be leaving, \\"he looked at her and pressed her against him so closely that he seemed to feel her warmth in his veins\\" (32.) You don't hold someone that close if you don't actually feel something more for him or her. When I read that part, it made me contemplate whether or not Mattie and Ethan secretly had a relationship. Another theme that is of major occurrence is his fantasies or hopes that Ethan has. When Zeena finally left to go pick up her medication, Ethan had already begun, \\"picturing what it would be like that evening when he and Mattie were there after supper...they would sit there, one on each side of the stove, like a married couple\\" (42). Its as if this is not even a dream, but more of an imaginative plan that he's working on. \\"It is exquisitely written by an author with remarkable observations and imagination.\\" I completely agree because Edith Wharton has a way of writing to convey to her audience the slight and sutel glances of flirtation between Ethan and Mattie that would still be hidden if not for her vivid descriptions.Ethan Frome is the best book that you could ever read. It has a mixture of love, hate, lies, and betrayal of the heart. This book will take you on a mind-blowing ride that will keep you wondering about what's going to happen next.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The story is somewhat sickening, with rather cruel punishment of the main characters coming together in an ironic way in the end. But this is a very interesting period piece set in the mountain villages of New England, perhaps in the late 1800s or early 1900s, Wharton's lifetime, and revealing the moral beliefs, harsh environment, and lives of the fairly poor... fatalistic lives in which they feel little choice. Even though I didn't exactly enjoy it, considering its bleakness at many levels, I couldn't put it down. It made me feel very grateful for my life, with so many freedoms and choices, and so much personal power compared to these characters.A minor complaint is that the author either overuses, under-uses, or misuses commas and semi-colons. Because punctuation influences the readability, I notice these details. She also refers to women as girls, and men as men, which is still common today."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton's short novel may not have the dimensions of her \\"Age of innocence\\" work when it comes to social codes, love and loss, but it is such a gem! the esoteric quest for love which may come with pain and isolation is magnificent."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a wonderful book about a tragic love story.

I recommend this story because it teaches you many morals and it is written clearly."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"To the dismay of many young, bright, energetic high school English students, this is perhaps the poorest possible example of American literature. Ethan, a depressed, pathetic man whose life is repetitive and uninteresting, stars in this book as its main character. His life, disappointment after disappointment, is slowly retold to the reader. It is bad enough that Ms. Wharton has chosen a main character which no human could admire--a man who has destroyed himself of his own free will. However, the worst part of this book is the way Ms. Wharton tells her story: page after page of pointless, obscure symbolism. Additionally, her characters are all wonderfully stupid. Their choices and actions seem irrelevant to their surroundings and desires, which gives the reader a sense of unreality, as if such writing should not and could not exist. If you are fond of understanding the motivations of the main characters in books you read, Ethan Frome is certainly not for you. The climax of this book was its best moment, not because it was serious or thought-provoking, but rather for its unintentional yet copious humor. The climax was the culmination of terrible symbolism and irrational behavior which should make any intelligent person burst out laughing on the spot. This uninspiring book has one positive point: its brevity. Having been forced to read such terrible literary works as Great Expectations, the shortness of this worthless book is a very welcome change. Thus, I give it 2 stars. My overall recommendation: avoid Ethan Frome like the plague."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed, you will be after reading this novel. Seriously, I did not find the novel either a) beautiful or b) worth reading. Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong. The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors. Perhaps, if the storyline of the book were my life, it would depress me very much. The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable, but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact. I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel, unless you have a flair for masochism."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book was the most uneventful book I have ever read.

To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending.

While normally I wouldn't watch the movie, the book is wonderfully written and engrossing. There's love, tragedy, a surprise ending, and a heavy dosage of emotion evoking scenery - a great story.Ethan From is a young man who is stuck in life. At the beginning of the 20th century, he must work hard, love hard, and deal with the struggles of life. He is virtually a slave to his hypochondriac wench of a wife, who constantly blocks Ethan's every possibility for enjoyment of fulfillment in life. He's a prisoner to his responsibilities, and combined with the restrictions of hard winters, it's sapping his strength.Ethan's life changes when his wife's cousin comes to stay with them. Since his sickly wife, Zeena, \\"can't\\" do any work around the house, her cousin, Mattie, is going to trade work for room and board. Soon enough, the classic love triangle develops, tearing Ethan between his guilt-ridden traditional marriage and his heart-wrenching desire for new love. Ethan is in agony, not just because of the internal struggle of decision, but also because of the sheer joy that he experiences from the slightest interaction with Mattie.With the brilliant foreshadowing throughout the book, and the descriptive prose that allows the reader to experience the scenery and town, the \\"classic\\" label is well deserved.While unknown to anyone but himself, Ethan is forced to make a decision is the essence of this book. It's a story of morality and obligation. Do what is perceived as the correct thing to do, or follow your heart without reservations?"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I had to read this book for my high school English class and thought that it was, not my favourite book, but one of the more interesting novels I have read (and I have read plenty).First of all, the way Wharton depicts the scenery and the setting is incredible and makes you feel as if you are actually there. But, beyond that, this book is what I would call (and don't laugh at me for making such a trite remark) \\"deep.\\" Ethan Frome makes you think about what is really important in life.In my opinion, this is very important today--especially in our \\"do what feels right to be happy now\\" mentality. All throughout the story, the main character is torn between his duty to his old, demanding, and bitter wife whom he does not love and his love for her sweet, beautiful, and loving cousin. However, as we all find out, his passions overtake him and destroy the very thing that he wanted so much.This book makes you think...Overall, it is an excellent read and can be finished in one sitting (you cannot put it down! :])."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I have read many books throughout my life, widely ranging from teen fiction, fantasy, romance novels, historical fiction, etc. Yet few of them can be truly known as \\"great\\". When I picked up the book, Ethan Frome, by Edith Wharton, it truly changed me. The book is centered on the life of Ethan, a young man who is caught between the entanglements of his marriage to Zeena (his sickly wife) and his uncontrollable love for his wife's cousin, Mattie. While 27-year-old Ethan struggles from his loveless marriage to Zeena, whose ill health and complaints smothers even the most powerful optimism, he finds comfort and solace from Mattie's lively spirits. Yet even this last cling to happiness becomes shattered when Zeena decides to send Mattie away. Ethan, torn beyond grief, has the choices of keeping his honor or following his heart. The haunting love triangle is from my view a conflict between the self image of a person and the emotions that lie beneath. The characters, in essence, are a symbol of the tormented souls that is a part of everyone's reality. While the ideal image, or in other words, face value of life is one blessed by joy, Ethan Frome unveils the world of truths, of angonizing moments, sorrow, and pain while it also exposes the eternal craving that is the driving force which keeps up the sparks of hope within the characters. The vividness and depth of the book is an amazingly genuine depiction of human nature, and the meaningfulness of the words only made it more beautiful a story.I think this book is great for anyone who enjoys some deep and serious reading with truth behind it. It is a classic piece of literature, but at the same time, it is also a intricate work of art."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton's 'Ethan Frome' (1911), one of the shortest, grimmest, and most perverse novels in American literature, was partially based on a real New England sledding accident as well as on aspects of Wharton's own loveless marriage. Formerly known for crisp social satires such as 1905's 'The House of Mirth,' the gripping 'Ethan Frome' understandably met with limited critical and commercial success upon its release.Superbly written, 'Ethan Frome' is almost realistic American fiction at its finest. After the unnamed narrator arrives in the small Massachusetts village of Starkfield at the height of winter, he quickly becomes fascinated with a tall, striking, and partially crippled man, Ethan Frome, that he repeatedly sees moving silently around the landscape. The narrator finds that the friendly local people are willing to speak at length about other matters, but about Ethan Frome he can learn almost nothing.Temporarily hiring Frome to provide him with transportation, he discovers that Frome is an unusually intelligent, intellectually curious, and sensitive man. Caught far from his own home on a freezing night, Frome offers the narrator a night's shelter at his own meager farmhouse, and thus the opportunity for Frome to recount his troubled history is presented. But then the narrator states, \\"It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his story.\\" Scholars have subsequently debated why Wharton decided to add this sentence, but all have agreed that, despite its ambiguity, the recounting of Frome's tragic history as given is ultimately an uncertain one.The story as recreated is almost biblically simple: Ethan, who is married to a coarse, domineering, vindictive, and malingering woman, Zenobia, falls in love with his wife's live in servant, Mattie, and Mattie, who is young, beautiful, and innocent, with Ethan. After a tender night alone while Zenobia is away ostensibly seeking a cure for her ailments, Ethan and Mattie desperately attempt to wrest themselves from Zenobia's grasp; but the results of their efforts are horrific.Taking its cues from the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, and the Brontes, 'Ethan Frome' offers a comfortless vision of perdition that suggests that hell on earth is the inevitable lot of some.Wharton's sense of integrity ultimately carries the novel, but the book's presentation of an amoral universe, the triumph of evil, and the utter transformation of innocence into what is most repulsive in human existence makes 'Ethan Frome' a work whose conclusions many readers will reject as untenable.The book's inexorable denouement probably explains Wharton's disinclination to attribute the main narrative to Ethan, allow the narrator to it present it as objective if fictional history, or wholly take credit herself. Though the hard facts provided in the book's final pages are undeniably established, the manner in which they are reached is left a matter of ambiguity, suggesting that while the writing of 'Ethan Frome' was probably a cathartic experience for Wharton, she may have also found the final result objectionable, distasteful, or repellant."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This brief but tragic novel casts a weirdly mesmeric spell, helped greatly by the fact that you can read it in one or two sittings. Ethan Frome is a strapping young New England farmer; like George Bailey he dreams of becoming an engineer and getting out of his small town. But circumstances conspire against him as he is first forced to care for his ailing parents, then impulsively marries the young woman who was brought in to help his Mother in her final days. His wife, Zenobia, proceeds to develop her own health problems, real or imagined, and Ethan is trapped in a loveless marriage on a hard scrabble farm that he can not possibly maintain.Then Zenobia's cousin Mattie Silver, who is destitute, comes to stay with them and help around the house. Ethan falls in love with her and she with him, but Zenobia, realizing that something is going on, determines to send the girl away. Ethan struggles against fate, but is too decent to actually run away with Mattie and leave an invalid wife behind. Despite which, an awful tragedy intervenes and warps the lives and bodies of all concerned.This ineffably sad tale is filled with all the revulsion at convention that we associate with Wharton and it is also an insidious and subtle attack in the long American war between the advocates of urban and rural life. Wharton, the ultimate chronicler of urban society, marshals everything from the name of the town, Starkfield, to the portrait of the barren homestead, to the final image of the shattered family left on that farm, to paint the most dismal possible picture of rural life.It is a deeply affecting work and you will not soon forget the heart rending plight of Ethan Frome."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I decided to write a review of this book because even though the last time I read it was over 20 years ago for a High School English class, I still remember the story so vividly. Obviously it had an impact on me. Other reviews here say, &quot;Boring, nothing happened, the man was stupid and made stupid choices.&quot; That was exactly the point! At the age of 14 it was brought home to me that it is easy to get into a situation where one small bad decision after another leads you to a life that is just plain awful. It encouraged me to consider the concequences of my actions 5, 10, even 20 years down the road. The concepts in this book are relevant to so many modern situations (How will your later life be affected if you get pregnant/do drugs/flunk school now?)

Ethan From, the protagonist of the story, and his sickly wife, Zeena, live in silence and unhappiness which ultimately destroy their marriage. Due to Zeena's tedious illness, her cousin Mattie Silver is called upon to take over the responsibilities of the house. Mattie's vibrant and radiant presence attracts Ethan immensely, causing a spark to ignite in his nonexistent life. Ethan's love for Mattie deepens each time their eyes meet. Her youthful appearance and her lively personality starkly contrast with the dark and evil characteristics of the wicked Zeena. Mattie and Ethan's unspoken love forms the basis of Zeena's jealousy and rage. Zeena's need for attention and sympathy allows her to dominate and control the lives of Mattie and Ethan, similarly like the relationship between the puppeteer and its puppets. The combination of fate and Zeena's imposing power to contribute to Ethan and Mattie's forbidden and unpreservable love. Ethan's constant pursuit of happiness and attempt to escape from Zeena's restraints and the confinements of the villlage inevitably cause unwanted results.Wharton's Ethan Frome begins by introducing the narrator as a character. The story then proceeds into a flashback which consumes the majority of the pages. She also includes, within her story hints of foreshadowing and irony which keep the reader focused and interested. Wharton distinctly describes the environment with excessive imagery and diction in order to sufficiently create the mood and tone of the story for the reader. The author's writing style attracts the reader and successfully develops an unexpected ironic twist which makes this story unique. This excellent story portrays the life of an unfortunate man whose unhappiness, depression and weakness cause him to become a helpless prisoner, a lost soul, who will continue living in the lonely village of Starkfield forever.*****I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about a forbidden love between two individuals who would do anything in the world to be together.***** I give this story, Ethan Frome, by Edith Wharton two thumbs up and five stars.*****"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I had to read this book for my English class, and I can honestly say that it was the only novel that I read with interest the entire year. Ethan Frome draws the reader into the tragic life of Ethan Frome, a man bound by the demands of his unproductive farm and his sickly wife, Zeena. His true love is for Mattie, Zeena's cousin. However, Ethan is a prisoner of his own poverty and his wife. He cannot run away with Mattie, because he does not have the money. Furthermore, Ethan, while he does not like Zeena's tyrannical behavior, feels he owes her in some way because she had taken care of his parents before they died. He also feels compassion for her being sick. This and many more uses of discrepancy are used by Wharton in this novel. The ending is very ironic: Mattie and Ethan's decision to leave Zeena ends up in them being bound to Zeena for the rest of their lives. You'll have to read to book to find out what they do. Although slow moving in some parts, this novel does use many symbols and images, and I would recommend it only to readers who can analyze novels and comprehend them in the manner in which the author intended."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This story portrays the life of an unfortunate man whose unhappiness, depression and weakness causes him to become a helpless prisoner and a lost soul that will continue living in the lonely village of Starkfield, Massachusetts forever.Edith Wharton's, Ethan Frome begins by introducing the narrator as a character.

Ethan From, the central character in the story, and his unhealthy wife, Zeena, live in quiet and sorrow, which puts an end to their marriage. Due to Zeena's illness, her cousin Mattie Silver is called to take over the responsibilities of the house. Mattie's bright and happy presence attracts Ethan immensely, causing a spark to ignite in his nonexistent life. Mattie's youthful appearance and her energetic personality contrasts with the dark and wicked characteristics of the evil sister, Zeena. Mattie and Ethan's unspoken love creates the foundation of Zeena's jealousy and rage. Her need for attention and sympathy allows her to dominate and control the lives of Mattie and Ethan. The combination of fate and Zeena's imposing power contributes to Ethan and Mattie's forbidden and unperceivable love. Ethan's constant pursuit of happiness and attempt to escape from Zeena's restraints and the confinements of the village inevitably cause unwanted results.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. It is one of the few that I have read more than once. It is a short novel, but it is 81 pages of dynamic work. The story moves along quickly at a great pace so a reader can read it in an afternoon.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about a forbidden love between two individuals that would do anything they could in the world to be together. It is a tragic love story, but so is life in its most unusual way. Wharton's best work in this story is definitely the catastrophic twist she gives it at the end. The outcome is overwhelming and tear-jerking. Edith Wharton's description of these pressures and the longing love Ethan has for Mattie makes this a story that immediately holds the attention of the reader. It pulls the reader into an invigorating tale of the one true love finally found that is at the same time torturously, maddeningly beyond all hope of attainment."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Despite what you might read above, Ethan Frome is a masterpiece of the naturalistic form. As you must know through study, determinism is the doctrine that man's actions and mental activities are governed by causes outside his own will. In this case, because Edith Wharton was a naturalistic writer, Ethan Frome's whole life was controlled by his heredity and his environment. This interpretive fiction is also a great example of the omniesent point of view. The author chose all of the images superbly while writing this piece.The setting is winter because nothing is alive in winter and because it is so bleak and impassable. The protagonist (Ethan) is a ruin of a man. Wharton portrays him perfectedly through her writing. He is emasculatory. He has no children nor does he frolic at any time with children or possess any fartherly or masculine traits other than hard work. The antagonist (Zeena) is sickly, bloodless, and flat chested. She is hardly the picture of a woman, nor is she the picture of life. Mattie (the bone of contention) is the picture of life, she is the picture of hope; However, hope in a frozen hell is hardly hope at all.This book has so much to offer to the observant reader it hardly seems necessary to give away the ending or the plot. The point is, this story is about man's inability to overcome heredity and his environment. And Ms. Wharton does this masterfully."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Obviously, high-school aged people who are &quot;forced&quot; into reading this will find it boring and long-winded. What a shame; I hope you all have good teachers who can teach this wonderful book in a way to make it vivid and real for you. Wharton is a rare writer who can take a simple winter's day and turn it into a finely-wrought canvas. The story of Ethan Frome itself is very interesting and I myself read the book from cover to cover in one sitting. The ending is a surprise, and brings to mind the old adage: Be careful of what you wish for. You might get it.Perhaps because this book is almost ninety years old and doesn't have a splashy, gory cover or jacket blurbs from modern hacks, it appears to young people as boring. Again : what a shame. You don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I picked this book out of the library just by chance. I started reading it, and, if I didn't pursue it, I would never have finised it. It was so boring in the beginning, and way through the middle, but at the end is where I couldn't put it down. It left a good feeling inside me when I finished it."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I thought that the book was dull yet many important morals and ideals involving the basis of several problems of todays love affairs. It orchastrated the desicions Ethan faced as he watched his wife become more ill and began to notice her younger cousin. It is a classic piece of American literature and should be read by people of all ages. Mrs. Kerkow: This is for you."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The book, Ethan Frome, was good. Ethan Frome's mother was sick so Zenobia, aka Zeena, took care of her up to her death. His mom died in the winter and then he married Zeena.

Zeena's controlling ways slowly kills Ethan."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This is one of those books which I read and thinking it was a piece of literary history, but extremely boring. It's a book where the story is unexciting and unappealing, but the point it conveys is important."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I started this book with intent to hate it, as 19th century literature is not usually my favorite. Surprisingly, I finished the book and actually looked back and realized I had enjoyed it. Although I found the bleak setting unconvincing, mostly because I was reading the much harsher &quot;Shipping News&quot; at the same time, the characters and the psychology were involving, and the ending was surprisingly satisfying, in a tragic sort of way."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This novelette by Edith Wharton is cleverly written and packed with effective literary devices to liven up the plot. Not that the scheme needs any livening up though, as at times, it seems like a soap opera. The is romance in the air and the husband and wife have a very stressful marriage. There are three characters who are linked in complex ways and share a variety of relationships within the household. First there is the title male figure, Ethan Frome, who is married to Zenobia(Zeena) Frome. They live on a small, isolated farm in northern New England. After Ethan's mother passes away, he marries Zeena who ironically, falls ill shortly after. The reader, trough careful observation, deciphers that Zeena's sickness is really hypochondia. But she hold the power in the household and the couple takes in Mattie Silver, a distant cousin of Zeena's. The beautiful, wintery imagery surrounds a love story that is out of the ordinary. Ethan gets to know Mattie, and he falls in love with her vivaciousness and gay inner spirit. As the story progresses, the reader notices the heightened contrast between the young, warm-hearted Mattie and the old, crotechty Zeena. Ethan digs himself into deeper moral isolation. Symbolism plays an active role in the story and allows the reader to understand the emotions through tangible objects. For example, a slinky cat and a unique glass pickle dish crop up as tangible reminders of the mental games. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a crippling and surprising ending. It is not what you expect and I really cannot give away what happened Mattie and Zeena."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"After reading two works of literature about life and tragedy in Puritan New England, I found Ethan Frome to be a welcome contrast from the strict, moral lives of the Puritans yet the cold stark New England landscape remains. Ethan Frome is a well written, tragic love story of man who falls in love with his wife's young cousin. Ethan Frome was a smart, young man with many goals and dreams and all of these dreams involved leaving the cold, desolate, town of Starkfield. However, all of his attempts to leave the miserable town were killed, first by his parent's illnesses and then by his wife's. After his parent's deaths, Ethan, in fear of losing his only companion and source of communication asked his mother's nurse and relative, Zeena, to marry him. However, soon after they married she became &quot;ill.&quot; Seven years later, Ethan is a lonely man with nowhere to go in life and no one to turn to for comfort. Then Mattie Silver comes into his life. She is young, pretty, healthy, and happy, whereas Zeena is old, ugly, sickly, and depressed. Throughout the novel, Ethan struggles within himself over the idea of leaving Zeena and running away to the West where he would spend the rest of his life with Mattie. Wharton clearly develops her characters through her use of diction and symbolism. Her diction creates breathtaking images of the New England scenery, enhancing the meaning of the story. The symbols Wharton uses, although sometimes too obvious, also enhance the meaning and encourage an understanding of the book. Her characters contrast each other nicely. Overall, the book has well developed characters and an interesting plot. I felt myself really wondering what was going to happen to Ethan and Matttie. If you want to know what happens to them, I strongly recommend you read the book and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I was assigned this book for my junior American Lit class. When I recieved it, I thought, crud. I have to read this whole stupid story about a gimpy man and his crabby wife. However, once I slogged through the introduction, I was captivated. I read the whole book the first night I had it. I just had to find out what happened to Ethan and Mattie! The personalities and settings were so vivid, it drew me right in. Then I got to the end. Boo.

It was, overall, a great story with a wonderful plot and a great higher meaning in the story.

In conclusion, I think this was a wonderful piece of work and I encourage anyone to pick up this book and read it."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"... but overall a great read.

While the village, its inhabitants and community life had rustic appeal, the weather was bleak, as were the central characters ... a whining and manipulative \\"sickly\\" wife, a forlorn hard-done-by young girl, and a tormented unfulfilled husband.

There was a local controversy about whether or not our present day High School English seniors are mature enough to handle the book (can you imagine?)

Maddie's character is mysterious and it build's your suspense as you get through the novel.I would recommend this book for any strong reader ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I was lucky enough to have discovered and loved this book as an adult; for those who were forced kicking and screaming to read it in high school, give yourself another chance; this is nothing short of an extremely rewarding and exciting reading experience. I usually like dry humor mixed in with my suffering, but this is a different kind of story, and even though it is a tragedy, there is tenderness here, too.I read it for the second time a year or so ago, and now I've just finished the Cliff Notes. (For those of you perplexed as to why this is a classic, the Cliff Notes may be a great way to sum up the intentions of the story for you.) It brought it all back to me again, as well as some of the imagery Edith Wharton intended that I had missed the first two times around. With a bitterly harsh winter backdrop on a New England farm around 1900, this is a story of the man Ethan trapped in a loveless marriage with the cold, domineering, hypochondriacal wife Zeena. He falls in love with the wife's sweet young cousin, Mattie, who has moved in to work as a housekeeper. Mattie is as full of life and hope as Zeena is full of coldness and bitterness and degrading control over her husband. The events that follow as Ethan and Mattie hope to escape Zeena and find happiness are absolute page turners. Wharton's book is an emotion packed love story; full of tragedy and suffering, dominance and control, yet keeping us hopeful for the possibility of salvation for the characters. The movie starring Liam Neeson is also excellent; he plays a magnificent Ethan."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton is a pretty good book. It is about a young man working really hard to make almost nothing. He has a bitter, \\"sickly\\" wife named Zeena who brings her cousin, Mattie, in to help her around the house. With Mattie being a young, beautiful, vibrant girl, Ethan, of course, falls in love with her. When Zeena decides to let Mattie go, Ethan can't stand the idea of her leaving. The pair run into a tree while sledding in an attempt to die together so they never have to be apart.The plot of this book was very interesting however the constant describing of things I didn't care to hear that much about, such as the landscape, made the book difficult for me to get into. I was also hoping the story would be a little bit juicier. Until the end there was nothing that really surprised me or stood out.I did like the way the book was set up. It starts in the present with a woman who tries to find out the story of what happened to Ethan years ago. When she ends up staying at his house one night because of a blizzard is when she finds out the story. I liked this because it gives the reader a view of Ethan after everything that happened to him. It made me more interested to find out what caused him to be this way.Although I didn't enjoy this book a ton, it was well written. For readers who do enjoy a lot of description, Edith Wharton did it very well. She had a great choice of words that create a vivid picture in your mind. For readers who are more like me and prefer to hear more about what's going on and less about what the scenery looks like, this book is pretty good but not so good I would want to read it over and over.-Valerie"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I was surprised to receive this very thin, small novel, but within those 175 pages, Edith Wharton has woven a supremely delicate and beautiful tale. If you're looking to be taken away to another place and another time - but only have a few hours - this is the book for you! Anita Shreve's introduction is equally impressive."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I enjoyed reading Edith Wharton's classic, Ethan Frome. The book has gained many responses, varying by each reader, whether it be an impressive or dreary read; however, I had the ability to see past the monotonous, uneventful, and bleak storyline. Wharton paints a vivid landscape of the New England weather and emotionless quality of each character. Though these characters appear impassive, Wharton subtly indicates the self-conflict within each character. Despite the repetitiveness of the characters' tone and mood, Wharton leads the storyline to its peak, and just when you assume something unexpected is bound to occur, the story falls back into its predictable state. The book itself moves along slowly, though Wharton's writing style engages you and allows you to continue on. I especially enjoyed reading the last chapter or so of the novel. The unanticipated ending made the read all worthwhile."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is a classic, and easy to read in one day. It is almost a short story.I first read Anita Shreve's introduction. Anita claims to have been chasing Edith Wharton's storytelling technique throughout her own writing career. This is evident in \\"Weight of Water.\\"\\"Ethan\\" is a sad story that concludes with at least one, and maybe two morals. It is the story of a man trapped in an unhappy marriage to a hypochondriac. When he meets his wife's cousin, he falls deeply in love and can think of nothing else.The book has a tragic and unexpected ending. The ending of this short little novel is the best part of the book in my view. Things turn out so that you think, \\"why didn't I see that coming,\\" when in fact, you didn't.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book is completely different from all the other Edith Wharton societal commentaries. Ethan Frome is stark in the handling of its characters and in the narration of the story.I particularly enjoyed the evocative description of winter in new hampshire. It seemed to be depicted through the eyes of one who truly appreciates beauty even in its grayest tones.The story however is very heartbreaking and haunting. I read it many months ago, but keep recalling parts of the book or aspects of its characters. Definitely unforgettable."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Considering Edith Wharton's works, this is virtually an alien among her books. Instead of setting the novel in her beloved and well-known New York, with the wealthy people, the action happens against a bleak New England background, and portraits the life of a very poor man. But, this issue aside, 'Ethan Frome' has the same virtues of other Wharton's books, like the Pulitzer Prize Winner 'The Age of Innocence' and 'The House of Mirth', that too many experts is her masterpiece.Ethan Frome is a young man who quits his studies to take care of his father. Later on, when he mother dies, he marries his cousin Zeena, who took care of his mother. He marries her because he doesn't want to be alone --and not for love. Only after their marriage does Frome realize that Zeena is a hypochondriac, and leads an existence claiming to be sick all the time, and visiting doctors, spending most of their money with medicines.Some time later, her cousin Mattie moves to their house, to nurse Zeena and do the house chores. Mattie is the opposite of Frome's wife: she's beautiful, young and full of life. They fall in love. But Ethan's story won't have a happy ending. Telling it is no spoil, because we know from the first chapter that something tragic happened in his life. The novel begins with a nameless narrator telling how he met Ethan Frome and that a tragic event happened to this man's life.By using this device, Wharton only increases the tension in the novel, because we do know that something will happen, and the more we read, the more curious we grow, to find out what had happened. The novel is set in the Wintertime, and Wharton is very gifted to describe the environment and characters. We can feel the cold weather during the whole story. It feels as if we were there with the characters, 'freezing' together. Of course, the coldness is much more than only in the weather --it affects the characters too, their hearts and lives.'Ethan Frome' was published almost a century ago (1911), but it is a very modern book. In the narrative, Wharton uses devices that became common only throughout the 20th century --like irony and flashback. Ethan marries a woman that keeps him from realizing his potential and being a fulfilled human being --and it is a question that became very popular in the late 20Century.'Ethan Frome' is a great novel written by a master who has made wonderful books. This is another jewel that should be read for centuries to come."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Title: Ethan Frome Author: Edith Warton In this book there are a few main characters Ethan Frome, Zeena, Mattie and Jotham Powell. Ethan and Mattie can be called the protagionists and Zeena and Jotham can be called the antagonists. Ethan works in a lumber yard where he cuts trees and ships them to places. Mattie is the housekeeper for Ethan and Zeena (they're married). Jotham is a co-worker with Ethan. This book is set in winter and during a time with no electricity. In this novel, Ethan is in love with Mattie and wants to leave with Zeena, but since Zeena is ill, she could not make it on her own. Ethan tries to spend dquality time with Mattie, but that is very difficult. One day when Zeena needs to go to a special doctor, Ethan asks Jotham to take her so he can spend time with Mattie, but makes up an excuse and says he needs to collect money. When Zeena leaves, Ethan works but when he gets home, he sees that Jotham is there with Mattie which makes him very mad. Zeena was a very idealistic character. She was always looking for attention and was not happy until she got it. Ethan made a big mistake when he said that he will stay with Zeena because now his life will never change. one thing strange about this book, is that there wasn't really any family relationship. Something I think would have been a big plus. I did not really like this book because it was very cold-hearted. Zeena always complained about little things which made it very annoying. There was also a lot of secret hatred in the book which the characters did not show, but you could sense it. There was some conflict with self in the book on the decisions that Ethan made. I thought his decisions were not the smart ones but I canot change that. I'm not a book critic, but to me the book wasn't what I expected it to be. I'm not stopping anyone from reading it, but I wouldn't recommend it. There wasn't really any good points in the book. At times the book could become confusing. There were some points in the book that there were hard to understand. I would give this book one star."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"If I were to use four words to review this book, they would be: &quot;thank goodness it's over&quot;. I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic &quot;lovers' pact&quot; set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there. I recommend staying very far away from this novella."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Stupid book.

This novella about a man who is confined by his social status and unhappy marriage, and unable to realize his desires - be that a different profession or marriage to a different woman - is just all too familiar. Of course, Wharton's writing is as always remarkable, but the story itself is not impressive. Maybe my coldness towards it has something to do with the fact that I can't muster any compassion for the characters. Ethan is weak, unable to stand up to his wife or own up to his own responsibilities. Zeena - his hypochondriac wife who finds her only pleasure in taunting him. Mattie - a helpless girl who has an eye on her cousin's husband. I don't know, these people's problems just seem too melodramatic to me.And secondly, I can't really take this novella seriously, because let's face it, the setting and the characters are well beyond the Wharton's scope of knowledge and thus never ring true.Overall, a decent, albeit overpraised read.

The opening of the book begins with a narrator on a business trip in the town where Ethan lives. Ethan even interacts with the narrator, which leads him to question Ethan's life further. This is what leads into the story within the story. Ethan Frome is married to a woman named Zenobia, or Zeena. Zeena was the nurse for Ethan's father and after he passed away, they married only to avoid a lonely life. They live a miserable life together until Zeena's young, beautiful, and outgoing cousin, Mattie Silver, comes to live with them as a helper around the house. Before long, Ethan falls in love with this new and exciting woman. Ethan spends time everyday dreaming about what it would be like to be with Mattie. He helps her with all her chores and tries to sneak in extra time alone with her. Life is pretty content for Ethan until one evening, Mattie breaks Zeena's glass dish from her wedding. Zeena is so angry with Mattie that she finds a way to make sure she leaves their home. Zeena uses the excuse of her poor health to send Mattie away and hire a more useful worker. This news is almost like the end of the world to Ethan.One evening, Ethan and Mattie bring the book to its climax. They talk about running away together and being in love. This is when the accident happens. Ethan and Mattie are sledding down a steep hill with a large oak tree at the bottom. They decide that they would rather kill themselves than have to be separated. Unfortunately, the crash was not hard enough. They both survive, but severely injured. The book ends with Ethan and Mattie living under Zeena's care.

I was skipping along quite enjoying the book and then it ended. It really ended. Had to re-read the last 10 or 15 pages to make sure what I was thinking was actually what I had read. You read it and then you'll understand."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction. People can fall in love, but rarely do things turn out well.But but few of even her books can evoke the feeling of \\"Ethan Frome,\\" whick packs plenty of emotion, vibrancy and regrets into a short novella. While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality. Not a stereotypical shrew.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a true tragedy -- as beautifully written as it is, it's still Wharton's description of how a man merely survives instead of living, hopeless and devastated."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Be prepared for a depressing yet powerful love story!Ethan Frome is an estranged villager, stoic, reclusive, long since abandoned himself to live alone, on his farm, with his sickly wife. Tragedy struck his family when both his parents died, and when his wife shortly thereafter became sick, Ethan's normal reservedness turned into an abnormal reticence that completely alientated him from the small northern town in which he lived. One wintry night, the narrator of the story hitches a ride with Ethan and after getting stuck in a snowstorm, spends the night at Ethan's house where he learns the tragic details of the love triangle that is repsonsible for Ethan's self-affected misery.There are no happy characters in this novel. Ethan's marriage has dissolved into a relationship of bickering and duty, and when Ethan finds love in the young woman who is staying with him in order to alleviate the burden on his wife, the two of them quickly grow frustrated at their inability to consummate their feelings. When the wife begins to suspect that adulterous emotions are arising in her house, she takes steps to prevent the situation, forcing the two wanna-be lovers to take drastic action.Wharton is a poetic writer who brings emotion and humanity to a simple yet powerful story of unrequited love. Nothing too complex or convoluted mars the all too human story, and it is due to the genius of Wharton's prose that this story carries the lasting impact that it does. This is an undeniable American classic but be warned, it is not an uplifting read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I dug the folksy language and the setting of the bleak, New England scene, so aptly described. If you know old timers from the area, you'll enjoy the flavor of some of the exchanges so much the better.I will say the pervasive yet sporadic inner contemplations were not quite fully developed, so that time passed exceedingly quickly through some passages, yet struggled along in others. Somehow it distracted me a bit, while at the same time, I'm forced to admit this mimics real life. We all report what we deem important, and glaze over the rest. I suppose that's as good a reason as any why the book's named Ethan Frome, and not Mattie Silver or Zeena Frome ... :-)Given a chance (and the lack of humility to attempt such an undertaking) to edit Ethan Frome, I don't believe I would change a thing. Most of us probably can't say that about a number of other books... It's a short read, and roundly included in almost any list of classics or \\"must-reads\\". I gather you'll find both the story and moreover the characters worth the short time reading it takes."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Ethan Frome is a wonderful short book about a man, his wife and another woman who live together in the same house on a small farm around the turn of the century. The wife suffers from some sort of long-term debilitating ailment and requires constant care. Neurasthenia is one idea, but it reads more like she had an exceptionally bad case of fibromyalgia. At any rate, she hurts from head to toe and suffers terrible headaches. The young woman was brought in to help with the care of the wife and the household, but naturally the lovesick husband allows himself to grow fond of her, and the story is really about his inner longings for her and how he finally builds up enough courage to let it all out. And once that happens, the book dives headlong into a strange and unexpected conclusion. The story takes place in the horse and buggy days, and the author, Edith Wharton, a Pulitzer Prize winning author, does a splendid job of describing the rural setting, the turn of the century characters, their day-to-day activities, and the romantic tension that slowly builds between the husband and the attractive young woman. The book held my interest from beginning to end, and I wasn't particularly offset by the way things turned out. However, the critics attacked the book unmercifully when it first came out in 1911. According to the book's introduction, the Saturday Review declared: \\"We wish we had not read it.\\" Now that's a pretty heavy statement. And it's just one of the critics, there were several others, and their opinion was unanimous in the negative. To me, it just goes to show that you should take criticism with a grain of salt, and view the critics and their criticism in proper perspective, in this case, 1911 rural America. I'm sure if they read this book in 2010, it would evoke a different set of criticisms. In my opinion, you've got to give Edith Wharton a huge \\"A\\" for her writing style, vivid imagination and her ability to craft a beautiful story. I give the book five stars."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I first read \\"Ethan Frome\\" in high school, where despite my fantastic teacher, I was left unimpressed. I revisited it again in college with an open mind, in the spirit of seeing whether or not my tastes had changed - they hadn't. I attempted it once more, and was forced to conclude that I will simply never enjoy this short story.As a long-time resident of New England, and a repeated survivor of its winters, I found Wharton's descriptions excessive and melodramatic. The book appears to attempt to tell the saddest and most pitiable tale it can muster, but characters must be engaging and relatable before they can be pitied, and Wharton's characters are so closed off from each other and the reader that they are utterly inaccessible.I could find no pity in myself for the embittered Ethan, whose own problems he created out of sheer foolishness. Nor any compassion for Zeena, a rather vile plot device whose only purpose seemed to be to ruin the lives of others. And certainly not for the hapless Maddie, whose insipid and inane presence served only to irritate the reader and muddle the story.Ms. Wharton attempts to hide her shallow characters behind decorative language and even more shallow metaphors, in an attempt to add depth to the story. She fails rather extravagantly, using cookie-cutter, formulaic symbolism and utterly dismal language. Her metaphors are constructed in such a manner that you cannot fail to understand them as they seem to hit you over the head with their meaning.The bottom line: The true \\"tragedy\\" of this story is that this book is forced down the throats of children under the pretense of being a \\"classic\\", when the only knowledge to be gleaned from it is \\"what not to do\\"."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This novel is beautifully written, almost stunningly so. I can't remember stopping so many times in the text of a book and just admiring the prose. The story itself is tragic, and there's no Hollywood ending, but it works. The writing perfectly captures the mood of the story and the ultimate hopelessness of the main character. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This is an excellent book about heartbreak and what happens when you get what you ask for. It is the saddest story I ever read. This is a short story, but you will not be able to put it down once you start."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I first heard about Ethan Frome when reading the Divine Feud: a biography of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Apparently, Bette Davis spent a lifetime trying to get the story filmed. So I bought Ethan Frome and read it. It is a novella written by Edith Wharton. Some say that the story was loosely based on her own personal relationships at the time. Whatever the genesis of the story, it is haunting. It stayed with me for a few days. Wharton creates a strong atmosphere, vivid characters and a sense of doom. There are many themes in the story I think: the overwhelming one for me is the hopelessness of the very poor and the tyranny of fate. Fate however can of course be the result of many decisions made along the way, those decisions which lead to hoplessness are the ones which should truly be lamented."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I first heard of Ethan Frome as a child in the late '60s, on Allan Sherman's parody song \\"Won't you come home, Disraeli?\\" In that parody, the queen is \\"getting awful lonesome/cause all I do/is sit here reading 'Ethan Frome'...Disraeli, won't you please come home?\\"Well, when I got old enough to read it, I did. Frankly at that point I was just curious as to whether Sherman included it for a reason, or just because \\"reading 'Ethan Frome'\\" fit in the song. It must have simply been because it fit: Queen Victoria died 10 years before 'Frome' was published; Disraeli had already been dead 30 years when the book came out. But I digress...Wharton (whose other works I like for the quality of writing more than for the content) did a beautiful job crafting this bleak gem of a novella. This story is even more depressing (in a good way) than \\"The Age of Innocence\\" or \\"The Buccaneers.\\" The writing clearly evokes the setting of Starkfield, the life of Ethan, and the tension in the Starkfield winters. Every character (and there aren't many) is believable and well-drawn. I reread Ethan Frome about once a year; more often is too intense, but it's so good I pick out something new from it every time."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"But certainly the worst one of the selection that my little brother was forced by a teacher (whom I assume to be either cruel or just to have bad taste,) to read. One of the books he read had an important message, and the other was amusing at parts. This book manages neither of those mildly-redeeming traits and revels in that nothingness in a way that no reader should have to tolerate.It's the basic story of girl meets boy, boy's already married, boy's wife is an unlikable hypochondriac, boy and girl want to be together, boy tries repeatedly to dodge his wife, etc... I won't give away too much else, because sadly, there isn't much else to give away, but the plot winds up being about as far from a happy or meaningful ending as it's possible to go without getting into the realm of bad B movie plots.There are a hundred ways I could describe the text of this novel even further, but let me start with the most obvious. This novel is written as though the person who wrote \\"Jingle Bells\\" grew up alone, became a mentally-depressed hermit and decided to write a novel about forbidden love that doesn't go anywhere. The bland, depressing tones set by this novel are both an affront to a reasonable aesthetic sense, and at the same time made obsolete by such writers as Edgar Allen Poe, who managed them much better.Throughout the entire novel, the author seems to have taken great pains to avoid describing things in much detail or creating any characters worth caring about, which is probably a good thing, since if you COULD care about these characters, you might not want to. As such, it's a mercifully-short novel.However, the author, apparently realizing how short it was, attempted to lengthen it through the use of long words and flowery metaphors, many of which made me scratch my head when I tried to comprehend their validity (or lack thereof.) All I know is that this novel is the first one in which I've seen the words \\"discursively\\" and \\"ain't\\" used one right after the other, just to give you some idea of how little the flowery language fit the scenes it was meant to depict.I've heard people complain that their kids were forced to read Moby Dick, but Moby Dick was light-hearted and serene compared to this novel. Ethan Frome has no strong positive emotional draw, no pleasant aesthetic, no appreciation for justice, no real substance, no likable characters, no message or purpose, and as near as I can tell, has nothing at all. Yet somehow people have both published it and heard of it. Ah, the trials of the modern world. I'd avoid this one like the plague if I were you."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Some people would say it's wrong to destroy literature but after reading Ethan Frome they might have to rethink their position.

The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. This book is tedious, depressing and most of all it's BORING!! Take the money you would have otherwise flushed down the toilet on this load and go see Lord Of The Rings again.I do have to say one thing though.

Of all the low, cowardly, spineless people I have ever read about Ethan's character reigns supreme. However the second to last Chapter (when Mattie and Ethan talk about their love for one another) made me cry. A book had never made me cry before and I never understood people who cried over books.

While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality.

When her cousin, Mattie, comes to help her, Ethan's life changes completely. He falls deeply in love with Mattie. This being the 1800's, he must endure the stifling conventions of that era's society also. There love for each other proves to be a fascinating story.I loved this book. This is a story that will definitely take you away. You'll actually feel you are there. Edith's detail description of the scenery and landscape of that time are truly vivid.

Ethan and his invalid wife Zeena resent their loveless marriage and life together. When Zeena's sickness requires additional attention, Zeena's cousin Mattie is invited to Starkfield. Mattie's lovely and warm personality contrasts Zeena's cold character, revealing to Ethan how much is missing from his life. He and Mattie immediately fall in love, but with Zeena's constant presence their love is doomed from the start. All of the characters are well-defined, especially Ethan. Although her writing style is hardly complex, Wharton, a woman, demonstrates an amazing skill in creating a believable sensitive and stern main character. Her vivid descriptions of nature throughout the book create an environment that is chillingly beautiful and captivate the reader. Wharton creates a sense of isolation and regret, often countered content and happiness. Ethan Frome is a classic. Wharton writes a novel that is both easy to follow and sophisticated.

But beyond that, this is a really depressing read. The story is basically a domestic tragedy set in the cold, grim town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. The title character is a poor farmer whose wife, Zeena, seems to be a hypochondriac. Their life together is complicated by Ethan's problematic attachment to Zeena's cousin, Mattie, who has come to live with them.Wharton's prose is impressive on many levels. She really brings the reader into Ethan's tormented mind, and the effect is heartbreaking. Her representation of American vernacular speech is intriguing, as is her use of foreshadowing. Ethan--&quot;the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man&quot;--is a memorable creation.Ultimately, &quot;Ethan&quot; is a horrific vision of human coldness, cruelty, bitterness, hopeless, and longing.

Kazin totally ruins the reading experience. He compares Wharton unfavorably with other writers and mocks her choice of words and word pictures. When he does compliment her, it is always preceded by a caveat that strips her of her every achievement.What an uncharitable piece of writing. It's incomprehensible to me why a publisher would chose to accompany Wharton's fine tale with this mean-spirited rant.

Wharton uses exlicit techniques so the reader can see and feel the story unfolded before them. In my opinion, Ethan Frome was enjoyable to read. The characters were more then they seemed on their surfaces. This made them dynamic and mysterious enough to keep me engaged and thinking even after I was done with the novel. The short length of the book gave the reader the chance to read slowly and carefully to catch the many hidden symbols."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton was sort of an American Jane Austen, in that she wrote almost exclusively about the society of her time. However, I have found Wharton to be better than Austen, if for no other reason than Wharton's characters have more depth--Wharton's characters are immediately recognizable as people. Ethan Frome was one of her most famous novels, and it is actually a departure for her, since it occurs in a rural Massachussetts town rather than turn of the century New York, but the stifling society presence is still here, and the story is very much a tragedy, just like her other works. However, I found this book to be even more devastating than The House of Mirth.The book is about the titular character, a man who lives with his cold, unlovable wife and his young and lovely cousin. Clearly he is stuck, and much of the book revolves around his attempts to sort out his feelings and deciding what to do. It's not an exceptionally complex story, but it is a powerful one, with an ending which I found extraordinarily sad. In a way, Ethan gets what he wants, but it can only bring him endless sorrow. I don't want to give it away if you haven't read it, but it is quite well-done.This book, if it isn't already, should be considered the very definition of American tragedy. The beautifully-drawn imagery and setting, the sublimated love and hate, the inevitable course and its tragic conclusion make this one of the finest novels I have ever read, and, I hope, one of the finest you will have ever read, too."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"For starters, the beginning and ending of &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; were rather surprising. This story is ironic in many ways. It's based on love, yet the story itself is gloomy and depressing. This story can relate to how many humans are weak when it comes to love and life situations. I think that the plot of the story had good intentions. Yet this story was just too sad to be proclaimed as a lovely love story. The ending of the story was, in a way, kind of confusing. Yet let me not ruin it for the future readers and leave off by saying that &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; was an overall good story. It's very catchy and you become intrested into what will happen to the characters towards the ending."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This is the tale of a withdrawn man caught in a loveless marriage, who breaks down when his harridan wife unknowingly ends his love affair with a young servant girl.&quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is sunk into the morass of Victorian values and standards, and, as such, is clearly targeting a subtler and more impressionable audience than the one available today. Several scenes which were doubtlessly touching and gentle back when the book was written are now hopelessly quaint and devoid of meaning. Wharton wonderfully communicates the innate reticence of the local people, but she does so in a way that fails to engage. The book carries an air of utmost restraint. The writing itself is quite sophisticated, beautifully descriptive, but the author's choice of words is a bit odd (&quot;groping&quot; is hardly the word I would use to describe a parting kiss). The vast majority of characters fail to interest, partially because they are hardly fleshed out. Zenobia, Ethan's overbearing wife, is perhaps the only one who is sufficiently detailed and participates in most of the action. In essence, all of the book revolves around her, since she is the cause of Ethan's captivity and suffering. The book drags hopelessly until the climax in the last twenty or so pages. The convention of a narrator who is abandoned after the first few pages does nothing to ease the ennui. The book is severely overwritten: though a novel, it should clearly be a short story.A potentially interesting tragic romance marred by excessive length."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"In the snowy town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, live Ethan Frome and his wife, Zeena. While Zeena is ill-stricken, Ethan finds comfort and friendship in their housekeeper, young Mattie Silver. The book portrays poverty and dull routine, the claustophobia of village life, lack of communication, and illicit love as its major themes. Edith Wharton uses the sense of fatality as the major case of symbolism. She writes of winter dreariness, the bareness of the Frome farmhouse, and the insufficiency of Ethan's sawmill to properly portray her thoughts. If you enjoy reading about forbidden love, such as Romeo and Juliet, then Ethan Frome is for you. However, be careful, because the use of British language can make it tough to read if you don't have an open mind, or if you're looking for something not-so-serious."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I am fascinated by the way the author portrays Ethan Frome.

Ethan had previosuly married Zeena out of pure desperation for a human companion. Their marriage quickly turns stale. When Mattie comes to work as a housemaid, Ethan grows to love her upbeat spirit and cheerful attitude. He is then torn between loyalty to his wife and his love for Mattie. Zeena banishes Mattie from their home, causing Ethan to struggle with the decision whether to run away with her or not. This book clearly shows the importance of love. It was a fairly easy read, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The obvious protagonist of this story is Ethan Frome, although he is disguised as a middle-aged man who lived just outside a small, barren community. He is a diligent worker who receives meager pay in comparison to his labors on the family farm that he shares with his wife. Clearly, he is the protagonist because, not only is he the main character, but he was also mentioned by Edith Wharton to be the protagonist in the introduction of the story. If this had not been so, I still would have said that Ethan Frome is the protagonist because he was always so willing to help people. One example of this is when he was so insistent on having Mattie Silver, who was a poor relation of his wife, Zeena, remain their hired girl. However, Mattie was not only a hired girl to Ethan, and this presented him with many conflicts within himself. The exact moment that he realizes that he is in love with Mattie is beautiful and is in this quote, \`They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and grey under the stars.' He felt his love for Mattie was wrong because he thought that it was his duty to love Zeena. Zeena was so overbearing and Ethan thought that it was his job to care and love her because she was his wife and she was ill. Zeena was most definitely the antagonist of this story because it seemed that all she wanted to do was sit around the house and feel sorry for herself. In this I do not think that she was also the villain because she changes her ways for the better. She often forced Ethan to make decisions he did not want to make. There was only one time that he actually put his foot down and did what he wanted for a change.One case of conflict between Ethan and his society was Mattie and Ethan's relationship. In the harshness of their community for Ethan to find love somewhere else when his wife was ill was frowned upon. Of course, adultery, is a sin everywhere, but the type of connection Mattie and Ethan had was different. In the one night that they had alone together they did nothing but talk. In this night a red glass bowl was broken. The bowl was one of Zeena's, and one that she cherished. This is major symbolism because the shattered bowl is a symbol of Mattie and Ethan's relationship. They realize, just as there is no way that they could ever mend the bowl, there was no way they could ever find a way to be together.A conflict with nature that arises in this book between Ethan and Starkfield. Ethan is bound to where he lives with chains, and it seems the harder he tries to free himself from them, the more engrossed he becomes. The county where he lives has been his home all of his life, and was his families home before him. He is a poor man and cannot afford to move anywhere else even though it is his dream to live in the city and become an engineer. This bleak and desolate nature of their community provides a sharp and ironic contrast to Zeena's illness. It is ironic that such a weak person could survive in such a harsh climate and condition of weather. Additionally, Zeena is an ironic character because her personality is very similar to the weather of their society. The nature of Starkfield also influences Ethans personality and tells us why he is so attracted to the young and spirited Mattie, who brings color and spice to their household. Furthermore, friendship is immensely important because without Ethan's friendship to Mattie, I do not think that he would be able to survive.Later in the story, when the plot thickens, Ethan's wife says she is ill and wants to make Ethan hire another girl to work for them. This would mean that Mattie, foe of, would not have to work with them and would have to leave. Ethan has trouble saying no to his wife, mainly because he feels compassion for her being ill, but also because he feels guilty for loving someone else. Zeena, who is clever and omniscient of Ethan's relationship with Mattie, twists Ethans' words around until she gets what she wants from him. Ethan has the illusion that his wife is helpless and needs him to provide for her. This is yet another thing that binds Ethan to his life. In this way it is an extremely important family relationship that Ethan and Zeena share. Even though it is not a good relationship it still makes the plot. Without Zeena this would be just another story for it would be lacking the romantic tragedy of Mattie and Ethan.Ethan, seemingly under Zeena's spell, was idealistic that one day he and Mattie could create some life together, a life that would not involve Zeena. Mattie does not appear to be quite as impractical as Ethan, and knows that if Zeena does not wish for her services, she will not have her services. Mattie sees only one option out. This is leads to the most crucial part of the story, when Zeena sends for a real hired girl and forces Mattie to move to the next town, where she would be left to fend for herself. Ethan makes an important decision here, between leaving Zeena and going with Mattie, or making Mattie stay. Instead, he and Mattie decide to make a final journey together; a sleigh ride at night on a icy, foreboding hill by the coast of Massachusetts. Their plan goes drastically wrong, and forever binds them to Zeena. In this part of the novel, human value becomes increasingly significant. This is where we realize that Zeena does in fact have a heart and does care about the well-being of other people, especially her relatives.The narrator, who is only in the beginning and end of the novel is extremely important because she provides us with background information on the characters and what they are like. Edith Wharton, who is the narrator, starts by telling us of Ethan Frome and then embarks on a journey to find out about Ethan's past from the people of Starkfield. She goes about finding this information as if she was actually in Starkfield and was talking to one of her characters. This is what truly makes the story come to life. The narrators interest in the terrain of Massachusetts, starts with her love for nature, but her desire to make the story more personal leads her to creating the character Ethan Frome. In the introduction of the story Edith tells us of the in-depth of Ethan Frome and she obviously spent time inventing his character. At the end of this story the narrator proves to be worth even more because she finishes the tale of \`Ethan Frome' when it has been years, perhaps decades, later in the story and, finally, provides us with a resolution.This story could definitely be considered parallel to other romantic tragedies such as West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet. The plot of this story, however, is not quite so complex. These are novels speak about forbidden love. All of these novels have showed us what the power of true love can drive people to do. When compared to Nineteen Eighty-Four, this book showed much more love and courage. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Winston was weak and was willing to do harm against Julia to spare himself. In this novel, love tragically drove Ethan and Mattie to their crippling fate, leaving Zeena, the weakest, to care for them for the remainder of their lives."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"From the point of view of a High School student I thought that it was going to be very bland.

Wharton describes these characters so well that at the end of the novel I felt that I knew Ethan and Mattie for years.

Don't worry, it's a short one. It's set in a cold and bleak Massachusetts village where all you see is miles and miles of endless snow. Ethan Frome is married to Zeena. Zeena is no princess warrior. She is an unhappy, sickly shrew of a woman who does not make Ethan's life easy. Given her failing health, Zeena's cousin, Mattie, comes to help around the house. Mattie is a breath of fresh air for Ethan. She's beautiful and she's nice, and Ethan hasn't seen nice in a long time. Though they don't act on it, the attraction is obvious, and Zeena is not happy.

I will admit that the story isn't terrible, it's just not very original or intriguing to me..just kind of dull, and more than a little dated.

The eponymous character is a young farmer in the fictional Massachusetts community of Starkfield, whose dreams of making something of himself are dashed by the early death of his parents and then his marriage to the sickly Zenobia \\"Zeena\\" Frome. When Zeena's cousin beautiful cousin Mattie Silver comes to help out in the house, Ethan's heart is thawed, but ultimately the uncompromising conditions of Starkfield life bring Ethan and Mattie to a tragedy.The plot of a pair of star-crossed lovers is rather overdone, but ETHAN FROME is interesting in its depiction of a Massachusetts village in the late 19th century, complete with characters speaking in dialect and a description of country farmhouses. And the ending is a surprise which will prove memorable, I think. But those strong points are challenged by the climax that precedes that ending: Ethan and Mattie deciding to escape this cruel world by sledding down a hill into a big elm tree. This is stupidest means of suicide in all of literature, and you really have to wonder what Wharton was thinking when she chose this to anchor her dramatic plot.ETHAN FROME is a short read, more a novella than a novel, and you can buy it for very little in the Dover Thrift Editions series, so it might be worth a try, but man, is that suicide attempt lame.(Verified purchase from a local bookshop back in the day.)"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"great book that has stood the test of time.

Thank you for what you said about this book, I so rarely find anyone who fully appreciates it. I don't think that I can add much more except to say that I read this book at a time in my life that absolutely matched the emotion found within it, and it will always be my most cherished book for that reason. I thank my sister (and her flawless taste in all things beautiful) for insisting that I read it. When she suggested it, just the title \\"Ethan Frome\\" immediately grabbed my attention. The name of the main character itself was so evocative of something fathomless beneath a silent surface. My first reading of it was incidentally in the dead of January, which added greatly to the experience.Reading this work, my jaw literally dropped so many times at the visceral, poignant visual and emotional imagery that Wharton evokes, and I honestly felt like I was going to have a heart attack at the story's climax. I've never read anything else that can quite match its intensity. You can bet that I sobbed my eyes out, from the climax to the end of the story. I related so much to the story on so many levels that it was the most profoundly intimate reading experience I've ever had. I return to it often to once again glimpse rare vistas of raw beauty and power. I recommend this book with all my heart."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Reviewing a classic like \\"Ethan Frome\\" is a humbling assignment. But here goes.To be totally practical, the book has four things going for it:-- It is short--100-150 pages depending on page size--and thus a quick read...really more a novella than a novel.-- It tells a complete story beautifully.-- You will never get a more bitter portrayal of New England's winter desolation and the hardships it placed on people in the pre-modern era.-- The impact on human choice of pent-up sexual desire or simple yearning for connection has rarely been more powerfully or delicately portrayed. That discreet approach was a function of the era in which Edith Wharton lived and the class to which she belonged. And frankly, in our crass age it is refreshing.All in all, this book is both a powerful human tragedy and beautifuly instructive of how one can imply raw emotions without flaunting them in tabloid form. It is a gem."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton filled her novels with a feeling of ruin, passion and restriction. People can fall in love, but rarely do things turn out well.But but few of even her books can evoke the feeling of \\"Ethan Frome,\\" whick packs plenty of emotion, vibrancy and regrets into a short novella. While the claustrophobic feeling doesn't suit her writing well, she still spins a beautiful, horrifying story of a man facing a life without hope or joy.It begins nearly a quarter of a century after the events of the novel, with an unnamed narrator watching middle-aged, crippled Ethan Frome drag himself to the post-office. He becomes interested in Frome's tragic past, and hears out his story.Ethan Frome once hoped to live an urban, educated life, but ended up trapped in a bleak New England town with a hypochondriac wife, Zeena, whom he didn't love. But then his wife's cousin Mattie arrives, a bright young girl who understands Ethan far better than his wife ever tried to. Unsurprisingly, he begins to fall in love with her, but still feels an obligation to his wife.But then Zeena threatens to send Mattie away and hire a new housekeeper, threatening the one bright spot in Ethan's dour life. Now Ethan must either rebel against the morals and strictures of his small village, or live out his life lonely. But when he and Mattie try for a third option, their affair ends in tragedy.Wharton was always at her best when she wrote about society's strictures, morals, and love that defies that. But rather than the opulent backdrop of wealthy New York, here the setting is a bleak, snowy New England town, appropriately named Starkfield. It's a good reflection of Ethan Frome's life, and a good illustration of how the poor can be trapped.Even when she describes a \\"ruin of a man\\" in a cold, distant town, Wharton spins beautiful prose (\\"the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow\\") and eloquent symbolism, like the shattered pickle dish. There's only minimal dialogue -- most of what the characters think and feel is kept inside.Instead she piles on the atmosphere, and increases the tension between the three main characters, as attraction and responsibility pull Ethan in two directions. It all finally climaxes in the disaster hinted at in the first chapter, which is as beautifully written and wistful as it is tragic.If the book has a flaw, it's the incredibly small cast -- mainly just the main love triangle. Ethan's not a strong or decisive man, but his desperation and loneliness are absolutely heartbreaking, as well as his final fate. Mattie seems more like a symbol of the life he wants that a full-fledged person, and Zeena is annoying and whiny up until the end, when we see a different side of her personality. Not a stereotypical shrew.\\"Ethan Frome\\" is a true tragedy -- as beautifully written as it is, it's still Wharton's description of how a man merely survives instead of living, hopeless and devastated."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome is no doubt one of the bleakest tragedies in classic American literature. Everything from the sparse landscape to the unappealing personal circumstances within this depressing tale hint at a gloomy conclusion. When we first see Ethan Frome, the narrator describes him as a broken man, both physically and psychologically, even from a first glance. As the narrator learns more about Frome from townspeople and eventually Frome himself, this first impression proves to be quite accurate. After the unnamed narrator employs Frome to drive him to work, he slowly learns a few surprising tidbits about the obscure man.One night, due to extenuating circumstances, Ethan takes the narrator into his home to stay the night. From there, the story switches to an omniscient point of view, detailing how Ethan became his current self. It is an age old tale: Man loves woman, man cannot have woman, Man and his love attempt to be together. Sadly, this love story has a tragic ending for everyone involved.Despite Wharton's magnificently descriptive writing, the story tends to drag at particular points. The book may have been better suited as a short story as opposed to a novel. Overall, the story itself was thoughtful and well written, just not very captivating at times."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"A simple yet profound story, Ethan Frome is a captivating and intriguing tale of two lovers who must cast aside their love to accept the rules of society. The exciting and compelling love story is entertaining as the story captures the reader's interest the entire time. Although the Ethan Frome follows a basic plot line, the tale still remains a joy to read.Ethan Frome is set in the New England town of Starkfield. The narrator sets out to learn the life of a mysterious character in the town- Ethan Frome. He sees Ethan one day and is puzzled by the man's simple yet agonizing countenance. The narrator attempts to piece together the tragic incident, leading to Ethan Frome's depressing attitude by questioning local residents, but it is due to a violent snowstorm that the narrator is able to link the story together by being forced into an overnight stay at the Frome's. The story centers around Ethan Frome's love of his wife's cousin Mattie, and his inability to express his love out of the respect for his own wife, eventually leading up to a tragic and horrifying incident.The storyline is basic, yet beautifully written as Edith Wharton captures the beauty of the New England landscape, which she uses to portray the various moods certain characters are feeling. She creates a masterpiece by metaphorically linking each character to a certain setting. The characters in the story are very dynamic, with extremely contrasting personalities, making their actions and dialogue captivating and entertaining. As the plot continues, readers can feel their varying moods, as Edith Wharton uses the landscape to change the atmosphere of the setting. The imagery is moving and sensual, and readers fall in love with the environment.The astounding ending links back to Edith Wharton's personal experience as she too experienced an ineffectual man, linking back to the story's Ethan Frome. His inability to take charge of his actions reflects the inadequate husband Wharton had leading to an unsuccessful and unhappy marriage.A short novel filled with beautiful imagery and engaging character's, Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome is a wonderful story to read."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Like many books before it, Ethan Frome creates a sense of anticipation to finish the book. At the beginning of this novel dark and depressing words arise where you just believe that nothing in the world could make the main character, Ethan, can never get out of his painful state of a man. However, it is proven to be false after the cousin of his wife, Mattie, comes to help out with the family. The family of a husband and wife needs help is because of Ethan's ill-streaking wife, Zeena. Mattie, being around the same age as Ethan, causes him to be more interested in the idea of loving Mattie instead of Zeena. That is where the entire creativeness that Edith Wharton has for the novel shows its true colors.Long descriptions create more of an attempt to be in the same cold, cruel atmosphere as Ethan throughout the book when he is either alone or with Zeena. This causes a true contrast within the novel of how everything is brighter when Mattie is around Ethan. I would have preferred to not read the perverted thoughts running through Ethan's head about how he wants to die with Mattie or just touch her. To me it just makes the love seem more like lust than anything, no matter how much he seems to attempt to suppress these thoughts.True, many love triangles begin in lust and end in both heartbreak and love for all parties effected by it. But still. I really don't want to read another Romeo and Juliet forbidden love scene. Luckily it didn't come to that when the two \`star-crossed lovers' finally admitted their feelings for one another with the cause of an accident. The flirtations back and forth were there and throughout the book you wanted to just see the two get together. Zeena gave the two a window of opportunity and the characters didn't take it.Manipulation is all throughout this book. It causes you to second guess about some of the actions of friends and enemies and relationships. So, if you don't want to be second guessing everything about your life do not read the book. And do not read the book if you are exhausted and you want a relaxing piece of literature to read, because this isn't it at all.It is an extremely descriptive book which isn't perfect. The characters though are memorable even though you may not agree with their actions. Even though that all the characters are pretty stereotypical, you still remember their actions and their thought process. It is a well written book with the same tragic story that many read in all classic literature. The story is memorable and yet it's just another tragic love story.Lillie M."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Aristocratic New York woman residing in Paris writes about impoverished New England man's demise in love - a formula which few would encourage today, and certainly was a misanthropic venture in 1911 when this book was published.But, Wharton excels in her delivery. The dialogue incorporates much of the Massachusetts' accent. The description of the countryside: magnificent. \\"On a road I had never traveled, we am to an orchard of starved apple trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breath.\\" And, the story - Bronte meets Sterling. Depressing, grey as the winter weather, and as cold as a Massachusetts' December.Zeena, originally thought to be named Zenobia, is Ethan Frome's wife from hell. They live in the aptly named town of Starkfield. Zeena, ill and nagging, haunts Ethan as her querulous droning echoes in his psyche, whether he be in the home listening or safely outside working in the farm. Zeena's niece, Mattie or Matt, comes to aid her ailing aunt. And, without any appreciation, she does her chores.Frome's exclusive enjoyment is seeing Mattie's face each morning - so much does he like this that he commences shaving every morning to look right for her. The amorous affection is not a one-way road. Each becomes increasingly more entranced by the other. And, when Zeena leaves for an overnight stay at a doctor's, opportunity knocks.But, this is Wharton and written about people in puritanical Massachusetts in the late 19th century - much of the book is reminiscing in 1911 about what transpired 20 years earlier. Illicit love is the forbidden fruit. Contract or arranged marriages delivered sexual pleasure, not love of the heart. Wharton's characters often are prisoners of their societal marriages - Ethan Frome being worse than others as he also lacks any societal privileges or money. True love is doomed too often in Wharton's books: Selden in \\"House of Mirth\\", Newland Archer in \\"Age of Innocence\\" and Ralph Marvell in \\"The Custom of the Country\\" lead similar demises.The ending is tremendously depressing. I will not detail what transpired, as that would be unfair to readers of this review. But, its twist is what reminds me of Sterling or O'Henry. It was both alarming, and perfect."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"Unhappily married to a hypochondriac wife, imprisoned in a small town, never able to study as he wanted, Ethan Frome is given hope by the young and vivacious Matti Silver .

But the book is beautifully written, and it also has the virtue of being short.The Penguin paperback edition has an excellent introduction by Doris Grumbach, beautiful typography and cover art, and a nice, pliable feel in one's hand."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"The blurb for this novella, and most of the reviews, seem to agree that nature-loving, gentle Ethan is a man who has experienced a hard, pitiless existence through no fault of his own. The only light in his life is his love for Mattie, which is thwarted by his manipulative and self-centred wife. Well! Let me press my thin lips together, and utter a merciless judgement on that little piece of nonsense!The novel opens with the narration of a stranger to Starkville who sees about the village the tall, slightly crippled, gaunt and uncommunicative Ethan Frome. When circumstances conspire to have the narrator stay the night at the Frome homestead, the novel then continues with the story of Ethan, told from only Ethan's viewpoint. We learn of Ethan's pain, Ethan's anguish, Ethan's unrealized passion.Given all the Ethan input, I have to say that I still sympathize with Zeena's position. She came to the isolated farm to nurse Ethan's dying mother, and subsequently Ethan felt lonely and asked her to marry him. Big mistake for Zeena! Once married, he found the older Zeena boring. When she talked to him, he didn't even bother to answer. Finally she stopped talking, started whining, became sickly and the communication stopped altogether. When her young cousin, Mattie, arrived to help in the household, Ethan mooned about, gazed adoringly at her, took an uncharacteristic interest in his own appearance and started helping out around the house. Surprise! Zeena gets annoyed! Duh!Poor (literally) Mattie was only 20 years old and trapped in Frome household. Ethan was kind to her, gave her a lot of attention and, if you can trust the narratiom, she falls in love with Ethan. She was, after all, a young and impressionable girl who would freeze on kindness and perhaps weave romantic fantisies around that kindness. Ethan also encouraged the crush and fanticized about the possibilities of that emotion. Zeena, his wife, does what she can to put a stop to it. Of course.It all ends in tragedy. Of course.The women come out badly. Is it possible for a female writer to be a misogynist? Or is Wharton's intention to make us realize that both Zeena and Ethan are actually a victim of Ethan's romanticism."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"After reading the book Ethan Frome... at the age of thirty, I can't help but wish I had been assigned this one in High School. This was a very thought proking story.I don't want to go to deeply into the story line because I really don't want to give too much away... but I must say the ending is shocking and expertly foreshadowed by Wharton.Wharton's telling of this story through a third person narrator is brilliant. We get a little piece, a glimpse of what happens in the story in the first chapter. In this glimpse we see an aged Ethan in town with a huge scar on his face and head.... and Wharton talks of the terrible, &quot;Smash Up&quot; he was involved in.When I read it, I couldn't help but race through the book to find out just what the &quot;Smash Up&quot; was. I love when a book gives you such motivation to speed through it. This bit of foreshadowing was masterfully brilliant and expertly done.During the story we see Etan Frome, a conflicted and yearning young man. Stuck between his ailing wife, Zeena and her young relative, Mattie who has come to live on their farm.What Ethan wants more than anything is Mattie... but he knows he can't have her.The bulk of the story brings us into his thought life. I really enjoyed this aspect of the book. We see Ethan waffling, hedging, scheming and hurting. He is stuck in the life he chose and can't seem to escape it's grasp.Ethan Frome is a conflicted and complex character. I just loved Edith Wharton's portrayal of this man... brilliant!!Read this book it is without a doubt a classic and well worth your effort!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I think that the high school students who felt that they had &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; pressured upon them don't appreciate the message that Edith Wharton is trying to express or didn't read the book. Here is an excellent book that any teenager, no matter how much they hate to read, can relate to. Ethan and Mattie's unexpressable love is easy to understand and is brought to one of the highest emotional peaks of any book that I have ever read. Imagine being young and passionate while married to a wife who is seven years your senior, depressingly dull and constantly sick. Her beautiful cousin who is there to help about the house, falls in love with you and you're absolutely unable to express your love in any way at all. Who can't relate (or at least imagine that they can relate) to that? Edith Wharton knows the essence of human love and expresses it vividly and emotionally in &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"This book was so detailed - i don't know how someone could drag out a 48 hour period of time into 9 chapters.

Illustrating the turbulence of an unattainable love, this story is about the tragic life of Ethan Frome, a man torn between his duty and his desire. Mirrored after the tragedy in her own personal life with ex-husband Edward Wharton and secret lover Morton Fullerton, Edith Wharton successfully paints the misery of her protagonist and his star-crossed lover Mattie Silver in this perfect \\"snuggle by the fire\\" read.I found the beginning of the book to be an interesting lead in, an unknown narrator visiting a cold and wintry Starkfield, Massachusetts where he meets Frome and two peculiar old women that are living with him. The drab setting that Edith Wharton cascades the small town with sets the gloomy atmosphere that pervades its characters and community throughout the story. Wharton utilizes the presence of this harsh winter weather as a symbol of the characters' battle with interior and exterior forces; they have to physically battle the icy, heavy snow while psychologically fighting the lust of human nature.Vividly captured are the emotional pain and sufferings each character in the story goes through, from Ethan's insatiable hunger for Mattie to a poor town simpleton's piteous gaze upon the troubles dealt to the Fromes. Wharton is able to fully connect with her audience as her empathetic emotions bring vehemence and truth to every word. She explores the candid thoughts of her characters, engrossing the reader with an up close and personal look into the tormented mind of Ethan Frome that consequently creats a fascinating masterpiece of romantic catastrophe. Though the story's ending did not turn out how I would have liked it to, it greatly underlines the messages that Wharton tries to convey to her audience. The theme of not being able to escape the past, the bitter results of duty vs. lust, and the everlasting marks a person carries after relationships encompass themselves within this novel and all come together at the end.This short yet satisfying read is a book fit to read by the fire on a cold wintry day, its harrowing tale of a secret lust and the human being's innermost desires are revealed and brought to life by this heartfelt creation of Edith Wharton's talent."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"I enjoyed Wharton's writing in The House of Mirth, even though I wasn't the hugest fan of Lilly Bart. I thought I'd try Wharton again with a change of character - and it worked! Ethan Frome started off a bit slow with a description of the town and allusions to Frome's past life, which were sort of confusing. Also, the colloquial and vernacular language was difficult to get through at first. But don't give up!Basic premise is that Ethan Frome, who took care of his ailing parents and now takes care of his spiteful, ailing wife, barely eeks out a meager living tending to a family farm. Mattie Silver, a relative of his wife, moves in with them as a housekeeper after her parents are killed, and Ethan develops a deep desire for Mattie.The circumspect obsession Frome has with Mattie Silver is hot (by 19th century standards)! Wharton's description of the cautious shadow-boxing between the two, especially when Frome's wife is out of town, is electrifying. Frome is stimulated by the way Mattie drops her eyelids when she's talking and the way she plays the mistress of the house when Zeenia is away - very simple gestures or actions drive Ethan wild. The fact that he can't have her as his wife, deepened by Zeenia wanting to send her away, intensifies the feelings Frome has for Mattie. A truly refreshing \\"courtship\\" compared to those seen on the OC and other modern day dramas.To be honest, relatively little actually happens in Ethan Frome, but the interaction between Ethan Frome and Mattie Silver is awesome!"},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"For an independent reading book this quarter I chose to read Ethan Frome, written by Edith Wharton. This book contains mind wrenching themes, symbols and other literary devices. At first, I wasn't too thrilled reading this book, and was actually disappointed because when I chose to read it I thought it would be a strong, interesting, and mind catching novel. Consternation struck me when the first few chapters put me into a bore. However, I later looked back and felt that I simply didn't understand, and catch the small things, in the early pages, that later had turned into big things.When I began to read this novel, I was thinking about how I would later rate it if it continued along the path it was on. I thought out of five stars I would give it at most a two. Nevertheless, I now believe this story deserves a three and a half or four. It is not the best story I have read, but by far not the worst. It contains a fine mixture of irony, symbolism, foreshadowing, characterizations, as well as other literary tools. The first example of foreshadowing is that in the beginning of the novel, the narrator describes the main character, Ethan Frome, as a crippled man who suffered in a \\"smash-up\\". This foreshadows Ethan Frome's lover's fate, or Mattie Silver. When Frome and Silver go sledding on the hill and hit the elm tree, much to the request of her, she ends of crippled and unable to walk due to the smash-up. I liked how Wharton uses this foreshadow because when I initially read the beginning where it talks of Frome's accident, I wasn't aware of the significance of the author adding that into the book, but now I see the smart choice of doing so. Also, the narrator as a character, and as somewhat of a friend of Ethan Frome, bewildered me as to why he was in the story, and his purpose of getting rides from Frome. Through the middle portion of the story, the narrator remains simply a narrator, but at the end, the narrator returns and describes Frome's current life.On page 142 of the novel, the character of Mrs. Hale sums up Frome's life in a simple, yet intriguing sentence. In Wharton's Ethan Frome, Mrs. Hale says, \\"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome\\" (142). In a small nutshell, she is speaking of the accident that was mentioned earlier, the death of his father, and that of his sick mother, the illness of his wife Zeena, and his life in poverty. Wharton shows extreme intelligence of maintaining Frome as a character in which to sympathize with, to relate to, and to see as a man of that day. At times one would think nothing goes right with him, and other times, one may feel as if they have been in a similar, and frustrating situation, and additional times the reader may feel as if they feel very distant from what's in Frome's life, and passes it off as what someone would have experienced back when the novel takes place, but not in today's society. An example of an occurrence that may make the reader feel distant is when the novel refers to a cutter, or a sleigh, and when Frome is driving in it and is going to bring Silver to the train. That word with that definition is obsolete in today's language, therefore, that is a moment in which a reader may not feel one with Frome, or the novel for that matter. However, the way that the author mixes it up with different feelings toward Frome, and other characters makes it a classic characterization and thinking on her part.The description throughout the novel was scarce in some parts, and just right in others, and too much in some. On page 48, Edith Wharton shows how she can paint a beautiful picture in the mind of a reader. It says, \\"They walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shaded lane...on the farther side of hemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars\\" (48). This shows the poetic, yet plentiful description of the setting. However, in some parts where the plot dragged for several more pages than it should have, and the description seemed to be in place just for the purpose of adding more, made the particular section boring, and impossible to get through.In my opinion, the language choices for this book were appropriate. They were because it contained such vocabulary that would have been used back then, such as, cutter, pre-trolley, water-mill, coasting and other words that were customary but not hard at all to decipher. Wharton smartly didn't choose large words for the simple purpose of using large words. She used the correct vocabulary, tone, and language for the purpose of staying true to the setting, but also to be appealing to the reader. One of the most fascinating and strong statements she used was utilized as the last sentence said by Mrs. Hale. She says in Ethan Frome, \\"If she'd ha' died, Ethan might ha' lived; and the way they are now, I don't see's there's much difference between the Frome's up at the farm and the Frome's down in the graveyard...\\" (181). This insightful sentence means that by Ethan Frome surviving the accident, and Mattie Silver ending up crippled by it, Ethan Frome would be better off dead and in peace than a living dead. He is that because he is now living with Zeena and Silver, in which he must give much care to both women. This refers to him as a trapped man whose soul will suffer for years to come.The symbolism in this novel was of few, yet important simple items. For example, when I was reading the part when Frome and Silver are sitting at the table eating a nice dinner by themselves and Zeena's beloved pickle dish is shattered on the floor, I thought that this part of the novel was nonsense, irrelevant and dull. However, I later learned that this is an important piece of the story. The pickle dish that is shattered represents Ethan and Zeena's relationship that is shattered, much to the result of Mattie Silver living with them and becoming the object of Frome's love. The fact that the pickle dish doesn't just break at any random time, but that it was during a dinner between the lovers illustrates even more that this shows the effect of Mattie on Zeena and Ethan.In closing, the characterization, symbolism, foreshadowing and language described here are just some things that make this novel a brilliant one. As I stated earlier, in the opening chapters of the book, I figured I would not rate this as a first-class novel, but evidentially, my opinion has seemed to change. This book wasn't perfect but the cleverness of Edith Wharton, and how she depicts different character, scenes symbols and other things makes up for a lot of the dragging points during the course of the reading. I feel that if Wharton didn't write this novel a lot of the points and elements she added would have made this novel not as good as it is. Therefore, my rate after finishing this book and finally understanding the mind of Wharton a little better, is four stars."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome","review":"In Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton , the world is simple, yet confusing. Throughout the book Ethan struggles with the forbidden love for Mattie, while also trying to love and support his sick wife, Zeena. Wharton's detailed depitction od a struggling male mind is phneonmenal and unusual. Wharton goes down to the essence of Ethan's feelings.The book starts out with a hint of sexual tension and gradually escalates to Ethan finally grabbing Mattie in his arms and saying he feels deeply for her. Once Mattie declares her love for Ethan a reader will finally feel serene and content and will predict a typical ending. Wharton however does not right a conventional ending, and I think readers may be disapointed.I feel that the book is well thought out and, for the period it was written, very sandalous. The book really impressed me except for the ending. I feel it ends abruptly and that I did not have time to fully understand and realize the severity of what had happened. Overall, however, the book was fabulous."},{"Title":"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera","review":"Would this give you confidence?On the first reading I had close to 147 objections by the end of letter C and most of these were factual errors.

It's amazing.This book is focused on the Burger court, when a Nixon appointed judge was tried to stem the type of progressive judicial activism the Warren court was known for. This book is fascinating for any one interested in what was happening inside the court during those important years. This book is worth reading for the fascinating back story of how Roe v.

The justices are seen in a new light. Its one of a kind."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I have become interested lately in the various opinions handed down by the Supreme Court in the Guantanamo habeas corpus cases. I was particularly surprised by the vehemence of the dissenting opinions expressed. This lead me to this book, to find out more. Published in 1979, it documents the internal workings, decision making and rivalries in the Supreme Court between the years 1968 and 1975. The activist Chief Justice Warren resigned at the start of this time, and the remainder of his colleagues moved towards retirement, replaced by Nixon appointees. The Court's more controversial cases in this time dealt with segregation, abortion and Watergate.They say that no man is a hero to his butler, and I think this book provides a law clerk's eye view of the workings of the court and the interactions of the justices. Each year, each justice hires three (more recently four) law clerks to help with research and documentation. The clerks leave after one year, and the book is laced with opinions about lazy justices being over-reliant on their clerks to write their opinions, how hard working clerks can influence which cases are taken and what opinion \`their' justice forms. I think this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. It is certainly true that the justices are appointed to life-long posts (they can be impeached by Congress, but otherwise make up their own minds when to retire), and that the temptation exists both to remain at work though they get older and physically weaker, and to get less interested in the writing of complex opinions. However I think it is clear that all the justices mentioned here, closely valued their own opinion and were jealous in casting their vote in the judicial conferences. It is also clear that, over the years, their basic philosophies could lead close observers to predict what their views on a particular case were likely to be.I have read that one of the authors' main sources for this book was the Justice Potter Stewart, who was in the running to become Chief Justice after Warren retired, but declined to put his name forward. There is an element of sour grapes towards Justice Burger, who did become Chief Justice. Burger is depicted as dim-witted, vacillating, manipulative and devious. I am sure that being in (essentially) a job for life, with eight other colleagues can lead to enormous frictions, especially when you are both free and required to express your opinions, which can have enormous consequences on society.The book is very informative about the workings of the Supreme Court, the characters of the Justices and the role of famous precedent setting cases. It is both enlivened and cheapened by the gossipy nature of some of the anecdotes, for example, when Justice Hugo Black died, he asked that all his personal papers be destroyed, to preserve the confidentiality of the decision making process. His paster, who wished to say something at his funeral, was left without much to go on, so he went to Black's book collection, and looked through books written by Black;s former law clerks; the pastor chose some of the underlined passages, especially from one particular book which was heavily marked, to illustrate what he believed were Black;s interests and views. The book quotes the other justices saying, after the funeral, that Black must have been turning in his grave, as he only underlined areas with which he disagreed!.There was an ongoing issue about how to define pornography, whether it was a version of free speech or an offense to the general public. The justices could not come up with a definition of pornography that might not infringe (they felt) on free speech, so the best they could come up with was expressed by Potter as \`I can't define it, but I know it when I see it'. Unfortunately this translated into the Supreme Court having to view, and decide by majority, on every piece of contested pornography in these years!. This is also dealt in a gossipy, jocular way, which again undermines some of the seriousness of the decisions - in fact the \`liberals' (Brennan and Douglas) felt nothing should be banned, provided it was proven that if was capable of being only viewed by adults who specifically were aware of its contents, therefore they did not view any of the material.The relative standing of each justice is also described, especially Harry Blackmun's inferiority complex, his indecision and his desire not to be seen a overly-influence by Justice Burger (despite being a life-long acquaintance). Their interaction, and the pride they took in contributing to developing law - as opposed to writing futile and bitter dissents, is contrasted with their profound (and perhaps egotistical) political philosophies. Their personalities are largely described in relation to their clerks also - an \`amiable' justice takes the time to learn his clerks first names, something you might think is common courtesy ; however usually their personality contrasts with their legacy - William O. Douglas, a liberal icon, is seen as acerbic, imperious and eccentric.The book is particularly good on the abortion judgement and the Watergate decisions, which, I believe, show the Court at is worst and best respectively. The court ruled in favour of abortion, as an extension of a woman's right to privacy, and the opinion was written by Blackmun. The opinion as written is shown to be of equal parts concern not to interfere with medical practice, and as a way for Blackman to redeem his reputation for indecision. It was definitely an unexpected decision of a Nixon appointee, though the progress of the case and the writing of the decision are well described.The Watergate controversy came to the Court as a challenge by President Nixon to orders for him to release taped Oval Office conversations to an committee investigating the Watergate break-in. As you would expect Bob Woodward has an excellent command of this case, and the process is described in detail. Though there was enormous concern (apparently) among the justices that their opinion be unanimous, and there was manoeuvring to ensure that Justice Burger, when writing the opinion, did not prevaricate or water it down, it seems to me that the strength of the court was that there was no question, from the outset, but that the President would loose. Whether the opinion would be narrowly based, and deferential, or a towering denunciation, was of some concern, but their unanimous view was that the President, who had appointed three of their number, was in the wrong, and must release information which would lead to his impeachment or resignation. Watergate and Nixon's resignation gave the Soviets a short-lived fillip in the Cold War, and at the time was seen as the Stumbling of the American Superpower, but ultimately can be viewed (I think) as the ability of the United States system of governance to impose standards and to correct itself.In general I think this book is useful, if too biased and gossipy. I think the absence of any footnotes, references or bibliography does it a disservice. As with all Woodwards material, I presume these absences are part of the price paid to get the information in the first place, and his reputation is such that the credibility of the book remains high. However, while it is likely that the events described are factually reported, and the characters and interactions are as fractious and frail as described, I think Hugo Black's view is more germane i.e. that publication of private papers/stories of Justices would inhibit the free exchange of views in the court. Read the formally published opinions and dissents, they are dramatic and revealing enough."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I chose this book off of a list before starting law school, and I was happily surprised that it gave a lot of insight in how many cases before the supreme court were determined.

Being aware of the maneuvers between the Justices that eventually led to their decisions was very intriguing. The engrossing way by which Woodward and Armstrong chronicled the recruitment of the Justices to their opinions led to my 15 year old son devouring the book in one week! Prior to this, his interest have been in the Harry Potter series.As for me, a fellow in forensic psychiatry, the knowledge I gained from the book elevated my contributions in our Landmark Cases class. For example, there is an assumption that based on their similar judicial philosophy, [whatever Brennan does, Marshall follows]. However, in a landmark case Powell v Texas, which centered on the issue of intoxication in a public place and whether alcoholism is a disease, Justice Marshall wrote the opinion for the majority who ruled in favor of Texas. Justice Brennan was in the minority. I pointed out to the class that had Marshall \`followed Brennan', as was frequent in The Brethren, the opinion would have tilted in favor of Powell. I believe that this book should be recommended for attendings and fellows in forensic psychiatry, as it will further improve their understandings of the reasoning behind the landmark cases that forms one of the essential pillars of the forensic psychiatry profession."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"This amazing book really emphasizes the strategic interactions the justices engage in everyday.

By the time I was out of law school, the damage had been done, and the court that I fell in love with in this book was long gone.And when I say the court I fell in love with, I don't just mean the individual justices, which this book explores with depth and care, but the institution it used to be.This is a book to own and to remember.

The book is over 30 years old; first being published in 1979. The prologue covers the end of the \\"Warren era.\\" Earl Warren was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, when \\"Brown vs. The Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas\\" was issued, in 1954, which declared racial school segregation to be inherently unequal, and hence, illegal. The book contains seven chapters, each covering a yearly Supreme Court session, commencing in 1969, and ending with 1975. This is the era of another \\"Warren,\\" but that was his first name: Warren E. Burger, who became the Chief Justice in 1969. Along with other Nixon appointees over the next seven years, he began \\"unwinding\\" the era of judicial \\"activism,\\" and moved the Court much more to the Center, which is aptly described by the last sentence in the book. Power in most forms loves its prerogatives, and strongly resists the \\"Dorothy's\\" of this world \\"pulling back the curtain.\\" The authors take a preemptive strike against those who defend (often as a well-paid PR person) the sanctity of The Curtain by quoting Warren Burger as an epigraph: \\"A court which is final and unreviewable needs more careful scrutiny than any other. Unreviewable power is the most likely to self-indulge itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate self-analysis...In a country like ours, no public institution, or the people who operate it, can be above public debate.\\"Who were the sources for the information in the book? The authors say in the introduction that it is more than 200 individuals, including the Justices themselves. 170 were former law clerks. Clearly, as a lawyer friend has indicated, issues of confidentiality and professional trust may, nay, almost certainly were breached. It is a tough ethical question; if those proverbial matters of confidentiality and \\"state secrets\\" are not breached, then the Pentagon Papers, of the same period, would never have been published, and the inner-workings of the powerful who led us down the road to Vietnam, would never have been known.The results? The Justices are very much humanized: warts, foibles; men who put on their pants just like you and me (the skirts would come in later decades). Cocktail-type anecdotes, such as Justice Thurgood Marshall, the one Black, pretending to be the elevator operator for unsuspecting tourists. Yes, maybe apocryphal. Concerning the nomination to the Court of Judge G. Harrold Carswell, the comment by conservative Senator Roman Hruska was telling: \\"There are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers, and they are entitled to a little representation.\\" Charles Reich, who wroteTHE GREENING OF AMERICAclerked for Justice Hugo Black. At Black's funeral, portions of the book that Black had underlined were read. What was not realized was that Black underlined the sections he disagreed with! I also found fascinating the backstage maneuvering that led to an 8-0 verdict in favor of Mohammed Ali as a Black Muslim who is a conscientious objector. As the authors note, when he praised the Court: If he had only known how close he had come to going to jail!Even by today's standards, it was a tumultuous era, with numerous cases involving the Vietnam War, the abuses of power known as Watergate, abortion and women's rights issues, free speech and pornography, and even baseball's \\"reserve clause\\" in the case of Curt Flood, of the St. Louis Cardinals.To get behind \\"the curtain\\" I can think of no other method than the one the authors used. Overall, I would believe their integrity was equal to, or greater, than the Justices they wrote about. No doubt, the \\"full and frank exchange of opinions\\" on future cases was somewhat inhibited as a result, but we should all be wiser as to the thoughts and methods of those who exercise such phenomenal power. I figure that the authors anecdotes are most likely 90% true, which would translate into 4.5 stars, and I'll round down, due to the ultimate unverifiable nature of some of the anecdotes. For those who have ever been involved in the legal process, and this being America, isn't that most of us, then this should be an essential read."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"When this book first appeared I found it quite readable and interesting but hardly a great work. I recently encountered Renata Adler's take in the New York Times Book Review (reprinted in her collection \`Canaries in the Mineshaft'). This review considers the shortcoming of journalists writing about judicial matters and is definitely worth looking up by anyone interested in this book."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Although the book shows a little bias from woodward, the story is great"},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"The quote above is the way Thurgood Marshall would salute the chief, Warren Burger, when they met in the hallway. When the court had to view porn films to decide whether they are \\"obscene\\" or \\"educational\\", Marshall once quipped at the end of one such movie, addressing the obviously uncomfortable and prudish Henry Blackmun: \\"Educational? *I* didn't learn anything new -- what about you, Harry?\\"This book, as you can see, had unprecedented information about the supreme court. It is by no means a \\"evil Nixon destroyed the saintly liberal Warren\\" job. To the book's great merit, it deals as objectively as possible with the court's decisions -- showing how they were, almost invariably, not the result of \\"conservatives\\" vs. \\"liberals\\", but of complex interaction of legal views and personal characters.Let us take, for example, the discussion about the death penalty. The authors present the anti-death-penalty argument given to the court in full, but they also present, in rebuttal, the arguments of the judges who disagreed -- noting that, all in all, there was no constitutional reason to reject the death penalty as \\"cruel and unusual\\" per se, but only -- at most -- specific laws that applied it unfairly, and that this is precisely what the court did.Or take the case about abortion, something many liberals support. Far from being supportive of the decision, the authors note that, whatever the outcome, the court's reasoning in this case was a mess -- essentially the judges acting as doctors and legislators, making \\"deals\\" to arrive at a \\"reasonable\\" opinion. The authors note that, socially, the court's decision might have been correct, but constitutionally, it was simply wrong.Why, then, four instead of five start? The issue is simple: credibility. The book's claims ring true; they give a lot of verifiable detail; but you keep asking yourself, how do the authors know all this -- e.g., what happened in judges-only meetings? Who is the \\"deep throat\\" inside the court, and how does HE know all of it? Except if one of the judges themselves was the source, which is very unlikely, it is hard to see how they could get all the information.But that aside, a fascinating book."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Frankly, I thought for sure this would be a 5-star. It's thick, \\"complete.\\" And maybe that's its shortcoming.Many a reviewer has commented on how the details of the politics of the Supreme Court were examined in this volume. The problem I had with it is that (1) the authors' biases were evident and (2) I don't know how the authors could know so well what's going on in the minds of the justices.Regarding the first, I have pretty much the same biases as the authors. I would have admired the Warren Court more than that of Warren Berger. But they judged Berger harshly from the beginning. Methinks that, had they done the same at the beginning of the Warren Court, they may have been surprised.As to the second, there was quite a bit that reminded me of what a former boss pointed out about a Halberstram book. I can't remember the details, but he asked, \\"How could the guy know what was going on in the minds of those in such and such a board room? That was speculative.\\" I found just enough of that in this book to be a little annoying.I was part of a discussion group over the book and some of the group members were amazed by (1) how hard William O. Douglas, the one whom we've looked to for liberal guidance, was on his clerks and (2) that Thurgood Marshall appeared, frankly, to be kind of lazy! I just thought I'd add that for a little color to the review.If there is any one benefit of the book it's that it reveals that the justices are, alas, human. That sounds naive perhaps. But I've often wondered if the Supreme Court is almost like a temple, with the priests going into their chambers of intellectual superiority, way beyond us mere mortals. You may get the picture. But they are very political...and they vary substantially, according to the authors, in their intellectual abilities. That revelation makes the book worth reading. But it is a little cumbersome at times, and you must take some of the authors' words for what they're worth."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Depth: BStyle: CContent: BResearch: AHistorical Impact: DWoodward and Armstrong write a tale of 7 years and 14 Supreme Court judges. To actually write the book, and to access dozens of law clerks and judges, and to amass huge documentation is in itself the feat of the book. The Supreme Court has been the most sheltered of all public institutions with only trifles of coverage before. The book does portray the quirks of the judges, the key decisions of each year, the infighting and the peculiarities of an institution founded on politics yet delivering fundamental cultural dictates.W and A fall down on two points - first, this is not a history book, but a retro-newspaper account. The two can't help but fall into the mode of journalists (which they tacitly state in the intro). This is not a book by Foote, Sandburg, Tuchman, or any other great historian.Secondly, in style they go year by year, day by day practically, without developing any great over-arching themes, lessons, keys, or even predictions.Toobin's recent book \\"The Nine\\" is actually sounder and more stylistic due to Toobin's political analysis and book writer's flair.It is clear that the authors despise Warren Burger, and their portrayal of him is of a petty, manipulative man with little integrity. Other accounts will have to be checked to see if the man is actually so unredeemed.all rights reserved - Scott Jones"},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"After the riveting &quot;All the President's Men,&quot; one would expect that when Bob Woodward sharpened his journalistic pencil to take after the Supreme Court that more fun would follow. Alas, it is not to be. &quot;The Brethren&quot; is a fairly conventional by-the-numbers account of the Nixon-Ford era Supreme Court that tries to drum up tension from such incidents as the movement to impeach the aged Justice William O. Douglas, but ultimately fails. The secretive world of the court would be difficult for any journalist to penetrate, and here Woodward and his cohort Armstrong prove themselves not to be up to the task.A word about this book's availability. I frequent a lot of used book stores and I've come across it on a regular basis."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"The 'Introduction' says the Supreme Court is the highest court and final forum. It operates in absolute secrecy, only revealing its judgments in formal written opinions. Their decision making has been kept secret from the people who are affected. This book tells about the inner workings of the Burger Court from 1969 to 1976. The Supreme Court can reinterpret laws, the Constitution, and prior cases. Numerous confidential sources provided information. It tells how 'LIFE' magazine was used to discredit Abe Fortas to force his resignation (pp.18-19). Page 21 gives the political reasons for Burger's selection. Page 24 suggests the fix was in: the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously recommended Burger. The next seven chapters cover the years 1969 to 1975; each Supreme Court term coves one year from October to June or early July.Do you know that newspapers manipulate the news (p.31)? [You can see this if your area has more than one newspaper.] One of Burger's first actions was against the rigorous code of ethics proposed for federal judges by Earl Warren (p.32). Next he restricted the normal intercommunication between the law clerks (pp.34-35). Was Burger \\"petty, unpleasant, and dishonest\\" (p.71)? Page 85 tells how Burger tried to change the rules to benefit a monopoly. This was a violation of judicial restraint and strict constructionism! Burger then backed down from Douglas' proposed dissent. While the emphasis is on Warren Earl Burger, the personalities and characters of the other Judges are displayed. Many cases were undecided because the Court was deadlocked 4 to 4. Blackmun would provide the deciding vote on these and future cases. This ended Burger's first term as Chief Justice. This book seems slow-paced in covering many details about the Justices. After 25 years, this then important story has faded into the background of history. But its important to understand that the Justices are politicians who do not need popular approval. This book does not go into much detail as to why a specific judge was picked.The \\"Constitutional Journal\\" by Jeffrey St. John was written as a journalistic summary of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Article III Section 1 defined the Court system. They left further changes to Congress. There is nothing in Section 1 that mandates life-tenure, except by default. Congress could specify a term for a fixed number of years, or an age limit. There are examples from history for an age limit. There were six Justices in Washington's era, seven for Jefferson, and nine for Jackson. About one Justice for every two states. If this example was followed we could have had twenty-one Justices by FDR's era. This could allow more work to be done more quickly."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"This book is the most repugnant book in the world.

Now, 15 years later, I'm an attorney and have read the book countless times over the years. It's so interesting to read about the inner workings of the country's highest court, complete with the politics, personalities, and just outright craziness."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Though a bit dated, The Brethren is still required reading for any who would speak intelligently about U.S. public policy. Undergrads considering a PoliSci major or a pre-law track should get this read before fall classes start. Justice John Paul Stevens is 86 as of this writing so we can expect another nomination circus soon. Opinions will be loud and furious but few of those opinions will be informed or articulate. The reason is that the courts are the least understood of the three branches of the U.S. govt. Americans love court TV but their eyes glaze over at the merest hint at what legal professionals actually do.Bob Woodward shows his considerable strengths in this collaborative work with Scott Armstrong. We see his uncanny ability to use the \\"background\\" style of interview to tease out a vivid picture of a generally inaccessible organization. We also see his ready willingness to place his own views alongside statements of alleged fact without the slightest pause for ethical implications. On p.378 of my hardbound copy, the authors describe an effort by one of the Court clerks to rally dissent against a Warren Burger opinion thusly: \\"The debate turned not on what the Chief had said or intended, but on what Klein and some other clerks said it might mean.\\" How Woodward read, maybe even wrote that line with a straight face is beyond my comprehension. Woodward is notorious for quoting a person or conversation or describing events at length and ending the otherwise factual paragraph with a summary of his own that sometimes stretches or distorts the obvious meaning hilariously.Such passages read about like this: The man walked into the courtroom. His body language seemed to say \\"I have contempt for this hallowed organization and shall devote my energies to its downfall in accordance with my extremist views mwahaha!\\" (do you see how I said the passages were LIKE this? Clever eh?) In the closing paragraphs of \\"The Brethren\\" the authors offer this from p. 444: Five separate Fourth Amendment cases were announced on July 6, the last day of the term. All five ruled against citizens' rights and in favor of the government.\\" That is a pretty terse description of cases which have spilled barrels of ink and a false dichotomy besides (are citizen rights truly protected by a government which fails to protect them from crime?)The storytelling is clearly slanted against the Burger court but the overall quality of the work makes the bias forgivable. We learn how the members of the Court see their mandate. We see the enormous role the clerks play in shaping the rulings of the Court. Hopefully, we see the imbecility of street demonstrations in front of the Court Building but probably not.There have been decent books on the SCOTUS since The Brethren but Woodward and Armstrong's work captures a period of transition and evolution. We see the bitter and grudging resignation of William Douglas, one of the longest serving Justices in the history of the Court. We see the machinations behind Roe, busing and capital punishment.The Brethren is a dense and fairly challenging read but well worth it."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Woodward and Armstrong have given us a revealing look at the U.S. Supreme Court during a six-year period (1969-1975) of transition away from liberalism. Taking over as chief justice from Earl Warren in 1969, Warren Burger was fixated on reversing the court's liberal direction and establishing himself as an important historical figure. According to the authors (and others) Burger wasn't entirely up to it. The authors provide us with an intimate look at the other justices, some of whom earned their respect (William Brennan, William Rehnquist), some who fell a bit short (Byron White, Thurgood Marshall), and one who's former brilliance had evaporated due to poor health (William Douglas). The authors also give readers a look at the internal politics of the court, which included political motivations, deal making, and even outright hypocrisy. There is also much focus on important court cases dealing with controversial issues such as busing, abortion, Watergate, etc.This lengthy narrative has the readable feel of a journalistic expose - which it pretty much is. The book is now dated, but remains a superbly revealing look inside the highest court of justice."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Woodward made the most of a mistake by Chief Justice Burger in allowing him the privvy to the inner working of the highest court in the land. This highly readable book brings to life the circumstances that led to opinions on Civil Rights, Abortion, Desegregation etc. The personal accounts in many ways take away the luster of the Court; but also bring comfort to the fact that these fallible men achieved and triumphed in spite of themselves.

Though published in 1979, The Brethren is still a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how the Supreme Court of the US really functions. The political ramifications of their judicial decisions have more of an effect on the lives of Americans those most presidential actions. It also reveals the transformation of previously unknown jurists into national figures and the affect upon their lives. Previously, nominees to the court were little-known and remained so for most of their tenure on the court, the nomination and confirmation process attracting little interest. But, beginning in the Nixon administration, the book also details the beginnings of the nasty political pitched-battles between the left and right about the nominee&#8217;s judicial philosophies that began during the period covered in this book. Previous Supreme Court decisions that changed American society for the better were decried as Judicial Activism by the right. Thus began the unfortunate politicization of the nomination process of new justices to the court.

The book covers the years 1969 - 1975, an extremely active period for the court. Landmark cases involving privacy, integration, abortion, women's rights, Watergate, and more were decided. Woodward and his co-author Scott Armstrong peel away the professional facade of the court to reveal how individual personalities and prejudices often impact court decisions. Unfortunately, many of the justices had feet of clay, but somehow, by pulling and pushing each other, they managed to make the court work for the good of the nation."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I first read The Brethren in 1990, a few years after graduation as a lawyer, when working for a local firm. This book was on the shelves of the firm's library and I read it with relish. Even though I had studied in the US I was unfamiliar with the workings of its judiciary, thus The Brethren opened to me exciting vistas of judges as powerful figures with compelling (or controversial) worldviews, and of the intense political dimension at the top of the judicial activity. Back in 1990 in Colombia the judiciary was the least powerful of the three brances of government and the Supreme Court of Justice, which stood at its apex, was a technical organ made up of grey nonentities. Back in 1985 the guerrilla group M-19, in tandem with the Medell&iacute;n cartel, had invaded the Palace of Justice and had murdered most of the justices of the Supreme Court, and their replacements did not appear (to a young lawyer like I was) as impressive as those had been. Under the Constitution of 1991 a Constitutional Court was created and for better or worse its members have been every bit as political and controversial as those in the US.The Brethren follows key cases on the Court's docket during several terms. It describes the interactions among the justices and the inner workings of the Court. One can imagine who talked to the authors, because they are portrayed in a generally positive light. But in my view, this is an unavoidable price for getting a ring-side seat to the Highest Court of the Land. So what if Chief Justice Burger is made to be more bumbling and unpleasant than he truly was (according to a recent book by his colleague Justice Stevens). It's still a fun book, an excellent introduction to a fascinating subject."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Very much enjoyed the book. The history lesson it provides are a description of the pulse and perspective of this country in the time frame that book discusses, as well as the major issues the nation was facing at the time. The psychology lesson is insight into how these judges, who I certainly took to have a measure of impartiality, still remained political animals (and still very human)-they decided cases not on principals but on how they felt about issues and where they stood on the political spectrum. Though this cuts away at the idealism I had about the sanctity of the Supreme Court, it was a reminder about what they were doing-laying down judgment, which at its very heart is about one's interpretation and feeling about an issue."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I knew it was a used paperback book printed several decades ago, so the paper was yellowed, as I expected.

The insights into the Burger Court are fascinating, especially given how little is still known about the inner-workings of the judicial system during this time period.

Ultimately, however, it may be hard to do given the distrust that occurred following this book's publication."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"The Brethren was written as popular reading, but 30+ years have shown it to be pretty decent history. It's not meant to be deep analysis of the law or the Constitution, but it gives a very interesting picture of the flawed, but sometimes brilliant, humans who form the court.After The Brethren, the world of the Court has become more open- to the benefit of Americans. While many citizens know very little about the workings of such an important institution, it's much less of a mystery. The Brethren must be judged in the context of later developments, including further disclosures that have shown how accurate Woodward and Armstrong were. While some of their sources have been disclosed, most notably Potter Stewart, history has reinforced their reporting.If there is a single theme running through the book, it's the ineptness of poor Warren Burger, a man who was committed to restoring America to that mythical image that is so popular today. Regrettably, that was an America run by privileged white men that most of today's most conservative advocates admit is best kept in the past. As I write in 2011, it's interesting to see that The Brethren chronicled a transition from a court dominated by Roosevelt and Eisenhower appointees to a very different generation."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"This book absolutely flew past.

The surprising aspect of the book is that persuading other Justices was not so much recruiting as it was threatening, deceiving, placating, or other forms of work place politics.This is all shocking until one realizes where the tension originates. These years are portrayed as a struggle between the noble and almost mythic Justices left over from the previous era - the Warren Court - and the new Justices, a.k.a. the Nixon appointees. Inevitably in the book, your appreciation will depend on your political leanings. \\"The Brethren\\" is, more than any book I've ever read, a product of its times. It reflects the anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-Nixon, pro-activist, and downright revolutionary times of the early 1970s. If you choose to read \\"The Brethren,\\" you should understand that it takes positions as being either right or wrong. And with political powder kegs (abortion, busing, the Watergate tapes, the death penalty, etc.), that is an intellectually risky proposition.Worth mentioning are also some lighter moments. Anything relating to the Justices and the obscenity/pornography cases of that time will have you telling your friends about this book. Those parts are filled with priceless humor. My final opinion, however, is that I'm glad I read it (really) but I wouldn't strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"So, you say you want to understand what CONSTITUTIONAL basis the Supreme Court's decisions stand upon? --- You won't find much of that here.Maybe you want to know the MORAL basis of all those famous Supreme Court decisions? --- This book's got it covered.Or maybe you just want to read about the juicy OFFICE POLITICS between the Supreme's. --- Bingo."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Although &quot;The Brethren&quot; was written a quarter of a century ago and it covers the Supreme Court sessions from 1969 to 1975, there are two reasons to hunt down a used copy of this book and read it today. The first is its examination of the important Court decisions of Warren Burger's early years, all of which still reverberate with their controversy and implications. The second is to learn how, in spite of its famously left-of-center decisions, the Court began taking a sharp turn to the ideological right, spurred by the appointment of Burger and by the ascent of the young William Rehnquist.&quot;The Brethren&quot; gave the Burger Court a reputation from which it never quite recovered. Although the Supreme Court has historically had its share of in-fighting, incompetence, and inanity, its internal meltdowns in the 1970s were occasionally beyond the pale. Woodward and Armstrong portray Burger as a well-meaning but ultimately misguided man obsessed by the legacy of Earl Warren, concerned far more with image than with principle, unskilled in management techniques that would have helped bring the Court to a consensus, and unashamed of his repeated attempts to assign the Court's decisions in a fashion insured to thwart the will of the majority. Even today, most historians, regardless of ideological bent, view the Burger years as a mediocre and often inconsistent transition between the liberal Warren Court and the conservative Rehnquist Court.It's not a perfect book, by any means. Woodward and Armstrong are at their page-turning best when they examine in detail some of the more famous decisions and controversies faced by the Court (busing, obscenity, abortion, the death penalty, and--especially--Watergate). And the account is surprisingly balanced: anyone expecting a &quot;liberal&quot; flogging of an increasingly conservative court will be surprised, on the one hand, by the authors' depictions of the increasingly unfit and ornery Douglas and the unsophisticated yet affable Marshall and, on the other hand, by their open admiration of Rehnquist, who comes across as (by far) the most likeable and amiable of the justices. Nevertheless, their account is a bit too heavy on office gossip. True--this journalistic style brings the fourteen justices who served during these years to life, but what's lacking is the necessary detailed legal background that would make sense of the Court's day-to-day work rather than its scandalous backbiting and personality conflicts. Overall, though, it's an admirable piece of journalism that makes the Court seem as human as it really is."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"This is still a must-read for people seriously interested in the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, some of my fellow reviewers had to read this for class or were not interested in the topic, which is really too bad, but these individuals should not be the last word on the issue. I would also like to respond to some of the more outrageous comments from other reviewers:&quot;It is not an easy reading.&quot;To those who do not have trouble reading the newspaper, it will be extremely easy reading. In fact, it is written in such a clear style, with short, to-the-point sentences, as to be among the easiest books I have ever read.&quot;The secretive world of the court would be difficult for any journalist to penetrate, and here Woodward and his cohort Armstrong prove themselves not to be up to the task.&quot;Whoever wrote this obviously had not come of age when the book was published. The publication of &quot;The Brethren&quot; ranks as probably the most scandalous moment in the history of the Supreme Court, because no one to that date had even come close to gaining the insider access that Woodward and Armstrong did-- and no journalist has gotten this close to the Court since. This is an utterly glib and untrue comment. As close as is humanly possible, Woodward and Armstrong penetrated the Court.&quot;'The Brethren' is, more than any book I've ever read, a product of its times. It reflects the anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-Nixon, pro-activist, and downright revolutionary times of the early 1970s. If you choose to read &quot;The Brethren,&quot; you should understand that it takes positions as being either right or wrong. And with political powder kegs (abortion, busing, the Watergate tapes, the death penalty, etc.), that is an intellectually risky proposition.&quot;Funny, because when I read it I had the exact opposite reaction-- I was upset by the excesses of that period. However, I should note that &quot;The Brethren&quot;'s presentation of the issues is absolutely non-judgmental. It notes with honesty what each justice's view was, in such simple language that it often sounds reductionist. People who have read Woodward's other books know that he is not a partisan hack.Again, people who are really interested in the Supreme Court should definitely hunt this down."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Despite being a bit dated, The Brethren, by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, remains one of the most illuminating looks at the inner workings of the Supermen Court. And certainly it will remain a very interesting historical look at the court it examines.The Brethren attempts to present the reader with what &quot;really&quot; goes on in the Supreme Court. It describes the conferences, the personality of justices, and how justice's feel toward each other, items which are generally hidden from the public. Covering the terms from 1969-1975, Woodward and Armstrong gives us a look at the fourteen justices and how they dealt with the major issues facing the court. The book describes how Burger changed his conference votes so he could assign the majority opinion of the court, angering William Douglas and William Brennen. He also describes how Thurgood Marshall greeted Burger &quot;Hey chiefy baby&quot;, getting a kick out of making him feel uncomfortable. The reader sees how Harry Blackmun agonized at being considered Burger's &quot;boy&quot; which eventually led to his breaking away from the conservative wing of the court. Woodward also tells of the lack of respect the justices had for the abilities of Chief Justice Burger, who wrote poorly reasoned opinions that embarrassed some members of the court.The main thesis of the book is how the moderates control the opinions of the court. A majority opinion must have the vote of at least five members of the court, therefore the opinion becomes a compromise between the author of the opinion and his joining brethren. Even when an ideologue writes an opinion, his opinion must be amended to maintain the votes of his brethren. Therefore, the majority opinions of the court usually reflect a somewhat moderate solution, as compared to the ideological make-up of the court.The Brethren also relates how politics play a key role in the decisions of the court. Justices have predispositions to every case they decide, and most have an ideology that influences their decisions. The role of the moderates on the court is also an example of how politics effects the decisions of the court. If a president is able to appoint enough justices of his political persuasion, the court's ideological make-up will change, as will the direction of the court's decisions. Justices on the court do worry about the effect of new appointments to the Supreme Court. When President Gerald Ford appointed Justice John Paul Stevens to the court to replace Justice Douglas, Brennen and Marshall worried about the future of abortion and busing, fearing a new conservative justice might vote to overturn or limit the scope of decisions in these areas. These are a few examples of the role of politics in the Supreme Court.The strengths of this book include its in-depth view of court personalities, antidotes, and relationships between the justices. These are aspects of the court normally not made public. Another strength of the book is its description of how cases are decided, and how a court is &quot;built&quot; (a majority opinion). Further, the reader gets an understanding of the factors that influence a court's opinions such as ideology, compromise, persuasive arguments, and even interaction with the clerks.The major weakness of the book is the lack of documentation. There is absolutely no documentation for the material presented in the book. Woodward's disclaimer is he got the information on background and deep background, meaning the sources go unnamed. He also claims he read memos, unpublished and rough draft opinions, and other unpublished written material generated by the court. Despite the lack of documentation The Brethren remains a must read for students interested in law and politics."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Few nonfiction books combine intimate details, startling information, and humor as well as this one. In The Brethren, the reader will make discoveries about the Supreme Court that he will never have fathomed: the Justices are fallible; there is bickering, politics, and lobbying when making decisions; they joke about pornography; the clerks have a secret society, etc. It is guaranteed to open the reader's eyes to a world that he never could have imagined existed. And I reccomend the book even to those who have a slight interest in the law. Additionally, there are guaranteed laughs (and I mean HUGE laughs) from both the subtle and not so subtle humor that is sprinkled throughout."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I read The Brethren because I have an interest in constitutional law and knew Woodward would do exhaustive research about the Supreme Court before writing this story. This book did not disappoint in its discussion of the constitutional issues debated in the court during the first 6 years of the Burger Court and it was a fascinating expose of the behind-the-scenes activites at the court and the personalities of the justices. Woodward does an excellent job presenting the cases in layman terms, perhaps because he began the project with no legal training himself, and it makes everything very clear for the reader. The most unsettling revelation in the book is how critical constitutional decisions often come down to compromises (&quot;I'll side with you on this case if you side with me on that case&quot;) and personality clashes, though it is important to understand that the justices are people and their determinations are often subject to human passions. I think this book is an excellent history of the court in the early 70s and a cautionary tale for the future and I would highly recommend it to people interested in the Court and/or people interested in practicing law. I would also recommend it for people interested in politics in general, because the court is obviously very political whether it tried to remain independent or not."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"This book might seem dated: it describes the machinations of the court from 1969 to 1976, which included, among other things, Roe v. Wade and the Watergate tapes case. However, it is far from obsolete. The Brethren is a still-unprecedented look into the Supreme Court, the most secretive top-level branch of government. Although the faces (save one) and the cases are different, the way in which cases are decided by this body has likely not, plus it is a look at a tumultous time in ours as well as the Court's history.The focus of the story is Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger, who replaces Earl Warren after his retirement. The irony of the names is unexplored, but it is appropriate, because Burger becomes progressively preoccupied with trying to match Warren's legacy. Unlike Warren, though, he allows political concerns and vanity to influence his judgment and, bit by bit, erode the confidence of his colleagues, to the point where the late William Rehnquist, then a young conservative on the Court, makes fun of him behind his back. Although this book is unflattering to some of the justices, such as Thurgood Marshall, who is noted as lazy and uninvolved and Byron White, who is noted to be unlikeable, Burger is the biggest loser here. The book was published in the early 80s, only a few years before Burger left the court, and the image of him as a pompous, preening, intellectually deficient and generally clueless politician cost him, big time. In spite of the landmark rulings his Court made, he was unable to reverse the Warren Court's liberal activism (as he had hoped to do). His \\"Minnesota Twin\\", Harry Blackmun, would drift further away from him, both politically and personally, until finally becoming the most liberal justice after the departure of Thurgood Marshall in 1991. Burger's Macchiavellian strategizing to assign opinions caused such a backlash that, at one point, William Brennan decides to vote for whatever side of a case puts him in the minority so that Burger won't be able to assign him another crappy oppinion.Ultimately, Burger had good intentions, but his blunders dominate the book. He is a fascinating character, almost as bad a manager and as delusional as David Brent from the recent BBC TV Series The Office. Some of the principals come out looking good: Potter Stewart, for example, and Brennan also. But Rehnquist comes out best, in spite of some scheming and obfuscation. Burger, though, is front and center, and he's a reminder of how we're to seriously we all should take the business of the Court."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"The Brethren, co-authored by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, is an in-depth documentary of the United States Supreme Court from 1969 to 1975, under the leadership of Warren Burger. Woodward and Armstrong present, in detail, all aspects of the court and of it's members. Major issues faced by the court during these years included abortion, racial integration, censorship, and the relationships between the justices. This book is comparable to a lengthy newspaper article. Written more as a source of information than of entertainment, The Brethren is the brutal truth, but not boring. The book was interesting for me, because prior to reading it I did not know much about the Supreme Court. I wanted to finish the book so I could find out what the ruling would be on a particular case, and whether certain justices would retire or not. A feature that helped me get through this book was a chart included in it. The chart listed the justices, the President who appointed them, and the years they had served on the court. It seems that the authors of this book had access to information that all members of the court did not. Gossip was a major part of this book. William Douglas privately referred to Thurgood Marshall as a &quot;spaghetti spine,&quot; and very few members of the court wielded a great deal of respect for Chief justice Burger. When Lewis Powell first arrived on the court in 1971, Potter Stewart informed him that &quot;The leadership was not Burger. He was Chief Justice in name only.&quot; The justices who actually controlled the court's decisions were the swing votes, the justices in the center. If anyone ever asks me why the United States judicial system is so inefficient, I will tell them to read The Brethren. In the supreme court, no case is an easy case, and no decision ever comes quickly. Some issues, such as abortion, were not settled in the Burger court, and are still not settled today. The decisions made by the court are too difficult to be made by nine men. There is too m! uch work to be done on a single case, and many times the clerks contributed more to an opinion that the justices themselves. The clerks and secretaries were often mistreated by their superiors, but they worked hard and thought like their bosses hoping for advancements in the future. The Brethren is very well written and was worth reading. It taught me more than I ever wanted to know about the judicial process and the Supreme Court. If I ever need information regarding one of the court cases from this time period I will go back to this book. It could be used as a textbook for a course on the Supreme Court. Trust in the political system was both strengthened and weakened by this book. I was impressed by how difficult it is to confirm an appointment to the supreme court. Not just anyone can become a Supreme Court justice, but selection is limited to political insiders who don't always know what America is all about. A book like this keeps Washington on it's toes. It reminds politicians that someone is always watching, and even the closest colleague may be willing to talk. The average American probably wouldn't read this book. If they did, they would only pay attention to cases that could possibly pertain to them. It could definitely make some readers angry and confused, causing them to question the whole political system."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"I have just re-read this book, which I first enjoyed while I was taking Con Law in law school in the late 1970s. It is a little dated, but still a fun and well-written insider's story of the workings of the U.S. Supreme Court. Woodward and Armstrong write with an \\"inside the beltway\\" politically-correct perspective which may seem a little dated today. That's one feature that stands out. When it was originally released, Jimmy Carter was just being elected President, and the Congress was 2/3 Democratic. The political battlegrounds have changed in a generation. However, judicially, not as much as you might expect. Many key issues - abortion, free expression, and the role and limits of government, e.g., - continued through Rehnquist's term as Chief and still face the Roberts court. While today's Court line-up is more conservative, the process of internal court politics is certainly similar, so this book remains useful in attempting to understand both the history of the Court when it issued so many of those decisions that still drive politicians mad today, and how the often convoluted opinions on divisive issues are formed.It also provides a little nostalgia in remembering Justices such as Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall. The authors capture a famous incident involving these two. When the Court of the 1970's considered an obscenity case, the Justices would retire, often en masse, to a basement screening room to take in the offending film. This was a world without home videos. Justice Stewart was infamous for his statement in an earlier case that, while he couldn't define obscenity, \\"I know it when I see it.\\" Apparently, at the crucial moment (you know the word I'm avoiding) of the film, Justice Marshall would turn to Justice Stewart and proclaim: \\"That's it - I know it, I see it!\\"Anyone interested in Constitutional Law and the Supreme Court should read this book."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Gives an amazing insight into what went on in the Supreme Court in the past few decades, particularly the interaction between the law and the individual judges' quirks and personal opinions. The Justices are portrayed in all their flaws, and it's amazing to watch the seemingly haphazard process produce results, as much through personal politics as through actual legal decisions! A must read."},{"Title":"THE BRETHREN INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT","review":"Impressive work and Kudos to Woodward and Armstrong. Though it may not be one to pick up for pleasure reading, actually I would highly recommend not reading it unless you needed to find info on the topic or are intrested in the topic. In a review, Anthony Lewis highly critized the book on the way it bashed members on the court and his close friend Brennan. And perhaps that is persicly the reason Lewis did not like the book, because it was often over critical of his friend. The book fully covers the court and gives great inside perspective, though it is questionable about the accuracy of their sources. So, if you are intrested in the topic, great read it. But I have to warn you it is not an easy reading."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"These &quot;Memoirs&quot; postulate a near future when society's framework and infrastructure are breaking down. Young people are forming gangs and moving out of the city, the trappings of civilization are no longer relevant, cannibalism is rumored. Priorities are back to food, shelter, and clothing. Personal safety and a bath cannot be taken for granted. The narrator is an older woman who lives on the ground floor of a large apartment building. A 12-year-old girl, Emily, is brought to her and she is told the girl is her responsibility. The woman does her best to protect Emily, who is growing up quickly, but the girl has a better grip on reality than her protector. Watching the action on the street from the windows, they see first the nomadic groups of young people moving through their area, then gangs forming from their own neighborhood and moving out. Emily falls in love with a young gang chieftain and joins his group, where she finds her responsibilities almost more than she can bear. Her abilities in the new order are great, but she often retreats to the older woman's apartment. As more people move out, life in the city changes. Gangs occupy and protect their territories, raise gardens and animals for food. And then a new kind of gang emerges - younger children who have no idea of organization, loyalty, or even much language. These feral children are vicious and cunning. The quandary is that they are &quot;only children.&quot; Emily's chieftain tries to help them and comes to grief. There are many puzzling threads to the story which are never explained. Does the wall really open into another reality? Is the dog really a dog, or something more? I enjoyed that quality of ambiguity as an added dimension to the story. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"There are several levels to this book, and many obscure threads which are woven together to make a very satisfying, yet provocative and obtuse novel of survival in times of chaos as society falls apart. Some of the mysteries which are present in the story ( who really is Emily, who and/or what is the dog, what is the alternate reality behind the wall, and what are all the charactors doing at the end when the iron egg crumbles) are woven into other novels by Lessing, such as the &quot;Four Gated City.&quot; &quot;Memoirs of a Survivor&quot; is reported to be partly autobiographical.A movie was made in England of &quot;Memoirs&quot; staring Julie Christi around 1985 which was shown briefly in Venice, California. I have not seen it referred to anywhere since."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"Despite the author's accomplished prose style and vivid imagination, this is, in the end, a very boring book about a setting and a theme which should be fascinating: surviving the--or at least an--apocalypse. The problem is that the author remains at such an abstract and intellectual level throughout most of the book. As a result, you don't fully enter into the narrator's world, and you don't really get to know the characters. There is a scene about 30 pages from the end, when some peddlers come selling water in buckets, and there's a fight over the water, when I found myself saying, &quot;Yes--this is exactly the kind of engaging detail that has been missing from most of this story!&quot; The ambiguities of the cat-dog character and the wall-as-conduit-to-alternate-reality do not make up for this fundamental shortcoming."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"The writing is good but this is just a short novella.As I post this review, I have read six of Lessing's novels from different time periods in her career all the way from her first novel in the 1950s to a recent 2003 novel. This present novel is from the middle of her career, written in 1974. As with all of her works, it contains some of the feminine perspectives, dialogues, analysis, and commentary that we associate with Lessing. The present novel is short and the social commentary is toned down drastically from other novels. It is about a person who cares for a young girl who is approximately age 12 to 15, along with the girl's dog. They live through a period of social breakdown.Doris Lessing (1919 - ) is the 2007 Nobel Prize winner in literature. She has a score of novels and many other works. Her complex novel The Golden Notebook (1957), her first novel The Grass is Singing (1950), and The Summer Before The Dark (1973) are considered to be her representative works. I read those three plus a few more. I have set up a Listmania list on her books.The present novel is good. It is not complicated in the fashion of The Golden Notebook. It is closer to being a short story. It has a good set of characters and an interesting plot. Without giving away the plot, Lessing describes the personality of the female protagonist living in an urban area that has been subject to a complete social breakdown. She is the narrator in the story. Lessing never tells us the cause of the problem, but the government is essentially gone, there is no electricity or water, and gangs roam the streets. People keep animals to eat and grow their own crops. The story is about the young girl, Emily, who has been left with the older woman. Emily matures and takes up with a local leader. Some might not like the book because it lacks emotion.I liked the book and would recommend it. It is a short quick read that takes an evenings to read. It does not contain the feminine arguments found in some of her longer works, but the present work is far easier read than The Golden Notebok (far, far easier) and it is a well written novel. If I had to pick one book that is easy to read and contains her arguments, I would recommend The Grass is Singing. It is a more innovative work and also easy to read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"What struck me most in the marvelous Lessing short book, Memoirs of a Survivor, is how matter-of-factly we accept horrific changes as long as they happen bit by bit. The absence of emotionality in the story, noted by others, is, I believe, intentional. As conditions worsen, the main character (and her ward) find ways to adapt, but never consider what actions they might take to reverse the societal decline.This is a story about our inherent passivity, our overweaning trust that someone else will surely take care of things when they go bad. It is also a testament to our ability to adapt to changing circumstances, but in general I feel it is a condemnation of our blindness to perceive and then resist those changes that dismantle and ultimately destroy vibrant societies."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of a Survivor","review":"My suggestion is to take this book at face value - a tale of a woman and her child trying to survive in an increasingly hard world. I didn't love it but there were aspects that still linger in my memory where other books have faded completely.

Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner.

Bettilu Faulkner has written a narrative of her uncle's psychic experiences for those who, likewise, need no convincing.Her account includes generous transcriptions of his psychic channeling, often taken from tape recordings her uncle was prescient enough to make while a congenial spirit named George spoke through him. The difficulty with her account is that the taped transcriptions begin when the biography reaches the late 1920s/early 1930s. Tape recorders, on the other hand, were first introduced to the U.S. in 1947. There is thus a gap of nearly 20 years between the earliest possible recording date and the purported date of the first transcribed sessions.Ms. Faulkner is a relative of the subject, not a professional biographer. She apparently did not have a professional editor, so this slip was probably unintentional. Whether the tapes Ms. Faulkner transcribes were deliberately misleading is another question. In the end, the narrative has the same take-it-or-leave-it credibility as any other account of someone who espies fairies, elves, and dead relatives.This should hardly matter to those who already are convinced, through experience or belief, of the fundamental truth of the psychic phenomena described.

It is jam-packed with theories and a wealth of practical experiences and lessons learned. This book is very comprehensive and goes beyond the catchy series title of \\"Absolute Beginner's Guide\\".I particularly found the Tip/Note/Caution pop-up style side-bars amusing and very helpful (I cheated and read them first before every page). Some of these pop-ups are very insightful (e.g. Caution: Page 32 - \\"A good project manager can still end up managing and delivering a troubled project\\").The summary/review section entitled \\"The Absolute Minimum\\", at the end of every chapter, is a very smart and practical method to review what the previous chapter was all about.This book goes beyond the mechanics of pure project management. As an example, in Chapter 16 \\"Leading a Project\\" this book discusses leadership, techniques and success factors. The \\"Servant Leadership\\" approach is extremely effective and I am also very glad that someone had already named it and documented it as early as 1970.Job very well done. This book is HIGHLY recommended for beginners and experts alike.Marwan F. Zakaria, PMP"},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"If you're either a new project manager (without PM training), orsomebody interested or involved in project management, then thisbook is for you.I've read the Project Management Institute's Project ManagementBody of Knowledge (PMBOK) cover to cover and I honestly don'tknow how I prevented myself from going to sleep.This book, on the other hand, is the most exciting book I'veever read about project management. Greg's 16 years ofexperience is evident in his writing.Get this book, read it and before you know it, you're on yourway to become a better project manager."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I think what makes this book stand out from all the others is how well the information is laid out for the reader. This is definitely a great starting point for a PM beginner. However, I think it's also an outstanding reference guide for those that have been in the field of project management for many years. Anyone that has read the PMBOK or other PM books knows that the material can become overwhelming when it's not communicated clearly. This book does an outstanding job of making the topic easy to understand. I wish this book had been around when I was starting in this field, and even studying for the PMP exam. I highly recommend it!Emelee Mitchum, PMP"},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I've read 10 books on PM in the last 3 years. Without a doubt this is the most practical one I've read. It takes PM theory and goes much further than other beginner's guides to actually telling you how to do apply the theory in the real world. The mind maps are particularly good. I have used these maps extensively for operations staff training and brain storming for phase planning. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"This is a fine introduction to project management. Well-written and well-paced, it functions as a great starting point, but can be handy to have around as a general sourcebook refresher course as well.However, I only give this book 3 stars because of it's not an exaggeration to say that it is not much more than a printed and bound Powerpoint presentation. The entire book is a collection of bullet points upon bullet points. The sidebar tips and short chapter overviews are very nice, but mostly you learn from ordered lists.Would have been nice for reference if the authors had focused their fine tutorial writing skills into a balance between bullet points and more narrative formats.Still and all, despite its flaws I'd have to recommend it as the go-to book for the beginning project manager."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I have re-read a number of books immediately after reading them for the first time. Re-reading well-written fiction is of course a pleasure, but I usually reserve this technique for non-fiction that is hard to understand or very dense, and I may re-read immediately after the first read or months or years later.This book is the first I have decided to re-read before I even finished it. The information presented is so full of useful knowledge that I realized I would forget most of the points while I was taking in the newer stuff. With the diagrams and summaries there is a vast amount of content here.I have one small criticism that I'd like to make. The book shows common-sense techniques for project management, and on subjects like this we feel we could do the job based on instinct. I think that the book, instead of being almost exclusively saying DO THIS, should have a few examples of DON'T DO THIS. Stories that involve mistakes and disasters tend to make the lesson more memorable.I have written several books, and I have rarely been more impressed at how the author handles huge amounts of information.Anyway, this book is worth five stars.EDIT: Forgot to mention it, but the book has a dangerous typo. On page 208, the book says \\"Exclude\\" but the word intended is \\"Exude\\" - in this case, that's almost 180 degrees from the intended meaning.And a big Hi! to my loyal fans.

When managing multi-level projects with teams and leaders involved it is key to have a method to the madness. Greg gives you a path to follow and makes sure the team understands that path. Love the side notes and the personality of the book as well. A successful project manager is essential to all areas of business. Most professionals should considering brushing up on this language and steps in execution to handle any type of deliverable.

In his new second edition he has improved the readability of the format. His \\"Accelerating the Learning Curve ---- Even More\\" section has three new chapters that take the reference to the reality level.Most books on project management discuss the processes and techniques but fall short by not relating the actual implementation and practice of actually managing the project in real time. Greg achieves this through giving us the benefit of his wealth of project experiences he managed. I managed more than 250 projects in my career so far and it covers the attributes of them all.Greg's continued use of Mind Mapping and the graphical representations for reporting the status and issues maintain his standard for reviewing and keeping things in perspective.His PMO section is right on. I had the good fortune to be at the beginning stages of a PMO in a multi business enterprise and its evolution and his assessments are correct based upon my experiences.This is not only a great reference book for all PM's of any sophistication but it should be the Textbook for Technical Colleges and Universities for Project Management courses. Coupled with the PMBOKA Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge: (Pmbok Guide)and this reference one need not look further for Project Management references. I hold it in the same group as the Capers & Jones book on software engineering.Bravo Greg!"},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"Okay... to like this book, with such a title, almost reeks of rookie, but I've been around a few projects, in a few industries (manufacturing, industrial, automotive, construction, and IT), and this book is best labelled as \\"practical and efficient\\". It uses the KISS philosophy unintentionally... rather than writing about a lot of stuff on one topic, or about a lot of topics, the author writes about what is truly a practical approach to doing things... I'd say this is likely too much information for a real beginner to appreciate... the author does a great job making every paragraph and bullet count... easy to read, yet to the point and a reminder of what PMs should be doing. I teach at a College in my spare time and have developed a nine course Project Management Program... I reach for this book among many others, particularly for its simplicity and structure - it covers more than I would expect, and provides an impressive base from which to build depth. Impressed. Well written. Would love to see the author add such books and style to focused areas such as Risk, EVA, Communications, Scope Management, etc...

The content in this new book that is targeted at \\"beginners\\" is helpful, comprehensive, well-written, and, yes, easy to find! The book is a good addition to any PM's library, not just a beginner. The author has extensive experience that he gnerously shares--you'll find practical ideas and suggestions that you can use today. Chapter 2 provides a superb description of the roles, skills, and qualities of the successful project manager. The author describes the critical value and importance of project leadership versus project management--an area that most of us can benefit from reflecting on. He discusses the attitude and mindset required by a PM. Table 3.1 provides common reasons for troubled projects, examples of them, and key learning points concerning each reason--great food for thought and action. Chapter 11 provides a detailed discussion of managing project changes, an increasing concern (as clarified by Cheryl L. White in her book, Change on Demand). Chapter 23 explains how to make better use of Microsoft Project, one of the popular automated project management tools."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"If you knew nothing about project management, then this would be the book I would have you read."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I bought that book for my college class which is an introductory class to project management. The book is very easy to read, you finish a chapter in no time. I think it gives you a good first impression about the topics that are relevant in that field but it's still only an introduction. It's really simple and most things seem pretty trivial to you. However, the author seems to really identify with the reader, he doesn't lecture and doesn't stick to technical terms but makes it fun to read. If you're looking for a book that will give you only a sense / an idea about what project management is like; buy this one. However if you're looking for something more substantial, you might reconsider buying it."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"Greg has pulled it off again making it even clearer this time the need to map a project and use a process.

Handy reference as well."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"This is a good project management book for beginners.

This is not necessarily a bad thing...project management is a wide field.Recommended."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I run a management and technology consulting firm and I am constantly searching for materials to supplement our internal training materials. In the past, we have leveraged the PMBOK as the definitive resource for our project managers. After reading this book, however, I will be looking to supplement the PMBOK with this new and insightful guide.As you would expect from any good project manager, the book is well organized and out-lined , and uses a logical and conversational approach to covering the subject matter. This is the best book I have seen with respect to speaking in common terms about projects and project management so that the new project manager can quickly become comfortable with the subject matter.I particularly like the coverage of some of the \`softer' skills in Chapter 2 and throughout Section 4 (Project Execution). Each provides a nice healthy balance to the science of project management (i.e PMBOK) discussed in most project management books. Without the \`art', the science is of little true value. Said differently, this book serves as a very practical guide for all levels of project management rather than simply focusing on the academic methodologies. Yet, for those preparing for their PMP, this book does use the PMBOK as its foundation and uses those terms and nomenclature throughout, so that the practical application is all related back to the PMBOK.I will definitely use this book as: 1) a basis for educating new project managers in my firm, 2) a refresher for experienced project managers who need some reminders on the \`softer' skills that define world-class project management, and 3) a recommendation for my clients to help them understand why we do what we do, and how they can improve their internal project management, and project managers."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"I'm a technical person and recently had a new responsibility of managing a short term project.I grabbed this book and read it now thrice.

He provides insights that can only be gained from years of experience - see the chapter on \\"When Reality Happens\\". Third, the guide is comprehensive. It covers all the basics and more.

The author assumes the reader has a complete lack of prior knowledge of any project management skills. It could be a good reference guide to someone with the project management duties but without the formal PM title. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone with more than two years professional experience.It seems to be written for a high school level education, which has advantages and disadvantages: it is easily digestable and a quick read but sometimes risks presenting the material in an overly simplistic description.While it provides a thorough introduction to the concepts of project management in a cookbook style, it does not provide adequate background on the soft skills, political savvy, and negotiation skills required of a project manager to resolve conflicts."},{"Title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management","review":"It is an easy read.

Reverend Jen is supported by her rich, suburban (Maryland) parents and, unlike most of you reading this, will never need to get a job. Instead, she has the luxury to \\"slum\\" it out in the LES, surround herself with supportive nimrods, and crank out moronic drivel. It's easy to knock hardworking people and mock society when you are a kept bird who never has to roll out of bed before noon."},{"Title":"Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood/Les Misrahi","review":"I cringed when I read the so-called review in which the reviewer launched a personal attack on the author rather than discussing the book. That was extremely inappropriate, and the person who wrote that should be ashamed of himself or herself. Then again, another reviewer, in response to that out-of-line review, wrote something that praised the author but again did not address the book itself at all. I think some people are missing the point of a review.Lest I too become one of those people, I'll now talk about the book: I liked it.The Lower East Side is a fun place. As Manhattan becomes more uniformly upscale and sanitized (you *know* things are changing when even the Meatpacking District becomes fashionable), the Lower East Side is the last bastion of hipness and nonconformity. I thought &quot;Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood&quot; captured the feel of that very nicely. As the author says, it's quite likely that some of the places she mentioned will no longer be there by the time the reader reads the book, but that hardly matters. The value of the book is not in its usefulness as a travel guide. Rather, I think it serves as a snapshot of a certain place at a certain time - a neighborhood somewhere between the old dangerous-but-fun New York and the new safe-but-bland New York."},{"Title":"Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood/Les Misrahi","review":"Every city guide should be as funny and personal and filled with wisdom and real experiences as Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood. This book is poetry of the ridiculous. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who's ever struggled in New York. You will laugh with recognition.By the way, Les Misrahi, the companion play that comes with the book and was apparently performed by the author with puppets outside her landlord's office is also hysterically funny. It tells the story of the author's alter-ego Jen Valjean, who was imprisoned for stealing a glue stick from Kinko's. Silly and brilliant."},{"Title":"Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood/Les Misrahi","review":"I for one hope and pray that the Rev has got rich parents who will look after her.

It sounds as though this review was written by either a.) a jilted lover b.) her landlord or c.)or her former editors at a magazine that shall remain nameless, but who went out of business shortly after canning the Reverend.

I picked it up as a teenager and taught myself to read music and play the piano. Later, with just a half dozen formal lessons, I took a grade 7 Royal Conservatory of Toronto standard music performance exam, and passed comfortably. Later I passed the sight reading audition to study piano and voice in college.The book is a pleasure to learn from, as it's packed with interesting, but not too involved, discussions of music and theory at a very simple level. The best thing about it is the philosophy, applied in every aspect, that one should start by playing actual music. In contrast, I've heard a piano teacher say one should start by studying nothing but scales and technique for the first 6 months. Sure: learn to play like a machine, without feeling, if you have the stomach and discipline for that. No, this book introduces beautiful classic melodies, simply but effectively arranged, to evoke the complex emotions that come from genuine music. An example I remember would be a minuet from the Anna Magdalena Bach book -- perfect for a JS Bach nut like me."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"Believable. Interesting. Captivating.

Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until the end. The basic story: Wealthy man is told that he is \\"kidnapped,\\" and then told that he will lead his life normally, but if money isn't put in investments owned by the kidnappers, the protagonist's friends and family will begin to die, one by one.This is a truly frightening premise, and is well described. I was at first annoyed because the villains all seemed to be hispanic, but then I noted that one of the really good guys is a man named Garcia who lives in Mexico, who is a sort of \\"fixer\\" of these kinds of problems. I enjoyed all the characters and recommend this book for anyone that has an afternoon to kill reading a nice mystery/thriller."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"After having been disappointed in David Lindsey's last book, Animosity, I approached The Rules of Silence with at least some trepidation. Was Animosity a fluke or an indicator of a downward trend in Lindsey's writing? The answer was hard to say: on the one hand, The Rules of Silence is a far better book, but it also suffers from some of the same flaws as the earlier book.In this novel, Titus Cain, a wealthy software entrepreneur, is targeted for extortion by a vicious and very well-organized thug. While Cain seeks help from a mysterious anti-terrorism expert named Burden, his friends start dying. As Burden takes over, Cain is caught in the middle, manipulated by both sides: even as the extortionist makes him jump through hoops, Burden - a do-gooder willing to kill innocents if it means elimination a major terrorist - has Cain doing things that grate on the businessman's conscience.Interestingly, the big problem with this book is exactly the same as in Animosity: the protagonist is not a man of action but rather reaction. Cain rarely takes any initiative but merely reacts to the situation. As a reader, I want to see Cain actually do something; instead, it is Burden who is called in to save the day, and Cain is just along for the ride. In a suspense novel, we may expect the main character to try and depend on an authority figure, but we also anticipate that in the end, it'll be the hero who will succeed or fail, not his substitutes.The story itself is pretty exciting although there are very few plot twists. The principal villain is a nasty piece of work, and is probably the most interesting character in the whole novel. The fact that this is a generally fun and fast read goes a long way to offset its critical flaws, and overall, I'd have to rate this as a good, but not great book...a weak four stars. For fans of Lindsey, this is a mixed success, but it is generally an improvement and should encourage readers to try another of his books in the future."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"Lou Diamond Phillips gives an economic, energetic reading to this story of a man caught in a whirlpool of evil. Tony nominee Phillips is remembered for his numerous film, television, and stage performances.Multimillionaire Titus Cain has it all. He's smart - so intelligent that he founded a software company that made him zillions. His wife is all he could wish.Then one day something he would never wish for happens - he's approached by Cayetano Luquin, a man sans conscience or scruples. Luquin demands that Cain fork over 64 million or Cain's loved ones will be systematically murdered. Further, he cannot just pay the money, but he must make a series of bad investments over the next few days in order to put the money into Cayetano's hands.Terrified that any harm should come to those he cherishes in life Cain initially pulls out all stops to comply with the bizarre demand. Then, deciding to fight back, Cain realizes he must have allies - allies as remorseless as Cayetano.Those who enjoy building suspense laced with shivers should give a listen to \\"The Rules Of Silence.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"If you're a David Lindey fan and you worried after &quot;Animosity&quot; that he'd maybe lost his way and perhaps left the genre for good --- fear not. &quot;The Rules of Silence&quot; is sensational.

Tano has chosen Titus Cain as his new victim.Tano kidnaps Titus to explain the rules of the latest game, and the rules are simple:Over the next four days Titus must make a series of \\"bad investments\\" totaling 64 million dollars. These payments must be made to Tano, and if any of the payments are missed someone close to Titus will die. Titus gets to go on living his life as usual, but nobody is to know of the kidnapping, and the money being paid must go undiscovered by his financial advisors. If Titus should break any rule, or talk to someone there will be a murder of those closest to him. There will be no warnings, and Tano will not repeat the rules, but if you break one of them you will pay.Titus decides to fight back, and in the process realizes he is up against a man more ruthless than he imagined, and if he is to come out of this alive he must fight as dirty as Tano.\`The Rules Of Silence' is a smart, well written thriller that actually thrills. A page-turner of the highest order this novel grabs hold from page one and doesn't let go. The action comes fast and furious as the kidnapping plot unfolds, and as the various sub-plots develop the reader will find they can't put the book down.David Lindsey is a wonderful thriller writer. I have been a fan for many years, and his novels get better, and better. Mr. Lindsey can always be counted upon for an original thriller, one that is smart as well as suspenseful. \`The Rules Of Silence' should jump onto bestseller lists everywhere, and place David Lindsey alongside other superstar authors in the genre for he is very deserving of it.Read this novel, you will not be disappointed!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"I've always had the feeling that David Lindsey was the \\"thinking man's\\" mystery/thriller writer. The reader was impressed at the writing skill and depth of the writer - the book HAD to be read slowly to appreciate the nuances he brought to the story, however gruesome the topic. Now he goes and writes something completely out of style: a book that grabs you from the first chapter and doesn't let you go until the final page. Great writing, as usual, but much more fast-paced than in the past.

His current chosen lamb is software developer guru Titus Cain.Titus and his wife Rita turn to counterterrorist expert Garcia Burden to help expedite the Cains from this devious plot. If Tano learns that his victims deviated from his script, one by one those close to Titus will be marked for death plus a demand for an increase from the $64 million dollar first offer will occur. A former CIA agent, Garcia starts gathering information on his opponent knowing that if he breaks THE RULES OF SILENCE of this game someone will die.Though somewhat similar in theme to Jon Katzenbach's THE ANALYST, THE RULES OF SILENCE is an exciting action thriller that never slows down until the final confrontation occurs. The story line moves at a rapid pace so readers need to wear their seat belts at all times. The villain and his opponent each have agendas that make them the lead duo in a deadly game of cat and mouse, and more easily understood than the victims. Not quite as character rounded as David Lindsey's usual novel (see A COLD MIND and MERCY), readers will still appreciate this exhilarating thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"Titus Cain has what some would call the \\"perfect life.\\" He has a loving relationship with his wife Rita, several good friends, and has built his own multi-million dollar company.

What ensues is a suspenseful, psychological thriller that leaves you breathless.This is my first time reading a work of David Lindsey, and I became an instant fan. THE RULES OF SILENCE is a gripping page-turner that left me wanting more. This is a must read for those looking for an intelligent, fast-paced, action-packed novel.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"I won't bore you with a synopsis of the book, let me just say that as someone who has read all of Lindsey's books this is one if his best. It's fast paced and is taunt. I have read very few writers who can describe places like Lindsey, you can almost smell the dank Mexico City air. If you love thrillers and enjoy great writing then you will love Lindsey and this book. Other books from David Lindsey I recommend: A Cold Mind, In the Lake of the Moon, Body of Truth, and Requiem for a Glass Heart."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"Similar type plot books out like this or I would have given it 5 stars.

He has a fine home and a good relationship with his wife and their two daughters.Instantly, his world of harmony and assuredness transforms into one of discord and uncertainty when a visitor from out-of-town shows up unexpectedly. The stranger threatens to kill Titus' family and friends unless he gives up 64 million dollars of his hard-earned fortune.Titus, not willing to give in easily, goes against the orders of the extortionist and solicits assistance from an ex-CIA agent, Garcia Burden. From Garcia, Titus learns that the stranger is Cayetano Luquin, a notorious drug principal with a deadly past and possible ties to terrorism.Garcia sets up his high-tech investigative operation and starts working on a plan of action. When people start dying, Titus feels there is more he needs to know and threatens to go to the FBI if Garcia doesn't give him more information. Garcia concedes but it comes with a price that Titus will have to pay for the rest of his life.Once enlightened to the magnitude of the situation, he decides to allow Garcia to continue with the case. Garcia organizes what seems to be the perfect plan to capture Cayetano and his entire crew, when things go awry. Then it is up to Titus to save his own life, the lives of those closest to him, and maybe the world.David Lindsey tells the story in such vivid imagery that you actually feel that you're in the Texas hill country. The story includes the language and violence expected in a story about extortion and murder. Overall, it is a book that is hard to put down, and when you do, you'll feel like you just watched an action movie."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"In general I don't read a lot of detective or mystery fiction. An exception has been David Lindsey. I own most of his books, even some of the more obscure works, published early in his career. I have been drawn to Lindsey's books by his writing style and the moral ambiguity of his plots. Sometimes decent people do ugly things in Lindsey's stories. As in life, in Lindsey's plots there have been no simple answers.The Rules of Silence is the last David Lindsey book I'm planning to buy. The only reason that I was able to finish this howler is that I could not believe that the plot was really as simplistic as it turned out to be. I kept thinking that Lindsay would twist the plot around in the end and show the reader that everything that they thought was true was not. Instead The Rules of Silence was a waste of time and money. This is the sort of book that I would expect from Clive Cussler, not the author of Mercy.In contrast to some of Lindsay's previous work, the characters in The Rules of Silence are cliches, without any depth. The story is so predictable and trite that until I reached the last page I could not believe that Lindsay would actually write something like this. If Lindsay had a long history of writing empty \\"boy fiction\\", then I would not expect anything else. Sadly Lindsay has been capable of better work. Given the poor quality of this book and the fact that there are so many good books, I'll think twice before spending time on another David Lindsay work."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"Within the confines of its genre, this book is fantastic. It scared the daylights out of me so patiently, so quietly, that I didn't even realize I was gripping it so tightly until I became worried about library fines. We meet a character, get to know enough of him to find him okay and basically likable, and then we watch him react to his life falling apart. His heroic response wins us over. The rest of the book is not as much fast-paced as it is unrelenting, and while this isn't literature, it is an efficient use of language and scene that is admirable in any genre. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get completely lost in a book, and find it the best of its genre so far. I hope Mr Lindsey hits the bestseller list alongside guys like Michael Connelly and Lee Childs, as both write similar mysteries that are not quite as intense or psychological as this one."},{"Title":"The Rules of Silence","review":"It's a good thing that Mr. Lindsey is writing books, instead of coming up with ideas such as portrayed in this adventure/mystery novel...I'd hate to have him on the wrong side of the law. The book sounded interesting, and it was. The realization that so much of our nation's police forces, espionage, search and rescue groups, and politicians have their minds elsewhere, makes the premise of this book, someone coming in and threatening someone in the U.S. who has a corporation under him, very plausible. Because of 9/11 and the various wars or problems in other nations our own nation is involved in, makes the possibility of someone using this as an opportunity frighteningly possible. I sure hope someone is paying attention to this possibility out there.This story is very much more along the lines of a Tom Clancy book, but it is better written then the latest Tom Clancy books which are often relegated to other writers in 'his' group. This was a new author for me and I was very impressed with his writing, and his plotting. I had a bit of a difficult time keeping up with all the various people who were called in to do a single job, and then left.I also knew right away, that the woman assistant was going to be targeted by the mastermind of this entire operation. In a situation such as thought up by this evil man, lives are not worth anything...and he will target those closest to the man he is manipulating.The ending is not unexpected, but the idea of having to keep absolute silence about the reality behind two deaths because of possible national and international consequences is mind-boggling. To not even be able to talk out such horror with a psychologist/psychiatrist for fear of what might happen, and then live with the knowledge that someone killed two people you loved just to get to you...I think most people with a conscience would find it very difficult to do that...be totally silent.A terrifying read...Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"This is your Civil Air Patrol;: The purpose, cadet program, equipment of the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary","review":"When I was a rugrat, longer ago than I really want to remember, I was enamored of the works of Caroll B. Colby. They were incredibly formulaic: A half-page or more picture (almost always from official sources) accompanied by a paragraph or two of comments and a fair amount of performance statistics on various pieces of (mostly) military hardware. Years later, while drawing up a bibliography of Civil Air Patrol reference materials, I stumbled across this item. It's classic Colby, in a heavy-duty library binding with a sorta-reproduction of the dust-jacket picture on the cover. Curiously (even for Colby, who was himself a CAP member when he wrote this), the book is a bit thin on detail throughout. However, the reader looking for a snapshot of CAP in its second decade, it's not bad. I'd be careful about overpaying for a copy, as books on CAP, with the exception of some of the most recent works, have traditionally been thin on literary or historical merit. Historically, this is a trend going back to \\"Flying Minute Men\\", the original book on the wartime CAP that was produced not by the Army Air Forces Historian's Office, but by the AAF Public Affairs Office. That said, the images are decent (if a bit staged) and it will fill in a gap in the collector's library."},{"Title":"Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things","review":"What happens when nave meets psycho...major drama. Java Weathersby tackles some tough issues in her newly released book Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things. Based on a true story, Weathersbys' first adventure into the real world is not what she had hoped for. Impressionable, to say the least, Java a gusty freshmen suddenly finds herself caught up in the social world of campus life. Smitten by one smooth talking fraternity man, who is simply known as Omar, this college sweetheart is eager to please. Sensing that she is willing to do almost anything to keep him, Omar uses extreme measures to tests the limits of her love.An emotional rollercoaster ride from the very beginning, Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things is a must read. Informative as well as entertaining, Weathersby does a nice job of engaging readers about the importance of loving ones self and the need for mutual respect in relationships. A fresh voice on the literary scene, Weathersbys' writing is simple, clean and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things","review":"Java Weathersby's novel, CRAZY MEN CAN MAKE YOU DO CRAZY THINGS, is based on a true story, and answers the question: Is craziness contagious? Beginning with her high school years and moving into college, Weathersby weaves an enjoyable tale about her life and relationships with men.In high school Java begins dating Miguel after they attend a school dance together. They appear to have a good relationship, but underneath the surface Miguel is dealing with some issues that will keep these two from ever really being more than friends. While Miguel has issues he is not the first official crazy man she will date, instead he is a stepping stone to Omar, a man whom she meets in college. Omar is everything a girl can ask for; he takes her places, buys her things and seems to have a genuine interest in her. Java moves out of her mother's house and into Omar's apartment, and things begin to change for her. He becomes obsessed with her even to the point that he kidnaps her rather than allowing her to go to a dance. Java enters the relationship as a virgin and the two are not having sex so Java is willing to allow Omar to go outside the relationship for sexual gratification. To make matters worse, during the time that she is dealing with Omar she goes out on a date with a co-worker to get revenge on Omar and ends up dealing with another crazy man who attempts to rape her. Java continues her relationship with Omar and doesn't realize how bad things are until she finds herself alone on the streets in the middle of the night.CRAZY MEN CAN MAKE YOU DO CRAZY THINGS is an intriguing tale that will have readers saying, \\"No she didn't!\\" or\\" What is she thinking?\\" The novel is written in a conversational tone and will keep the reader interested in what will happen next. The only downside is the length. Weathersby mentions in both the introduction and the end that this is only the first book with emphasis on one relationship; however, it could be longer. Overall, this book will take you through a range of emotions, will make you laugh, and make you wonder. All this while teaching a lesson to stay away from crazy men because you never know when or if their craziness will rub off on you.Reviewed by Criss Colesfor The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things","review":"I had the pleasure of reading \\"Crazy Men Can Make You Do Crazy Things\\" and I enjoyed the novel.

I know about all the mind games that they play, because I played them when I was in college. My worst nightmare would be for my daughter to meet \\"the old me\\" in school.The author does an excellent job in expressing a view that is seldomly spoke of...the view of a naive, 18 year old virgin. She exposes the manipulative ways of (some) college males that have more than just an education on their minds. Let's face it, because this was a true story, you may say that she was too naive, or some may even say she was stupid...but the bottom line is, we were all raised differently and WE ARE WHO WE ARE and ultimately, nobody but Jesus can change that.My daughter has NO CHOICE but to read this book. Just as the write-up says, it made me laugh, cry and at times, mad as hell, because all I could see was my daughter walking in this author's shoes.EVERY COLLEGE OR COLLEGE-BOUND FEMALE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.May God continue to use this book to entertain, but more importantly, to help others.

The book was alot of fun to read, and planted some interesting plot \\"seeds\\" that come to fruition later in this series.This series was purposely written in the general style of the SF/adventure series of a by gone era, reminiscent for me of the Tom Swift, Jr. books I read as a teen, but with better writing and plot in my opinion. As such, there is a fair amount of \\"gee whiz\\" type moments that could rub some people the wrong way, and the characters are not as fleshed out as they could be. However, this is the first book in a 9 book series, and as you read the series the characters gain much depth and the story becomes more and more involved and interesting to follow.This book was fun to read for me as an adult, but would be easily suitable for and might be especially enjoyed by a teen. The worldview of the book is similar to that found in some of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, with evil and good fairly clearly delineated, though the style and content is different.My advice is to borrow or buy this book and if you like it even a bit to go ahead and read the next in the series, \\"The Runaway Asteroid\\", which is available as a free download (google starman series downloads). Then borrow/buy the third book, \\"Journey to the furthest planet\\". If by then you do not like the series you have spent a relatively small sum of money, but if you do, then you are in for a fun ride in reading the remaining six books of this nine book series!"},{"Title":"Wicked German (Wicked Travel Series)","review":"A very funny little German book that is as much a satire on the language, Germans, and travel in general as a phrasebook. Although only 64 pages, it packs a lot of humor and entertainment into this small package. Some of the phrases are truly funny. To give you a sampling of some of what's in the book, here are a few examples. In the chapter on Clothing I found \\"Diese Hosen sind einfach ummerfend.\\" (These lederhosen are hilarious!) In the chapter on dealing with policemen, there was \\"Ich muste sie naturlich von der Strasse rammen.\\" (I had to run him off the road, of course). In the chapter on \\"Words of Love and Pastry,\\" there was \\"Ich mochte in Ihren Gugelhopf beissen.\\" (I want to bite your Bundt cake). And in the chapter, \\"The Wurst of the Wurst,\\" there was \\"Habe ich erwahnt das ich mich entschlossen Vegetarier su weiden?\\" (Did I mention that I've decided to become a vegetarian?).The book is devided into 38 sections of a page or two, each with its own funny phrases. The book is mostly phrases and sentences, but there are a few funny words highlighted too. There is also a humorous two-page \\"fractured\\" history and timeline of beer, which has entries like, \\"1516--The German Purity Law is written ro protect the quality of beer. Anyone caught drinking a Coors is spanked to death by a 300-pound barmaid.\\" Even the chapter and section titles are humorous, such as \\"Surviving German Romanticism,\\" and \\"Grimm Tales of the Black Forest.\\"If you liked this book I can also recommend \\"Scheisse!: The Real German You Were Never Taught in School,\\" by Gertrude Besserwisser, which covers all the funniest and most outrageous German curses, epithets, slang, and other phrases of dubious parentage and gentility. For example, I learned that saying \\"BMW\\" doesn't just mean the name of a car, it also refers to a woman who is not especially well-endowed, since it's from \\"Brett mit Warzen,\\" or \\"a board with warts.\\" But a lot of the book wouldn't be repeatable here, so I'll have to leave it at that and urge you to get the book yourself if you're interested."},{"Title":"Wicked German (Wicked Travel Series)","review":"I hate to be a stick-in-the-mud here, but this book is really NOT a \\"phrase book\\" and should not be listed in the language reference section.

The nuances can thwart a student of the language of romanticism. For example did you know that \\"Fic dir\\" has only the literal meaning to the average German citizen, who is likely to reply with, \\"Danke bitte\\" or a confused stare. Scheiss is in fact literal, and offensive in any language, but many insults are going to have to be run by a native speaker if you would like to truly offend in German.This book is about much more than insults. It is a parody of a phrase book and not an actual phrase book (if you didn't catch on yet). The phrases included are there for humor, and look accurate (but I'm not a native speaker). It has sections on pick-up lines, waiting in lines and other situations not dealt with in a basic German text book. Mostly the cusses are what you want to study. \\"Was zum Teufel?\\" is right. \\"Was der Hoehle?\\" is only literal. I was serious about those nuances.If you already know some German, but want to hone your skills, then this could help. This is also a good gag-gift for a German student. And it might prove useful later."},{"Title":"Wicked German (Wicked Travel Series)","review":"This is a hilarious book. Anyone who reads it will understand very quickly that it shouldn't be taken seriously. But if you are a German student looking to pick up German colloquial expressions or street German, this is definitely not what you want. It is a book of humor, not an educational text."},{"Title":"Wicked German (Wicked Travel Series)","review":"I bought this book figuring it was practical and useful, which for my surprise, was exactly the opposite!

There is something evil about the machine and the Doctor must convince the powers that be that it must be destroyed. Meanwhile, it appears that someone is trying to sabotage the World Peace Conference, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart wants the Doctor to help him get to the bottom of it. Little do either realize that the same evil mastermind is behind both plot &#8211; the Doctor&#8217;s old nemesis, the Master. Can the Doctor defeat the Master&#8217;s evil plan and prevent a catastrophe of global proportions?This is a very good novelization the Doctor Who serial of the same name that originally aired from January 30 to March 6, 1971.

Unfortunately, so is the Master. The Master hatches yet another plot with the invention of a machine that can remove the evil from a hardened criminal. How can this be a world dominating move? Hmmm, guess for that you need to read the book.I found this one a bit less interesting than many of the other novelizations I've read, but still an OK story. It takes less than two hours to read, so there are certainly worse ways to spend your time."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Mind of Evil (Doctor Who #96)","review":"A bit of an oddity in Doctor Who's eighth season, 'The Mind of Evil 'actually has a plot with multiple levels. It is adapted here by Terrance Dicks who was the script editor at the time.The Doctor and Jo visit Stangmoor Prison to witness a new method for rehabilitating criminals: the Keller Process, which drains all evil impulses from the minds of criminals. But something goes wrong with the first British test subject, who dies. Little do they realise, but Professor Emil Keller is none other than the Master, and the Keller Process is only one of many strands to his complex web.This story is more in line with Doctor Who's season seven, and may very well be more suited to presentation as a novel than on video (where the serial exists only in black and white) where it is a little slow moving and shows the limited budget of the show."},{"Title":"Panoramas Of England","review":"For me it was easy as I am already fascinated by English history, architecture and the land. This book is wonderful! It has breathtaking color photographs of such variety it truly captures the rugged, changing and multiple landscapes of a gorgeous country. This would be a perfect book for your coffee table. The photographs are of high quality and clarity and the authors do a wonderful job of evoking all kinds of emotions from the lonely, dark feelings of northern Yorkshire to the jubilant colorful lifeforce of the coastal towns of southern England. The sheer chalk cliffs of the southeast of England are perfectly captured. Ample justice is made to capturing all that this wonderful country has to offer from the cold to the warm weather, the wet to the even more wet! Light and dark combine to produce a powerful visual image that makes this book one to keep for a rainy day to look at and fall into a dreamlike state. I loved every page!"},{"Title":"A User's Guide to Spectral Sequences (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"Spectral sequences have generally been thought of as being complicated, esoteric constructions, due mainly to the way they are presented in the mathematical literature. This book is very unusual, in that it attempts to explain the need for spectral sequences and give insight into how they arise and in what contexts. Anyone who is curious about spectral sequences will find an exceptionally well-written book here. This goes especially for the physicist reader, who if involved in fields such as string theory or quantum field theory, is faced with a daunting task of learning both the physics and mathematics behind these theories, formidable as both of these are. Chapter one, entitled \`An Informal Introduction', is one of the best introductions to spectral sequences in print, in both books and research papers. The intuition gained by the reading of this chapter is invaluable for the chapters that follow, since the author motivates the construction of spectral sequences exceedingly well, with many examples given.The author introduces spectral sequences as a tool for computing the homology or cohomology (which he labels as H*) of a space or an algebraic invariant assigned to a space or algebraic object. In order to obtain a more tractable problem and to motivate the calculation of H* using spectral sequences, the author assumes at first that H* is \`filtered', in particular that H* is a graded vector space. As a first approximation to H*, one uses the associated graded vector space to some filtration of H*, which is the \\"target\\" of the spectral sequence. The \\"two-index\\" property of spectral sequences in this case arises from the fact that the associated graded vector space to the filtered graded vector space is in fact \`bigraded'. One of the indices is called the \`complementary degree' while the other is called the \`filtration degree.' More formally, the spectral sequence is a sequence of differential bigraded vector spaces, where each bigraded vector space in the sequence is equipped with a linear mapping that is also a differential. The goal is then to find the conditions under which the spectral sequence will \`converge' to H*. In the introductory chapter, the author outlines various situations that allow one to compute with a spectral sequence. Some familiar constructions appear, such as the Gysin sequence, known from homological algebra and differential geometry, and the exterior algebra, also from differential geometry.With the motivation for spectral sequences established in the introduction, the author proceeds to more formal constructions in the next chapter. Spectral sequences arise as a collection of differential bigraded R-modules between which are defined differentials. The author shows in detail how to build spectral sequences using a filtered differential module and using an exact couple. As per the historical development, he also constructs spectral sequences of algebras using tensor products of differential graded modules. After these constructions are made, the author turns his attention to how well the spectral sequence can approximate its target. This entails, as expected, a rigorous notion of limits. The author in fact defines limits and colimits of modules and the notion of a morphism between spectral sequences. For filtered differential graded modules, he shows how conditions on the filtration will ensure the associated spectral sequence converges uniquely to its target. For exact couples, the convergence can be shown but certain properties such as the Hausdorff property for the filtration must be satisfied.The book covers four main spectral sequences that arise in algebraic topology: the Leray-Serre, Eilenberg-Moore, Adams, and Bockstein spectral sequences. The Leray-Serre spectral sequence arises when studying the homology (and cohomology) of fibrations with path-connected base spaces and connected fibers. The Leray-Serre spectral sequence allows one to compute the cohomology of the total space from knowledge of the cohomology of the base space and the fiber. The author discusses applications in the computation of cohomology of Lie groups. This is accomplished by constructing the fibration resulting from taking quotients by subgroups. Rigorous proofs of all the constructions are given for the interested reader, including a full proof of the theorem that the fourth homotopy group of the two-sphere is the integers modulo two, and the connections with characteristic classes and the Steenrod algebra.The Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence also arises in the study of fibrations, when the cohomology of the base space and the cohomology of the total space are known and one wants to compute the cohomology of the fiber. The author studies this case and the dual case of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence for homology. Heavy use is made of differential homological algebra in this study. The reader can see with great clarity the role of torsion in the applications of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences.The Adams spectral sequence arises in the context of computing the homotopy groups of a nontrivial finite CW-complex. An approximation to the homotopy groups is given by the \`stable homotopy groups', and Adams analysis of these groups and his proof that there are no elements of Hopf invariant one led him to construct the spectral sequence that bears his name. The author gives a detailed overview of this spectral sequence, its applications, and its connection with cobordism theory.The Bockstein spectral sequence arose in the study of Lie groups, and the author gives the details of the construction of this spectral sequence and its application to H-spaces. Bockstein spectral sequences arise from exact couples, the first differential being the Bockstein homomorphism (in the case of homology). The Bockstein spectral sequence can also be constructed for the case of cohomology, wherein the Bockstein homomorphism becomes the stable cohomology operation in the Steenrod algebra. The resulting spectral sequence is in fact a spectral sequence of algebras with the stable cohomology operation being a derivation with respect to the cup product."},{"Title":"A User's Guide to Spectral Sequences (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"The author tried very hard to write a useful book, but succeeded only partially: the book jumps into hairy definitions before giving any example where the spectral sequence technology is useful. The first chapter is an unrelenting onslaught of somewhat unmotivated definitions, and it takes a tough man to make through the thickets of notation through to the interesting examples (there are lots of trivial ones from the beginning). In addition, the book seems to have not changed too much from the first (Publish or Perish) edition, except for the addition of an exorbitant price. The book is still dated, since the primary application is homotopy theory, which is not the flavor of this decade, or the last (of course, it might come back).It would be much cheaper and more enlightening to read the original papers by Lyndon, Hochschild-Serre, and Serre's thesis.Cohomology of Groups (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, No. 87)is also much better motivated and much cheaper.EDIT: Another excellent textbook on the subject isAn Introduction to Homological Algebra (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics), in the same series but at 1/3 the price."},{"Title":"Midlife Mavericks: Women Reinventing Their Lives in Mexico","review":"Not happy with the limited geographic area or the depressing news that a single/widowed or divorced woman would have no chance of ever dating or finding a future partner.

Perhaps it's because I was seeking out stories of other's risk-taking decisions that might lend credence and/or validation for me to take a chance on myself. Whatever the case, I was totally intrigued with Karen Blue's stories of women who were attempting to create a more simplistic, yet truthful life for themselves in Mexico.

They find other English speakers, beautiful weather, a cooperative local community, and a way to stretch their dollars. One can't avoid the reality that the Mexicans are the servant class for the Americans, which must prick the conscience a little, but this is not acknowledged as a concern by anyone.

Each of these women had already constructed full lives, but questioned the status quo and wondered if more could be wrung from the only go-round we have on the planet. Some sought escape from corporate culture, others from unsatisfying relationships; all sought, and found, freer, more meaningful, happier lives in Mexico. Each woman is a pioneer in her journey for self in a new world, confronting language and cultural barriers, each obstacle providing new opportunities for growth and change.The accounts are authentic, highly engaging and well written, and the reader will resonate with the challenges each woman faced.

The stories are confusing and not well written. The author jumps between her move to Mexico and that of the person she is interviewing without making much distinction. In nearly every story she spends several lines describing the smoking habits of the women and how the smoke swirls around in the air or they tap their cigarette to the ashtray, please spare us. One of the women the author inteviewed moved to Mexico due to the health problems she suffered while living in Texas. Now this peaked my interest as I wondered what kind of health care she received in Mexico, did her health improve, etc but alas none of these questions were answered.If you want a light read with not much substance then this book would be fine.

I was impressed by Jocelyn Burrell's ambitions to have a representative sampling of the writing of so many women from so many cultures. Sometimes the excerpts seem curtailed, but I suspect that might be a publishing decision and that she was handed down the fiat to shorten the book by another 10,000 words. If so it is excellently done with not a seam showing, just the general feeling of wanting more. It is not only the most well known women authors who contribute the best pieces to WORD. No, there are some great essays here by woman with very low profiles. Liza Fiol-Matta is of course a widely published author and thinker of New Jersey, but she does not have the cultural capital of (say) Margaret Atwood, and yet her essay here, \\"Beyond Survival\\" A Politics/Poetics of Puerto Rican Consciousness\\" is every bit as captivating and poetically written as Atwood's--if not more so.As she says, \\"Rescuing a poet/ from the claws of colonial bilingualism/ is not an easy thing.\\" In the poem that begins her essay, she lets loose with a number of uncomfortable truths. As a Puerto Rican lesbian living on the mainland, stuck between Spanish and English, she is a nomad, doomed to carry mutual heritages and to weather a disastrous tide of diminishing resources. She cites Homi Bhabha and Bhabha's conception of the \\"in-between spaces.\\" She was six when her father moved her family to Arkansas--of all places. Another great Puerto Rican author to appear here is Judith Ortiz Cofer, sometimes thought of as the \\"Puerto Rican Joyce Carol Oates.\\" But in truth, if we were honest with ourselves and able to see through the thick walls of culture, we would be referring to Oates as the \\"Detroit Judith Ortiz Cofer.\\""},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian) (Instant Conversation Portuguese (Brazillian))","review":"This audio only lanuguage tutorial is highly effective. The course is broken into sixteen 30 minute lessons. Each lesson gets progessivly more advanced moving from learning individual words, to phrases and finally complete sentences. I found the lesson length of 30 minutes ideal for learning on my commute to and from work each day. (It's not a good idea to drive an unfamiliar route while doing this course, you'll miss intersections!!)In addition to learning and repeating stock phrases you are challenged to put together phrases and sentences from words you have already learnt but in unique combinations not previously tried. This makes you 'think' about what you are going to say rather than repeat by rote. This mirrors what you'll be doing when communicating to someone on your travels. This approach is key to eventually 'thinking' in a foreign language.The pauses in the audio for you to respond can be rather short for the more unique and thought provoking phrases. As a beginner one still 'translates' before speaking. I'd like to see longer pauses for new material and shorter pauses for material you should know well. Pausing the CD manually is not appropriate while driving or doing some other activity.This course is a good primer and you will learn just enough to get around as a business visitor or tourist to Brazil. You will learn to count to 79, tell the time, ask basic questions about eating and drinking and locating hotels etc. It will not teach you enough to understand TV or radio or fast conversations. For that you will need to purchase Pimsleurs more extensive language program(s). I wish they had taught one to say 'talk more slowly please' in this course.This course gets you much further down the road of learning the language than the quick and simple version. I think this one is worth the extra bucks.I completed the course in about 20 days. At the age of 46 I am somewhat suprised I learnt the language so quickly - I was resigned to the fact that I was probably too old to learn a new language. Someone younger or sharper than I should be able to complete the course in 16 days or less. If I can learn Portuguese from this course so can you!!!It's a shame that a short phrase book is not included with the program, reading basic words is a requirement when visiting a foreign land. You will need to supplement this course with a phrase book. Note that it's important to complete this course before opening a phrase book. The sounds of the language are so different to what an English speaking person will expect from the written language, looking at the written word too early will encourage you to add a strong accent.I can thourougly recommend this course to anyone contemplating a trip to Brazil. In addition it's ideal if you are unsure if you want to fork out the money for the full course(s) and want to a trial run with this first. The full course(s) do include sections for reading Portuguese from provided words and phrases.5 Stars Pimsleur!!

The 16-lesson series equips you with enough language to be sufficient for a short visit to Brazil. There is no substitute for hearing the corrrect pronounciation of words in the original dialect and that's one of the benefits of the course.My only issue with this method of learning is that you don't know how the words you're speaking look, which is important, because many of the words look nothing like they sound.

It more closely resembles that of the radio programs of the 1940's-1950's, an art mastered by Orson Welles.The dialogue on this CD shows good character, though often a bit exaggerated; this is common in radio performances as you have no other means of conveying emotion but inflection of voice. The plot of the CD mostly follows the book, but much has been omitted. The background soundtrack contains sound effects and music, though the level is well-balanced in effort to reduce the amount of distraction from the dialogue.It is not substitute for the novel.Raymond Chandler's novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, may be one of his most stylistically clever works. Brimming with sarcasm, repressed anger and sexuality, and criticism of both upper and lower classes, Chandler's prose makes any audio adaptation challenging. For those who love old radio programs, this will do for a few hours enjoyment."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This is the best book I have read in ages. I don't read everything start to finish. I like to be taken in, and to finish a book, I usually feel compelled to do so. This book had me eagerly flipping page after page. I couldn't wait to find out what would unfold next. It was the highlight of most of my recent days. Chandler's failed career as a romantic poet shows admirably in this prose. It's really beautiful, to the point, and not pretentious at all. It was fun. The pace was quick, and you are trying to put the pieces together with Marlowe as he brings you along. I don't usually read mysteries. With Chandler, I at least plan to read all of his. This is better than the best noir films. If you dig noir films and literature, read this book.

I kept looking ahead for convenient places to stop, but blew right by them instead. The combination of Chandler's pace and piquancy is simply irresistible.Farewell, My Lovely isn't the most believable of books, but just like The Big Sleep, it doesn't matter. Indeed, there's a tongue-in-cheek charm that peeks out quite often from behind the hardened facade. Chandler excelled at caricature. He danced on the edge of parody. But, he did it so exquisitely well that he detracted not a whit from the earnestness of the story.A paroled con comes back to LA in search of the woman he loves. Philip Marlowe, our protagonist, stumbles into the plot thus derived. Conspiracy and murder follow among the landmarks of the Los Angeles area. There's a magnetic pull to 40's-era LA and Chandler takes full advantage of it. Farewell, My Lovely is quintessential, it is provocative, and, in places, shamefully vulgar. And, still, I recommend it highly, because it is worth every bit of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"According to Wikipedia, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY (1940) was Raymond Chandler's second novel and created from three short stories--\\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\" (1936), \\"Try the Girl\\" (1937), and \\"Mandarin's Jade\\" (1937). This makes a lot of sense to me, since Chandler's great creation, Philip Marlowe, seems more like a character from a short story than the deep and complex creation that a great novelist can achieve.Yes, Marlowe is certainly a well-defined in FML. He's a guy with high integrity, down-beat and droll, lyrical in his descriptions, relentless and lonely, and he drinks too much. But why is he this way? And what greater issues do his struggles touch upon? Here, Chandler offers next to nothing, unless you have a film-Noir vision of life and view all winners as corrupt and brutal. Instead, he stays small with Marlowe, a highly focused creation developed in short stories, who offers a perfect streamlined literary voice to tell a novel-length story of crime.This is not to say that Philip Marlowe is ever an uninteresting character in FML. But does he really have a very interesting mind? Take away his lyricism and the grouchy humor of his metaphors and his limits show--he's everybody's sour uncle, boyishly uncompromising, for whom things didn't work out.Of course, you can't really separate character and voice in fiction. And, Marlowe's voice, its absolutely uncanny metaphors and amazing lyricism, explains why Raymond Chandler, among hundreds of crime-fiction writers, is the guy I choose to read. (I'm usually bored by mysteries and crime fiction.) Here are just two examples from FML.\\"He wore a brown suit of which the coat was too small for his shoulders and his trousers were probably a little tight at the waist. His hat was at least two sizes too small and had been perspired in freely by somebody it fitted better than it fitted him. He wore it about where a house wears a weather vane...A tie dangled outside his buttoned jacket, a black tie which had been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea. ...He had a big flat face and a highbridged fleshy nose that looked as hard as the prow of a cruiser.\\"\\"Then there were no more houses, just the still dark foothills with an early star or two above them, and the concrete ribbon of road and a sheer drop on one side into a tangle of scrub oak and Manzanita where sometimes you can hear the call of the quails if you stop and keep still and wait. On the other side of the road was a raw clay bank at the edge of which a few unbeatable wild flowers hung on like naughty children that won't go to bed.\\"In FML, I also enjoyed the brief Hemingway parody and was surprised to encounter--SPOILER COMING--a multi-bullet suicide. This was something Martin Amis used to make a point about crime fiction inNight Trainwhere the narrator is, like Philip Marlowe, burned out but amazingly lyrical."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's second novel, Philip Marlowe gets embroiled in a complex plot involving murder and lost love.Marlowe's on the wrong side of town when he gets drawn into watching a murder in a bar that blacks frequent. As usual for this day and age - this is decades before civil rights, remember - the white cops brush it off as meaningless. Only Marlowe shows some interest in what is going on, and the lug of a man that desperately misses his lost love.Marlowe, pretty down on his luck and drinking hard, pries into the situation as much out of intellectual boredom as anything else. He's not after money, and indeed half the time he's not getting any. He's after making some difference in the world, no matter how small. He's after doing his part to help out those in need. These qualities of honor are taken up by many detectives who came after Marlowe, and are admired by millions of movie viewers who saw the movie version of this book.The gritty world that Marlowe lives in, the desperate state that many of the characters are in, the racism and disregard for the poor and drug use were all harsh realities of Los Angeles in the 1940s. In that swamp of despair roamed Marlowe, barely keeping his own head above water, but determined to do the right thing. It's his doggedness and his adherence to his own rules that make him a man to be admired throughout the ages ... and it's Chandler's brilliant writing style that brings this world to life.Those reviewers who cringe at the drinking, the despair and the racism should thank Chandler for bringing these realities into such clear view, instead of blaming Chandler for showing them a glimpse of a life beyond their air conditioned living rooms."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book. I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books. And yes, that is true in his second book.Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm. Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I'm not much of a fiction reader, but I have just about everything Chandler ever wrote, including a copy of his screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot; Every couple of years I go back and read everything all over again. How many mysteries can you do that with?The thing is, of course, that you don't read Chandler for the mystery, which is just as well, because it's hard to figure out the story line in his books sometimes. You read, and re-read, Chandler because he created a whole universe in his novels - an image of a Los Angeles with a seedy underside, which suited perfectly the milieu that was associated with the town in the 1940's - the movie people and the parasites that lived off of them, the internal immigrants that flooded California from the Midwest during the Depression, the alienation under a bright sun. A lot of people got their image of California from Chandler.You also read him for the irresistable charm of his protagonist, Marlowe, the shopworn Galahad with the relentlessly absorbing internal monologue that has been imitated by everybody from Jean Claude Belmondo to Garrison Keillor. For a while, Hollywood couldn't get enough of Marlowe, and well into the 70's movies were being made of his books - several of them have been made into movies twice, including this one. I sometimes think that the Marlowe character appeals very strongly to men, or at least a certain type of men, and that's why so many actors - Bogart, Robert Montgomery, Robert Mitchum, and especially Dick Powell - really wanted to play him on the screen.The story starts out with Marlowe just walking down the street and not minding his own business, as usual, and ends up with multiple murders (some of them totally senseless), unspoken mistakes in judgement ( a favorite device of Chandler's) and a lot of unanswered questions. You always find yourself with a sense of brooding emptiness at the end of a Chandler book, a feeling that you've been through an incredible struggle to no purpose at all, and yet you're always glad you were along for the ride all the same.This may very well be the best of the Marlowe novels; it's in my top two for technical perfection along with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, although I have a personal emotional attachment to &quot;The Long Goodbye.&quot; My advice: try them all."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This book is a good rather than a great read. The story got a little over complicated as Chandler tries to tie in and link too many threads - all connected to the gigantic villain Moose Malloy. There were times when I scratched my head a little despairingly as I tried to work out what these connections were. There were also times when sentences and paragraphs made no logical sense to me at all. I put this down to the language of the time but it did leave a feeling of bewilderment.However, I did enjoy this book and the character of Marlow is strong and amusing. His one liners did on occassions grate a little but nevertheless his overwhelming sense of optimism rang through and made me laugh.Although written many years ago - it still had quite a modern feel to it."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"While working a job that never pans out, PI Philip Marlowe is drawn against his will into a bar called Florian's by a very huge man. Moose Malloy has just spent eight years doing time, and he's looking for his girl Velma. Well, it has been eight years, and the bar's changed hands since then. The new owners and employees know nothing of any Velma, but Moose gets mad and someone gets dead, and Marlowe finds himself in the middle of something he never bargained for.Being a good PI, Marlowe calls the police, and the case goes to a fellow named Nulty, who tries to inveigle Marlowe into helping him solve it. Marlowe says he'll let him know if he thinks of anything, then decides to follow up on the Velma angle. He goes into a hotel near the bar, asking about the previous owner, and learns where the man's widow still resides. So Marlowe decides to pay her a visit.Mrs. Florian is a house-bound soul with a fondness for alcohol. It isn't hard to pry information out of her, armed with a bottle and a willingness to suffer being her drinking companion in order to get her to talk. The widow plays coy, but when she learns Moose is on the loose, she grows pale. Velma is dead, she says, so no use looking for her. Marlowe informs Nulty and goes back to his office.There he receives a phone call about a job, although the caller is being very vague and mysterious about what he's to be doing for his money. Money is money, so Marlowe gets the address and agrees to meet the client that night. His name is Lindsay Marriott and he lives in the better part of time. He wants Marlowe to go with him while he does something, but he isn't to be seen or do anything. Marlowe doesn't like that and makes no bones about it, and then he lays down his rules. It seems that Marriott is paying to retrieve some stolen jewelry--very valuable jade, to be exact. It was taken from a lady, and the thieves are holding it for ransom.Marlowe agrees to the job, for a hundred dollars, and instructions are received, along with directions. However, nothing is simple, and Marlowe gets sapped. By the time he wakes up, there's a strange girl there by the name of Anne Riordan, and Lindsay Marriott is deceased. Marlowe checks the man's pockets and finds something interesting--marihuana cigarettes in a cheap case. However, by the time the police arrive, those are no longer there.Turns out Anne's father was once police chief of Bay City, so she can't help but be nosy about what she's stumbled across. Marlowe finds her attractive in a more than pretty face kind of way. She returns the cigarettes she stole to him, and he makes an interesting discovery--hidden inside are the business cards of a local psychic, Jules Amthor. So Marlowe sets off to investigate.A dead man, an escaped convict, a missing girl, graft in high polices, a crooked doctor, gambling--all these things and more lie in wait for Philip Marlowe. The question is, has he bitten off more than he can chew, and are there people who are determined that he not find out the truth, no matter how they have to silence him?Farewell, My Lovely is the sequel to The Big Sleep. It's another great read from Raymond Chandler. I'm really enjoying Marlowe's adventures. He's not a super hero, he's just an ordinary guy, doing his job, and as such he's not beyond getting hurt--and he does, because he keeps sticking his nose where it isn't wanted.One thing to keep in mind when you read this is that it's a product of its times, much as Huckleberry Finn. Some of the terms used would be considered racist now, but they weren't then, so you have to realize that and either not be offended, or not read the book. Those don't detract from the enjoyment of the story.Chandler has a definite way with words that I enjoy. For example, in talking about Marlowe's first sight of Moose Malloy: \\"He was looking up at the dusty windows with a sort of ecstatic fixity of expression, like a hunky immigrant catching his first sight of the Statue of Liberty.\\" His description of scenery is also unique, pure Marlowe: \\"I got down to Montemar Vista as the light began to fade, but there was still a fine sparkle on the water and the surf was breaking far out in long smooth curves.\\"This story has a lot of twists and turns, and I didn't see the ending coming until it was on top of me. Raymond Chandler set the bar for detective stories, and he set it pretty damn high. I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries and detectives, and to those who haven't put your toe in the water, try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I don't read a lot of thrillers and this is the first Chandler I've read. As many have said before, this is a step and a half above your average good thriller, the reason being the wit and intelligence of the prose, the elegance of the descriptions and the understanding of character which is compassionate, passionate and cynical all at the same time.His flip one-liners aren't just clever, but oil the wheels of the plot. Some of the references I couldn't understand, they belong to the period or the locality, but the plot moves along because the characters find common ground by means of their expressions in the shifting sands of what is acceptable and what is not in the way of behaviour.Another thing is that reading this is a bit like watching a film, Los Angeles comes to life before your eyes.On the downside there's a slight sense of not looking very far beneath the surface, it would slow the book down."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"If you like incomprehensible story lines, improbable plots and connections and an overtone of misogyny then this is your book.If not this is book best left unread."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Oh how I wanted to hate this. It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"A hard-boiled detective novel featuring Philip Marlowe. A great read with a surprise ending. I really enjoyed Chandler's description of people and situations -- very colorful, like \\"he stood out like a pair of spats at an Iowa picnic.\\" At one point in the book the author has another character speak like Marlowe, whereupon he says, \\"that sounds like something I should have said.\\" not surprising how popular these became, along with the whole film noir genre. I can almost hear Humphrey Bogart speaking the lines!"},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Essentially, in this book, Marlowe just keeps getting his a$s handed to him in every way imaginable and you have to wonder what Chandler was thinking when our hero gets beaten down over the skull for the sixth, seventh and eighth time. I kept thinking he was going to die from internal bleeding or a serious head wound but instead he just pines for another long shot of whiskey.The story is actually a bit thin but still interesting. Historically, some have complained that this book bleeds into areas that have racist overtones and ideas, but it's a time-capsule look back into the past more than it ever will be a damning piece of evidence against Chandler. I' sure some literature of this day and age will be thought of as racist or troubled when read fifty or sixty years on.A long and tangled story, but a beautiful read full of some of the best dialogue between characters ever. It's no wonder everyone aped him in every other genre ever after. Chandler was as bold as he was blunt and could could write literature disguised as Noir Detective fiction better than anyone or since."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"It's nice to read a mystery novel without all the blood and violence that are part of today's fiction.

It is hard to choose which one is the best, because they are both so good. In this new adventure of his best character Philip Marlowe there are many more adventures, thrills and mysteries than in the first novel.In this second step of the noir literature, Chandler has built up and developed his style and characters, so he spends no time with that. The novel begins with plain action, and it takes only a few pages for the writer to set the main mystery of this narrative. Once it is done, he has all time in the world to make the weirdest people cross Marlow's path.Like in the previous book, the prose is dry, there aren't many descriptions --only of some characters, but nothing that evocative-- and it is not a bad thing. by using such a device Chandler is able to write non-stop action making the main plot more and more intrincated, until its solution. A great book, highly recommended to readers who like mistery novels of high quality and beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Can YOU feel the pain from a right hook thrown in a darkened alleyway at 2:00 a.m. on a cold April Thursday, or the well-worn warmth of a ragged wool carpet runner tacked to the seventh floor of a well past acceptable rent-up in pre-war Los Angeles against the leather shoe sole, or perhaps your face?

He notices a big man walk into double swinging doors, almost immediately a youth is thrown through the air into the gutter. Marlowe looks in, and is taken upstairs by Moose Malloy. More violence breaks out while Malloy searches for Velma. Marlowe calls the police to report the problem. The police lieutenant strongly suggests that Marlowe should look for Velma. Marlowe gathers information, and looks up Mrs. Florian, wife of the now dead owner of this bar. Mrs. Florian says that Velma is dead, and gives Marlowe a picture of Velma. Marlowe gives her his card, and reports back to Detective Lieutenant Nulty.When Marlowe returns to his office, he gets a phone call hiring him by a stranger to act as his bodyguard. Marlowe accompanies Marriott to a deserted country spot to pay off a jewel thief. Marlowe leaves the car to make the payoff, but nobody is around. When he returns to the car he finds Marriott dead. A young woman shows up and gives Marlowe a ride to his car. Marlowe returns to the West Los Angeles police station to report another murder.Marlowe continues to gather more facts. Marlowe has meetings and adventures in pursuit of the truth. The story effectively exposes the crookedness of Bay City politics, and the corruption of the rich and powerful. The ending seems tacked-on to meet the moral conventions of the time: nobody gets away with murder, not in fiction. The author sort of admits this in the last chapter: \\"we'd never have convicted her\\". If the trial and scandal hurt her older husband, she'd be a rich widow. If not, they could move away from this scandal and notoriety."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"After reading &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; I knew that I was going to read more of Raymond Chandler. After reading this book I know that I will continue to read even more.A very interesting and entertaining crime yarn. I will give it the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's crime world, everyone's got a gat (a gun) - even sickly old women (&quot;I feel like Death Valley&quot;) and nice daughters of former coppers. People are led to locations where their screams will not be heard. Drinking establishments are respectable if there hasn't been a knife fight in the past month.****Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, is looking for a case that pays. But the action starts when he's not on assignment. He follows a stranger into a &quot;Negro dinge joint&quot; for no other compelling reason except that it wasn't any of his business. The dinge joint turns out to be a homicide scene, and Marlowe continues to follow the case without a real client in sight. Even the police aren't overly-interested in his participation.****He's a smart-mouth. An almost-heel. He frequently talks to himself out loud. Sometimes he hears a voice replying and realizes it's his own. This guy's a freak.****It's not hard to imagine how a recent writer like Jonathan Lethem could create a detective who has Tourette's Syndrome in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (Vintage Books, 1999). A detective is really just a man with serious quirks - he's also smarter than you think he is and likable enough to get the girl, at least for a little while.****Marlowe's a special brand of freak. He notices with exacting detail and describes in kid-like exaggeration what people wear. He fixates on the body musk of henchmen, the desirability of women, and a pink-headed bug crawling around an office.****There are &quot;agents&quot; in the universe - men with fluid positions that we merely call private investigators. Marlowe can fall into a scenario not of his creation. He can be as one character describes, &quot;a late comer to the show,&quot; but just in time to be in on the action. He carries the arc in a story and brings clarity. If he can't figure things out, there is no solution to be had.****&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is typical Chandler - tough, sardonic, thickly sliced but smartly dialogued, and oddly, funny as hell."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Hooray! I finally found a classic crime noir novel that I really liked...This is book #2 in the Phillip Marlowe series. Marlowe bumps into a huge man named Moose and unwillingly sees him murder a man while trying to find his lost love. That is the beginning of a fairly complex, well plotted story.Book #1, The Big Sleep was also well done, but what was missing for me was a glimpse of the human, softer side of Marlowe. This book filled in the missing pieces with the aid of a genuinely good woman. Marlowe's ability to see her good qualities rounded out the tale for me - I got a little of everything I needed to enjoy it.I have to say, there's a lot of prejudice in these books. I suppose it was more common for the time period, but I'm hoping I never get used to it. And there's slang that I don't understand, but I'm catching on slowly. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Dodgy dames, crooked cops, one charlatan, one Moose and plenty of booze.Philip Marlowe is a pretty bright tough guy private eye in Los Angeles, when he is hired to be a bodyguard on a very strange assignment involving supposedly a jewellery ransom buyback.He is soon crossing paths with various police departments, the rich and powerful, and crimelords, not to mention saps and drugs, as this book improves throughout with some entertaining phraseology."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Chandler is great fun to read. He structures his sentences and paragraphs with such metaphoric precision that he turns the mundane crime noir into literature. His hero is none other than perhaps an alter ego of Chandler himself Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is the straight talking, honest PI that will not accept any money until he is on the case and everything is legit. I wondered as I read this if Chandler didn't wished he could live his life in the honest and opened fashion of his hero. In \`Farewell, My Lovely\\" Marlowe searches for Velma a nightclub singer and love of ex-con Moose Malloy. Murder, dope dealers, gambling ships, femme fatales and the always questionable police keep Marlowe on and off his toes.This is another of Chandler's canon that is worth adding to the reading list."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for the inevitable \`missing woman' (\`dame' for the non-politically correct types) of an ex-convict who will not take no for an answer. And a \`missing woman\\" who wants to stay missing and will not take no for an answer. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned \`dame' that caught me off guard. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. As always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely was my first Raymond Chandler experience, a novel I first read back in junior year of high school, and one that will forever be known to me as the novel that defines noir, hardboiled detectives and gumshoe novels.In this classic, detective Philip Marlowe gets hired to recover stolen jewels, which in turn has him running into the rogue gallery of gamblers, con men, crooked cops, and (of course) femme fatales. With this said, the story is completely character-driven, making it full of action and narrative. Just flip the book open to any page, and you'll clearly read slick, muscular dialogue and snappy comebacks. Chandler is a benchmark author for stories stripped of any literary fat.Besides Dashiel Hammett, Chandler is the perennial writer of gumshoe detectives. And Farewell, My Lovely is the perennial gumshoe novel."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Marlowe is in a tough spot.

Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot? The book is beautiful and the prose is blossoming with unusual and evocative images. Chander ranks as one of the great American masters of prose.Read this and weep..."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This novel is simply the best detective novel by the best writer of American detective fiction.

The rich descriptions of the seedy side of pre-WWII LA is enough to make this book a winner. Our hero (Marlowe of course) gets drug into a bar and almost witnesses a murder, then gets hired by a rich playboy who drags him to another murder scene. He meets a spunky young lady, gets hired by a rich dame (to use the language of the genre), and runs into a pyschic and other strange characters. How does it all tie together? Does it even matter? Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Private Eye Philip Marlowe's curiosity for affairs that are none of his business sets him on a trail of murder, blackmail, jewels, women and a man who would always need a shave.Subsequent to Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, this second installment from Chandler oozes class and atmosphere that is absolutely unparralelled.Farewell, My Lovelly is a book that grips the reader from the first paragraph and where The Big Sleep slacks and breaks apart in the middle, the book picks up the pace with astonishing prose, particularly the way in which Chandler starts and finishes a chapter makes it hard to set the book down.Marlowe gets involved in a case of murder involving a man named Moose Malloy who is searching for his old girfriend. The poilce take over the murder case and Marlowe is hired by a mysterious client for an evenings bodyguard work which ends in a nasty way.By the time Chandler had set to work on his second novel it is clear that his skills as a writer of detective fiction had improved and he was virtualy unparallelled and unstoppable.Chandler's character creations not only remain fresh and quirky, he has set the standard fom many more titles in the genre; The hard boiled P.I, the cop who is too dumb to fuguire anything out and of course the femme fatal. The key character Marlowe is a slueth on a trail he did not expect, Chandler writes with tremendous naturalism and his genius creation of Marlowe comes forth through the dialogue and attitude fully conveying his hard boiled persona.The prose and description furnish this book with undertones of classc dusty Noir which have become the benchmark for generations of writers and while the movie may have been a hit, it hardly compares to the book.I was lucky enough to stumble upon Farewell, My Lovelly through a reading list from my university and I was not dissapointed, the tension and themes along with the twists and turns leave the reader gripping their lip with thier teeth. The Big Sleep may have been the novel where Chandler broke out into the literary world but this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This is my favorite Raymond Chandler book and that's saying quite a lot. It has a sense of mystery to it that transcends the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read &quot;Farewell&quot; at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however. Devotees may want to make their own MP3 files and then donate the CDs to a library."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely is one of several Philip Marlowe detective stories from Raymond Chandler known for their smokey, 1940s L.A. feel. Philip Marlowe is the private eye whom ladies love, but he seems to be more interested in solving extremely bizarre crimes (and not getting paid for his time) than in romance. Sometimes Raymond Chandler does a brilliant job in building a story around the Marlowe character, as he did with The Lady In The Lake. However he misses the mark with Farewell, My Lovely.Why? Hmmm, let's see. Well certainly the story scores well on the bizarre-ness scale. Marlowe finds himself in a pickle complete with killers, boozers, psychopathes ... the usual lot. But Raymond Chandler does a poor job with building on these characters; there are simply too many of them with only cameo appearances. The author fails to give his Marlowe character much to do other than waltz into one improbable scenario to another. Naturally in the end the story comes together, sort of. But Farewell, My Lovely sadly falls into the &quot;curious but forgettable&quot; category of mystery novels.Bottom line: Raymond Chandler on a bad day. Passable entertainment."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler, an everyday detective, Marlowe, gets wrapped up in a hermeneutic search that could eventually cost him his life. Everything he does affects what will be and, in turn, he winds up changing the course of his search as he becomes caught in its very tentacles. Leading from one murder and scandal to another, this mystery novel addresses corruption and deceit in all of its forms. While it is occasionally difficult to understand because of Chandler's creative habit of inventing new detection slang, it yet creates for an engaging read as it keeps readers in suspense and \\"in the dark\\" until the climax of the book, during which time everything is revealed. More than many other detection novels, this one follows a more Sherlock Holmesesque method of detection by revealing and explaining all in a very short, descriptive, \\"aha!\\" type of moment, which is exciting to the reader who has been trying to solve the mystery all along.However, while the eventual mastermind turns out to be a cunning, selfish woman, the overall portrayal of women in this 1940's novel is daunting. Although often depicted as intelligent, they are also often depicted as needing and revering men. Furthermore, Marlowe's sarcastic confidence and desire to rescue women just gives an overall bad taste to the novel as he looks at women as burdens, sex objects, and inferior beings. In fact, he doesn't very highly esteem African Americans, either. In conclusion, while this book is an interesting read, it is too great a reminder of gender and racial inequalities to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chander's second novel is both more and less successful than his first. THE BIG SLEEP suffered from a plot that fell apart in midstream; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is much more consistent throughout. On the other hand, for all its twists and turns, THE BIG SLEEP was quite plausible; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is about as farfetched as you can get. But once again, such criticisms are almost beside the point: the great attraction is still Chandler's knock-you-flat prose, his tone of voice, his often imitated but seldom equaled style, and it is so powerful that it keeps you turning page after page after page.In general, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY once more finds street-smart and super-savvy California P.I. Philip Marlowe sticking his nose where it has no business being--and when curiosity leads him to follow a massively built white man into a black nightclub he finds himself embroiled in a murder no one cares about solving... at least not until it begins to figure in what seems to be a completely different case with a high-society spin. And encounters with stolen jewels, a spiritualist racket, police corruption, and a gambling ship quickly follow.Along the way Chandler again paints a gritty portrait of the seamy side of life. On this occasion, he takes a passing look at race, and makes the point that from a police point of view two standards apply: the authorities care nothing about the murder of a black man, but they treat a white man's murder very differently indeed. This portion of the novel is intrinsically controversial, for Chandler uses the slang and racial slurs common to the mean streets of his era--but it is worth noting that although Marlowe uses the same language, his attitude toward the blacks who appear in the novel is considerably different from that of the authorities, who could not care less about the murder of a black man who don't much care who knows it. And once again, Chandler graces his pages with dames and dandies, broads and bums--and he makes them live with remarkable vitality. The famous prose is as rich as ever, although noticeably less witty and quite a bit darker than that found in THE BIG SLEEP. We've stepped off the curb and into the gutter, Chandler seems to be saying, and we're walking in it all the way. Impressive stuff and a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely, Raymond Chandler's second novel in the Philip Marlowe series, transcends the genre it helped to create, and is now (deservedly) viewed by many as literature and as social criticism.Chandler creates moods and telegraphs emotions via the poetic ramblings and outrageous similes from the mind of Philip Marlowe, the protagonist/detective/narrator who is picked up by the collar and dragged into a murder mystery that exposes not only the hypocrisy beneath the surface in the lifestyles of the rich and beautiful, but ultimately, the depravity of the human condition. And all of this is delivered with a caustic sense of humor, a wry wit, and a hypersensitivity to the visual world and it's translation into the language of the mean streets.Although Chandler died shortly before I was born, I grew up in L.A., and I can say that the L.A. Chandler wrote of is in many ways the city of my childhood memories, so well did he capture the ambiance and ambivalence of the 'city of angels'.Some have criticized his plotting and plausability, but emotion, action, and detail were what interested him the most, and in these he excelled. FAREWELL MY LOVELY must be viewed within the context of it's era (published in 1940) to be fully appreciated, but the flow of action, the visual aspect of it's language, and the insights into the very human conflict of corruption verses conscience are timeless.This book, like the first in the Marlowe series (THE BIG SLEEP) was written at the height of Chandler's creative career, and exemplifies the style that has made him a writer's writer, possibly the most imitated author of the past century."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler was such a master at his style of prose that you only have to read the first two paragraphs of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY to know exactly what sort of story you're in for. Those two paragraphs perfectly set up the plot that follows: a thriller crossing in and out of the racial divisions of 1940's Los Angeles involving seedy speakeasies, and off-shore gambling, with double-crossing as far as the eye can see. Wonderfully gritty stuff.This particular Chandler novel has a lot going for it. The hero, Philip Marlowe, is as entertaining as ever. The setting is the familiar scene of other Chandler stories -- alive, heavy and oppressively Los Angeles. The plot is logical, but jumps around a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the more it moves around, the more room Chandler has to incorporate evil-doings; I quite lost track of exactly how many crimes are committed or alluded to during the course of the book. No matter how farfetched it is, Chandler's prose is utterly gripping and absorbing.I think Philip Marlowe must drink his weight in cheap liquor several times over during the course of this adventure, but you can't help but like the guy. He punches, he shoots, he boozes. He even solves the case by the end. He sure takes a beating in this one, but he keeps coming back for more. He's everything a pulp detective should be - angry, arrogant, determined, and with just a hint of pathos to make him interesting enough to carry the story.The book as a whole is just too appealing and entertaining not to be a fun experience. Chandler is pretty much the benchmark for these sorts of stories about guns, police, and corruption, so if you like the genre, you might as well read the man who invented it. Tough guys yelling, \\"Beat it!\\" at each other might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Chandler is so good as telling the story that any inadequacies in the conventions of this genre are wallpapered over with some slick dialog and snappy comebacks.I read FAREWELL, MY LOVELY more for the great atmosphere and tone than for its overall plot. The fact that the storyline wraps up nicely at the end is merely a bonus. But the real way to enjoy this book is to just let the atmosphere, the characters and the prose just wash over you."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Only THE LONG GOODBYE merits higher place in the shining canon of prose-poet Raymond Chandler. This violent, shabby, hilarious, and ultimately very moving novel rockets P.I. Phillips Marlowe through the darkest, seamiest side of Chandler's textured world Los Angeles. In no other novel does Chandler's razor sharp and witty prose slice so sharply, and his sense of tragic irony (&quot;It isn't funny that a man should die, but it is funny that a man should die for so little&quot;) reaches its zenith. Hard to put down, impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler's novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \\"page turners\\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \\"page turner\\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" (actually more than in \\"Goodbye\\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler's protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn't attempt to get to the bottom of people's motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \\"all bad\\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can't completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don't know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \\"dated\\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960's and 1970's, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \\"ice truck\\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"The tough-as-nails writing of Raymond Chandler has overtaken mysteries to so great an extent that it's easy to forget his role as a trailblazer. 'Farewell, My Lovely,' just Chandler's second novel, already burns with the rot of Los Angeles that spawned countless other imitations and had a far-reaching effect on both crime fiction and moviemaking over the next thirty-five years.'Farewell, My Lovely' is a typically Chandlerian novel, using first person narrative and a slew of characters. Thirtyish private investigator Philip Marlowe starts with a dull case, before he gets pulled onto the scene of a murder at one of Los Angeles's Afro-American bars. The huge, White assailant Moose Malloy has recently left prison and is searching for his lost girlfriend. Marlowe finds himself beside a dead body and a load of curiosity. Helping with police investigations, he enters a labyrinth of the Los Angeles underworld, including crooked cops, hot blondes, swindling psychics, and racketeers.Chandler's storytelling in the first person narrative of Marlowe is hard-boiled crime before it took on clich&eacute; status. The writing style is crude by necessity; found here is the private detective's rough and cynical attitude that influenced later antiheros like Peter Gunn and the noir style that dominated Hollywood movies. Besides several adaptations of Chandler to the big screen, other directors have paid homage, such as Roman Polanski in 'Chinatown' and David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet.''Farewell, My Lovely' is a well-constructed novel, but not without flaw. Chandler lets none of the characters go to waste, each holding a pivotal role in Marlowe's detective work. This novel stays consistent with his first project, 'The Big Sleep,' in having Marlowe revisit the same territory of earlier chapters. There is no predictability at all and Chandler creates genuinely tense moments.Marlowe, however, is steered by chance far too often and there are times when the action seems contrived, or without inevitability. The easy-going narration helps to smoothen over farfetched elements, such as the unlikelihood of Marlowe getting shoved into Moose Malloy's bar brawl, which is needed just to launch the story. The climax is also rather disappointing, taking place in an unimaginative location.While dealing with the social realities of 1940s California, Chandler's novels still need to be considered as great entertainments rather than full-fledged literature. The novels make generalizations about human life but are mostly driven by plot. It is pulp fiction of the highest rank: well-written, often humorous, and highly dependable. This novel, like others of Chandler, should hold its place in the detective genre for ages to come.The Chandler novels have been republished in an attractive collection by Black Lizard, the crime subsidiary of Vintage Books. 'Farewell, My Lovely' is 292 pages long, in a nice art deco format. Imperfect but highly entertaining, the novel is a must for crime fiction fans."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"From the first paragraph to the last, I was held hostage by Chandler's writing. The action comes at you faster than a bouncer's fist and is just as relentless. This was the first Chandler book I'd read and though I'd heard a lot about his stature as a noir writer, I have to say he did not disappoint in the least. Marlowe is a man's man. He doesn't back down from a challenge, he enjoys the women he likes, dismisses those he dislikes, fights the good fight, and he always tells it like it is!I worked my way through Hammett, Thompson, Mosley, and others, and now it looks like I'm going to work my way through Chandler."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In &quot;Farewell, My Lovely,&quot; Raymond Chandler's second Philip Marlowe novel, Marlowe reluctantly agrees to help a careworn police detective search for a nightclub girl named Velma, a former girlfriend of an ogreish ex-convict named Moose Malloy who is wanted for murder. Marlowe's first lead is the nightclub owner's widow, whom he plies with liquor, only to find out that Velma's whereabouts are being kept a guarded secret. Then, in what initially seems like an unrelated subplot, Marlowe is hired by a man who wants &quot;backup&quot; while he delivers money to some jewel thieves. The man ends up murdered, and Marlowe meets a mysterious girl at the scene of the crime. To think there's no connection between this event and Velma's disappearance would be to underestimate Chandler's genius at plot construction.Chandler cleverly plants false leads to twist the already unpredictable plot and subtle clues that make sense at the end. His colorful characters are masters of deceit; the reader imagines that these people must have great poker faces. They know a lot more than what they're telling Marlowe, and it's exciting to know that Marlowe will eventually be able to guess what they're leaving out. Like J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, Marlowe is one of literature's greatest magicians; the fun of reading the book is waiting for him to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" we see the stereotypical detective, sitting in his detective agency, at his desk, looking out of a rain-streaked window, pondering something, something we will probably never figure out. The detective here is Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator, and he is presented with what seems like a simple jewelry theft case. Marlowe, with his wit and charm, instead confronts crooked cops, fraudulent psychiatric hospitals, blackmailers, con men, and beautiful and deadly women. Marlowe jumps, almost literally from situation to situation. Each scenario is highly entertaining, but a little difficult to believe. Either Philip Marlowe manages to fit thirty-four action-packed hours in one day or I don't know what. It's interesting how witty the character of Marlowe is and how unaffected he seems to be by all the events going on around him. Even when he is beat up, drugged, and almost killed, he gets up, and carries on. It is difficult to determine whether or not he does this solely for the money, or if he feels he has a personal investment, or perhaps desires the glorification. Chandler incorporates wonderful descriptions of sunny Los Angeles into his novel as we follow Marlowe around the city chasing after people, details, and a solution. He also uses a great amount of similes and metaphors, comparing everything to some strange seemingly unrelated object. Yet, when it comes down to it, this quintessential detective mystery fulfills all my requirements for a good book and left me guessing up until the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"With the exception of Charles Dickens, has any writer has more influence on narration than Raymond Chandler? Dozens and dozens of writers -- not always crime writers -- have tried to sound like Philip Marlowe. Dozens of movies have featured Philip Marlowe-like narrators, including the theatrical release of BLADE RUNNER, where Rick Deckard sound nothing so much as a 21st Century updating. And perhaps there have been even more parodies. Either way, we all know what detective narrators are supposed to sound like, and we know this because of Raymond Chandler.Raymond Chandler did not invent hardboiled detective fiction. He essentially took Dashiell Hammett's invention and focused nearly all his attention on prose style, character, and detail. There is an almost tactile quality to many of his stories, to the extent where you feel you could almost reach out and wipe the dust off a desk with your finger. There is, also, an almost wanton disregard of plot. If you read Raymond Chandler for plot, you are misreading him. I'll admit that in several of his novels I'm still unclear what happened. But who cares? The brilliance is in the texture, the detail. Take smell. Read virtually any other detective, crime, mystery, or hardboiled novel and look at how often other writers mention smells and then look at Chandler. He is constantly telling you what places smell like, whether mesquite or sage or sandalwood or whatever. Chandler wrote with heightened senses. I frankly can't get around to caring that his plots aren't very tight because other things absorb all my attention.FAREWELL, MY LOVELY is one of my favorite Chandler novels, perhaps only behind THE BIG SLEEP and his flawed masterpiece THE LONG GOODBYE. It featured many of his most memorable characters, especially the doomed Moose Malloy, and many of his most unforgettable scenes. Because of Chandler's ability to sketch a scene in such astonishing detail, there are scenes in his books that are as easy to visualize as it is a scene in a movie. He is that vivid and precise in his depiction. A great example is Marlowe's visit to Mrs. Florian in his search for Velma. It would be a person of very poor imagination who didn't get a strong sense of what her house looked like, smelled like, felt like.This is also one of his best books because it is one of the most tragic. The end of the novel feels almost like the end of Hamlet, with nearly all of the major characters either dead or at least shattered. And like with most of Chandler, there isn't an overly nice resolution of the mystery, whereby the detective magically makes everything nice and tidy and correct. Marlowe gets to the bottom of things, but often what he finds when he gets there is an abyss. And speaking of Chandler's influence, can one imagine the end of Raymond Polanski's CHINATOWN without Marlowe?As a side note, there have been two very good film versions of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. The first was made by RKO while Chandler was still alive and was originally released with that title. It tanked at the box office, mainly because it starred former Warner Brothers boy crooner Dick Powell. His style of musical had gone out of style and no one wanted to see what they assumed was a musical. So RKO renamed it MURDER, MY SWEET, which obviously could not be a musical, and re-released it. It was a box office success and was crucial in launching the second half of Dick Powell's career, this time as a serious dramatic actor. Chandler himself was horrified at the casting of Powell as Marlowe, but later proclaimed that he thought Powell was outstanding in the role. By the way, the person that Chandler himself thought would have made the ideal Marlowe was Cary Grant. The second version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was released in 1975 with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe. With apologies to Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum is my favorite Marlowe. He was a tad too old for the role, but apart from that he absolutely nailed the cynicism and latent nobility of Marlowe. My only regret is that Mitchum didn't begin making a string of Marlowe films when he was 35. As it was he was too old in his second appearance as Marlowe in a bizarre version of THE BIG SLEEP set, of all places, in London."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"The second Philip Marlowe novel written by Raymond Chandler, and also the second one read by me was already familiar to me, having seen two film versions. Therefore, this story was the first real introduction to the character (Robert Altman's version of The Long Goodbye bears very little resemblance to any Marlowe novel I've read).I walk away from a Marlowe novel with an incomplete understanding of all the intricate mechanisms of the plot and how they fall into place (although Farewell, My Lovely is more straightforward than The Big Sleep in that respect) although I leave the book fully cognizant of a world created in a specific time and place with a self-contained atmosphere and a self-contained and pulpishly poetic language.In Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe is trying to mind his own private eye business but somehow ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, somehow running afoul of crooks as well as cops. A simple case of tracking down an old flame for a massive ex-boxer turned convict is never going to be simple with Marlowe. His encounters with seedy crooks, smugglers, dope peddlers and gambling joint operators provide the reader with a tour of, to use an overworn phrase, the \`underbelly of society.' With Chandler, the law enforcement officers and the laws of the government they are sworn to protect are often as corrupt as any of the pseudo legitimate businessmen/crooks.Culturally and sociologically, this is an interesting depiction of the U.S. in 1940. The racial attitudes are probably pretty typical of the time although aside from occasional uses of the n-word, Chandler doesn't exploit stereotypes as much as most of the films of the time period. Marlowe's attitude toward marijuana also seems to be fairly non-judgmental, unlike what one would expect of many of the law enforcers of that time.Marlowe is a collection of contradictions. On one hand, he can be as brutal and deadly as he needs to be although I don't recall him intentionally killing anyone. In this novel, I don't believe he kills anyone at all. On the other, he is sensitive to washed up losers such as Jessie Florian and he seems to want to believe that others are as principled as he is. Unlike many other popular private eyes, he seems at least somewhat cultured and even quotes Shakespeare on a couple of occasions. If one accepts the prose style as the creation of Marlowe rather than as simply the mouthpiece for Raymond Chandler, then Marlowe has a very poetic view of his world and describes it in metaphors that have been parodied to death and yet Marlowe has used the perfect set of words to describe what he sees.Chandler's plots have been criticized for their contrivance and implausibility. Implausible they may be, but plots are not why I read Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories. I'm reading them for the reasons I enumerated. I am reading them for the unique world view of a character who wears the necessary armor to do battle in a corrupt world and yet wants to believe in a world of chivalry and moral order."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler creates a world of grime and crime in his second novel Farewell, My Lovely. Protagonist and private detective Phillip Marlowe falls into a case when he's taken into an old nightclub with a large ex-con named Moose Malloy. Malloy is looking for his girl Velma, but it seems that the place has been taken under new ownership. Malloy winds up killing a man there, unable to control his temper, but that isn't Marlowe's only trouble. He goes along for the ride on a jewelry ranson deal where his client is brutally beaten to death. Things get stranger and stranger the more things happen, and plenty does.Even if you've seen any or all of the movie versions, you'll probably find yourself guessing to the very end. How? Because Chandler creates a world like no other, a world truly his own. He preferred Dick Powell as Marlowe in the 40s noir film Murder, My Sweet, an adaptation of this book.Chandler has an amazing grasp of the Marlowe character. Every line is distinct and memorable. Despite the lurid setting, you'll probably find yourself laughing at Marlowe's wit and sarcasm. This is no childrens' book, but it's an indulgent read. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I purchased this Audiobook on Cd, being familiar with Raymond Chandler as an author, but having never read any. I bought this solely for Ed Bishop being in it. It turns out I really totally enjoyed this book being dramatized. I have since purchased the other Marlowe plays available. I love the honesty, though brutal at times, of Marlowe's character. To me he is a dedicated, likeable guy who gets the job done and done well. For anybody who enjoys the old radio plays from years ago..this is a must for you. Any mega fan of actor Ed Bishop, (like me who totally fell in love with him years ago) this is also a must to own!

This novel reads like a Quentin Tarantino production where every one seems clich&eacute; cool, moves swift, and screams with devious intentions. The main detective Philip Marlowe knows the underground world around Southern California as he is initially recruited to find stolen jewels but ultimately stumbles upon a murder case full of twists and turns. Crime follows everywhere he goes as he meets gamblers, fraud, vixens, con men, prostitutes, poor, and rich. This books relishes in the criminal underground and that is exactly what makes this novel such an enticing read. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes of this book is the fact that Marlowe, like the rest of us, is not flawless. Rather than being the astute Sherlock Holmes, this gifted sleuth has normal problems which we all can relate to. He never seems invincible and always seems to be on the verge of trouble which ultimately makes the book more enjoyable. The only drawback is by the end of the book I had already guessed the criminal, but then again, I may have just gotten lucky."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely puts Chandler's detective hero, Philip Marlowe on the trail of Moose Malloy, a hulking ex-convict who's looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma. Marlowe stumbles upon Malloy as he tears up a bar looking for her. Velma had worked there when the bar had a white clientele. The place has the same name but is now for coloreds only. Molloy murders the bar's owner. The police are uninterested since the victim was a person of color. Marlowe looks into the case on his own initiative, even though no client has hired him to do so. A mysterious wealthy playboy hires Marlowe to be his bodyguard at a ransom exchange. Marlowe is knocked unconscious and his client is murdered. The story proceeds from there with all the loose threads being tied together at the end. There are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense.Bay City is a fictitious town abutting Los Angeles where a good part of the story takes place. It is a haven for crooked cops, corrupt politicians, quack doctors, phony psychics, and illegal casino gambling. Marlowe makes a huge effort, risking his life several times, to meet Brunette, the mob boss that runs Bay City. That effort seems worthwhile only in hindsight. The climactic confrontation between Marlowe, Molloy and the missing girlfriend seems contrived. All of that is unimportant. Raymond Chandler's novels are appealing more for their witty dialogue and clever metaphors than for their stories. Farewell My Lovely's best line describes Moose Malloy's girlfriend: \\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.\\" Molloy himself is described as follows: \\"He looked as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\\" Pure genius."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"With smooth moves across the literary dance floor, author Raymond Chandler has his way with his partner, the fortunate reader. Without a word too much or too little, Chandler created a style both casual and elegant. His lead character in this work, private detective Phillip Marlowe, must solve a murder, one that is connected to gambling, beautiful women, guns and danger. If you like the sleek style of the 1930's or 40's, then this writer is probably the one for you.\\"She got out a gold cigarette case from her bag and I went over and held a match for her. She blew a vague plume of smoke and watched it with half shut-eyes.\\"Sit close to me,\\" she said suddenly.\\"Let's talk a little first.\\"\\"About what? Oh...my jade?\\"\\"About murder.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I recently listened to the unabridged version of this book narrated by Elliott Gould, and while Chandler's glimpse of 1940's era Los Angeles was surely entertaining, I still like Dashiell Hammett's \\"Continental Op\\" novels better. In Farewell, My Lovely, private dick Philip Marlowe starts out working for a barber on a minor job and unrealistically stumbles onto a murder by a hulk of an ex-con, looking for his old girl Velma in a club where she used to work. Marlowe then is mysteriously contacted out of the blue to provide security for a shady jewel transaction, in which a rich dandy is to attempt to buy back some precious jade from the thieves who stole it.The novel moves at a brisk pace, and while some of the plot twists seem a little forced, they are entertaining nonetheless. One of my main problems with the story is that Marlowe seems to spend most of the novel putting his life in danger, getting knocked out, shot at or drugged, without much of an incentive to get involved. He often seems to be acting on his own, without a paying client, despite warnings from the police to stay away coupled with the obvious dangers. Hammett's continental op, in novels like The Dain Curse, at least had a paying client ordering him to snoop into the multi-layered mysteries, with significant insurance money at stake.Ultimately, without giving away too much of the story, Chandler does a pretty good job of throwing a lot of balls in the air and wrapping up most of the loose ends by story's end. Some threads are left unresolved, like the whereabouts and motives of the mysterious doctor and psychic in Bay City, but most of the rest of the plot makes sense. LIke another reviewer said, at the end of the novel, while you may have enjoyed the ride, you are left with somewhat of an empty feeling.As for the narration, I expected a little more from Mr. Gould, an accomplished stage and screen actor who seems to sleepwalk his way through the beginning of the book as if he was handed a copy of the novel, a microphone, and told to read. He later changes pace a little, adopting different voices for different characters, but I found the voices ill-suited to the characters and sometimes caricatures of policemen or gangsters, as if the novel was a scene from a \\"Bowery Boys\\" episode."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Tough guy, hot woman that might leave you with a bullet lodged in your back, lies and double dealing all served up on a corrupt California landscape.

Usually it is when you think they will get away with it.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"In this his second adventure, private detective Philip Marlowe - more or less in between cases - pokes his inquisitive nose where it doesn't belong. Encountering a behemoth of an ex-con, Moose Malloy, on the street, Marlowe follows the big man into a bar and witnesses a murder. And before the reader can ask, \\"Where's my Velma?\\" - the question makes sense when you read the novel - Marlowe finds himself embroiled in police corruption, a blackmail scam, chasing a gang of jewelry thieves, another murder and encounters a young female who becomes his pseudo-partner, a psychic con-man, a crooked doctor and is propositioned by beautiful young woman who is married to a much older and very wealthy man. All the while Marlowe attempts to keep tabs on Moose.If possible the plot/story-line of Farewell, My Lovely is even more convoluted than its predecessor, The Big Sleep. Marlowe meeting new players with each twist and turn of the investigation and getting physically bounced around on a regular basis. (For the politically correct there are a handful of racial slurs which may make the reader cringe.) But somehow the author ties it all together in the end with maybe a not so neat bow.This being a Chandler novel there are plenty of classic \\"Marlowe-isms\\". After being called to a rich client's home, where \\"the carpeting almost tickled his ankles\\", he describes the den he is escorted into as \\"a room where anything could happen, except work.\\"When embarking on a night's work he makes the observation, \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance. I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun.\\"Ahhhh - to be Philip Marlowe."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"A giant of an ex-con, bursting out of his costly, tasteless and ill-fitting clothes shows up at a nightclub one day, looking for his ex-girl, Velma, and takes Raymond Chandler's intrepid, wise-cracking detective, Philip Marlowe, along for a rather bumpy and dangerous ride, in this tale of crooked L.A. cops, gigolos, mediums, gamblers and gang betrayal. Moose Malloy is bigger then nearly everyone else and not overly bright but he is dead set on finding his Velma, last seen eight years before when Moose got turned into the cops for a bank job he pulled with some others. Marlowe witnesses Moose in action, while on a case, and gets sucked into the search for the big guy and his long lost honey by one cop while being warned off by another. But Marlowe is too bull-headed to do anything but keep pushing and, surprisingly, not particularly bright, since he keeps getting suckered and hit over the head and put at serious risk of his life. Situations he ought to see coming, as an experienced detective, he seems to persistently misread, perhaps because his liking for liquor has blurred his senses or maybe he just isn't a very good investigator. But, whatever the case, he stumbles on, from one life threatening situation to another. He also can't seem to get his arms around the fuzzy set of coincidences that follow hard on the heels of his run-in with Moose as he gets a job offer that anyone in his business with half a brain would walk away from . . . and then mishandles it badly. The seedy atmosphere of L.A. is very nicely handled and the characters sharply limned and convincing, but the perpetually soused Marlowe, with the self-defeating wise-cracks and nasty mouth is a little tiresome. I had a bit of trouble acclimating myself to the racist mindset that Marlowe and his cohorts present in this 40's milieu, too, since I thought it was somewhat gratuitous and even mean-spirited, but maybe that's how some folks thought in those days. More troubling was my profound sense that Marlowe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye. He seems, in this book, to have a death-wish, a bad trait for someone who hires himself out as bodyguard and investigator. He takes chances a green kid shouldn't take and never seems to see the blackjack coming. Still, he manages to stumble along, thanks to a combination of apparently undeserved good luck and just plain hard-headedness, until the cause of all his troubles unfolds itself before his and our eyes. Surprisingly, given his drink-induced obtuseness, he solves the mysterious set of coincidences that have led to so much murder and betrayal, and gets the girl who wants him though he's too tough to ever openly acknowledge wanting her. This was a very odd detective tale, if ever there was one, and yet, for all its irritations and flaws it kept me reading to a most satisfying conclusion that pretty much wraps the central problem up in an almost too-tight, neatly tied bow. Moose finds what he was looking for and Marlowe figures out how to find Moose and the killer of Marlowe's mysterious client is unmasked. Marlowe, of course, has another drink. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"This is a great novel for so many reasons. The dialogue is clever without descending into cuteness. The supporting cast of characters is a truly fascinating one. The descriptions of places are vivid. Be they the homes of the obscenely rich or rundown slum dwellings. The intricate plot unfolds in a way that really holds the reader's interest with a couple of nice plump red herrings thrown in for good measure.As always, Marlowe himself is tough as nails and completely hard-boiled. Except that towards the end of the book, he surprises us by becoming sentimental. This uncharacteristic sentimentality is not directed toward either of the two female love interests. But rather toward a tall, violet eyed boatman named Red who helps Marlowe in his hour of need. You really have to admire Raymond Chandler for knowing just when to interject the unexpected.I would love to give Farewell, My Lovely 5 stars, but I have to deduct 1 star. The reason? I can't for the life of me understand what the killer hoped to gain by commiting murder in the first place.If Mr. Chandler were still alive, I'm sure he would address that particular concern in the manner of a college professor talking to a kindergartener. I can just imagine him saying: \\"Reality is not straightforward. Only in the world of fiction are motives clearly defined and unambiguous. My writing is meant to reflect real life.\\" {From The Big Sleep (1939)- \\"It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"}"},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I finished THE BIG SLEEP in a few days and was so impressed by the book, I immediately bought FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. Another great novel by Chandler.The book begins with Marlowe being pulled into a barroom mishap when an ex-con is looking for his girl. Once Marlowe finishes with the police reports, he thinks his day is over. At the office he receives a phone call from a man who needs his help. The man asks Marlowe to accompany him to a 'business' meeting. This is only the beginning of a twisted mystery which Marlowe is faced with solving.Once again Chandler does a great job of weaving various stories and characters in an effortless manner which takes the reader easily through the mystery. I look forward to reading another Marlowe mystery...they are pure joy!"},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler's creation, Philip Marlowe, is a character that has influenced modern fiction greatly. Without Marlowe the archetype of \\"private dick\\" would not carry the cultural weight that it does today. It is true that the plot lines of many Chandler works are contorted to the point of no return, but it is not the plot that counts. The reason why these books are so successful is because we the reader become enthralled by Marlowe and his immediate knowledge of all things that surround him. Because Chandler made Marlowe such a carefully wrought character, Farewell, My Lovely becomes an examination of the human character rather than a list of dastardly deeds committed by crooks without depth. Every scene is an interaction between fully developed characters. He defines himself in relation to the people and actions that whirl in and out of his life. Marlowe offers us plenty of insight into his opinion of his relations. Because he is such an endearing person we want to believe every word he says. He is a product of the LA scene where he works. We the reader build confidence in our hero because he is capable of sizing up any situation immediately. Slowly we learn to trust Marlowe's way of navigating the underbelly of LA. I truly enjoyed Farewell, My Lovely because Chandler forces through Marlowe an undeniable wit and charm. He will make you laugh and draw you into his brand of thinking about other characters. I wonder sometimes when reading Chandler about how Marlowe would size me up. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about interesting characters and loves a wry wit and dark charm."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I hated how 1940 racism suppurated in this story and nobody saw anything wrong with it.I didn't like how sometimes I didn't understand what was happening, but then neither did Philip Marlowe.By the time I didn't understand I was mesmerized by red neon flashing further and further across grimy hotel ceilings, the damp smell of sage in the canyons that flared my nostrils, the scraping of pebbles pulled by the ocean tide.I liked seeing how words can be magic.Here is a random paragraph (truly) about the same as you'll find on any page in this book: \\"After a while there was a faint smell of the ocean. Not very much, but as if they had kept this much just to remind people this had once been a clean open beach where the waves came in and creamed and the wind blew and you could smell something besides hot fat and cold sweat.\\"I loved seeing how paragraphs can also be poems."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Given Chandler's enormity I'm feeling (as I did with Austen) more like I'll be reviewed than him - and this is complicated by the fact that I've been too busy lately to get to the review soon after reading the book. Anyway, with these disclaimers I'll push on.Great stuff - Chandler really has his own voice, mood and characters. Indeed, he's quite self-conscious in this book, having Anne Riordan remonstrate with Marlowe about how he *should* have run and concluded his investigation in a more traditional and elegant fashion:\\"You ought to have given a dinner party ... and you at the head of the long table telling all about it, little by little, with your charming light smile and a phony English accent..\\"Marlowe responds for Chandler, \\"It's not that kind of story. It's not lithe and clever. It's just dark and full of blood.\\"Interesting that Chandler felt he had to justify his deliberate departure from the classic mannered English detective story - or was he just enjoying highlighting the contrast?And it's not *just* dark and full of blood: there's flirting, camaraderie, humour, honour, and even a romantic ending. Still, along the way Marlowe takes a hell of a beating given his somewhat inexplicable method - which involves identifying particularly dangerous individuals and locations and just walking in without preparation, protection or backup. If you somehow manage to still be breathing after they've pounded you for a while, you've got some more clues to your case. And you even get the (nice) girl on your own terms:\`You're so marvellous,' she said, \`So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody beats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they're all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?\`Go on,' I growled, \`Spill it.'Anne Riordan said thoughtfully: \`I'd like to be kissed, damn you!'So who's reviewing this book - me or Chandler?Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises. He blurs the lines, liking some of the bad guys a bit much, being rough and coarse - but then bugging the good guys by showing he's read a bit and can show more chivalry than they do. And just what was going on with \`Mrs Grayle' and the midnight assignation which could have ended very differently:\`I bet it's fun to be played by handsome blondes,' Anne Riordan said. \`Even if there is a little risk. As, I suppose, there usually is.'I didn't say anything.He's quite a contrast with the cold, aloof (but still troubled) Sherlock Holmes. If getting involved might cloud his judgement a bit, hey, what the hell...Chandler has a knack for making his characters shine - Marlowe is actually a bit of a soft touch, he can empathise, and from his perspective we find things to draw us to them the way he is. An odd thing in his in other ways very bleak, rough world."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is such an amazing book. From the first page, this novel does what all Chandler books do-- transports you to a whole 'nother world, so real it feels like you're actually there. FML is such an awe-inspiring accomplishment for the immensely talented man of letters, Raymond Chandler. Most of the time I was absolutely floored, just sitting there with my mouth wide open, marvelling at his genius. Writing is hardly ever this good, and when it is, the great stuff usually isn't the abundance of the book (as RC's is), rather, it's in little snippets here and there. There must be a God, because Chandler's writing makes me realize the potential of us humans to transcend the ordinary and be what he is-- extraordinary. Not to mention that the mystery will have you guessing all the way through, and even without the cynical prose (yes, I said prose) which manages to be beautifully ugly and positively negative at the same time (I told you he was a genius), is excellent in of itself. So, I urge every person who hasn't yet done so to read Raymond Chandler. He is not just a mystery writer (which usually means sub-standard literature) but he totally, without a doubt, transcended the genre. I guarantee his writing will blow you away. His clever, cheeky remarks, his sarcasm, his minimalistic prose, his cynical outlook, the dames, the coppers, the criminals-- that and more is what you can look forward to in this masterpiece of the English language."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"For me the main pleasure of reading this novel derives from wisecracks zinging on almost every page. Here are a couple, plucked randomly:The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on.A bogus heartiness, as weak as a Chinaman's tea, moved into her face and voice.And here is another one, a shot at Hemingway, as Marlowe explains a corrupt cop why he keeps calling him by that name: \\"A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.\\"Hemingway may not be a great writer -- I'm not a big fan -- but he was a far better one than Chandler. That little charming fish story of his alone has (rightfully) much greater literary acclaim than all of Chandler's works put together.Still, Raymond Chandler is a pleasure to read. He has a tremendous gift for storytelling. The wisecracks, the colorful characters, and the snappy dialogue make reading this novel, as well his other ones a pleasant experience, especially on lazy, boozy weekend afternoons. Nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"Being a fan of \\"modern\\" mysteries, I always enjoy picking up a \\"classic\\" such as \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"I,the Jury.\\" THis was my first Chandler novel. I won't say I liked this book as much as the others mentioned yet reading it made me think of a dialog line from the first \\"National Treasure\\" film where Nicholas Cage reads the Declaration of Independence and says \\"they just don't talk like that anymore.\\" The same holds true here; the characters, the way they talk, and the way a bottle of booze can take care of everything captures the time and makes you understand what made Chandler so revered up to this day.As so many great novels do, the story line is secondary to you getting engrossed in the time period, the city of Los Angeles, the hero(??), private eye Philip Marlow, and those he meets up with. As some have mentioned, the plot seems somewhat disjointed early on. It almost borders on Quentin Tarantino movie territory in that you have to wait awhile for a couple of separate incidents to come together in order to grasp the entire story. Marlowe literally stumbles into the middle of a couple of murders and the women, bad guys, and good guys that Marlow comes across makes for a sometimes confusing yet very interesting novel.A good novel but, for me, not as much fun as Spillane or engrossing as Hammett's classic work. Still, this is the kind of book you read, enjoy, and say as you are closing that book cover, \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, My Lovely","review":"I started reading Raymond Chandler after the author of one of my favorite new authors of last year, Richard K. Morgan, was compared left and right to him. The comparison was apt, and Morgan should be flattered, because Chandler is a genius.Farewell, My Lovely is Chandler's second book, and features his hero, Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed, hard-boiled private dick who is straight as an arrow. I had read that The Big Sleep, Chandler's first book, was his best, and that they descended in quality chronologically. But after reading this book, I know that is wrong.

I think the characters are very developed - you feel as if you know them and identify with them. Certain parts actually make me cry no matter how many times I have read this book.

I like strong women characters who stand up for themselves, but Rachel, Doris and Lillian, the daughters of the awful Sara, took verbal abuse all though their childhood, and still kow-towed to Sara to the point I started skipping the same old dialogue over and over. Sara was one of the most unlikable charactors I've ever encountered in a novel like this.

It is written at an appropriate level for a middle-school child (see examples below).Abbot explains clearly what life was like for the nobility in the Medieval period and writes with sympathy for the commoners caught between the feuding pretenders to the throne. He discusses the rivalry between the various kings, their sons, and their supporters and enemies, always in clear prose. Abbot is also clear about motivations, for example distinguishing between, on the one hand, the cruel and rapacious kings (such as Ethelred) and, on the other, William, whom he believes acted in a combination of ambition and a sincere belief that it was his duty to displace a usurper of the throne. (According to Abbot, William had been promised by King Edward of England that he, William, would be named successor to throne. On Edward's death however, no such statement of succession was made and in fact Edward stated that he was indifferent to who should succeed him.)To give a flavor of Abbot's writing, here are two brief quotes:\\"It is not to be supposed that, even in the warlike times of which we are writing, such a potentate as a duke of Normandy would invade a country like England, so large and powerful in comparison to his own, without some pretext. William's pretext was, that he himself was the legitimate successor to the English crown, and that the English king who possessed it at the time of his invasion was a usurper.\\"\\"The hostages which are particularly named by historians as given by Godwin to King Edward were his son and his grandson. Their names were Ulnoth and Hacune.\\"All in all, for an adult, Abbot's book is a very basic overview of the facts of the wars of the period, the rivalries among the factions, and the execution of the Norman invasion. Abbot deals with personalities and motivations, but does not venture into the principles of the reigns of the various kings, leaving the reader with little to no information about the structure of the societies, the laws or the ways they were enforced (or not enforced), or why the Normans were never displaced, despite the continuing rivalries after William's death. For that, one will have to turn to another book."},{"Title":"History of William the Conqueror (Makers of history)","review":"This book is the fifth book that I read on historical figures by Abbott.

Much of this was requisitioned from the civilian population and certificates were issued payable in either continental or state funds, depending on the units supplied, upon presentation to court authorities. Thousands of these certificates issued to Virginians were duly entered by the courts, and they provide a fascinating insight into the period of the Revolution. These \\"Publick\\" Claims booklets contain interesting and useful information about the contributions of ordinary people to the Revolutionary War. They provide some details of people's service in the militia or as guards for prisoners of war; they indicate where some bodies of troops were at particular times; and they identify providers of horses, wagons, cattle, grain, or other supplies. Much of the information in these booklets cannot be found anywhere else, which makes the surviving records particularly valuable. Also remarkable is the fact that records survived from virtually every county in the state at that time with the exception of the newly formed Kentucky counties. This makes the collection even more valuable in covering areas which heretofore in this time period have suffered from a lack of personal data. The \\"Virginia Publick Claims\\" are published by counties. In addition to a faithful transcription by Janice Luck Abercrombie and the late Richard Slatten, a complete index is provided for each county booklet.

If Amy was invited to a party or to go somewhere else with her friends she makes up a lie so that she can go home to her sickly mother.This story has a surprise ending so I don't want to give it a way so, if you are enjoy reading books about suspense you would probably like to read this book. I would recommend this book because it's the type of book that will keep your attention focused on the book and you wanting to turn the page."},{"Title":"Daughter","review":"Three sntences summary:Sylvies life is turned up side down when her mother is diagnosed with alzhimer's. not knowing what her mom will be like the next day sylvie finds comfort from her friend ryan whose grandmother also has alzhimer disease. with the help of her friends and dad, Sylvie knows that she will make it through to be there for her mother.What i like most about the book:That she was 14 and i love books that relate to young teens.What i didn't like and why?:The way the author left the end of the book!my favorite character and why:Her name is Sylvie b/c she has to grow-up and parent her mom while balancing school boys and friends.The scene ,line,or passage that meant something to me and why(page#):133, \\" Your face..

This book for young readers will, I hope, introduce the succeeding generations to the man who would be president in 1968.I like the way the author highlights the salient points of the late Senator's life. Although this is not a comprehensive biography even for young standards, the author does a credible job of presenting the Senator in a favorable light. I was especially pleased that the Senator's focus on civil rights issues was emphasized.As with any work on Robert Kennedy, the reader is left with the aching, gaping question of what would have transpired in the intervening years had this good man been elected president in 1968."},{"Title":"Si llevas un raton al cine (Spanish Edition)","review":"My mother told me my step-father was finally learning Spanish, so I purchased this for him as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, his Spanish studies went nowhere, but I did get to share the book with my children, who are both learning Spanish. While the text was simple enough for a 9 year old to follow, it simply didn't have the same rhythm, charm, and cuteness that the English versions of the \\"Mouse\\" books. Illustrations are nice, however, and my kids enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hi Cat","review":"Hi, Cat! by Ezra Jack Keats is a timeless story of a young boy's encounter with a less-than-predictable cat.

The book and cassette tape are both winners!"},{"Title":"The Woman's Study Bible","review":"Working in a Christian bookstore exposes me to hundreds of Bibles but I find this one to be not only an effective study tool but a foundation for developing character, integrity and understanding God's plan for women. Informative helps, devotions and biblical references combine together presenting a strong biblically based cornerstone for today's Christian woman."},{"Title":"The Woman's Study Bible","review":"This book has been great in revealing how a Christian woman should live, and which tools are needed to do so. Many Bibles claim to be geared toward women, but this Bible definitely reaches the depths of womanhood. Along with interesting portraits of women in the Bible, this study Bible goes into intricate detail about the people, land, and enviroment surrounding the Old and New Testaments.This is a MUST HAVE for all women....Read and be BLESSED of GOD!!!!"},{"Title":"The Woman's Study Bible","review":"I actually bought the paperback version of this book and I couldn't be more pleased with it. I love the study materials it includes, such as pages on the flowers and herbs of the bible. The footnotes on the bible verses are so easy to understand. I recommend buying the hardcover version because my paperback is already showing a lot of wear, and I've only had it about 3 weeks. It really focuses on the relationship between women and God."},{"Title":"The Woman's Study Bible","review":"The Women's Study Bible is all it's title states and more. Not only do you have a comprehensive study bible but a rich tool for applying God's Word to a womans daily life.

It is a rich tool for individual learning, discipleship and biblical counseling. Truly a MUST HAVE for any woman of God."},{"Title":"The Woman's Study Bible","review":"I couldn't be more pleased with The Woman's Study Bible (Thomas Nelson, 1995).

I recently upgraded to Illustrator 10 and started reading Adobe's User Guide, which as usual is not all that great for beginners. Sam's Illustrator 10 book is actually very helpful for those never having used Illustrator before, which I haven't (although I am experienced in Photoshop). The book could be helped with a CD and color diagrams, but otherwise it is a straightforward instruction book that is easy to read. It gives both the Mac and Windows versions when there are differences. Overall I'm satisfied, especially since I got it on sale at Amazon and it's currently the only Illustrator 10 book available."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Illustrator 10 in 24 Hours","review":"I liken this book to a book on how to work on cars.

Advanced techincal areas are intermingled with simpler beginner techniques throughout the book. I was especially disappointed in the small areas of the book devoted to the use of text. Kind of interesting since a quote from the book is that text is a powerful way of graphic expression. Of the 554 pages they devote 30 to the use of text.I have been impressed with the SAMS books in the past but this one is a dud."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Illustrator 10 in 24 Hours","review":"I liked this book.

And there are no corrections posted on the publisher's web page for the book so they either think the book's error free or they just don't care. I emailed them and asked if there was an errata page and got one of those replies you often receive from big companies that showed they didn't even really read my email in the first place."},{"Title":"Qualitative Data Analysis: A Sourcebook of New Methods","review":"As explained in the acknowledgements, this book grew out of research projects of the authors. It seeks to explain how one draws valid meaning from qualitative data. The focus of the book, as a consequence, is analysis. The authors see themselves as logical positivists. Three components of analysis are: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification.Like a large number of other scholars, they see compatibility between qualitative and quantitative research. They contend that &quot;qualitative research can be outright 'confirmatory.'&quot;This book covers the basics of doing a qualitataive study. It is a helpful reference to use for experienced researchers as well as an excellent introduction for beginners."},{"Title":"Holyoke: The Skinner Family and Wistariahurst (MA) (Images of America)","review":"Those who know something about the histories of Hampden and Hampshire Counties in Massachusetts are sure to be familiar with the Mill River disaster of 1874 and how it shaped the destinies of the towns it affected and those it didn't, as well as the people and families who survived that preventable tragedy. This book offers a quick but well-rounded glimpse into the private lives of one family who attained prominence both before and after the flood nearly ruined them. This collection of photographs makes an excellent companion volume to Elizabeth Sharpe's \\"In the Shadow of the Dam\\".On a more personal note, I would like to thank Ms. Thibodeau for providing me with what are probably the highest-quality pictures of my great-great-grandfather Thomas Skinner I will ever possess."},{"Title":"Gangs in America","review":"This edited volume provides a balanced approach to gangs that includes defining and measuring gang participation in several urban settings. Special attention is given to the role of ethnicity and gender in gang involvement. Most importantly, the book integrates individual behavioral factors with ecological and socioeconomic dimensions that contribute to an increase in gang activity. The book ends with several case studies of community responses. Edited by one of the leading gang scholars, this is a must read."},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"\\"French Style - How to Think, Shop and Dress Like a French Woman\\" was published by Express (the clothing store) in 1993. The book design is unusual. It is a an oversized 10\\" by 9\\" soft cover book with a stiff book jacket cover making it a cross between a hard cover and soft cover book.The text is illustrated with line drawings and a number of photographs (mostly black and white). It helps you learn to THINK like a French woman. It will help you learn to make the decisions a French woman would when shopping, dressing, playing and more.French woman are known for their chic appearance and attitude. Within these pages Vienne who was born and raised in France conveys what it is that makes the French woman so stylish. She begins by looking to the past. A look at how the French fashion evolved. Then she shares the purebred classics that make the French look - items such as the supreme black turtleneck, hermes scarf, red gloves etc.Vienne encourages you to \\"epater les bourgeois\\" that is shock say a French matron. Here is where you wear things that will raise the eyebrow such as a sweater turned inside out, sunglasses in the rain etc. As Vienne says \\"you cannot have style without breaking the rules\\". Take what you have and add little twists to make it special and give it style.In the States we dress \\"appropriately\\" in France a French woman will push buttons - be surprising and fresh.Vienne gives a list of \\"do's\\" and \\"don'ts\\" and she gets into \\"Le Shopping\\". Armed with more attitude than cash the French woman will use her wits and savvy to find the very best.Like the design itself this book is very unusual. Not your usual dress like this fare. This is a book that goes beyond the obvious of what is style and helps explain the mystery of how to make style yours.French style is not a trend, it's a way of life. A way of thinking and feeling. Veronique captures that in this book!Lee Mellott"},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"I, too, bought this book from Express way back when and read it religiously numerous times. As a high school girl who didn't want to look like a tart, Mme. Vienne's words of wisdom were just what I needed to create a classy style of my own.Sadly, I donated it to the Goodwill or Friends of the Library a couple of years ago, during a momentary lapse of reason and good common sense. Guess I thought I didn't need it anymore. Boy, was I wrong!Get it if you can, my dears, as it's a great read for the exact reasons the other reviewers love it. Thankfully, I still remember a lot of the advice.I wish I still had mine!!!"},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"If you're lucky enough to come across a copy of this funny little book, grab it immediately!The illustrations & photographs are marvelous, darling!

Just casually flipped through it and read only parts (I don't why). Now, I've found another copy and have read it from cover to cover. I honestly don't think I was ready (5 yrs ago) to tackle the suggestions in this book. I am now.I can't think of anything that's more inspiring or more helpful for getting the French look. I've read all of Anne Barone's books (helpful) and the tres terrible French Chic and this is absolute best..hands down.The best thing I have come away with from this book is that you don't needs tons of money to create that French allure. The tips and tricks in the book anyone can do and will create that mystique you're after.Today, I decided to mix navy and black together (as the book says \\"Very French\\") and I've gotten a few second glances. Shock les bourgeois...ooh I do feel so very French!Get your hands on a copy of this book and don't let go!Amusez-vous bien!"},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"This book came highly recommended, and I had the opportunity to obtain it for far less than the usual list price of vendors [$60+] Being OOP has alot to do with it. It's a softback book, measuring about 8x9\\", less than 100 pgs with lots of illustrations and photographs. It was informative and enjoyable, but NOT worth that kind of cash, unless you're a collector. If you can locate it in a library - terrific! Otherwise, check out authors Anne Barone, Mireille Guiliano and others who have imparted and expanded on similar information about the allure of \\"French Women.\\""},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"I've read a number of books on French culture and French women's style, and this book was a complete disappointment. It manages to be repetitious and quite thin on useful content while containing an overabundance of superfluous historical information and irritatingly over-designed layouts. I'm completely bemused by the rave reviews and prices charged by used book vendors for this volume. Susan Sommers' French Chic and Genevieve Antoine-Dariaux's Guide to Elegance are better by far."},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"I'm totally baffled as to why people like this book. It's mostly a picture book with some text squeezed in. And they aren't even good pictures - there are some nice images of stylish women (including many of Audrey Hepburn, who was Belgian) but many of them are random drawings and historical pictures. The text is just Vienne spouting off ideas about the French that are either totally useless or outdated. Some examples from just flipping through at random: &#34;I used to be puzzled when well-meaning American friends praised what I was wearing but never asked where I got it. I thought that their obvious lack of concern... meant that they only wore custom-made clothes.&#34; Or, &#34;If you are a beginner and have never shocked a French matron before - but want to try - wear any of the following combinations: A red brocade vest with a denim jacket/ Two different shades of green/ A belt with a large tassel/ Slim pants in a pony print/ A sweater turned inside out.&#34; Or, &#34;Learn to be surprising, not obvious. Dress as you normally would - and then take off a thing or two. Take off your jacket and throw a sweater over your shoulders. Remove the logo from your jeans. Leave your handbag behind.&#34;I don't think that Vienne had a very keen eye for cultural observation, (even of her own culture) and she had even less of a talent for providing useful advice. (most of the book isn't even prescriptive, just rambly like my first quote above) Glad I got this from my library, as I can't imagine spending even a fraction of the prices being charged here."},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"I agree, the photography and graphics are fun, though nothing unique for a book about style or fashion. The text is interesting at best, yawn. I could have made a much better choice at Half Price Books, ho hum. Basically, it's a book that belongs in a powder room and the next time I have a week to kill sitting in front of a vanity mirror, I may finish it."},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"I loved this book when I was in high school, and still remember (and use)some of the tips."},{"Title":"French Style: How to Think, Shop, and Dress Like a French Woman","review":"A light but inspiring read. Insightful and encouraging. This is 'hope' in a book for women with a style crisis."},{"Title":"Pete Rose : My Story: An autobiography","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the strange and unfortunate saga of Pete Rose. It offers his version of the \\"truth\\" regarding his banishment from baseball as well as his views about his magnificent career. Although the book features the information most fans would want to know, it is not structured well. Roger Kahn organizes the book as almost a dialogue between Rose and himself, which gives the reader the feeling that the book is cut and pasted together from random interviews. The transitions from Kahn's views to Rose's views are sloppy and at times confusing. It is hard to believe that Kahn spent three years writing this book.Buy the book for its information and overlook the unfortunate fact that Pete Rose selected the wrong person to write his biography. Roger Kahn was either loafing through the project or he was severely past his prime. Maybe he should have \\"hung \`em up\\" when Pete Rose did."},{"Title":"Pete Rose : My Story: An autobiography","review":"PETE ROSE DOES A GOOD JOB IN THIS STORY CONCERNING HIS CAREER AND PRIVATE LIFE. THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING HIS GAMBLING IS DONE IN GREAT DETAIL AND IS A STAND OUT. PETE COMES ACROSS AS BEING CONFIDENT AND AT TIMES COCKY, HONEST, AND ARROGANT. I ADMIRE PETE THE BALL PLAYER, BUT AS A HUMAN BEING HE IS NOT A MODEL CITIZEN. I FOUND THIS BOOK WELL WRITTEN AND QUITE INTERESTING. A MUST FOR PETE ROSE FANS."},{"Title":"Pete Rose : My Story: An autobiography","review":"The book was very well written and was very good up until the time when Rose was charged with gambling. When it got at this time Rose talked around every single topic he was asked. Because of this book I am 99% sure Pete Rose bet on baseball."},{"Title":"Rainbow & Rose - Canada","review":"I was going to give this book four stars until I reached the end and it moved me almost to tears, hence 5 stars. Live many of Shute's books the feelings he invokes are beautiful and powerful, all coming from rather controlled, unemotional characters. \\"The Rainbow and the Rose\\" is about lives twined and brought around in a full-circle effect. There are no surprises in the plot, but there doesn't need to be. It works even as you know what's coming. There is a great deal of detail on flying and airplanes that may or may not appeal to you--I enjoyed it. Shute writes those sorts of technical details very smoothly so they integrate into the characters' traits. Not Shute's best novel, but decidedly worth reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow & Rose - Canada","review":"I read The Rainbow and The Rose , along with most of Nevil Shute's novels, many years ago. Interestingly, I've never read On The Beach. I have, however, recently begun buying copies of Shute's novels for rereading. I wish to see if my sixty year old personna interprets them differently than I did as an eighteen year old.At the time I first read The Rainbow and The Rose, I thought it as good as A Town Like Alice. I could not wait for Ron Clarke to become airborne once again, as he made his way across Australia, so that he would continue to experience the visions that were some sort of gift to help him sort out his feelings toward the woman he once loved and the man who'd won her heart so many years ago.I thought back then, and I think today that the book would make a wonderful movie, if done correctly and with the right people.I urge anyone with even a passing interest in Shute's work to read The Rainbow and The Rose."},{"Title":"Rainbow & Rose - Canada","review":"This novel has a somber tone to it as it tells the life of a pioneer aviator. Much of the story is told in dream sequences as the lead character, an Australian airline pilot, tries to fly a mercy mission to evacuate or deliver a doctor to treat his old friend who has crashed on a similar mercy mission. Johnny Pascoe was a World War I fighter pilot and, after the war, works as a flying instructor for a small flying club in England. During the war, he marries a beautiful girl and she has a child while he is off at war. When he comes back, she has an offer to go to Hollywood as an actress and she divorces him taking their daughter to America. While working as a flying instructor, he meets another beautiful woman who is married to a wealthy man who is confined to a mental hospital. She learns to fly and they slowly fall in love. Eventually, they decide to marry if she can convince her husband to divorce her. She become pregnant but the husband balks at the divorce and she goes to France to have the baby. Eventually, she becomes distraught at the stalemate with the husband who has escaped from the mental hospital and her inability to reconcile the circumstances with her sense of duty. She crashes her plane committing suicide.Johnny Pascoe then leaves for India and becomes an airline pilot for the next 30 years. At the time of the story, he is nearing retirement and he meets a stewardess who has become his senior stewardess on his regular flight. They become quite close and eventually he learns a shocking secret. The story is somber but like several others of Shute's novels is a pleasure to read. It resembles \\"In the Wet\\" in its dream sequences in which the story is told. It resembles \\"Requiem for a Wren\\" in the somber tone of the story. There is similarity to \\"Pastoral\\" in the flying sequences. It is an outstanding example of Shute at his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow & Rose - Canada","review":"Wonderful to read this book again.

The structure of this is similar to \\"In the wet,\\" where the story was stronger, in part, because of the characters.

If you would understand what the abortion debate isall about, this book, along with The Facts of Life, by Harold Morowitzand James Trefil and my book, There is a Bomb in Gilead, are basicallyall that you need to read. Understanding Differences is a group of 12essays, 10 of which are written from either a Pro-Life or a Pro-Choiceperspective -five on either side with the first two written from noparticular political view point. Each of the Pro-Choice or Pro-Lifeessays is critiqued at its end by an author from the oppositeperspective and the editors, Daniel and Sidney Callahan writing thelast two essays and critiqueing each others. Daniel Callahan is amedical ethicist writing from an essential Pro-Choice perspective andSidney is a clinical Psychologist writing from a religiously Pro-Lifeperspective. They are a married couple who had six children, one ofwhom they tragically lost a few years ago. Daniel was born and raisedCatholic and Sidney converted as a young adult. The book is the bestexploration of the differing positions informing the abortion debatethat I have ever read, and as I have been consumed by the issue foralmost twenty years, and was trained in ob/gyn in the uearsimmediately preceding the Roe v. Wade era, I believe that I know asmuch about the various aspects of the abortion debate as any personalive. (...)You need to get it and read it ifyou are really interested in the subject and desire to be adequatelyinformed to debate the issue intelligently from either side, withyourself or others. You really owe it to yourself to get and read it.wfh"},{"Title":"THE TROJAN HEARSE.","review":"The Trojan Hearse is a 1960s detective novel by Richard S. Prather, who obviously had his tongue firmly implanted in his cheek when he wrote it. It stars Shell Scott, the fictional protagonist of many a Prather work. Scott is an LA private eye, known equally well for his fearlessness and his trademark white hair and eyebrows.In this particular installment, Scott is hired to find out who is responsible for the sudden death of Charley White, the best friend of a highly popular singer named Johnny Troy.

Then more murders occur, which by definition one would think would make the mystery easier to solve as there are less suspects. However, Ms. Christie is too clever for that, and much as in And Then There Were None, the reader is baffled until the very end.My only [small] complaint is that Miss Marple is a relatively small part of the novel, and it would have been nice to see a tad more of her.Relic113"},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Christie wrote several books with nursery rhymes themes, HICKORY DICKORY DEATH being another. She also dealt with dysfunctional families several times, HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS and 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON were two. In this work she combined the two ideas.Rex Fortescue was a very rich and quite unpleasant man. He ran his family and his business with an iron fist. One morning his very efficient secretary took in his morning tea and found him dying. While investigating his death the police were met with one puzzle after another, what killed Mr. Fortescue?, how was it administered? and why did he have a pocket full of rye grain? As they were beginning to get some answers another murder occurred and then yet another each bringing more confusion to the scene.Jane Marple arrives to the house and begins to sort through the tangle of clues to steer the police in the right direction.This story may seem quite familiar. The Fortescue family is Christie's standard - domineering, wealthy father who keeps most of his family trapped in the family home, under his control. An errant &quot;black sheep&quot; child returns just as the murders begin and there are many family secrets.Although the story is somewhat formulistic it is still a well told tale and a fairly laid out puzzle. All the clues are there for the reader to use to try to solve the mystery before the last chapter.

Nevertheless, let the record show that i did, on this occassion at least, outthink the Queen, and come to the solution chapters before she revealed it.

The lead policemant, Inspector Neele, is one of the more attractive creations Chirstie has made ~ much better than Dermott Craddock, for example ~ though, naturally, subservient to and not fully understanding the value of Miss Marple. Another nice touch in &quot;Rye&quot; is that Miss Marple doesn't appear until well into the story; nor is too much made of her, as we see far more of Neele than we do her.

And, of course, there is a red herring. Don't let this title be your first of Christie's novels"},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Mr. Fortescue was sitting in his office, drinking his normal morning tea, when the secretary heard him screaming for his life. When ambulances finally arrived and got him to the hospital, he was dead. The diagnosis was that a poison, taxine had killed him. This can be found in yew berries, and Mr. Fortescue lived on Yewtree Lodge. His wife was the main suspect in the murder, until she also was murdered. Her lover, Mr. Dubois, was the suspect next. Just about everyone that knew the family was a suspect. On the same day that Mrs. Fortescue died, the maid, Gladys, died also. This is when Miss Marple came to stay at Yewtree Lodge. She worked together with Inspector Neele, even though they had completely different thought patterns about what had happened. Inspector Neele eventually came to the conclusion that Percival, the son of Mr. Fortescue, was the murderer. While staying at Yewtree, Miss Marple made her own discoveries, biased on what the family members had told her. Neele was wrong, and soon agreed with Miss Marple that the other son, Lance had killed his father. Even though Lance was in Africa during all of the murders, Miss Marple proved that he had come back in the summer and given Gladys taxine, while pretending to be her boyfriend. He told her that the taxine would make Mr. Fortescue tell the truth, so Gladys put it in his marmalade. The marmalade wasn't eaten for months later, so Lance was in Africa when his father died. This gave him a strong alibi. He also killed Gladys and Mrs. Fortescue. He lured Gladys outside, pretending to be her boyfriend again, and then strangled her. Then he came to the front door and met up with his wife, pretending to just have arrived. While have tea with his step-mother, he pretended to drop sugar in her tea, but it was actually poison. Inspector Neele would never have discovered any of this without Miss Marple. This book was written with a surprise ending. This was a good book, but it had too many characters. An interesting part was that the murders fit perfectly with a nursery rhyme. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to read a good murder mystery book.The book was written so the person least likely to be the murderer turned out to be it. Lance was fired from his father's business, and moved to Africa. When his father was murdered, he was still in Africa. This made it seem nearly impossible for him to have committed three murders while being on a completely different continent. Percival, the other son was used as a distraction from Lance, and was portrayed as the murderer for a good part of the book. The MacKenzie's were also used as a distraction from Lance being the murderer. Mr. Fortescue left Mr. MacKenzie in Africa to die, so his family probably wanted revenge. All of these characters were used to make Lance seem less and less likely to be the murderer.There were too many characters. The author created too many suspects, so it got hard to follow. There were maids and housekeepers and cooks and a lot of relatives all living at Yewtree. This made them all suspects, and they kept being brought up. This made it hard to keep up with what was going on in the murder being solved. Also, the book seemed to go on and on, going through all of the possibilities of where everyone was during the murder.The murders were planned to fit a Mother Goose nursery rhyme. Miss Marple discovered that the murders perfectly fit the nursery rhyme about blackbirds. The people were killed in the same order and Mr. Fortescue was even killed with a grain of rye in his pocket. Gladys was killed with a clothes pin on her nose, to symbolize a bird snipping off her nose. The all seemed to be an odd plan the murderer was doing, until it was discovered that Gladys was killed before Mrs. Fortescue, which made it not fit with the rhyme anymore.This was a very interesting book that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat the entire book. There are many twists and turns that keep you guessing on who will be suspect next. It is almost impossible to tell who the true murderer is until the very end. Paying attention while reading this book is very important, but the book is a great mystery book that would be good for almost everyone, as long as you're willing to keep up with all of the different characters that come in and out of the book.A.

Although she is the first suspect, her murder the following afternoon after a tea of scones and honey, shifts suspicion. That same afternoon, the housemaid Glady Martin is also found dead. While unpegging clothes from the clothesline, someone strangled her with a stocking and left a clothespin attached to her nose to complete the rhyme's final line &quot;When there came a little bird and nipped off her nose.&quot;It is the death of the maid that brings Miss Jane Marple into the case.

It is filled with tales of frustration, revenge and greed.Miss Marple becomes part of the investigating team when she reads that the maid at Yewtree Lodge is one of three people murdered. The maid is an orphan whom Jane Marple helped train for private service. Miss Marple is particularly upset when the maid is found with a clothes peg on her nose. She makes a train journey from St. Mary Mead via London and presents herself at Yewtree Lodge:Crump [the butler] saw a tall, elderly lady wearing an old-fashioned tweed coat and skirt, a couple of scarves and a small felt hat with a bird's wing. The old lady carried a capacious handbag and an aged but good-quality suitcase reposed by her feet. Crump recognized a lady when he saw one...The detective in charge of the case wisely decides to make use of Miss Marple's talents.Inspector Neele looked with some interest at the mild, earnest face of the old lady who confronted him now at Yewtree Lodge. He had been in two minds at first how to treat her, but he quickly made up his mind. Miss Marple would be useful to him. She was upright, of unimpeachable rectitude and she had, like most old ladies, time on her hands and an old maid's nose for scenting bits of gossip. She'd get things out of servants, and out of the women of the Fortescue family perhaps, that he and his policemen would never get. Talk, conjecture, reminiscences, repetitions of things said and done, out of it all she would pick the salient facts. So Inspector Neele was gracious.I don't think the murderer's identity came as a surprise. I was surprised that he used three separate murder weapons, albeit two of them were poisons.

But no sooner do police suspicions begin to form around one of the three than murder strikes again--and then again--in such a way as to leave them baffled. Enter, of course, Miss Marple, who sets about uncovering a killer who may be a psychotic that is killing victims in accordance with the old \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" nursey rhyme.Most of Christie's great novels were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Although she could still create a stunner when she wished, with A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED a case in point, by the 1950s Christie favored a less complicated approach, preferring to write novels that might be described as creamy confections for a very civilized high tea. A POCKET FULL OF RYE is perhaps the perfect example. Like most Christie novels, the plot is extremely contrived--but in this instance she makes no effort to conceal the contrivance; it is a shell game, pure and simple and without pretension, a game undertaken for the pleasure of it. And when Christie sets out to write a novel for the pure fun of it, there is always a great deal of fun to be had. This will never rank among her greatest works, but fans will devour it in a single sitting and feel as satisified as if they had just enjoyed a blow-out of cream buns.

There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Once again, \\"The Queen of Crime\\" pleased me with another thrilling mystery. Even more delightful, this book follows a similar pattern to \\"Three Blind Mice and Other Stories\\" and \\"Hickory Dickory Dock.\\" When Agatha Christie sets out to write a story with a nursery rhyme pattern it is truly suspenseful and intriguing.This installmen in Christie's large collection has Miss Marple, my favorite of her detectives, trying to solve the mystery of the poisoning of financier Rex Fortescue with taxeine. This case hits close to home for Miss Marple since Gladys Martin, a domestic maid whom she had trained for service becomes a victim of the killer. The culprit is following a bizarre pattern of using the \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" nursery rhyme, and thus three victims are discovered. Rex Fortescue is discovered upon death to have a coat pocket full of rye grain, his young wife, Adelle Fortescue is discovered dead over a meal of scones and honey, and Gladys is discovered strangled with a clothespin on her nose, (A cruel imitation of \\"The little blackbird who nipped off the maids nose.\\") Miss Marple uses the nursery rhyme to discover the guilty person, and the motive is both enraging and poignant. Since there is a lemited amount of suspects, Christie superbly develops the characters and purposefully misleads the reader with plenty of red herrings.The characters in this particular installment are not as likable as in previous books of the series, but they each have complex personalities. Perhaps my favorite character is Jennifer Fortescue, whom I can relate too in a way. Of course, Miss Marple is unforgettable, and I cannot help but wish that Christie would have put more of her in to the book. Inspector Neal is fine, but Craddock is my personal favorite police officer in Christie's Miss Marple series. However, this book is terrific, and should be read by all mystery fans as a cozy whodunit that is both poignant and mostly fun. Happy reading to you all."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"Or so did Ms Marple say to one of her characters in the book, if I remember it rightly. This book stands out for me through the brilliant, albeit grisly, usage of the old nursery rhyme &quot;Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds&quot;.The first chapter described the death of Rex Fortescue in great detail, although those details curtail none of the man's suffering but his assistants worries: whether their boss is having a sudden attack of epilepsy, drunk, or simply dying. I find this chapter very funny - I have a very strange sense of humour, so sue me - and sets the motion for the proceeding chapters when more of the rhyme came into fulfilment: the dead queen in the parlour, the maid with a clothespin on her nose to make up for the 'bird came and nipped her nose' and even the pie that contained dead blackbirds, which of course, accounts for the first part of the rhyme.Ms Marple commented these things in the book as horribly childish, and she set out to seek the murderer who not only killed from afar but also killed merely out of covering his/her own sad behind. Another brilliant novel from the Dame."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"\\"A Pocket Full of Rye\\" may perhaps be the best novel Christie wrote that features Miss Jane Marple. It is, at heart, a mystery with an ingenious setup that revolves around a familiar nursery rhyme. With murders happening aplenty and somewhat unexpectedly, this is a mystery that will keep readers on their toes until the very end.When Rex Fortescue is poisoned, suspicion immediately falls upon his young, second wife, an unfaithful woman who definitely had a motive to kill her husband. As do several (if not all) of his family members. Yet when a second poisoning claims the live of Mrs. Fortescue, she is wiped out as a suspect, but someone else within the family is definitely confirmed as the murderer. Almost every family member, or someone connected with them, had something to gain from these two deaths. Miss Marple becomes involved because one of her old serving girls is the third murder victim, filling out the last two lines of the nursery rhyme. Miss Marple helps put the detective in charge along the right track, separating murder from pranks, and finding the heartless killer among the family ranks.\\"A Pocket Full of Rye\\" is a fast-paced mystery, as are many of Christie's works, but it is spurred on by its unique story and a compelling cast of characters. As CID Inspector Neele says many times, every member of the Fortescue family is 'unpleasant', as are most of the people who work for them. As with other Christie works where Miss Marple helps out a detective, the mystery is solved but justice isn't necessarily served out in the end."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"This was one of a string of Agatha Christie mysteries I read ina very short time, but it is the only one which has really stuckwith me.

I'd never have expected to find a Christiework thought-provoking, but this one was."},{"Title":"A Pocket Full of Rye","review":"The seventh book to feature Agatha Christie's famous spinster sleuth concerns the mysterious death of Rex Fortescue, a powerful businessman with a rather unpleasant family who in turn have about a dozen different motives for killing him. There's the pretty young wife who is clearly having an affair, the suppressed daughter who was chafing under her father's control, the impatient young son who was concerned about the wellbeing of his father's business empire, and rumors of a family vendetta from years ago, involving an African goldmine.Inspector Neele is put in charge of the case, one that seems relatively straightforward what with the news that Fortescue was poisoned by taxine, a substance that was easily found in the yew tree berries that grow in abundance at Yewtree Lodge. This clearly implicates someone living at the household, whether it be a member of the dissolute family, or one of the servants - Neely in particular is intrigued by the impeccably calm and composed Mary Dove. More puzzling however, is why on earth Mr Fortescue had a pocketful of rye in his jacket, which seems a singularly pointless thing for him to have been carrying.But then two more bodies turn up in swift succession, both of which seem wholly unconnected. Neele's attention is suddenly drawn to Mr Fortescue's sons, the amusingly named Percival and Lancelot, who are respectively the white and black sheep of the family. Yet both have impeccable alibis...Christie often drew upon nursery rhymes in order to construct a mystery (such asHickory Dickory DockandOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe) and here it is \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" that gets the treatment, complete with the king in his counting house, the queen in the parlor, and the maid hanging out the clothes. Miss Marple has figured out the pattern, and believes that the murders must therefore have something to do with blackbirds, however unlikely this connection may seem.As you may have guessed, the set-up and solution are borderline ridiculous, but that Christie wrote this book for fun is very clear - it's a puzzle, nothing more, with the usual fare of red herrings, mistaken identities, false leads and so on. The characters are lightly sketched, the murders are ticked off in quick succession, and though there is some amount of pathos involved concerning Miss Marple's desire for justice for the pathetic housemaid, the entire story is mostly presented as an intellectual puzzle, nothing more.Miss Marple takes a while to turn up (it's not until chapter thirteen that she makes her appearance), however, unlike some Christie novels, which take time for the body count to stack up, this one wastes no time in delivering cadavers to the reader. In essence, \\"A Pocketful of Rye\\" is vintage Christie.

The incredibly competent Inspector Neele is assigned to investigate the case, and what at first seems like a \\"routine\\" poisoning case soon grows into a veritable maze of lies and misdirection - beginning with the curious discovery of rye in Rex's pockets. When Rex's much younger widow is subsequently poisoned while taking tea, and the maid is found murdered by the clothesline, Neele struggles to find the connection between these seemingly random crimes.Miss Jane Marple barely appears in this novel, but her scenes are critical in revealing the killer's identity. She's the catalyst that helps Neele connect the threads of these seemingly random killings. I was quite impressed with Neele's character - for my money he's one of Christie's most interesting inspectors. He's extremely intelligent, intuitive, and knows how to read people. Most importantly, he knows how to use a person's tendency to underestimate him. He's not one of those investigators who must have every clue handed to him by the \\"civilian\\" or \\"amateur\\" sleuth. Christie could've written more novels featuring Neele's character and I wouldn't have complained at all.Christie incorporated rhymes or famous quotes as clues in her mysteries on more than one occasion (Poirot'sOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe (Hercule Poirot)or Tommy and Tuppence'sBy The Pricking Of My Thumbs (Tommy and Tuppence), to name just a few). Pocket probably isn't one of my favorites - the pool of suspects is relatively limited after all. But Christie throws so many misdirections and possible motives into the setting of this dysfunctional, very English, household that it's a delight to spend a few hours with Neele and Marple sorting through the red herrings in order to reveal the culprit."},{"Title":"The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture","review":"As an architectural book editor, I find this book an excellent reference for biographical data, architectural terms, and historical context.

During that time, I'velearned a lot about float hunting for Alaska's big game, but I still picked up new pointers from Larry's book.He covers many of the basics which will be invaluable to first-time Alaska hunters and agreat refresher for veteran hunters. There's help with choosing equipment, packing yourraft, hunting Alaska's big game species, care of meat and trophies, and a host of otherimportant topics. Larry is clearly an experienced Alaska outdoorsman. An example of themany tips I picked up from this book is to consider using the US Mail to save money inshipping equipment to the point from which my bush flight will leave.To me, the big drawback of this book is the lack of specific advice in choosing a river.There are hundreds of rivers in Alaska, but the vast majority are poor choices due tonavigability or access problems or lack of game along them. The information in thisbook did me little good in discovering new rivers to float.The bottom line though, is whether or not it is worthwhile to buy this book. In myopinion, if you are planning a float hunt in Alaska and are interested enough to read thesereviews, you ought to buy this book! For me, it was definitely worth it for the photos andthe good new tips I picked up along the way. Good Luck!Bruce Nelson, Producer of \\"Alaska Hunting Adventure: 700 Miles Alone by Backpack and Raft\\""},{"Title":"A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska","review":"I heard of this book from Alaska Fishing &amp; Hunting News magazine. Larry frequently writes for that publication, and his knowledge of Alaska is superb. I bought the book to judge if I should hunt in Alaska, as I heard the research aspects of getting there and hunting was difficult. His book gave me everything I needed in order to plan my trip. There has to be 300 phone numbers and over 20 detailed mapsof Alaska's hunting regions. I can't believe this book has not been made until now. If you plan to ever hunt in Alaska, you should own this book!"},{"Title":"A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska","review":"In spite of all the great reviews prior to this one, this book is not a complete guide to float hunting Alaska. I give the author credit for doing a lot of research and the book provides an incomplete but valuable list of phone numbers and some nice pictures. Other than that it reads like college term paper. It has a lot of words but not enough depth to plan much of anything. The maps are straight out of the hunting orders and no specifics are given on any river. There are inaccuracies throughout the book. For example, in the wildlife biology section it states mineral licks for sheep contain protein (p 97) and that sodium and magnesium are organic compounds, a different chemistry than what I learned. Some of the conclusions in the discussion of firearms and ballistics are irrational like including the 7mm(7x57?)and .308 in the list of calibers as good choices for moose and bears (brown and/or black it doesn't specify?). Besides, I hate to see sporting firearms referred to as weapons, we have enough problems with the media and anti-gun groups. If you are a novice hunter and didn't know much about the outdoors, you will find usefull information. Beyond that it covers everything from changing your socks to minimum impact camping. Unfortunately, none of it in enough detail to be of real benefit to any but the inexperienced. It would have been better to write a book on float hunting and concentrate on the basics in depth instead of trying to create the complete guide to everything in 205 short pages and missing the mark the title implies. Go to the AK Fish and Game web site and get a good floating Alaska rivers book, you will be ahead."},{"Title":"A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska","review":"I was fortunate enough to meet Larry at a book signing recently.

This book does it all from what to bring, what to expect, and how it is done. I personally have read the book three times and learned something new each time.

That said, I'm also a reader and my opinion of the review below is that MsFrisby missed the point. Manstealing for Fat Girls has sex, drinking and drugs in it. So do most kids lives these days. Whether they do or don't engage in any of the above, they know kids who do. The book shows how a real, literary heroine navigates these dangers as well as unnamable ones--patriarchy, homophobia and a class system that also negates her worth as a human being. The \\"lessons\\" for young readers--and there are many--involve watching a young woman figure out that she's ultimately stronger than all of the above. Also that she will continue to have to fight these battles her whole life. That is the reality MsFrisby and those who visit her library also deal with, and naming these things, through literature, ultimately makes all of us stronger (and saner). I've spoken to countless librarians about this book who are jumping up and down excited about it because its books like these that make kids want to read.MsFisby, I agree with you that the examples above are disturbing (though some are a bit misquoted). That's why the author put them in the book. That's the function of literature: to show a mirror to the world and then to show us the alteratives.As for my take on this book, I adore it. Its smart and political, but mostly its really, really funny."},{"Title":"Manstealing for Fat Girls","review":"In a time of sugary sweet coming of age stories like Juno and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, it was a wonder to read something so simultaneously harsh and heart felt as MSFFG.I am an objective reader, and I couldn't put this book down for one second. literally read it cover to cover in one sitting.The setting of 80s suburban wasteland, the infusion of grime-core punk music and the undercutting of the John hughes genre makes this a teenage adventure I can actually relate to my own life.And it is so funny.A wonderful book I would recommend to any and every one."},{"Title":"Manstealing for Fat Girls","review":"I read it until I passed out and then woke up a few hours later wanting to do nothing but finish it. It spoke so much to body image issues all young women face, and to the difficulties of teenage sexuality. I have it on good authority that this book wasn't written for young adults, but was marketed that way because it's about young adults. I say, forget the label. Its visceral critique of gender relations and class issues are more than adult enough for any non-teenage reader. It has its flaws, but it'll punch you in the gut. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Manstealing for Fat Girls","review":"Michelle Embree, Manstealing for Fat Girls (Soft Skull, 2005)It's been a bit of time since I've read this, because I haven't quite been sure what to say about it. I've read both sides of the argument over this book, and I can see the points both sides are making. The one thing I haven't been able to see is the one aspect of the book about which everyone else sees in it: its sense of humor. Both critics and defenders seemed to find the book uproariously funny. I missed the joke.I'm not even going to try and summarize this incredibly (and needlessly) complex novel beyond the barest bones. The story involves Angie, who's sixteen, fat, and bi-curious. Her mother is dating a jerk, her best friend is both out of the closet and flamboyant, and the only guy she knows who treats her like a human being is so odd that, until we get some third-party confirmation, the reader may be left wondering if he's actually a figment of Angie's imagination. Angie is obsessed to the point of madness with dieting, which never works, but the attention that a classmate slowly starts paying her leads her to the first tentative steps towards believing that she's pretty the way she is. And that's when things start getting weird.The central premise there is the book's strong point, to me at least--it's a book that does promote the idea that there's more to attractiveness than the physical, which is an especially important lesson in today's society (though like most other books that have that message, it never seems to take into account the idea that some guys really do actually find fat chicks hot; it takes the same tack of \\"well, I like you no matter what you look like\\" that everyone else does, which is highly annoying). Its problem is that while that does seem to be the main thrust of the book, it's sometimes hard to tell, because it gets buried under the weight of its own subplots, seemingly extraneous (if well-drawn) characters, and attempts at--veracity?--that just come off silly. (Maybe that's the humor I missed?)In any case, as I said at the beginning of this, I can see both sides of the debate. Yes, high school kids actually do these things. (Well, most of them.) And this is nothing new; high school kids did these things when I was in high school, and that's long enough ago that what we did is probably considered very old hat by today's standards. So to contend that high school students should be sheltered from it is purest stupidity. But on the other side of the coin, I do think the book tries too hard and reaches too far into the absurd in its quest to either identify with its target audience or make them laugh (your call). But it's readable enough that the all-out absurdity in the final third of the novel acquires a certain weird charm. Or it may annoy you to death. Depends. Like everything else about this book. ***"},{"Title":"Manstealing for Fat Girls","review":"Manstealing For Fat Girls works very hard to be a gritty young-adult book. The author, Michelle Embree, stretches to make the book appealing through a deviant and even dysfunctional flair, and can't seem to help but cram the grit in to surplus and inessential levels. I'm hard pressed to find a page that doesn't contain cursing, drug talk, or teenage sex. It apparently works on the premise that this unsoftened, graphic portrayal can better transfer an unyielding commentary on the lifestyle of the characters, but when you pack the grit on to such gratuitous levels, it ends up reading like the book's trying to sell itself with schlock and shock.At best, this overzealous literary technique makes the lessons in the book oblique. At worst, it makes the book's character portrayal seem hollow and artificial. Myself, I'd like to comment on the biggest issues I had with the themes and characters. Angie, the main character, is sixteen and lives with her mother. Her father left her mother when he found out she was pregnant, and Angie has had to deal with a long string of her mother's boyfriends. The current one, Rudy, has just moved in after announcing that he and Rita, Angie's mom, are going to be getting married. Angie is a definite outsider at her school, and largely moves in the outsider circle of friends. She is the only one in her circle that does not smoke marijuana, although she is offered several times. While this behavior is a decent example of someone sidestepping peer pressure, and the peer pressure is presented far more realistically than seen in many a book containing drug use, she usually turns down these offers solely because she's concerned with her weight and how getting the munchies would affect her weight loss efforts. Angie shows evidence of eating disorders throughout the book: anorexia and bulimia. She avoids eating to the point of getting light-headed and is obsessed with calories. She also forces herself to vomit after an episode of binging following a particularly traumatic event at school. This is a little distressing because it never get addressed in the novel. She is complimented on the weight she has lost. In some ways, it feels like an anorexic's how-to novel at times.Angie's best friend is Shelby, a lesbian in her class. She gets teased because of Shelby's sexuality, which does not help her already poor self image. Angie really only spends time with Shelby at the beginning of the book. She seems to pick up a number of outsider friends and by the time the story is over, Angie has gathered a much wider circle of friends very quickly. And she needs some of them after she is beaten and sexually abused at school by a jock and his girlfriend in one of the bathrooms before school. Carrie runs in the popular crowd with Mindy, the girl who helps beat Angie. But Carrie has struck up a barely plausible lunchtime friendship with Angie before the bathroom incident and helps her get her revenge on Mindy and her boyfriend. The reaction of friends and family after her beating is a bit frightful, including comments such as \\"A shiner like that? Some guy callin'? Sounds like a boyfriend to me,\\" from Rudy. Shelby's sister, Robyn, replies to Angie after being told the bruise is a long story, \\"Always is when someone knocks you around.\\" Such a blas&eacute; attitude towards relationship violence is painful and these reactions are paired with a strong sense of either a lack of concern or cluelessness on the part of adults who should notice. Her mom fails to notice that Angie is skipping school nearly every day before the bathroom incident and it escalates into full-scale drop-out mode afterwards. Rudy is written very clearly and realistically, a perfect portrait of a dysfunctional character who is not all bad and who does not completely reform through the course of the book. Rita, Angie's mother, just does not seem to be written with the same intensity, and she tends to fade into the woodwork. Whether this is an intentional ploy of the author to show her wishy-washy character in the face of emotional abuse from Rudy or not, Rita could be written much more memorably. The same could be said for a great number of Angie's other friends. Some have memorable characteristics, such as Pike, a dropout who enjoys sketching people, but seems to have no family. Inez also has some memorable characteristics, such as yelling into payphones outrageous conversations in order to unnerve passers-by. But by and large, the side characters are largely forgettable. The characters are not written in a stereotypical good or bad dichotomy; almost all of them have negative characteristics as well as some redeeming quality, including the main character. The only truly one-dimensionally written characters are Mindy and her boyfriend, Troy. Overall, while there are definitely aspects that shine, the book is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Reconnecting to the Magic of Life","review":"Joyce Mills, Ph.D. does in Reconnecting to the Magic of Life, what Julia Cameron did in The Artist's Way. Reading this book feels like spending beautiful time with a learned friend who integrates stories and ceremonies from many cultures including Hawaiian, Native American and Jewish. Where Julia Cameron uses the tasks of writing to enhance daily creativity, Dr. Mills utilizes story telling and active play &quot;Steppingstones&quot; that can be tangible, 3-dimensional objects and images created to hold in your hand and heart. She instills an attitude of looking daily for magical moments with people and nature. &quot;Where you stand you pray&quot; encapsulates her beautiful in-the-moment style and direction of life and the work she does with clientsEasily this book could have been called, &quot;Transitions to the Magic of Life&quot; as Dr. Mills embodies Milton H. Erickson's utilization principle through story telling and metaphor. Her specialty is viewing difficult life transitions as opportunities for &quot;Steppingstones&quot; into greater love, creativity and depth of compassion for our relations and selves. Poignant, loving stories are shared, such as the death or illness of a loved one, natural disasters, coming to creative terms of raising a mentally or physically challenged child, moving 3000 miles away to make your dreams come true, facing personal rejection and more.The metaphor of a butterfly's life particularly hit home. There are four stages of a butterfly's transformation: the Egg, the Caterpillar, the Chrysalis (Cocoon) and the Emerging Butterfly. Last year my husband and I bought a house by the sea adjacent to a nationally designated estuary. As is my practice, I name our homes. This one is called, &quot;Cocoon de Luz&quot; which means cocoon of light in Spanish. It is a place we nurture what Dr. Mills calls Imaginal Discs, a biological term indicating that there are cells that are genetically encrypted to propel the butterfly's transition from the chrysalis stage to the emerging butterfly if all the conditions are right. I would imagine if Butterfly's have documented &quot;Imaginal discs, then surly we humans do too.All great teachers seem to have this ability that Dr. Mills instills: to make tangible helping people to uniquely identify and move from a boxed-in chrysalis stage to emerging as a butterfly in daily lives. Her stories will make you laugh, cry and think.

Along the way he took great photos showing the details of each step. The illustrations are excellent. A great feature of this book is that it systematically takes you through the entire fitting-out process.Like all books, this one is limited in how much information it can pack into one volume. Completing a yacht interior usually involves applying the skills of a cabinetmaker, electrician, plumber, upholsterer, etc., and while this book shows you what's involved, you'll need other materials if you're not experienced in each of these areas. Surprisingly, all of the work is done with hand tools and a limited number of portable power tools (and, I guess, a lot of patience...). Stationary woodworking machines such as tablesaw, bandsaw, and sanders would save considerable labor.My biggest criticism has to do with the translation. The book was originally written in German, and translated in the UK. As such, much of the terminology and product names are unfamiliar in North America.

I didn't know what a lot of things were. Some are not explained, but some are explained in later chapters. This not very good organization and long quotes, make the book seem very much like it's been cut and pasted from previous columns and interviews.The last chapter, discussing the future of this monarchy, gives some comparative information and contains a lot of quotes. It's a disappointment, because this chapter should have been substantive.The current family has made itself relevant through charitable work, recognizing national achievement, being interesting to tourists and being helpful to the British Department of State.

The author has a tendency to jump around and as the book progresses her views change, which can make it seem \\"cut and pasted.\\" This reason alone stopped me from giving it five stars. From an American with an interest in the monarchy, I think it gives an interesting history while touching on why a monarchy works (at least as long as the Queen is the monarch in question). It also has a bunch of tidbits that make it good reading and gave another view of the Princess of Wales.

Though 'Commanders' in the title should more correctly be 'leaders', this book is a welcome companion to Ayers' A House Divided and Lyman's Civil War Wordbook; Including Sayings, Phrases, and Expletives. Some of Tsouras' selections bear the dryness of subjects we are long familiar with, from religious sentiment, honor, and glory, to logistics and maneuverability. However, these quotes retain their veridical and immutable character, despite our familiarity with the themes. Moreover, readers will benefit from the wide range of less well-known quotes.Unwittingly perhaps, Tsouras presents a revealing book since much is unveiled by what these commanders do not say. For instance, he quotes Maj Gen Oliver O. Howard speaking in admirable terms of men carrying the colors against enemy guns (55). Did this underlie the reason Howard needlessly launched the doomed uphill assault against entrenched Confederate positions at Pickett's Mill? Relatedly, though Ulysses S. Grant could boast of having &quot;never spared lives to gain an object&quot; (25), we are aware of his deep regret over ordering a final, doomed charge at Cold Harbor. Such contradictions in behavior represent the complexities of human nature, which Tsouras brings to mind. As such, we witness a telling psychology between the lines of many of these quotations, exemplified by Stonewall Jackson's statement that &quot;war...is the sum of all evils&quot; (254), and Sherman's &quot;War is at best barbarism&quot; (256). Otherwise, readers may find the entries under 'Administration' or 'Civil Affairs' non-scintillating, while other categories beg more citations than the few Tsouras includes (such as 'First Battle'). Furthermore, instead of including vainglorious poetry, Tsouras could have served his readers better with the haunting lines of Emily Dickinson's Victory Comes Late, or Melville's Shiloh: A Requiem.Finally, sometimes the idealism embedded in pronouncements by variously laureled, high ranking officers, did not result in plausible registrations of actuality. Hence, this reviewer recommends balancing Tsouras' book with others which cite quotes from common soldiers, whose words bequeath visceral elegy, imagistic power, and emotional resonance. Admittedly, it is easy to criticize a book of quotations because readers will always think of a phrase that the author could have included. Therefore, despite these criticisms, readers will still find in Tsouras' book much time-honored, veridical wisdom."},{"Title":"Military Quotations from the Civil War: In the Words of the Commanders","review":"I used this book as a source of daily inspirational quotations while in the military.

Gennett describes in fair detail various logging practices, and the technical vernacular is even footnoted to assist the reader with terms he/she has probably never heard.The brothers' Gennett certainly had a knack for making money, but it was always after much investigation and hard work, and certainly risk. It was interesting to me how Andrew, from the upper crust of society, rolled his sleeves up and learned the art of cruising timber and sawmilling. Accounts of the long nights in the cold camping or boarding with mountaineer families while on timber cruises and logging operations were fascinating.Gennett's views of the long arm of Uncle Sam and issues regarding private property rights are still echoed today.I highly recommend to this book to anyone interested in the history of the Southern Appalchians, natural resource management, logging, or the American entreprenural spirit."},{"Title":"Sound Wormy: Memoir of Andrew Gennett, Lumberman","review":"Sound Wood Wormy is a biography, well actually an autobiography of Andrew Gennett, a pioneer lumberman in the rugged country along the Chattooga River between Georgia and South Carolina north of Madison, SC and up to the North Carolina stateline. It is based on the personal papers of Gennett and was edited by Nicole Hayler with a foreword by John Alger of Swannanoa, NC, a timberman of some reknown.The one problem for the reader is the lack of any map that lets one know where Gennett was cutting, or splash-damming or visiting folks in his adventures. I resorted to a current trout fishing map for northeast Georgia which shows all the streams by name in the same area. Nevertheless, this is an extraordinary book and led to my contacting Gennett's grandson who is still in the lumber business in Asheville.Not only is this interesting to logging enthusiasts, it is a window to the way folks lived in this isolated area that was bereft of roads or other forms of communication long after civilization had come to Tallulah Falls in Georgia or to Walhalla in South Carolina on either side of the Chattooga. Most of you will recall the Burt Reynolds movie \\"Deliverance\\" about four men from Atlanta who canoe down the river through the rapids of the Chattooga.While at college in the area in the 1950's, my room-mate and I found a small community up near the tri-state juncture and had our own distrubing encouter with the locals and decided to move on instead of stopping for a Coke at the general store on a hot summer day. The banjo-picking youngster we saw may have been the same one that much later was in Reynold's movie.Gennett's story is worth every penny for this book. Even if you are from the West Coast, you will be able to walk along with Andrew Gennett as he opened up the area to logging. His interactions with the local folks shows how he knew when to hold em and when to fold em. A raised shotgun can give one pause in negotiations.Tom FettersLogging Railroads of the Blue Ridge & Smoky Mountains"},{"Title":"Sound Wormy: Memoir of Andrew Gennett, Lumberman","review":"There are many references about logging in the Southern Appalachians.

Also includes some great pictures of those earlier years."},{"Title":"History of William the Conqueror (Biographical histories)","review":"This is a very basic overview of the life of William the Conqueror, giving a brief history of the Saxon and Danish kings of England and the dukes of Normandy, followed by a detailed retelling of the life of William and his family. It is written at an appropriate level for a middle-school child (see examples below).Abbot explains clearly what life was like for the nobility in the Medieval period and writes with sympathy for the commoners caught between the feuding pretenders to the throne. He discusses the rivalry between the various kings, their sons, and their supporters and enemies, always in clear prose. Abbot is also clear about motivations, for example distinguishing between, on the one hand, the cruel and rapacious kings (such as Ethelred) and, on the other, William, whom he believes acted in a combination of ambition and a sincere belief that it was his duty to displace a usurper of the throne. (According to Abbot, William had been promised by King Edward of England that he, William, would be named successor to throne. On Edward's death however, no such statement of succession was made and in fact Edward stated that he was indifferent to who should succeed him.)To give a flavor of Abbot's writing, here are two brief quotes:\\"It is not to be supposed that, even in the warlike times of which we are writing, such a potentate as a duke of Normandy would invade a country like England, so large and powerful in comparison to his own, without some pretext. William's pretext was, that he himself was the legitimate successor to the English crown, and that the English king who possessed it at the time of his invasion was a usurper.\\"\\"The hostages which are particularly named by historians as given by Godwin to King Edward were his son and his grandson. Their names were Ulnoth and Hacune.\\"All in all, for an adult, Abbot's book is a very basic overview of the facts of the wars of the period, the rivalries among the factions, and the execution of the Norman invasion. Abbot deals with personalities and motivations, but does not venture into the principles of the reigns of the various kings, leaving the reader with little to no information about the structure of the societies, the laws or the ways they were enforced (or not enforced), or why the Normans were never displaced, despite the continuing rivalries after William's death. For that, one will have to turn to another book."},{"Title":"History of William the Conqueror (Biographical histories)","review":"This book is the fifth book that I read on historical figures by Abbott. After the initial excitement on reading them, I become to know some weakness.For this book, I hope that the author can write more about how William managed England, which currently is related to a half a conclusion section."},{"Title":"Four Things My Geeky-Jock-of-a-Best Friend Must Do in Europe","review":"Four Things My Geeky Jock-of-a-Best-Friend Must Do in Europe is about a young teenager name Brady, who takes a cruise along the Mediterranean Sea as a celebration of coming of age. Brady is a self-conscious teenager, shy and timid. Her best friend, Delia (who is as different from Brady as Europe is to a droplet of water from the Mediterranean Sea), gives her four, rather bossy, things to accomplish. She writes these commands (in permanent marker) on Brady's hand: 1. Write real letters to your best friend every day, describing thrilling adventures. 2. Wear the Bikini... 3. ...in Public 4. Meet a code-red Euro hottie. With these four things in mind, Brady sees European cities as beautiful and famous as the Mediterranean Sea itself. Along with her mom and the other vacationers, she takes a trip of a lifetime. Brady makes new friends, is cursed by plastic monkey, and has somewhat of a bikini \\"malfunction\\" in the French Rivera.I'm sure you're thinking this trip may seem eccentric. However, Brady discovers more of who she is and the treasures of life. She becomes more confident and gets to know different people along her way. I enjoyed this book because I can definitely relate to some of the characters. The author portrays Brady as a klutzy teenager, which really makes the story funny.

I got it from a used bookstore, cheap, because it sounded like it could be a fun, quick read. And because I had to finish my 100 books for the year, and was looking for something quick like this.So, it's about Brady, who is going on this cruise with her mother in Europe, and who's best friend decided to write out instructions on her hand for her to follow in Europe.It's written in letter format, as Brady writes the letters in detail of what has happened to her to her friend Delia. Since it's in letter format, it's a bit like it would be if a person were writing a message online. Not in chat speak, but with all caps for emphasis and lots of exclamation points, and with her talking to Delia. This did bother me a little bit, but that kind of writing bothers me on a normal basis, so it took some getting use to. I tried not letting it bother me, since it is in letters, but it still did some.The story was alright. Brady is dealing with her mother, who is leading her around to visit everything as they come to different cities, and she's a very shy person but is supposed to follow these rules her friend set. Her friend wants her to wear a bikini in public, which she doesn't want to do, and meet a euro hottie (or, more specifically, a code-red euro-hottie. I don't really know what the code-red is, exactly. Code-yellow, I think, was also mentioned. I don't know what that means, either. I got the gist of it, but it isn't explained [which it shouldn't be, since it's in a letter to Delia, who already knows what it means], so is that something that I just missed the memo on?). But Brady mostly follows the rules. She also makes some friends, who push her to complete the list, and who she also gets close to.And I do like her friends. There's a southern boy, two girls and another boy from different countries, and another boy who speaks Klingon (this is cool, but I've never seen any Star Trek. I should, though, right?) The two girls she gets pretty close with, and I liked them. The southern boy is pretty cute, and the Klingon guy seems sweet. Although they apparently are going to be seeing each other again, but it just seemed to work out too well, that I didn't believe it.I didn't particularly feel much for Brady, though, and I didn't get a big idea of who Delia is. I felt like it might have been better if there were letter exchanged back and forth between the two, like if Delia was supposed to do something as well, instead it just being one-way. Although I couldn't really imagine Brady telling Delia to do something... But still.It also made me interested in finding out more about her family, particularly her sister that's always at the computer, but I'm partial to computer geeks. I didn't get much of an impression of her mother, though. Brady makes it seem like she's crazy, but I didn't really think so.The story wasn't all that exciting, but it wasn't boring. It didn't have me clutching the book in anticipation for the next bit, but I didn't particularly want to put it down. It was easy to keep reading, but it didn't really leave an outstanding impression.And the ending was pretty good. It leaves you thinking that things are going to work out alright, maybe even pretty well.So, it was mostly just alright."},{"Title":"Four Things My Geeky-Jock-of-a-Best Friend Must Do in Europe","review":"My daughter selected the book for a quick read on a book report.

King Jesus didn't have the legs that Claudius or some of the others (I'm partial to Count Belasarius) but it's a powerful offering. More than Graves' other works, this one really requires some knowledge of the period. Graves was a fine classicist and it shows here: this is very far from Anne Rice. That said, if you don't have a feel for Temple Judaism (probably better understood today than in Grave's time) you might find King Jesus a hard read. If you like the idea of recreated dialogue between Jewish scholars, buy two copies of this book. It hardly \\"shocks\\" anyone today. Perhaps it did seventy years ago. The historical profession, for good or ill (I'd argue ill) has gotten into the historic Jesus debate again twice since \\"King Jesus\\" was published. Many of these scholars have tried to find a \\"useful\\" Jesus that fits more easily into our enlightened era than the one portrayed in the New Testament. Frankly, I'd rather hear this message in fictional form because that's where it belongs. No matter how you dice it, the only real sources we have concerning Jesus were composed by people who considered him fully divine. And as scholars like Larry Hurtado have shown, this idea appears to have been present well before Paul started writing letters - in other words, as soon as someone found the \\"empty tomb\\". Naturally, no historian can prove there was an empty tomb, but that reflects all of the testimony we have. (The Babylonian Talmud argues that Jesus' followers stole his body. The odd thing here is that when the \\"Jesus Movement\\" started, it's very unclear why some hostile witness to the execution didn't simply come forward and say \\"I saw the Romans dump his body into a ditch, the way the Romans always do.\\" This rendition does imply that there was a tomb in the first place and that someone thought it was empty. It is also yet another reason to dismiss Tabor's silly claim that someone has found Jesus' family tomb. History isn't easy.) Ironically the best Jesus novel I know of, Christopher Moore's \\"Lamb\\" accepts it indirectly. (I'm not comparing the two books other than they are both masterful works.) So if you want your Jesus to be a Jewish sage, here's a splendid picture of how he might have looked. Just remember, that Graves, just as much as Bart Ehrman, rejects the only evidence we do have creating this picture. Graves just admits to writing fiction.Eric Bergerud"},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"This re-telling of the incidents around the Nativity, the life of Jesus, and the state of very early Christianity, is unlike any other version of the New Testament I have ever read. The setting of the novel integrates a startling and heady recreation of Palestine at the time: the pagans with their Olympian gods; the older Mediterranean/Semitic Palestinian tribes with their mysterious gods; the orthodox Jewish society; those Jews whose beliefs straddled both the Jewish and the Graeco-Roman world; the Essenes; the Samaritans and many others. The book orchestrates how each of these groups interacted with resignation and suspicion to share in some power and belief. It is a rich, provocative and explosive mix. Each of these strands of society influence the young...and clearly not divine...young man born to Mary, who exhibits a religious genius and charismatic humanity that finally entangle and torment him until he is killed by these external forces, perhaps even sacrificed by them. There are several implausible incidents, but the brisk writing, the astounding backround of cultures and the sheer originality of this book are always compelling. Beware. This is not a book for traditional Christian believers. Nevertheless, it is a reverent but unorthodox take on the origins of Christianity and how it developed. Graves is a genius, with some unusual ideas that he uses well to illuminate and bring down to earth a series of events that has been scrubbed and idealized and overthought for centuries. While no one can know if Graves is close to the truth, he is always compelling and ingenious. Stay with this one. You will remember it."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Robert Graves's novels always take one expected places and this one is no exception.

Then he (Graves)hammered his square pegs into the already-rounded holes of New Testament historic anthropology. Even the absurd notion of Jesus having his left leg ceremoniously disjointed so that he could be a lame king, according to the Greco-Dionysian formula. Sure, there was a lot to learn from Graves rendition, and I appreciated his rational explanations for the so-called miracles, but he stretched the story of the Life of Jesus to unbelievable limits and conjectures, and that's even AFTER accepting the remote possibility that the eldest of Herod the Great's kids, Herod Antipas, MAY have been the true father of Jesus. I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this, and I'm a big fan of Graves usually, but if there is a justification for this book, it's the fact that it's clearly described as a novel, and that's how it should be cataloged, as fiction. To get closer to the true and accurate historicity of the new Testament stories, I would heartily recommend Schonfield, even though he has his own detractors."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"The book has some interesting ideas. There are several problems however:1) Most of the writings from ancient times have been lost, so he bases his theories on what has survived, which is very incomplete.2) He too heavily pushed his white goddess theory3) His command of Hebrew seems to be limited. For instance he writes Son of Adam. This is the literal translation of Ben Adam which means person.

But my reaction to King Jesus was, &quot;You know...It COULD have happened that way.&quot; In childhood I was the kid that made the teachers raise their eyebrows with my questions (and probably consign me to Satan's realm when my time comes), but it's always bothered me that the only species I've ever heard of being capable of parthenogenesis was--turkeys."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Graves fits the known and not so known facts around Jesus in a fascinanting story about what his presence meant to his contemporaries.After reading the book you have to say &quot; Si non e vero e ben trovato&quot;"},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Robert Graves always did considerable research for his historical novels, and this one is no exception. He had clearly read deeply about the religious traditions of the ancient world, not just Judaism, and it shows here. The result is an interesting version of the story of Jesus, which stresses his Jewishness, and explains his philosophy entirely in the context of Jewish belief. There is also a back story on his parentage which puts the title \\"King of the Jews\\" in a very different light.Our fictional narrator is one \\"Agabus the Decapolitan\\", writing ca 90 A.D., who briefly met Jesus, when he, Agabus,was a child, and has been fascinated with him ever since. Historically, this was a time when Christian doctrine was very unsettled, somewhat exacerbated by those gentiles who wanted to become Christians without being subject to Jewish law. Agabus has some critical comments about \\"Gentile Chrestians\\" (sic), and the ways in which they distort the teachings of Jesus.There's something here to offend everybody who is inclined to take offense at a discussion of ideas. Believing Christians may well object to the demystification of many of Jesus's actions, the natural explanations for such occurrences as the miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example. They may also object to the narrowness of his mission, since he is clearly concerned primarily with the Jews, not with all mankind.On the other hand, resolute non-believers may lose patience with the failure to provide a natural explanation for other supposed miracles, and the implication that there are some actual supernatural goings on. Of course, one could point out that the narrator does not claim to have witnessed most of the story himself, but is relying on the best information he has been able to get from others.Some Jews, Christians, and for all I know, Muslims, may take exception to the way Judaism is tied to earlier pagan beliefs, and pagan remnants are found in Jewish practice.There is, then, the material here for an interesting take on the foundation of one of the \\"great\\" religions. Unfortunately, it does get rather tedious at times, with extended discussions on mythology, religious traditions, and mysticism. Although I did not take offense at anything, there were lengthy passages that I found rather a hard slog. The philosophical maundering might be easier to take if I could convince myself that anything of actual importance was being said.Recommended then, mostly for those who have enjoyed Graves' other work, and want to see what he's done with this story. Probably not the best book of his to start with."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Martin Scorsese originally wanted to film King Jesus until Barbara Hershey put a copy of the extraordinarily beautiful and moving Last Temptation of Christ into his hands.And he would have had his work cut out for him had he tackled Graves' astonishing novel, for it is so thick with archeaological information, as well as Biblical scholarship, that the result is a beguiling combination of hard-nosed history book and old-fashioned sandal and robe epic.Devotees of the Galilean Jew who caused all this need not worry, Jesus stays a virgin and is never shown having sex with anyone. But he does indeed set up his own betrayal, with the help of Judas (\\"what you must do, do quickly\\"), and the most potentially damaging angle is the fact that Graves asserts that Jesus was indeed the heir to the throne of Jerusalem; hence Pilate's sign, INRI, placed over the Cross is no longer a bad joke, but a crime and slap in the face to Jesus' ancestry.Ultimately, though, the novel's main theme is the conflict between Monotheism (masculine) and Polytheism (feminine) and in the end, Monotheism wins out... or does it? With stories of Jesus walking on water and healing the sick and raising the dead, and being raised from the dead himself, just as if he was one of the many other magical pagan gods running about the Mediterranean at the time, did Monotheism really win after all?Great, but difficult, stuff. I've read it five times in order to fully get Graves' strange vision. King Jesus is like unearthing a golden treasure from the dusty caves of Qumran. Mysterious, and probably retaining all of its mysteries, but valuable nonetheless."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Definitely not the easiest read I've done, and I confess that before starting the book, I was a little skeptical about it, specially because of being a Faith-related novel. However, I found it to be just that: a novel. A book based on historical events (with recreated fictional elements of course) and the author does a fine job in accomplishing a very comprehensive narrative work (and well documented too!). Of course, English not being my native tongue made this book a bit harder. The book made this past month a very reflexive one for me, even though I'm not that into... let's say I've had phases in life in which I've been more religious than others."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"So used are Christians to think of Jesus' words as revolutionary and idiosynctratic that Graves won me over instantly when he points out the truth: Jesus was a Pharisee, a follower of the great Hillel. Jesus preached the Pharisee-an doctrine of \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" No, that wasn't an invention of Jesus'. Jesus did call those Pharisees who didn't act as they preached, \\"hypocrites.\\" That is no surprise. Pharisees were human, after all, and hypocrisy is an all too-human failing. I know when I first read the Gospels, I was struck by the fact that everything Jesus said had been taught to me in Hebrew school. I also note that Jesus himself is not quoted as claiming to be more divine than other people. The Gospel writers and Christian commentators make such claims, but Jeus doesn't. Graves does present Jesus as a human conceived via the usual channel, but Graves is, as I am, reverent towards Jesus. This is no icon-smashing work.Two passages stand out for me. One is the hilarious send-up of pagan scholars, all of whom claim to be sons of Abraham, \\"proving\\" to Jesus that all the prophets and women in the Jewish Bible are actually dervived from Middle Eastern and Greek mythologies. Their reasoning is baroque, tenuous, and spurious. They make analogies where none can be made. How like many scholars, then and today.The other is the marvelous (in the literal sense of that word) passage in which Jesus recites an arcane passage from Ezekiel and then proceeds to interpret it in a fascinating and, to me, innovative way. I must admit I haven't delved into the extant literature on the exegesis of Ezekiel, but Graves blew me away. Those more familiar with religious interpretation may tell me I was wrong, but I still found the entire passage breathtakingLess believable to me was the celibate marriage between Jesus and Mary, Lazarus' sister. I don't know what sources Graves had for such a marriage or if he just made this up. That's one of the problems with getting your facts from a novel. Within the novel, the marriage makes sense and fits in with the theme of the Three Mary's. As history or theology, however, I need some footnotes.Again, Graves presentation of Jesus as the rightful descendent of Herod, therefore, the rightful heir to the throne of King of the Jews, is novelistically sound, but historically? I have no clue. Again, someone more versed in 1st century history might be able to shed light on this.Overall, I found this an awesome, sometimes difficult read. It raised many provocative issues, and many fascinating descriptions of the times, which were dreadful. Graves's presentation of Jesus as a brilliant preacher who should not be considered a magician fit into my own concept of Jesus who is, after all, the most influential personage in the Western world. If people have spent time reading The DaVinci Code, they certainly should be willing to invest time in reading King Jesus. It's based upon Graves's considerable scholarship and his vivid imagination.I wish someone would undertake an annotated version of this novel on the model of the Annotated Alice or the Annotated Sherlock Holmes. The annotator(s), however, should be Classicists and Religious Studies scholars with expertise in the 1st century CE. I envision such a work as a collaboration between Christian and Jewish scholars."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"King Jesus: A NovelThis book, though a novel, is a stunning tour de force on history of the time of Jesus. Robert Graves presents a detailed history derived from multiple sources including Jewish and New Testament scriptures, contemporary historians (particularly Josephus), and lesser known works such as the Nag Hammadi gospels which had been recently discovered when the book was written. In doing so, he derives a plausible and very human historical Jesus, including his lineage as a legitimate heir to the throne of David.The book held my interest from beginning to end. To me was very readable, and brought the era to life. It would be more difficult to come to grips with, however, for someone who did not have prior interest in and knowedge about the times.The only fault with the book is that it was published 60 years too soon, at a time when its contents were probably widely seen as heretical. Now that the historical Jesus is better known outside of specialsed academic circles, the book should be better appreciated.Janice Nelson"},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Graves begins by giving us a wide panoramic vista of society, geopolitics, and the religious context of the world in which the Jesus myth was born. With his great erudition about the Ancient world, its religions and myths, it is much easier to understand the real background of the Gospels. A Jewish world profoundly divided, with plenty of sects and cults, in a Palestine dominated by the Romans. The Jews yearn for the arrival of the Messiah, who will free them from the Evil Empire. From there, Graves develops a bold thesis: given the political and dynastic conflicts facing the Jews, a conspiracy is devised in order to beget a totally legitimate heir to the throne, one who has all the credentials to lead his people to freedom. As other reviewers have pointed out, Graves's thesis is based on the myth of the Triple or White Goddess (about which Graves himself was an erudite, as shown in his complex book \\"The White Goddess\\").The said heir must be the husband of the youngest descendant from the maternal lineage of Michal, which represented the maternal continuity of King David's lineage. This would be the truly legitimate succession. That young woman is Mary, the youngest daughter of Joachim and Hanna. Simeon, the Supreme Priest, convinces Antipater, Herod's eldest son, to secretly marry Mary, so that he may legitimately claim the throne of Israel after the death of his ruthless father. After the secret wedding, Mary is then officially given in marriage (a mock one) to an old widower called Joseph, who agrees to the farce. Herod learns something about this conspiracy and plans to kill every boy under four from the Davidian lineage. Of course, Joseph and his family flee to Egypt. There, the future Messiah spends years of deep learning under the guide of Simeon. The script of the Gospels follows, but according to Graves's thesis. Jospeh and his family return, not to Judaea, but to Galilee. In order to fulfill the requisites of the Triple Goddess's myth, Jesus is married to another Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, and he is formally anointed as King of the Jews (since Antipater has died also). So Jesus begins his ministery, gathering followers and provoking the establishment. He suffers persecutions. But turns out Jesus, at the beginning, is not really preaching anything much new: his novelty consists in a radical return to original Judaism, updated to a different society, but free of all the rigidities, pomp, and hypocrisy of Pharisees and Saducees. Jesus inherits the religion of the Essenes, radical conservatives who preach austerity and the simple life. Little by little Jesus alienates and infuriates the Jewish leadership and his perception of his ministry and mission changes.This is where the story really changes from the Gospels: according to Graves, the original intention of the plot is changed: Jesus will no longer be a political, religious, and military leader who will overthrow the Romans and preside over a new Jewish Golden Age, but he will be the sacrificed offering to the White Goddess, so that her cult might reign. This also won't happen: Jesus's sacrifice will not usher in the religion of the goddess, but Christianity. Strange are God's ways. It is precisely this change which alienates some of Jesus's original followers, like Judas, a man totally committed to the overthrowing of the Romans. When Jesus starts changing from leader to redemptor, the plot becomes sort of like a Greek tragedy, until the well-known and bloody end.This book is a great novel about the deepest-rooted myth of humanity: the birth of Christianity. Graves's Jesus is a very complex character, rude, disconcerting and little likable. His theology sounds simple but is in fact confusing. When this confusion is added to the already complex web of cults and sects existing in Palestine, the end develops in an inevitable way. Sharp, bold, and provocative, Graves points to a fictional but believable theory of the story whose History will never be known: where, how, by whom, why, the powerful myth of the Jewish Messiah become Universal Saviour was created."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"I didn't plan on reading this book (and the thematically related Eve: A Novel of the First Woman) around Easter but that's how things worked out. Graves always enjoys turning readers' perceptions upside down in his historical novels (I'm afraid my recollection of the Julio-Claudians will be forever colored by I Claudius and its sequel). And his erudition is astounding. You may not accept his interpretations of Greek myth (The Greek Myths) or of the pre-Indo-European goddess cults (The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth) but you have to grant him a mastery of the sources common and obscure that few can equal.In King Jesus Graves exploits every contradiction in the canonical Gospels, the Apocrypha, Jewish tradition and Gnostic writings and combines it with pre-Hellenic religious traditions to write the \\"real story\\" of Jesus' ministry. Graves makes no concession to later Christian mythology. Jesus believes he is a Jewish Messiah sent to \\"destroy the works of the Female\\" (more of that later). Other nations may be saved but it would be under the hegemony of a Jewish savior of a restored Israel.The book purports to be written by Agabus the Decapolitan during the reign of Domitian (AD 81-96); a pagan who once succored a follower of Jesus during one of the persecutions. This source vouchsafed to Agabus the real story because he believed himself to be the last survivor and wanted to preserve the true tradition of who Jesus was and why he acted as he did. I don't know if Agabus is a historical figure; knowing Graves' exhaustive research into obscure texts, he may very well be but he's a believable narrator for the story: disinterested but sympathetic. Graves also makes it a point to relate the story through the eyes of a first century AD, educated citizen of the Roman Empire. Agabus is not an atheist or skeptic, he worships his gods and accepts that Jesus could, for example, raise a man from the dead by uttering God's true name or heal people based on his own strong faith and the faith of his followers.The first part of the book recounts the birth of Mary, her life and Jesus' birth. It would be too confusing to recount all the background but suffice it to say that Mary is the scion of the matrilineal line of high priestesses displaced by the patriarchal worshipers of the Sky Father who overran the Middle East and among whom are the ancestors of the Jews. This displacement was not total, however. For millennia, the invading patriarchs have had to win legitimacy by marrying the priestesses and honoring the goddess (in her many manifestations). This is where Christians may get \\"nervous\\": In order to legitimize the Herodian dynasty, the Jewish High Priest of the time (Simon) concocts a scheme whereby Herod's first son, Antipater, weds Mary and their issue will reign as a king acceptable to the entire Jewish nation. The first half of the plan goes well: Mary and Antipater are secretly married and he manages to get her pregnant with Jesus. Publicly, Mary is wed to the septegenarian Joseph of Emmaus. After this, alas, things fall apart. Antipater is not the most politically savvy operator and falls afoul of his father's raging paranoia, forcing Joseph, Mary and Jesus to flee to Egypt.Part two of the novel recounts Jesus' childhood. Here Graves follows the traditional narrative fairly closely but motives and reasons are very different - Jesus' mentors are grooming him to become the Messiah and he's fully cognizant of the role he's destined to play, if not it's exact form. This section ends with Jesus' marriage to another Mary, also an heiress to the ancient priestesses, and his laming, symbolic of his position as the Goddess' consort. There's also an extended scene with yet another Mary, the Hairdresser (aka the Magdalene), an old priestess, where she and Jesus debate radically different interpretations of the ancient tablets on which the Jews base their Law:\\"Mary said: \`See where my Mistress, the First Eve, is seated on her birth-stool under the palm-tree. The people are awaiting a great event, for the pangs are upon her.'\\"Swiftly, Jesus answered her: \`No, witch, that is not the First Eve: that is Deborah judging the Israelites under the palm-tree of Deborah. For so it is written.'\\" (p. 251)Denied political power, Jesus comes to see his Messiahship in a far more symbolic and important light: Rising beyond the flesh (the Female) and bringing an era of spiritual enlightenment that will free men and women from carnality and the snares of the flesh. Women aren't to be excluded from the Kingdom but they and men can only enter by denying the flesh - becoming neither male nor female.In reference to the Yahweh cult's accomodations with goddesses, there is a growing body of archeological evidence confirming it. The God of the Jews and the New Testament we're familiar with - alone, transcendant, omnipotent, etc. - wasn't created until the Deuteronomic reforms of King Josiah in the 7th century BC (The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts).Part three follows Jesus' ministry as he preaches to the Jews. Again Graves follows the traditional narrative on the surface but motivations are very different. From confidence in the success of his mission and the coming of the Kingdom, Jesus knows despair and realizes that he has failed - he tried to \\"hurry\\" God's dispensation, the sin of pride and presumption. He tries to redeem the situation by getting Judas (the most perceptive of the Apostles) to slay him as the traditional sacrifice but Judas doesn't want to kill Jesus, his friend and teacher, and betrays him to the Jewish authorities on the understanding that Jesus' supporters in the Sanhedrin (Pharisees, mostly) will save him. Again, plans go awry and it's a Sadducee-dominated quorum that turns him over to the Romans. Peter is Jesus' last hope but he can't understand what Jesus wants and uses his sword to try and defend him in the famous garden scene where he cuts off a soldier's ear. (Of course, it doesn't help that Jesus is less than straightforward in asking his disciples for help.)Hopefully, this barebones account of this remarkable book will encourage readers to check it out. Beyond its provocative subject matter, it's a good novel in its own right. And I'll take this opportunity to highly recommend Paula Frederickson's Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews: A Jewish Life and the Emergence of Christianity. It's a nonfictional perspective on \\"the greatest story ever told\\" that tries to make sense of Jesus' life in the context of 1st century Palestine and does so in a very persuasive argument."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Take any of his published works and there is no doubt that Robert Graves is a thorough scholar. King Jesus is unusual in that it is a novel filled with scholarly references from the canonical books of the Bible, Gnostic gospels, Apocryphia and Semitic mythology that tries to convince the reader of Grave's view of the significant relevance of the Triple Goddess mystery religion in the culture of ancient Israel.Following the theme set out in his work White Goddess, Graves retells the story of the gospel(s) with more than a little literary license I found both fun and interesting.It turns out that Christ's message was completely misinterpreted. And yet, in the end, Christ won in the sense that were it not for his death and resurrection and the subsequent growing popularity of his cult, we might be going to the sacred grove on Sundays to worship the Goddess instead of Church to worship the God.Despite some insightful gems such as &quot;The Three Marys&quot; -- WOW! I never realized the connection before! -- overall his thesis doesn't seem very convincing. Anyone who has read the Bible and standard Apocryphia cover to cover can see that there were clearly defined messages for both the Old and New Testaments that had nothing even remotely to do with Goddess worship. Moreover, his argument for a more prominent role of a matri-centric mystery cult in the patriarchal dominated culture of ancient Israel is very weak. Graves confuses the dualistic concepts of the Gnostics with Christ's goal of destroying the supposed feminine influence in Judaism.Still, it was a fun read if you don't take it too seriously"},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Robert Graves knew that the Gospels were essentially historical novels with a religious subject & themes. Like historical novels, they were a blend of history & myth, fact & fiction. But Graves' novel about Jesus is more than just another fairy tale or Homer's Illiad. It is a history of myth that explains in much detail the pagan origins of Christianity. However, the picture that Graves paints is different in detail from the picture of Jesus given to us by Pauline Christianity. Rather, Graves tries to give us a portrait of the Herodian era that existed before & during the life of Jesus. This was an era in which a pre-pharasaical, virulent, pagan-hating (despite it's own pagan roots), caste system of Judaic monotheism promoted a single, masculine, deity to the exclusion of all others (in particular, feminine deities) & was forced to accomodate the old paganism of the Greeks (which they tried to destroy, but failed) & the new paganism of the Romans (Greco/Roman) while under the control of an unpopular vassal state. It is a colonial Rome that became the protectors of this Gentile population which resented their forced Jewish conversion under the Maccabees & the Hasmonean Jews. Much of this Greek ethnic population, both pagan & converted, resided in protected areas directly administered by Rome called a decapolis where they could worship in freedom & prosper economically without being subject to second class status & Jewish religious authority which predominated in the Jewish tetrarchies. Hence, the narrator of the story, Agabus the Decapolitan, is a supposed metropolitan administrator for one of these \\"pagan\\" enclaves. Ironically, Jesus' ministry begins & grows in the decapolis around the Sea of Galilee where he is protected from rival Herodian rulers. But the rivalry, in question, stems from Jesus not only having been an ancestor of King David, on his mother's side, but also from having been born into the Herodian royal family & it's intrigues, on his father's side. In other words, Graves rejects the so called virgin birth of Jesus because the immaculate conception was a view that was not held by the early Jewish Christian followers of Jesus & his divinity was not \\"universally\\" proclaimed until the Roman Emperor Constantine & the Council of Nicea formulated the nature of that divinity, i.e. the Trinity (itself derived from Egyptian/Sumerian paganism & Greek metaphysical philosophy). This is essentially a book about the politics of religion. But it also tries to show the character of Jesus at the crossroads of the politics & religion, of his time. Jesus isn't just a Jewish scholar par excellence or a rabbi who's job (unlike the Sadducees) was to preach in synagogues set up to minister to those excluded from the temples, i.e. converts & patrilineal Jews (like Herod the Great). He is also a man on a mission with a rightful claim to being the high priest/king that is the Jewish, as opposed to the Christian, messiah who is \\"a\\" son of God & not \\"the\\" son of God & who's divinity is achieved through the inseparability of his word to his works & deeds."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Robert Graves provides an intriguing hypothesis about the background of Jesus. In order not to spoil the suspense, I will refrain from stating the core hypostheis. But he has provided a very interesting historical backdrop to make his idea plausible.

As a native of the region, I noticed that the pilgramige of the family from Egypt to jerusalem, passes - for some reasons - in Galeele, which is a detour of at least 200 miles. There is no merit in these writings, just some guy sitting in a library copying bits from various books, and probably just making up stuff. Jesus, one of Humanity's greatest spiritual teachers, is reduced by Graves to a mad librarian spuoting out page after page of the most ridiculous conjunctions of every bit of stale trivia you can imagine - most of which just don't make any sense.Graves must have been using a fualty translation of the Bible, because he keeps making mistakes in the meaning of certain words, on top of which he builds babilonian towers of misinterpretation. Except for a few sensational conjunctions, i don't feel that I've learned anything interesting or substantial about J.C., sorry.The only remedy, is to consider this text as purely fictitious, and even then it's cumbersome, with little story and long \\"theological\\" and pseudo-historic debate.It's a shame becuase Graves is a good writer.P.S. if I may be bold for a moment, and assume Graves position of dismantler of texts, I might suggest that the whole notion of J.C.'s kingdom is not an earthly one - but rather refers to a hightened state of spiritual development:\\"The Kingdom of God is within you\\""},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character.

As is often the case with Graves, it's clear that he's done a lot of serious research, and from there has gone off on his own curious tangents. (It looks like he got some material from Robert Eisler's book from the '20s, &quot;The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist&quot;). Graves's methods drive some scholars crazy, because they want a clear line drawn between the research and the tangents. &quot;King Jesus&quot; is clearly more propaganda for Graves's &quot;White Goddess&quot; theology, but as propaganda it's great fun. Indulge Graves early on in the book--material that may seem pointless eventually does inform what follows. With few exceptions, the book is sympathetic to Judaism, but the exceptions should not be read as anti-Semitism; rather, the reader should recognize that Graves is equally discriminatory towards all religions where they don't gibe with his White Goddess-ism."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Easy reading this ain't, especially while you're first trying to get into it, but it's hard to think of a more rewarding way to spend your time and intellectual effort.

Moreover despite Graves' atheism the novel remains utterly respectful of Jesus Christ. A riveting book with which I expect to bore my friends by quoting for probably the rest of my life."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Having grown up in an Episcopalian family in the Southeastern US, I am very familiar with Christ the Savior from St.John's gospel and the epistles of Paul. Graves offers the viewer two alternative interpreations of Jesus in his book,King Jesus. These two alternative views are based on Hebrew concepts of a political/military messiah and the mystery religion of the triple goddess, which requires the sacrifice of the goddess's consort to bless the land and people with his sacrificial blood. There is no doubt that these two world-views, religions, concepts were dominant in the Mediterranean Roman world. For example, St. Paul's epistles strongly condemn the mystery religions of the triple goddess, which he identies as Artemis (also known as Diana in Roman mythology).I realize that my many fundamentalists Christian friends would find this book disturbing but I would invite them to read this exceptional historic novel to gain more insight into the Hebrew concept of a worldly military messiah destined to overthrow Roman domination or the concept of the consort of the triple goddess, destined to be sacrificed for the well being of the land and people.First, the book is a political novel about the efforts of the Hebrew leadership to bring about the birth and development of a young man to be their military leader and savior. Jesus is the son of Mary and Herod's oldest son,Antipater, hidden in the home of Joseph until the time he will arise as the Hebrew ruler. Graves was a scholar of Hebrew religion and he brings his considerable knowledge of the Hebrew faith to the novel. Graves writes of a possible plot wherein the birth, schooling, and mentoring of Jesus were all part of a Hebrew plot to produce the Messiah that would defeat the Romans and bring about a Hebrew golden age of 1000 years.Second,the book is a novel about the struggle between the patriarchial religion of the Hebrews and the cult mystery religions of the triple goddess, or the white goddess. This ancient religion has as the central deity a female goddess who is mother/birth, wife/consort/fertility, and death/destroyer. Graves has Mary the mother of Jesus, his cousin Mary (sister of Martha and Lazarus), and Mary Magdalene playing these roles. However, in the religion of the triple goddess or white goddess, a male plays the role of son, husband, consort, king, and finally human sacrifice to this triple goddess. Graves has Jesus move from the role of warrior king of the Jews to sacrificial king through the novel. Whereas Mary the mother of Jesus is a player in the Hebrew plot to support Jesus as the military Messiah, his wife and cousin Mary asks him to use his powers to raise his cousin (her brother) Lazarus from the dead. Jesus does this act but because he must now offer God a life for a life, he must offer his own life for that of Lazarus. This puts Jesus directly in the power and plot of Mary Magdalene (the layer-out) who requires the sacrificial death of her husband/consort to bless the world and its people. Graves was probably the foremost expert on the religions of the triple goddess and his scholarship helps maintain the internal consistency of the novel.Finally, we are left with the question of whether Jesus' crucifixion was a triump of the feminist mystery religion of the triple goddess over the Hebrew messiah or whether Jesus' cruicifixion spelled the doom of the triple goddess as he emerges as the Christian savior.Graves, an expert on Hebrew religion and mythology, classical history and mythology, and the canonical gospels as well as the Gnostic gospels, is certainly the scholar best suited to try to bring all this together in a fascinating historic novel consistent with the society and theology of the times. Graves was a highly creative and independent thinker and I have no doubt that this book will disturb my fundamentalists Christian friends - none-the-less it is a wonderful description of the world into which Jesus was born and the two major east Mediteranean religious philosophies that competed with Christianity at the time of his death."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"King Jesus is pure historical romance, a prose masterpiece, a poetically allegorical phenomenon. Blow away the pussywillow's outer flowering and what you hold is the wish granting root and stem; eliminate the metaphor and symbol from the central principle of \\"King Jesus\\" and what you find is the actual entity of this heroic figure in Western art, philosophy and religion. I must admit I am a \\"Johnny come lately\\" to the wonders that is Jesus Christ. I am a Buddhist by faith, with a kind of theosophical attitude towards all religions; I have tried to appreciate the meaning and significance of Jesus over the years, reading Renan, Schweitzer, Steiner, and most recently A.N. Wilson. Robert Graves has existed in my pantheon of great writers since the late sixties. I read his translation of Apulieus, his poetry, and puzzled over the White Goddess for years. They say timing is everything when it comes to appreciating great literature or works of art. Now the time has come for me to recommend this exceptional literary gem. Anyone familiar enough with the author must note the liturgical thread running throughout his writings: Graves, the poet priest, so to speak, of the Goddess Isis. Here, in this novel, you get our savior, the Christ or \\"Chrestman,\\" in all the sacrificial and cocksure glory of Frazer, projected out of a chilling virtual reality, paying the ultimate price for all psychic sins and one sided human development. In this nightmare vision to the well known and often told tale, resplendent with a fervent reality beyond the dream within a dream, I find a most endearing and honorable person of rare and supremely authentic quality. Like one of those \\"prophetic birds\\" written of in The White Goddess, (c.f., P. 26), whose plumage is said to line her nest containing the \\"jawbones and entrails of poets,\\" King Jesus is an awesomely important tale to read and hear; as imperative, one could say, as the Mariner's recollection to the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's \\"Rime.\\" I hope you will find the time to read what this story has to say about the life and death of Western tradition's most important religious icon, King Jesus."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"The thesis of the book is really brilliant. How would an historian in the first centuries of the first millenium view the life of Jesus, the so called &quot;King Of The Jews&quot;? The act of imagination that Graves has taken is breath taking. He fleshes out most of the gaps and mysteries surrounding the Gospels, without attacking or defending Christianity. The book could have been a cringe inducing &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; but it is a great example of the historical novel."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Robert Graves' writings are all fascinating, but this one is unique.

Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the Gospels and so another version of events colored my own response. Perhaps it's because the telling was not as lively and personal as I Claudius. Still it is good to read this book and to get more information about the politics during the time of Jesus - as well as an understanding of the Jews and their politics and their expectations of the Messiah."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"in that King Jesus is certainly not a soap opera. Graves has constructed a well-researched and intriguing life of Christ on earth, which departs in many ways from the received tradition. An excellent book to give the brain cells a stretch of the legs: highly recommended"},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"Readers already familiar with Graves know that he brings a unique blend of scholarship, wit, literary talent, and profound sympathy to whatever subject matter he addresses himself. As in \\"I Claudius,\\" Graves is superbly deft at breathing life into the arcane, alien traditions and source materials that have come down to us from that time. Though best known as a classicist, Graves uses the story of Jesus to explore the themes and symbols of Judeo-Christian mythology. Characters familiar from \\"Claudius\\" appear in this tale as well (Augustus, Livia, Herod the Great), and through skilful manipulation of plot and dialogue Graves depicts Jewish tradition in a context of the mythical corpus prevalent at the time and known from Europe's Atlantic seabord to the fringes of India.Ever the independent thinker, Graves never shied away from controversy, and true to form he offers up an alternative, historically plausible view of Jesus' early life at odds with the official version that has come down to us. Whatever the shortcomings of his efforts, Graves has at least concocted a story that is consistent with our knowledge of society and theology of the time and actually explains elements of the tradition that otherwise defy logic.In fact, Graves is able to use this novel intelligently to explore and explain issues surrounding authorship, religious politics, and redaction in the Scriptures--normally the exclusive province of turgid academia--all in highly readable and readily understood style. It is a testament to his skill as an author and to his deeply humane worldview that Graves is able to challenge our distorted and obfuscated beliefs about Jesus even as he pays respect to the Master and reaffirms the significance of His ministry.Highly recommended to atheists, agnostics, and apostles alike."},{"Title":"King Jesus,","review":"It is doubtful if there is any man alive today who could write a book which equaled &quot;King Jesus&quot; asan intellectual virtuoso performance.

Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines. A masterpiece not only of economics, but of prose as well."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of the Nations is an outstanding work of one of the most important men of the social sciences, the father of economics, Adam Smith.Although the full work is included in this book, including the often forgotten last two books of the Wealth of Nations, this edition has no introduction, and its table of contents has numbers pointing to the wrong pages. In addition, this edition makes the book too large and thus very uncomfortable for the reader to hold while reading.I highly suggest reading the Wealth of Nations, but I also strongly suggest to avoid this edition.

There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about.

For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero.

So I had to resort to the usual CDs. This revealed an immediate shortcoming with Tantor's version. Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital).

It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;. However, as it was written for its own time, it refers tocontemporary events, people and nation-states, and that makes it hard for anyone but a history buff to understand many of Smith's points. Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star. However, the book deserves the other four stars for its remarkable clarity in destroying socialist arguments for the conscious ability of humanity to put the interest of the group ahead of their own."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The simple points upon which this book is based might be much easier to understand today than when it was written, because a large part of the growth of the world economy has been based on the ideas about the growth of capital which this book assumed as the fundamental surplus value of economic activity. Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it. This hardly makes more sense than those who expected seizure of everybody's major assets to solve society's problems."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"If you're wondering which Wealth of Nations to purchase, get the Bantam paperback.

In addition, the margin of the pages contain useful notes which summarize Smith's writing. For the price, this is clearly the superior choice.Now, if you're wondering whether you should undertake such an endeavor, let me just say that Adam Smith was a professor of rhetoric. He explains everything so precisely, yet so comprehensible. Smith's writing is by no means difficult; I actually found it a surprisingly easy read given its antique nature.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures. This book gives the motivation for many modern economic concepts that is often lost in mathematical formalism."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia. Hiswords facilitate skimming, something most readers ofthis thousand page book are apt to do. His words andphrases are also easily ignored. They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T. Grimes comments on the marginalia aswell.)Finally, reading The Wealth of Nations shows Smith tobe different from his usual portrayal. He can bewickedly satirical. Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version.

I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"The Wealth of Nations (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations) by Adam Smith.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"Adam Smith's WONs should be required reading / course work in high school.Long winded, yes, but also relevant.

That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers.

The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics. Brian Oley"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (The Harvard classics)","review":"I ordered this book for my son.
