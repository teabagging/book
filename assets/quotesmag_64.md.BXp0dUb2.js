However, if you are looking to really understand the structure and morphology of Biblical Hebrew, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"The explanations of hebrew grammar and sounds are much too difficult to understand in this \\"introduction\\". I spent more time trying to learn all of his transliterations and grammatical terms than I did actually learning the Hebrew. In fact, from the start in his sounds and spelling section he doesn't even give you the Hebrew characters! This might be all well and dandy if this was spanish or something but this is Biblical Hebrew, the main point is to be able to read and understand it instead of pronouncing it. I found that after a little study I could pronounce many things but I couldn't tell you how they looked on paper.&lt;"},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is the best learning grammar of Biblical Hebrew out there.

The shipping is a bit pricey but it's still less than half the price!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This is an excellent introductory textbook for &quot;serious&quot; study of Biblical Hebrew, and as such, one is required to have a solid background in Grammar."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"Thomas Lambdin's textbook of Biblical Hebrew was designed for college courses taught by a professor, not for self-study. Lambdin is thorough and detailed. The amount of detail at the beginning, particularly about the minute details of vowel points and vowel pronunciation, can seem overwhelming. If you're studying on your own, you have the luxury of not mastering all these details for a test before you proceed to the rest of the book. Just learn the basic \\"a, e, i, o, u\\" values of the vowel points and move on. Go back to study the finer details after you're more comfortable reading Hebrew.Since many people do use Lambdin's book to study Biblical Hebrew on their own, it is nice that a key to it has been published:Annotated Key to Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew. You may also find it helpful to use a much simpler introductory grammar. I personally likeA Modern Introduction to Biblical Hebrew, though many others are available as well.Lambdin's book was originally published as a large hardback book, with a font large enough to be easily read. The small paperback edition now more commonly available has shrunk the font so much it is hard to read the vowel points. If you can get hold of an old hardback, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"I have been studying Hebrew at both the undergraduate and graduate levels for three years, and Lambdin is by far the best introductory grammar I've come across. I used Lambdin in my first two years, but I have since read three other introductory Hebrew grammars (Seow, Pratico/Van Pelt, and Kelley). I must say that, while Lambdin is certainly more dense, one will have a MUCH better command of the basics of the language after completing this book than the others I've encountered. Other than for ease, I'm not sure why anyone would choose not to use Lambdin. Of course, if one is taking the easy route to language learning, one should probably not expect to actually learn the language."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"Great Service. Got the book quickly! Great book! Helpful with Hebrew Language class. Great book for understanding Hebrew language and its GUM!! It came highly recommended by my Hebrew teacher. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This course, as so many others have said, it an excellent course for Biblical Hebrew.The book is divided into a series of lessons, starting with easy grammar, and progressing into harder and harder grammar. And after about fifteen lessons you are given readings straight from the Bible. I love that fact that these readings are added in the book. Other textbooks in BH give you assigned readings, but assume you have a Hebrew Bible with you. It's nice to actually have all the assignments included in the text. And it's good to have actual texts rather then non-connected sentences. You, of course, still get these non-connected sentences too. And the vocabulary expected to be learned in each lesson is very manageable.The grammar explanations can get a bit technical, but I've had no problems understanding them. I don't think your typical lay-person would get lost if they word through the book at a nice, easy pace.Overall, this is a great standard in the study of Biblical Hebrew."},{"Title":"Introduction to Biblical Hebrew","review":"This book was highly recommended, so I got it.

Having worked through an Elementary Hebrew class, I am now able to wade through most of the bewildering density of this book, but even so I remain frustrated by inconsistent paradigm charts (verb tenses are shown in their typical 3rd-1st person order while pronomial endings are shown 1st-3rd; the infamous irregular verb &quot;to be&quot; isn't even given in its entirety) and the intrusive use of transliterations, sometimes even to the exclusion of the actual Hebrew. This is a dry, self-satisfied description of the Hebrew language which fails to engage the learner, manages to confuse the beginner, and completely misses the immediacy and excitement of the Hebrew Bible... which is, I believe, the whole point of learning this language."},{"Title":"A gallery of children,","review":"Definitely not just a children's book, it will appeal to the adult in each child and the child in each adult. The most interesting aspect is that each story was written about it's illustration, rather than the other way around. Le Mair's exquisite drawings and Milne's prose and poetry are so woven together that you find yourself flipping back and forth between them as you read.As with all Milne's stories and verse, these children are strong and independent. The last story, \\"Castles by the Sea\\", is politically correct enough to have been written today. Anyone who loves Milne should give these children a try."},{"Title":"A gallery of children,","review":"Published just after &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; and before &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, this book displays a transition in Milne's writing. Although the title would suggest it was written for children, it's probably more correct to say it was written for parents. The stories, while good, are not quite the exciting tales we might tell our children today, but have that distinct rhythm of Milne's that is very soothing and will aid in the children falling asleep. The joy is not so much in the stories themselves, but in the manner in which they are told.There are eleven stories in the book, and in several you can see the foundations for what would be the Pooh books. He often speaks in the first person, including himself as a character in the stories. In &quot;Miss Waterlow in Bed&quot;, we find a character that could easily be Pooh himself. And the real gem of the book is the last story, &quot;Castles By the Sea&quot;. Told partly in verse, and partly in prose, it's a fun tale that draws you in. Parents will enjoy getting into the role of the story teller for that one.Readers who only know the Pooh books might be disappointed in this book, but fans who have read and enjoyed Milne's other works will find this one very familiar and a welcome addition to their collection."},{"Title":"Contain Yourself: 101 Fresh Ideas for Fantastic Container Gardens","review":"Contain Yourself offers a clever way to teach gardeners to break out of the &quot;marigold/impatien&quot; cycle through creative &quot;recipes&quot; for container gardens featuring more color, height and texture than most novices are able to do on their own.By presenting the material in this fashion, Ouellet gives the reader the tools to ultimately be able to create his or her own container masterpieces by using portions of multiple recipes. In essence, the reader learns new techniques as the book progresses. Once the basic techniques are learned, gardeners should be able to design beautiful gardens on their own.The book includes care instructions for containers (which need more frequent watering than traditional gardens) and information on the growing habits of the plants used in the designs. While it's true that there is not a huge variety of containers used (as noted by another reviewer), how many households have endless supplies of different containers? I rather like the lesson taught that any one container may be used in many different ways.More seasoned gardeners might find the text and instruction somewhat remedial. Even so, it's a beautiful book with excellent content for anyone who wishes to learn more about expanding the horizons of traditional gardening."},{"Title":"Contain Yourself: 101 Fresh Ideas for Fantastic Container Gardens","review":"I'm not one of those gardeners who can spout off the botanical names of the plants.

Kerstin's book shows me what to do with all those cool new plants I've been seeing in the garden shops. My new favorites? Wave petunia, verbena, bidens, helichrysum and chalibrachoa (I'llhave to check my spelling on this one). It looks like a miniature petunia.

There are 101 &quot;recipes&quot; for pots, hanging baskets, and window boxes, with planting diagrams and care instructions. The recipes use plants I'd not seen before and use combinations of flowers, texture, and height to achieve their beauty.

The subtitle \\"101 fresh ideas for container gardens\\" is more specific, if rather unrealistic. I'll take the writer's word for it that there are 101 container gardens described in this book, but \\"fresh ideas\\" they are not. They feature fairly basic containers filled with the likes of petunias, verbena,and osteospermums, with a grass or phormium to give height and ivy, lotus vine or ajuga as a trailer. The result is the kind of thing you see on sale at Home Depot or one of the other big box retailers.Each \\"recipe\\" for a container design has a colour photo of the mature planting, a planting diagram and notes on the plants, containers and care.

It is chock full of history and at times reads more like a textbook than a novel, but as long as you're prepared for that, I found it very thought provoking and truly fascinating."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This was a book I enjoyed immensely, I enjoyed reading the facts and the author's idea of what happened. I have enjoyed reading many of Ms. Cornwell,s books including this one, but I am still not convinced that Walter Sickert was the Ripper. He may have murdered women and children, but does that mean he was the Ripper, I don't think so.He may be crazy and strange but a serial killer then why was he not included in any other book I have read?But that being said Ms.Cornwell has turned out another great storyline and wonderful characters."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Perhaps the reason for all the outrage against Cornwells' theory is because some of her critics on this work can't accept the notion that a well-known British artist could be Jack the Ripper. Absurd, right? Just like it's absurd that a well-known and (once) highly regarded NFL athlete could brutally commit a knife slaying of two people in L.A. That said, of course the evidence in the case is circumstantial. After a hundred years, what else could it be? But Cornwell puts together a compelling argument that involves more than hypotheticals. Her application of forensic testing as well as a ciminal profile, motivation for the crimes, background and psychological analysis of the suspect puts the pieces of the puzzle together in a clinical way for building a very plausible case. Cornwell has gone farther than any other investigative author in presenting a case for the identity of JTR. Could it be that Cornwell receives such criticism because her acumen as an investigator has stepped on some egos? Afterall, she can't possibly be the one to finally solve the Ripper Case, she's just a fiction writer and not a police detective or inspector, right? Maybe there are those who do not want the case solved. Maybe they prefer it to remain the stuff of mystery, with a multitude of suspects to dissect and no real face to name for the crimes. Let's not forget, that in all the hype and skullduggery, this was a real crime in which victims suffered horrible deaths. If nothing more, Cornwell deserves respect for her scientific and sobering approach in attempting to solve this century-old crime. CASE CLOSED."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although there may be holes in this publication, the writer did spend her own money, time and effort on the investigation.She had to make assumptions as the murdered cases happened so long ago. You have to pardon the DNA samples may be contaminated, the letters may be hoaxes, etc. One thing I did not like was that Cornwell should not make such a strong statement that Sickert was in fact the Ripper without the 100% evident.The book may not be a perfect or complete investigation but it certainly is a good reference."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book. I am an English teacher who loves to read about the macabre for entertainment. I have read many books on serial killers and forensic profiling, and very often feel let down; however, Patricia Cornwall's book satisfies the need to know on multiple levels. She covers motivation, childhood, forensics, and psychology. While I would love to have been able to get even more in-depth with details from Sikert's life (especially his early trauma) and linked it in more deatil to childhood psychology. ON the other hand,it is over one years old a cold case! Cornwall does a solid and resonable excavation of history, and she is always honest to offer up where her weak points are in the argument, as well as indicating where she is speculating. A truly interesting read for anyone who is fascinated by the criminal mind of a demon."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I listened to this in audio book format while I drove across country from NYC to LA. Excellent book... kept my interest, and presented a view of the Jack the Ripper myth I had never heard before. And, I think she is right.Excellent work for anyone who liked the movie &quot;From Hell&quot; or any other person interested in Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book reads more like an &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; on A&amp;E rather than a novel. I bought this for my wife - and she really enjoyed reading it. If you are interested in Jack the Ripper - and would like to read about specifics of the case - including autopsies, etc - this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Hmmmm. I doubt that the world will ever really know the truth about the Jack the Ripper case, especially since in the Green River Killer case, some experts such as former PI Joyce Spizer believe that the killings were the work of more than one murderer. Spizer specifically names Glen Rogers, \\"The Cross-Country Killer,\\" as a Green River suspect, and also, interestingly, the murderer of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, a hypothesis supported by Donald Freed's book on the OJ case. Spizer's assertion is bound to spark as much controversy as Cornwell's, although both experts' opinions should be given more weight because of their experience, Spizer as a PI and Cornwell as a forensic pathologist.Leaving aside the question of whether Cornwell is correct in fingering Walter Sickert as the 19th-century killer, I found her thought processes, her CSI-type investigation (and very human Sherlockian analyses) and her portrait of 19th-century London engrossing. There is a good deal of poetry in the treatment of a gruesome subject. Most affecting is the way that the poverty in London emerges as an even greater crime than the Ripper's butchery of women. Most serial killers follow a profile, with the exception of course of the DC snipers and Aillen Wuornos in which a prostitute, far from being a killer's victim, herself became the attacker. Serial killers like Glen Rogers do target \\"throwaway women,\\" who sadly still exist today, as alive and well in modern America as in 19th-century London.Cornwell's writing style is sensitive and masterly. I love the way that she takes an image from a chapter, for example, a dark lantern or three keys, and uses that as the chapter title. Her writing style is certainly vivid and evocative.Although I couldn't make up my mind whether Cornwell proved Sickert as the Jack the Ripper suspect, for me that wasn't the point. I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was an interesting read, but unfortunately does not by any means deserve to be the most widely read Ripper book. Her case is circumstantial at best. The problematic mtDNA evidence and links to numerous JtR letters that are undoubtedly frauds and the fact that Sickert may have been in France in September 1888 are all problems that would have to be dealt with much more seriously. I think it was a noble attempt, but her argument ultimately falls short. While it's not totally worthless, it is definitely not \\"case closed\\". One would be better served to read Begg's \\"JtR The Facts\\", or Sugden's \\"Complete History\\". For suspect oriented books, Fido or Evans & Gainey are much more worthwhile."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwall started the book questioning herself if this forensic investigation was worthy of her time and sweat.She was horrified yet facinated by the crimes of Jack the Ripper, and to be honest, I never knew the depth of his sickness and hatred against women. But women weren't his only victims, he killed young boys as well.Cornwall had a theory that Walter Richard Sickert was the one and only Jack the Ripper...by day, he was Dr. Jekyll and by darkness, he became the hideous Mr. Hide. Or was it the other way around?In either case, this book is a facinating glimpse into what life was like in London in the mid to late 1800's.She describes the country and paints a dark and dirty picture of it. Her descriptions are credible accounts of how life in polluted London must have been. The \\"Unfortunates,\\" are the women who were forced to live a life of the oldest profession. WOmen in those days had no rights at all, and could not own property. It was a death sentence to ever become divorced in Victorian society.Jack the Ripper preyed on these unfortunates, and his crimes were ghastly. Cornwall provides her theory that Walter Richard Sickert was the serial killer known as JTR, but since his remains were cremated, we will never know this as fact.Give the woman a break...all she has to go on is the saliva which was scraped from underneath an old postage stamp.Her theory is a sound one, the artist Walter R Sickert drew some unsettling and unsavory canvases. He was a sicko alright.Now, during the late 1880's, a man known as the Elephant Man lived in the same neighborhood where these henious crimes were being committed. Due to his otherworldy appearance and deformity, there were those who wrongly accused the EM about the crimes. He was innocent, he was locked up in hospital not to protect the neighborhood from him but rather, to protect him from the natives. People could be so cruel.Here's the irony -- the Elephant Man was horribly deformed all over his body due to some rare cellular pathology, but his manly parts were perfect.He could experience love and lust, but no woman could stomach looking at him or smelling him.He was truly a monster on the outside, but inside, he was a kind, intelligent person who experienced love.Compare him to Walter Sickert, the handsome artist who liked to draw fiendish portraits of mutilated women.He was handsome on the outside, all except for his genitalia.Cornwall explains in great detail the gruesome deformities that made it impossible for Sickert to consummate his love for women. That deformity drove him to extreme rage against women.Thus, inside, Sickert was a more terrible monster than the Elephant Man, because he lusted to kill.He lusted for blood of innocent victims. He was a killing type of monster who had a love for darkness and hideous thoughts.Cornwall was able to provide motive behind the Ripper's killing.There you have it....Cornwall painstakingly took many months to research this man of misery.She read countless letters of his, becuase Jack the Ripper loved to write and pen things down and he mailed alot of letters to Scotland Yard...mostly just to taunt them.All the brightest cops just couldn't put two and two together.Unfortunately for those women who were slashed by the Ripper, they could not be put together again ever again.It's a good book but got rather longish in the end.Still - a valiant effort written by a brilliant forensic scientist, Ms Patricia Cornwall."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I think the case was made that Walter Sickert wrote some, maybe all, of the &quot;Ripper Letters&quot;, and that some of his paintings reflect the Ripper's handiwork. However, I think that a defense attorney could make a good argument that Sickert was just an &quot;aficionado&quot;, a fan, a Rippermania groupie. Modern cases still attract such people, including those who &quot;confess&quot; to the crimes, as many of the Ripper letters did.I agree with most other reviewers that the book needed more editing. What a shame to put all that work and money into research and then to rush (so it seems) the account into print. Perhaps she feared that the meat of the story would scooped by the news media.I have read most of the theories on the identity of JTR, and hers is the most believable, but &quot;case closed&quot; is stretching it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is an excellent book. The author does an outstanding job at presenting the factual inforamtion she has found and explains at least some of the reason other theories are invalid."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As fascinating as they are to those of us interested in the subject, Ripper books tend to be the product of people who are better and more dedicated scholars than they are fluid and entertaining writers. This book turns the tables. The style is flashy US Crimewriter, and as a piece of page-turning hokum, it is successful.As mentioned in other reviews, Ms Cornwell is a crime novellist and so, by definition, has her bad guy from the beginning and shapes the suspect, story and the evidence to fit until a point is reached where the tale can be concluded. If there was an affliction someone could suffer, Sickert had it: If there was a dislike someone might harbour, Sickert hated it: If a man had been seen riding a bike backwards that evening, Sickert was the Kent and East Sussex backwards bikeriding champion of 1870. Piling-on unsubstantiated ideas does not make them facts by volume alone.No one doubts that forensic science is now 100, 1,000, 10,000 times more spohisticated than in 1888, but what's the point of repeating the obvious? The detectives and doctors did their best with what they had, in the face of something they had never encountered before. How long would detectives looking for the Beltway snipers have sought a 30-35 year old white loner in a van? The modern counterparts of Abberline and Co had no more idea, despite helicopters, profiling and all the money and science in the world and needed something to fall into their laps. In the sniper case, it did. In the Ripper case, it didn't.What have I learned from reading this book? That Sickert was an unpleasant piece of work, with any number of problems. There are plenty of art references that can tell us that he was moody, awkward, disturbingly complex, probably schizophrenic and maybe sociopathic. There is also plenty of reason to believe that he was capable of bombarding the police with crank mails, or nasty enough to insult people by editing their entries in a hotel guestbook. However, proving he was responsible for the letters, which are the only things to which the vaunted DNA evidence connects him, does not prove that he somehow made the vast leap from nuisance mail to Jack the Ripper.If she wasn't the person who came up with the disastrous \\"Case Closed\\" subtitle, Ms Cornwell should be readying a pink slip for the one who was."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There has been many final solutions and great mystory solved books about the infamous Victorian serial killer. And now we can add one more to the every growing books of authors who have clamed &quot;I solved the case of jack the ripper, I'm right and your wrong!&quot; The problem with these books is that they bend and twist the thruth of the case so that their person will be saucy jacky.Let me begin in all the things I found wrong in tis book. There is evendince that Walter Sickert was in France between August and Octobetr of 1888.And nobody can possibly write all those letters! Look at the differance in the handwritting!Patricia Cornwell's book failed to convince me that he was the killer, but I did get a good laugh out the weak evindice!Put this book were it belongs-in the trash bin."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After reading through the reviews here of people who \\"take issue\\" with the evidence, who say the author \\"hasn't proven\\" her case, who complain the book is \\"hard to follow,\\" and so on, perhaps a fair statement would be: WHAT A BUNCH OF WHINERS!The book was, in fact, well-written and not hard to follow at all. (If you want to know one of the key reasons the justice system is in shambles in this country, just remember that these kinds of you-owe-me-more-evidence-than-that people end up on juries).Poor Walter Sickert, his reputation maligned...those poor Sickert relatives...please. Cry me a river. Perhaps they can explain the DNA links, his writing Ripper letters to the police and media, the unholy resemblance between images he painted and some of the Ripper's victims, and how he told people he knew the Ripper's identity (but \\"forgetting\\" it later, despite his famed photographic memory). Take a look again at the dead faces of Annie Chapman and Catherine Eddows, and Sickert's paintings. WHAT PART OF THIS IS TOO HARD TO GRASP? Think about his Ripper Bedroom picture. (How would he know?) WHAT PART OF THIS DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?I don't even consider myself a Cornwell fan, having only read one of her prior fiction works. I do know she's done her homework here--and then some.Actually, there was a young man here in Colorado (Ft. Collins) who was tried and convicted of murdering a woman on seemingly less evidence that Cornwell has for Sickert. The young guy had \\"telegraphed\\" and \\"recounted\\" the crime with his drawings, even though there was no direct physical evidence against him. (Folks: When people draw pictures of victims and details that only a killer would know, who does that then make the killer?)Not to be rude or anything, but the maligning this book is taking is ridiculous. It's a good, solid (harrowing) read, and something history should remember."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Dont let the title fool you. The case is not solved. But a new light has been shone into it.In this book Patricia Cornwell does a brave thing: to try to solve a cold case from over a hundred years ago using modern criminal profiling and lessons learned from her work in forensics. I was so sure it would have its share of detractors and naysayers but that's what it takes to bring out such an audacious enterprise. The best this book does is add a very big, fat, likely suspect into the lineup.From what we know of modern serial killers with forensics character profiling, Jack the Ripper was very smart, definitely had a huge chip on his shoulder, enjoyed the killing and planned for them (which means he is remorseless), flamboyant, extremely narcissistic and WAS NEVER CAUGHT.I really loved how Ms. Cornwell gets into detail about the letters. I love too the fact that the letters have been judged a hoax over a hundred years ago with the same sharp astute judgment that failed to solve the case. If the enterprise was a disastrous failure with Scotland Yard as prototype of the Keystone Cops why would the fact that the letters be judged as hoaxes pull any weight now? It was judged by people who were experts of the 1880's which in today's world means zip.Yes I believe that artists can be ambidextrous, disguise their penmanship and write 'in-character' because I am such a person (it helps too if one is multi-lingual).I appreciate how Ms. Cornwell starts from scratch and looks for the narcissistic killer's urge to be involved, to mislead and be 'admired' by writing such letters. This part of her investigation impressed me the most.The DNA part I wasn't too optimistic would yield anything.It must have been quite a rush to the senses in those days to be covered by the press on that level.In every killing he became bolder to heighten the sensual enjoyment. Jack the Ripper was following the template of the modern serial killer except he was ahead of his time. Ms. Cornwell travels the mind of the killer from accounts of his childhood to the dark sexual frustrations of a man with a huge grudge on women and prostitution. She uses the familiar map for serial killers that keep the facade of their normal lives to walk down the dark alleys of his psyche.All-in-all the book was good read. It's a very brave thesis to present but definitely offers more than the other theories. We've heard them all: the Royal Surgeon, the Freemasons, Prince Albert Victor, Kosminsky the butcher and every other wild theory. Most of them are theories too but they rest on nothing the more seasoned serial-killer enthusiasts can believe.I invite everyone to read it but not to think the the case is solved as the titles says. In conclusion I wonder how this nutcase-painter-suspect slipped through the net."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I thought this was well done. The author proves rather well the guilt of a very very ugly and dispicable person."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell has taken a beating from some corners over the theory she proposes in this book, and yes her claims are a theory. But a theory as plausible as the majority of those out there as to the identity of Jack the Ripper.The book is well written and Ms. Cornwell backs up her claims with a lot of circumstantial evidence and coincidences about Sickert. But over a hundred years since the murders, what else is there but circumstantial evidence ?The detractors of Cornwell's theories can scoff at her evidence, but this does not detract from the possibility of Sickert being a stronger than average plausible suspect. And Corwell does a great job presenting her case in a fascinating manner. Alas, there will never be a \\"smoking gun\\" found in the Ripper case, but Cornwell's presentation is as close as one will get."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I loved reading this book.

But this Cornwell book was one big disappointment. Not only did she fail miserably to make a convincing argument for her theory on Jack the Ripper, she did it in the most tedious and boring way. Arrrrgh. Of all the &quot;candidates&quot; for Jack the Ripper, her theory is the weakest and certainly not up to the investigative work she writes into her fictional Kay Scarpetta. I have always enjoyed Ms. Cronwell's books, but this one goes back on the market. What a waste.If you want to read a more compelling and convincing theory, pick up The Diary of Jack the Ripper by Maybrick."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is just the book for a avid mystery reader. Ms. Cornwell definately makes her point of who the probable \\"Jack the Ripper\\" was. The details of that era, the murders, & the clues to solving this 100 year puzzle are very vivid & interesting. A book you will not want to put down."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"My, how we loathe to surrender our myths. If GOD were to drop down and reveal personally the identity of Jack the Ripper to our multitudes, it's quite doubtful even then that any sort of contentment would overtake the bleating throngs of Ripper-chasers. In any case, a few points:For one, \\"circumstantial evidence\\" does not carry the flimsy, pejorative connotation within the justice system that it does among the general population. As other reviewers have pointed out, very strong legal cases can be made (and are, routinely) on the basis of \\"circumstantial evidence.\\" In fact, the circumstantial can be considered stronger even than some types of direct evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, which have been much studied and found to be notoriously unreliable. As an astute reader will notice, Cornwell is smartly careful to qualify, quite meticulously, the recorded statements of eyewitnesses.And even such things as fingerprints and DNA can fall into the realm of the circumstantial--if, for instance, a suspect's presence is verified by prints but time-frame is critical and cannot be ascertained. Additionally, circumstantial evidence in the form of, for example, the \\"ha ha's\\" in various Ripper letters is actually quite significant stuff. The fact that, in the cultural and historical context of Cornwell's focus, the expression was an American linguistic convention but not a British one is just the sort of \\"circumstantial\\" oddity that should solicit serious investigative attention.And Cornwell's tentativeness--her \\"maybes\\" \\"perhapses\\" and \\"possiblys\\" that are curling the nose hairs of so many of her detractors here--are actually the requisite marks of a judicious investigator. As Cornwell herself points out to the reader, even forensic experts discussing DNA results make a deliberate practice of doing so only in terms of probabilities, even when the experts themselves consider the results conclusive or damning. This is convention, and it's fully necessary and appropriate. Anyone trotting among the educated while spouting brazen absolutes is inviting a precious beating, and Cornwell is plenty smart enough to know this. Incidentally, even the phrase \\"case closed\\" does not out of necessity imply an absolute. Cases all over are routinely closed by all sorts of investigators and legal types, for all sorts of reasons, including the gathering of evidence that is convincing EVEN WHILE IMPERFECT. Hey, present-day Scotland Yard is impressed with Cornwell's analysis. Not too shabby.The weakest part of Cornwell's otherwise compelling argument is her very Freudian explanation for Sickert's murderous exploits (i.e. the potentially deformed and butchered penis). Rather than venturing into that ever-suspect, murky territory, she could have skipped over the issue of motivation entirely. Most people sufficiently knowledgeable about psychopathy, as Cornwell clearly is--and I am referring here to psychopathy in the clinical, DSM IV sense of the term (as opposed to the popular, oft-misguided Hollywood rendition)--understand that, ultimately, motivation for the abhorrent behavior of psychopaths is rather beside the point. Their compulsive, obsessive, destructive penchants are inborn and do not necessarily correlate with any external factor or event. Some psychopaths have experienced violent, abusive childhoods, but many have not. Some engage in violent behavior, and some do not. Cornwell provides a particularly good description of psychopathic characteristics in general. And current research into the brain function of psychopaths is, in fact, beginning to reveal distinct organic neurological abnormalities that probably have a genetic basis. In other words, it's looking more and more to be the case that psychopaths are not made by bad parents, but that, in fact, they are born.But as non-psychopathic people, the rest of us nearly always want to have clear, plausible antecedents--explanations--for horrific things to which we simply cannot relate. And this is why, one could readily suppose, Cornwell cannot really be faulted for feeling compelled to provide an identifiable motive. We don't want to believe that someone like Walter Sickert was simply born without the neurological foundation for a conscience, an unpreventable and incomprehensible deficit that led him to mutilate people for no other reason than that his talented-but-nevertheless-damaged brain was chemically stimulated and gratified by his acts. Admittedly, one could read every last scrap of text depicting the psychopathic nature and--lacking personal, face-to-face experience with one of these inscrutable beasts--still fail profoundly to \\"appreciate\\" what psychopathy actually is: evil without a sponsor. Really, it most likely runs no deeper than the entropic, frenetic looping of electricity among faulty neural pathways. This is huge, and it holds dire implications--for both the legal system in particular and for society in general. In a very fundamental and real way, psychopaths are not human.And the structure of the text, clearly problematic for many readers (though not this one), seems--more than anything else--a complex side-effect of the need to wrangle and weave multiple, \\"swim-lane\\" chronologies into a single stretch of fabric. No mean feat, and Cornwell pulls it off laudably. The alleged \\"tangential\\" and \\"boring\\" excursions are interesting at worst and necessary at best. We are, after all, concerning ourselves with intricate events dated over a century ago. And far more remarkable than the evidence missing from Cornwell's study is the amount that was still available! With all of the various documents providing rare insight into Walter Sickert's character and whereabouts--and there are a lot! (all duly cited in the back of the text)--the presiding fact that none has yet to render Cornwell's suppositions implausible is far more impressive than critics would have us believe. And, finally, as to the charges that Cornwell demonstrates some incriminating bias by announcing her suspect-of-choice in the beginning of her book: well, duh. Her thesis is that Walter Sickert committed the long-unsolved atrocities. She then proceeds to tell us why she thinks this. This approach is fully customary._Portrait of a Killer_ is an exhaustively researched effort and is overwhelmingly deserving of attention. A smart, solidly respected author has staked her very reputation on it, and she has not appeared to do so foolishly. Time to give up the ghost, me thinks."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Patricia has got the right person, I believe. She just doesn't have enough proof to conclude her case.I have read many books and articles, and watched numerous crime programmes that deal with forensics and in particular, criminal Profiling. Indeed, this book refers to one particular trait of this type of Killer that made an impression on me with regard to solving the ripper case: trophy taking.We know that body parts were removed in certain of the killings. As Patricia shows, Sickert was a very intelligent man and we would never expect him to be foolish enough to keep tangible proof that would link him to the crimes, not even at the turn of the 20th century. He was brazen enough to create artwork that \\"explored\\" the killings in a way that he could easily explain away as professional curiosity if he was ever confronted. I believe Patricia needs to look deeper at his art - indeed, within his art, when (or if) this book is updated.Ancient Egypt could be the final link for Patricia to prove Sickert was the killer.Did you know that in Europe - from the middle ages until late Victorian times - the remains of ground up mummies were used for Fertiliser, fuel, medicinal purposes and, more interestingly, by artists, as paint pigment. I believe the name of the pigment was called \\"Mummeia\\", mummy brown, or something similar. I heard about the latter two uses on a late-night BBC radio 4 programme, last year. The programme claimed that many famous artists did use this particular pigment. Reference is also made in several books too, including: Colour: travels through the paintbox, by Victoria Finlay.Sickert almost certainly knew of this pigment and may even have used it himself.Moving on slightly, I believe it is perfectly feasible that Sickert could have created his own pigment in the same way, ie using dried-out, ground-up human remains (his trophies), rather than blood. That way he would be able to have his trophies around him, for him to enjoy, but with no risk of him being discovered. I don't know whether DNA is recoverable from this type of pigment, but if it is, Patricia's team might be able to match the DNA to the bodies that are buried in London. I know it is a long-shot, but it is a possible way to link the victims to Sickerts work: the work is his, he created it and perhaps he used his \\"tokens\\" within it? We know that not all the bodies had parts removed from them, so it should narrow the field down to a few potential DNA matches. Also, the date on a particular painting might have a relationship with a specific murder that was committed closely before the painting was produced. At the very least, Patricia might be able to show that there are human remains in his work, something else to add to the \\"circumstantial\\" evidence against Sickert."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Even though the writing style seems a bit unorganized, I found the actual information very interesting. Cornwell uses every scrap of evidence possible building her case to prove that the artist, Walter Sickert, was Jack the Ripper. I was very impressed by the obvious energy spent in researching all the finer details, such as, the water marks found on the various papers, details in Sickert's paintings, and outlining what facts would have been brought into focus back in that point in time. And while most won't be happy until a bloody knife is found, I do believe this book is worthy of serious review."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's novels, but this book is boring! It's page after page of conjecture, no suspense, no pacing, no interesting characters. It reads like a college term paper. Frankly I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I think the quality of this book depends on what one expects from it. Some like pure facts, others like the entertainment. I belong to the second group. What Cornwell certainly succeeds with is to bring alive the life and fears of those \\"Unfortunates\\" who lived in the poor quarters of London in the 19th century and who became the victims of Jack the Ripper. The book also gives interesting details on how the police worked in those days. But most of all, it digs into the mind of Walter Sickert, the man who is believed to be the murderer. It's altogether a very fascinating book. I couldn't put it away. And I do feel convinced that it was Sickert who was Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It seems as if Patricia Cornwell tried her best to slove the case of Jack the Ripper, but something stood in her way: the complete lack of evidence. Cornwell only has to go on astounding coincidences and assumptions. There are many passages in this book which state that there's no evidence to suggest that Walter Sickert was or did something, but there's no evidence to suggest that he DIDN'T. This becomes a little presumptuous and slightly annoying. The same rule could apply to anyone: There's no evidence that says that Abraham Lincoln was in London at the time of the Ripper murders, but there's no evidence that says that he WASN'T.There is really not enough evidence to accuse one specific individual of being Jack the Ripper. Which is why the case continues to mystify and bewilder us. Cornwell seems to believe that Sickert wrote a staggering majority of the Ripper letters sent to the police, which I cannot believe. Perhaps Sickert had visited all of the places where the letters came from, but I didn't find it convincing that he traveled all over England, Wales, Scotland, and even France in one day.Cornwell makes a noble effort though. She invested much of her own money (not to mention time) into this investigation. She does extensive research on the Ripper letters, and connects a few drawings to similar ones that Sickert did in his time as an artist. There are points in this book where I thought, &quot;Yes, Sickert COULD be Jack the Ripper.&quot; But I never thought, &quot;Yes, Sickert was, without a doubt, Jack the Ripper.&quot;Another bothersome aspect of this book is it's complete lack of choronology. Before Cornwell even begins to write about Mary Kelly (the last victim of the Ripper), she has already gone on for many pages about murders that took place in 1907 (Mary Kelly was murdered in 1888).I read this book simply because I am fascinated by Jack the Ripper. And it is a good read. Cornwell brings to light many facts about the murders that I had never heard of. But did she convince me that Sickert was, in fact, the Ripper? No. Perhaps she should not have titled this book &quot;Case Closed.&quot; The case is still, and forever will be, unsolved. That is the grotesque beauty and wonder of the Jack the Ripper murders."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Noted artist Walter Richard Sickert (1860-1942) was Jack the Ripper. That's the position taken by author Patricia Cornwell in the first 20 pages of PORTRAIT OF A KILLER. She then goes another 341 pages to prove the point.Cornwell, otherwise known for her crime novels, has penned an exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, investigation of the Jack the Ripper murders, which took place in London's East End in 1888. Since the premise of the narrative is that the Ripper was the renowned, German-born, English artist William Sickert, it's also an examination of that man's life, art and presumed psychology. Not to put too fine a point on it, he was a real whack-job. Certifiably psychopathic. Early on, the author asserts that Sickert's rage against the prostitutes he butchered stemmed from a physical inability to have sex, a condition resulting from several (botched) surgeries he endured as a 5-year old to correct congenitally malformed genitalia. Yup, I suspect that would do it.Cornwell details everything you ever wanted to know about the five murders traditionally attributed to the Ripper: the victims (Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddows, Kelly), the East End environment, the crime scenes, the condition of the corpses as found, and the autopsies. As background, she describes the state of the metropolitan police force of the time, and the reasons it was ill-equipped to find a serial killer, particularly Sickert. Of course, she also reconstructs the artist's erratic and eccentric London lifestyle that caused him to roam the East End, utilizing skills at disguise learned as an actor, in search of victims. Casting her investigative net wider, the author establishes links between Sickert and many of the more than 200 so-called Ripper Letters mailed to the police and newspapers during the period of the murders and the years immediately following. Furthermore, she notes details in Sickert's own paintings and drawings that suggest an up-close and personal familiarity with each individual homicide. He had to have been there. According to Scotland Yard, the circumstantial evidence compiled by Cornwell would be sufficient to place before the crown prosecutor.Cornwell also makes the case that Sickert continued his slaughters (beyond the traditional five) up to as late as 1907.Since the conclusion of PORTRAIT OF A KILLER is foregone, the author leaves the most hideous of the Ripper's killings, that of Mary Kelly, until last. Cornwell doesn't specifically say so, but perhaps this was the most gruesome because Sickert was indoors and safe from interruption rather than on exposed streets as with the previous four. He had the luxury of time and privacy to give full vent to his fury. It's a horrific vision.Though there's no evidence that Sickert ever had a child - certainly consistent with the hypothesis that he was physically unable to engage in normal sex - a story persists that he had an illegitimate son by a Frenchwoman. This is a loose end in Cornwell's narrative - one apparently beyond her ability to resolve at this late date. (Remember, it's her assertion that Sickert's inability to perform sexually was at the root of his violent frenzies.) Otherwise, PORTRAIT OF A KILLER, with its three useful sections of photographs, is a compelling and convincing indictment of the artist, and a must-read for Jack the Ripper obsessives and fans of Patricia Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Portrait of a Killer, I've been interested in Jack the Ripper since a trip to England and read some other works about him, mostly just this-is-what-happened casebooks. But this book was awful. The author blatently states that &quot;Ripperology&quot; is just something she picked up one day and decided to write a book on, and she didn't seem to to a very good job getting her research on the cases and the theory she has. After reading the speculations of Ripperologists, much more creative, I found her speculations boring, and it was the same old thing over and over again for pages, just &quot;look at the watermarks! Look at his pictures!&quot; This was the only real evidence the author had. This book was very boring. If you want a good read on Jack the Ripper try Donald Rumbelow's The Complete Jack the Ripper, it's a much better read and better written as well. Save your money on this one."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I saw the title \\"Case Closed,\\" and thought that no one in their right mind, especially someone with a reputation such as Patricia Cornwell's, would make such a claim unless they had the goods. Wrong! As I read, I kept waiting for something, *anything,* in the way of good evidence, to show up in those pages. Even though nothing ever did, I kept pushing through, since I had spent good money and didn't want to think I'd been snookered.The denoument for me came when I got to the handwriting samples. Having read a little on handwriting analysis, I had a good time comparing the writing of Sickert with the other alleged \\"Ripper\\" letters. The little details you look for in handwriting - letter endings, \\"i\\" dotting, \\"t\\" crossing, fullness/height/shape of letters - were so different as to be startling obvious. I'd been taken! I immediately came to Amazon to check out the reviews (I'm assuming there were none when I bought the book, as I would have avoided it like the plague if I had read reviews such as these), and was both sickened and satisfied to see that I had been right all along about how nonexistent a case Ms. Cornwell had against Mr. Sickert.Thank goodness for the wonderful people at Amazon, and their generous return policy! I wrapped that book up quicker than you could spit, and sent it back (in pristine condition, I might add :-), and will get a much *better* book the next time around (I'm thinking of \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Handwriting Analysis :-J)."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I agree with the reviewers who suggest that this is a hotch potch of unsubstantiated rumour and innuendo. I found nothing in this book that was compelling evidence to prove Sickert was the Ripper. It's totally cirmustantial evidence when you do away with the so-called DNA evidence.Ms Cornwall should be ashamed of herself for putting out this farrago of rubbish and in the messy and unconvincing form that she has. It may well be that Sickert was the Ripper. And I'm inclined to think he's the most likely suspect. But the case would have been better put together and argued by someone like Vince Bugliosi (he of the wonderful &quot;Helter Skeleter&quot; and &quot;The Sea Will Tell&quot; -- both highly recommended true crime stories). She should stick to fiction.BTW: I too was a little annoyed at the &quot;Case Closed&quot; subtitle to her book; hers is in no way a watertight proof of Sickert as Ripper.BTW2: I too did enjoy the parts describing Victorian London, though even in those she often descends into use of adjectives with at time inappropriate value judgements."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"&quot;Who is Jack the Ripper?&quot;: the greatest true crime mystery ever, and this book tries to convince the reader that the mystery has been solved. Quite a persuasive case is made that Sickert is the fiend who haunted Whitechapel. More than anything, his violent paintings and drawings are the most persuasive evidence, one is even titled &quot;Jack the Ripper's Bedroom&quot;. More conclusive DNA evidence would have thoroughly swayed me to the author's opinion. I have always loved to read any material related to the Ripper, so of course this book was a must. I still prefer to believe that conclusive evidence of who the Ripper really was has either never existed, or has been destroyed, either by time or by choice."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms Cornwell's novels are interesting if you have an interest in forensic science and detective novels. They appear to be well researched and flow smoothly which brings about a pleasent read. After reading Portrait of a Killer though, it is my conclusion that Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction. I have no doubt that she investigated the case thuroughly, but her narrative is confusing and unorganized; I can't believe an editor let this fly. I think that a plausable case against Mr Sickert could be made with the &quot;evedence&quot; that Ms Cornwell presents but it is doubtful that she would be able to convince a jury simply because everything seems to be out of order.Ripper buffs may get a kick out of her take on the facts."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'll have to join the chorus of others who have already made the point that, while interesting, Ms. Cornwell's book falls far short of &quot;closing the case&quot; on the Ripper murders. She makes some interesting points, but relies far too much on coincidences, similarities, and &quot;well it _could_ have happened like this.&quot;For me, by far the most interesting aspect of the book was its description of the living conditions in the poorer parts of London in the 1880s. Life was truly &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot; for the lower classes in England then, and their suspicion -- even hatred -- of the police certainly contributed to the slipshod investigation of the crimes. The primitive forensic tools of that era didn't help either!So, overall, I'd give the book a marginal &quot;thumbs up&quot; -- but with the caveats already noted."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's recently released Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper Case Closed claims to have brought closure to the century old Jack the Ripper murders. She stakes her claim on the innumerable number of \\"coincidences\\" tying Jack the Ripper to Walter Sickert, a famous British painter. She applies modern forensics, psychological profiling, and DNA sampling to once and for all resolve the identity of Whitechapel's infamous butcher.Throughout the book, Cornwell's talents as a best-selling fiction writer are evident. Her descriptions of 19th century culture and forensic technology are extraordinarily vivid, with a rich, story-like detail throughout. Biographical sketches, the biting taunts of the Ripper letters, and eye-witness accounts are impressively presented and bring to life the circumstances surrounding the crimes. But little is offered that will supplant a host of other theories on the actual identity of Ripper. Cornwell's logic is faulty and at times self-contradicting. Oversights are common and alternative scenarios that point away from Sickert are either unmentioned or ignored. Contrary evidence is manipulated until it somehow points back to Sickert, and the validity of every point hinges on a profane number of conjectures and speculations, few of which are supported by a single scrap of evidence."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If someone were to ask me what this book was about I'd say it was about Jack the Ripper, his victims and how he did his dirty & evil deeds. It is an intriguing book that takes you through foggy streets of the infamous Whitechapel district. It paints a sinister portrait of Jack the Ripper by including letters & excerpts from the time of the murders. A Ripper fan will very much appreciate the ambiance of the book & all the facts that accompany the actual murders. As for the fact that Walter Sickert is indeed Jack the Ripper, this is most definately the author's opinion. Could Sickert be Jack the Ripper? Yes, he could. But anyone else could have been him too. Just because a man is a bit strange, dark & bizarre & happens to live in London during the times of the Ripper murdersdoes not make him the Ripper. Yes, I agree some things do match up and he would give some people reasons to beleive so, but there is still the lack of any real evidence besides the author's opinion that she knows who the Ripper was.

I have not read any other &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; books, because none appeared to be more than intellectual rhetoric and conjecture.Through the frenzied prose, one can tell that Cornwell not only studied the Ripper, but has truly vested herself in finding the truth. She has brought together a collection of research never studied by one person, and added scientific testing (including DNA) to further her cause.The only warning I have is that the subject matter is dark. You may have read true crime before, watched the Sopranos, and seen shows about the Ripper on the History Channel, as I have. The depths of depravity that Cornwell's suspect is purported to have sunk will still amaze and horrify you. There were evenings where I could not sleep because my heart was racing and my stomach was churning from disgust over the atrocities that were committed not only in the Ripper murders, but several other murders that Cornwell alludes may have been caused by her suspect.Despite the gore, I couldn't put it down.

I also found that her determination in presenting Sickert as the only possible killer and nothing could deter her from that idea (even the facts) to be annoying, frustrating, and slanted to her views.

Then again, I doubt that enough evidence even still exists to convict anyone of these crimes.Sickert is definately someone ripperologists should give a closer look.Her evidence (or lack of) aside, Portrait of a Killer offers a rare view into the underbelly of Victorian England and a fairly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Let me start by saying I was a big Cornwell fan for a couple of her books, but decided her fiction was a little dark and her protagonist self-righteous and unsympathetic. I've continued to read her books hoping that she'll temper her holier-than-thou narrative style. Thus the purchase of this book.&quot;She doesn't fail to disappoint&quot; comes to mind.Her narrative here is disjointed, she has no definitive conclusions and page after page of speculation. There were times I had to check the page numbers to make sure I hadn't skipped a page. Could she be absolutely correct in her assumptions? You betcha. Does she &quot;close the case&quot;? You decide -- but don't buy this book, just borrow one from someone who's pitching it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I almost didn't get this book because of the bad reviews. Mrs. Cornwell did a good job in telling her story and in giving her views. I think she has proved that Sickert probably sent several of the ripper letters. However, sending a letter and taunting the police seems like a sick joke Sickert would enjoy playing. As far as him being the Ripper that's a joke. I suggest picking this book up if you can get it for a buck or two. However, if your wanting the straight story you won't find a better book than - The Complete History of Jack The Ripper by Philip Sugden. By the way, Mrs. Cornwall has been buying Sickerts paintings. If she can make people believe this man was Jack the Ripper - what an investment."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When admitting that her assumptions are in no way demonstrable as fact, Cornwell puts the word &quot;proof&quot; in quotation marks (p. 192) &quot;Proof&quot; therefore becomes questionable, as in 'so-called-proof.' As in 'let's not allow PROOF to get in the way of a good story.' She doesn't. I believe the well-intentioned author could have saved herself some embarrassment by reviewing some of the Ripper books published over the years. Anyone can marshall this mess of evidence to convict their favorite suspect. She's just the latest (and perhaps most arrogant)."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After reading the book and seeing a TV special (starring, of course, Ms. Cornwell), it is with deep regret that I must relegate both the book and the theory of Sickert as the Ripper to the scrap heap. She has committed the greatest sin of the true investigator, as pointed out by the fictional Sherlock Holmes. Instead of letting the clues lead her to a suspect, she starts out with an alleged perpetrator and then goes digging to find &quot;facts&quot; to support her case.It is true that some of Sickert's work seems to show a startling propensity to portray women in deathlike poses very similar to some of the victims, as well as making references to the Ripper. However, it apparently never entered the author's mind that Sickert may have been inspired by the Ripper's handiwork,and chose to use these horrid events as subjects for his work. And what is so strange about asking permission to go inside and sketch the interior of Mary Kelly's abode? Instead of assuming that he wished to re-visit the scene of his crime and/or flaunt his work in front of the police, it may be that, like a modern photographer, he wanted to obtain material to portray the latest ravages of this killer.This analysis could go on and on, with Ms. Cornwell ignoring anything that did not fit in with her belief in his guilt. Apparently Sickert's genital deformity was not so great that he could not father children, but the author chooses to downplay the fact he had a son. Sickert was also in France during part of the time of the murders, but again, this means nothing in her eyes. It is true that William Sickert had a dark side and some strange proclivities, but this does not make him a killer. Rather, it explains his fascination with the crimes.Finally, linking Sickert to any of the Ripper letters would only prove that he wrote at least one of them. However, the authenticity of all the letters remains in doubt, with only the &quot;From Hell&quot; missive POSSIBLY coming from the killer. Just as today, there are attention getters who want to taunt the police and have their fifteen minutes of fame.All the author has succeeded in doing is painting a very negative picture of a famous artist who had (and still maintains) a huge following of art lovers who are appreciative of his work and do not fancy the idea of a fiction writer blackening his name and memory.Even Conan Doyle could not solve real life crimes. Stick to fiction, Ms. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have read in the past a couple of books around JR and discover that pretty much everybody has been a suspect in this case at one point of another. Walter Sickert -Patricia's choice as JR is not a new suspect, simply there has not been anyone creating a convincing enough case around him.The incriminating evidence in this book is convincingly positioned and the profiling in Sickert's life fits the psyche of a pretty sick man. Nevertheless this case will never be closed.....For starts writers would not want to stop creating books on the subject, moreover hard core evidence is clearly lacking and it is just a matter of creating the right assumptions to arrive to the wrong suspect.The book is not bad...but is just another JR book....that's all."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book by Patricia Cornwell is quite a read; her conclusions are very interesting. However, we know her conclusions from the very beginning of the book as it appears that she has focused on her one suspect and one, alone. The fact is that there have been dozens of JtR suspects named in the past century, though a number of these are highly improbable as Ripper suspects. Little to no attention is paid to any other suspects, but her one. This book would have been more thorough, had she focused on some of the other logical suspects, besides this one. However, I give this four stars, despite all of these thing. Cornwell has spent a great deal of time and money in researching this book. Though very onsided, Cornwell's reasearch can be a very valuable tool in research for other Ripperologist and I give this book four stars for it's research reference value."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell may be a good writer, but after this venture it appears she should stick to fiction, not history.She makes an interesting THEORY for Walter Sickert being Jack the Ripper, but her book is filled with 'would of' and 'could of's' and unsupported presumptions, all no-no's for historians. Her book is mostly opinion and theory, not fact, unfortunatly she writes of her theories and possibilities as if they are fully supported Facts.Creating a theory based on spurious information and presenting it as a new POSSIBILITY is one thing, but to purport it as absolute fact is ludicrous, and definetly not the work of a historian, which is what she has done. She creates an interesting theory/possibility, but thats all, and the grounds for which she creates this theory are patchy. Quite frankly, she makes up excuses and theories as she goes along to support what are simply her beleifs. Quite often she places Sickert where, and doing, what she WANTS him to have been.This books is mostly her opinions and presumptions, not facts. Interesting theory, but bad history.To subtitle her book 'Jack the Ripper - case closed' is incredibly arrogant and unwarranted.Try 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' by Philip Sudgen for a Historian's work."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"im not going to write a long essay of why i dont like this book.though let me say i have read the other reviews both positive and negative.i urge any person who is using these reviews to influence your decision to read this book or not,to pay close attention to the negative reviews,because they provide important info for you........."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"One thing that Ms Cornwell has in her favor is that she is certainly qualified to evaluate the evidence forensically. I think she does make the following points1.) Sickert no doubt did write most if not all of the Ripper letters based on paper, ink, and watermark evidence, as well as the DNA evidence discovered. But why not prove it by exhuming Sickert's mother and comparing DNA?2.) The police COMMISSIONER, not the general force, was incompetent. Surely no policeman worthy of the title would destroy evidence as he did twice, once with the bloody trousers and once with the message in chalk which he wouldn't even allow to be photographed. I suspect he got his job based on who he was as opposed to whether or not he was the best man for the job.3.) The Ripper was NOT left-handed. This man had to disappear into the night, once within a few minutes of the police arriving on the scene. Could he have done this if he were covered in blood? i.e. worked from the front, left-handed? No. He worked from behind, right-handed, well out of the way of the spurting blood.The handwriting analysis, which Ms Cornwell seems to dismiss, certainly seems to be the same hand to me. But then again, I am hardly an expert on graphology.Does all of this prove Sickert's guilt? Not hardly. Just that he enjoyed deviling the police. Was he the Ripper? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But by definition of a serial killer, Martha Talbert may have been the first, but Mary Kelly was certainly not the last unless the Ripper died shortly after. They kill early in life and continue to do so until caught. Bottom line, Ms Cornwell, you need more evidence. But you could definitely be one the right trail...Quoth the Raven..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Somehow I expected more. Not that Ms Cornwell didn't put forth some convincing evidence, but the manner in which she rambled from topic to topic to topic and back again, and the defensive tone of some of her arguments bothered me. I found the narrative hard to follow at times, as it bounced from modern DNA testing to Sickert's personality flaws to watermarks on stationery and so on. It's true that writing convincing non-fiction and gripping fiction are two very different talents. Worth a read, but has its tedious moments."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am usually a big fan of Cornwell's; I have read all her Scarpetta novels and was looking forward to seeing the same page-turner writing applied to a real, historical case. I was sorely disappointed. _Portrait of a Killer_ was 400 pages of asides, with occasional installments of an interesting story that could have been told in 100. Perhaps a reader truly obsessed with the Ripper case would appreciate the extensive biographical information about Sickert's father-in-law and other quasi-relatives and the historical details about art exhibits, etc, during the time period of the killings. For most, it is too much detail and not relevant enough to hold a reader's attention. I finished the book, hoping for some suspense, but there was no climax. It seems that Cornwell was simply told that 400 pages was enough, so she stopped there. Thank goodness."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After Isle of Dogs which I pre-ordered, I will never buy Patricia Cornwell without checking it out in a bookstore first. I perused this book and decided against the purchase. I hope Patricia Cornwell will return to her fiction which I and my friends used to wait for with baited breath."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a Cornwell fan and having a moderate interest in the Ripper cases (sparked mainly by publicity for this book), I was looking forward to it's publication. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish what I felt was a poorly organized and hard to follow jumble of thoughts.I found the actual facts regarding the murders themselves slightly interesting and could even be convinced that Sickert was indeed the murder. But I felt as though I was reading a thesis written by someone half-heartedly.My advice to anyone interested in this book is to skip it. Save your money. I wish I would have. My advice to Cornwell... stick to Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I very much enjoyded reading &quot;Portrait of a Killer&quot; I did find one error in Patricia Cornwell's research. In her book, she states that John Merrick suffered from von Recklinghaus disease. This is otherwise known as Neurofibromatosis. Merrick did NOT have this disesase. He may have had Protias, or some disorder so far unique to him. A special on the Discovery channel thoughory explored this matter. It was a special I watched wtih great interest, as I have NF Type 1. A small detail, and one that certainly doesn't question the evidence compiled in a very compelling case agains Sickert. Still it is a detain she wove into her tapestry which is a lose thread. While pulling it may not effect thhe greater picture, it does make me question what other threads may be lose or missing that could unravel her case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The author is obviously convinced she has found the Ripper, but fails to provide the reader with an orderly presentation of the evidence. Her conclusions are not enough to win us over."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is a decent book and a solid theory for the Jack the Ripper murders...I disagree with her that Jack the Ripper's killings were much a fantasy, probably more to do with suffering than actual delight, which came out in art, then in murder and again in art. Also, she attempts to describe for us the thoughts of people living at that time and how they viewed prostitutes and how there was a certain double standard for sexual \\"thrill\\". Well, I doubt there were many male prostitutes at that time, so how can we compare or judge what must have been on their minds because she also admits those intimate opinions weren't printed or even discussed? She repeatedly mentions the \\"thrill\\" and details how ignorant we were medically at that time. A lot of social issues just seem pointless and largely presumptuous, trying to be salacious and always viewing the ripper case from a gender/sex aspect (part of which helps us see things from Sickert's mind, but it seems to be the whole of her psychology -- very limited), in Sickert's paintings that she sees only artless evidence detailed with Sickert's supposedly pure hatred. The book is fascinating in it's subjects, but largely artless itself.She writes everything so that it will remind us that she is an intellectual, feminist woman, the book also seems like it's written specifically for women, which may be a trait carried over from her fiction novels. She peppers her narrative with annoying phrases of the time like 'coppers' and 'boys in blue'. Some of her phrases are placed in brackets to mock what she perceives as strict beliefs or outdated morality, others are to assume an unconvincing character, acting as a tour guide. .... The ripper letters feature words that are poorly scrawled and decayed, unfortunately they are each undeciphered without captions, which would have done a world of good for each reader. The chapters are far from being chronological, this is refreshing and even suprising sometimes, but keeps us from getting a clear view of the man, I enjoyed the pleasant chapter titles.The accused is W. Sickert (an artist, and self-proclaimed \\"Nobody\\") who seemed to want to implicate Mr. Whistler in his Ripper letters, dropping Americanisms every chance he got including where they both worked, hoping for a chance for contact with the po-lice and maybe in the back of his mind, even hoping to be caught. Whistler wasn't accused and he married an actress Sickert had some interest in. One wonderful moment was the opportunity to contrast between Walter Sickert (Ripper) and Joseph Merrick (the Elephant Man). Merrick was intelligent but not intellectually arrogant, he was far more deformed than Walter, but without his bitterness, he was very loving and harmless and much more underestimated and respected. I found it interesting how his sister was probably made to refer to her brothers as \\"Walter and the Boys\\", it probably sowed in Walter Sickert a point of reference for women the rest of his life, I can think of an instance at least once where he took some revenge against her. Though Cornwell strangely decides to depict her as the one woman he could not manipulate or control, I think that's because she wanted to input a female heroine into all of the tragedy, as she already mentioned the time he easily forced her into enacting a humiliating play. Sickert began writing his name on paintings in many different ways, one of them was 'Sick'. In my opinion, the case is closed, at least for me. This book will quickly be outdone, but for now it's all we really have for the theory and I have to give credit to the author for that. I guess some people want to continue believing in 'the man that got away', this book shows us however, that he wasn't so lucky."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwall has certainly reviewed a lot of material in her investigation, but her presentation is so disorganized that it leaves the reader with only the confused knowledge that there is a tiny bit of forensic evidence (not conclusive) and a plethora of circumstantial evidence to support her \\"case\\". She quickly begins to sound like an overzealous lawyer trying to inundate the jury with a huge quantity of disjointed circumstantial evidence to cover the fact that there's very little hard evidence. It would have been more helpful to start with a summary biography of what is known about Walter Sickert including a chronology of where he was known to have lived and traveled (as well as times whereabouts unknown) and an overview of the body of work he produced (written and drawn) during those times. Following this with summary of the material reviewed for the case would have laid the framework for understanding the \\"evidence\\". Then present the evidence without digressing into long discourses on modern forensics that are more self-serving than helpful...her esteemed predecessors have already pointed out that contemporary standards in police detection and forensics were not highly evolved and repetition of these facts are not helpful to \\"solving\\" this case. The fact remains that it is still conjecture that modern forensics might have solved the case if available at the time.Perhaps the next breakthrough in forensics will solve the case. Its still open for now."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The book started off interesting enough, But the details and evidence linking W.R.S. to the crimes seem more than circumstantial to me, and as the book goes on the author fills the pages with uniteresting facts and life stories about people who have really no importance at all in the big picture. The thing that irritated me the most was how she compared crime scene investigation in that era to crime scene investigation now, I for one am aware that we've advanced considerably, Like I said earlier, there was alot &quot;page filling&quot; with unuseful information. I for one was not impressed nor do I believe the alleged and certainly unreliable police reports and eye- witness accounts documented over 100 years ago forming the basis of this book, It seems the documentation would have been unreliable even then.. There are some interesting things to consider in this book though, If you have any interest at all in &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; its worth the read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you want to get a flavor of what this book and its author are all about without having to purchase a copy, I encourage you to check your local television listings for the one-hour program (carried in our area by The Learning Channel) that chronicles the investigation by Ms Cornwell that is the basis of the book. (Unfortunately, I saw the program after buying the book.) I found the program, which appears to have been scripted by Ms Cornwell, to be an exercise in pretentiousness and self-promotion, revealing in the author an ego the size of Texas. Some of the program was simplistic: a forensic pathologist proclaiming that the wounds to a Ripper victim were more than what was necessary to kill and thus were meant to degrade the victim; a profiler ticking off obvious possible characteristics of such a killer. Some were pretentious: the author stating she felt an obligation to find justice for the Ripper's victims; the author driving up to her private jet in a high-dollar sports car. And some were risible. In one scene, Ms Cornwell's hired experts walk toward the camera shoulder-to-shoulder like gunslingers come to clean up a corrupt town - all that was missing was Elmer Bernstein's score to The Magnificent Seven. I laughed out loud. Much of this could have been forgiven had Ms Cornwell delivered on her claim to have solved the Ripper case, but she has not. What the author has done is to make a circumstantial case for Walter Sickert being the Ripper. The evidence, though circumstantial, moves the author to claim she is \\"100% certain\\" that Sickert is the Ripper. While Ms Cornwell's many fans may line up behind this conclusion, objective readers, and those who do not have six million in expenses to recoup, are more likely to conclude simply that Sickert merits inclusion in the cast of suspects."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was lead to believe this book would be worth a read, but having done so, I realize that my money was wasted. Ms. Cornwell is NOT a forensic scientist, as the jacket and reviews would have one believe. She worked in a forensic lab. Using that as a basis for schooling, I cannot wait until the janitor or plumber from the lab spews his solving of the infamous murders. She immediately starts the book off by stating that Sickert had sexual dysfunction. In no way does she prove this, its just her hunch. She then goes on a wild run about his art featuring death, etc. At the time he was an artist, an entire movement in the art world was rebelling against the Impressionists, though not one (Oscar Wilde included) was ever thought of as a murderer. This group actually studied death, murder and the like. Before you waste your money on this title, check into Patricia Cornwell's own history and her own involvement in the judicial system. Its good to know where an author spawns from."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've never read Patricia Cornwell's fiction, so I can't comment on her usual writing style. I can, however, tell you that \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is a disorganised mess that is a primer in how NOT to write non-fiction.Although I wouldn't say I'm a \\"Ripperologist\\", I've read a few other books on the subject; the main reason for writing a book of this sort is to convince the reader of the writer's point of view. Patricia Cornwell fails miserably in that aim. She doesn't fail due to lack of compelling evidence: what I was able to sift out of the miasma was as good as the evidence other writers have presented for their personal candidates. Where Cornwell loses the reader is her presentation.From page 1, she is stridently accusing Walter Sickert of being the Ripper. She assumes the reader is as familiar with who Walter Strickert was as she is, so she fails right from the beginning to give the reader a basic biography for her subject. Then, she fails to go over the history of the Ripper cases and the historical figures involved. Because Cornwell assumes the reader has a fairly extensive background on the subject, she jumps around in time, mentions people with no introduction or explanation of their role in the history, and fails to give basic references or citations for facts and opinions she relies upon.A good example of this is Sickert's first wife, Ellen. Approximately 100 pg into \\"Portrait of a Killer\\", the only coherent biography we have been given on Walter Sickert is that of his childhood. While discussing the 2nd murder attributed to the Ripper, Cornwell suddenly mentions Ellen in the context of people she introduced Sickert to. The reader has NO IDEA when Sickert met Ellen, how they married, how long they'd been married at the time of the murders; as a matter of fact, this reader would have had no way of knowing who \\"Ellen\\" was except that she is mentioned in the caption of one of the pictures included!Cornwell uses Sickert's acting career as a constant basis for assumption that he was able to effectively disguise himself and thus escape detection whilst committing the murders. Yet she never gives the reader any coherent idea of what that acting career consisted of. What training did Sickert have? When did he join Henry Irving's prestigious company? What did he do prior to that plum assignment? etc etc.These omissions make it difficult for the reader to be able to fully follow Cornwell's reasoning.Thruout this book, chapters have no coherent center, jumping about in both era and subject. Cornwell's tone is consistently that of a stridently hysterical believer who seems to think the louder she yells the more persuasive she will be. Her descriptions of life in late-Victorian London, while interesting, tend towards the sensationalistic; at times Cornwell treads dangerously close to \\"purple\\" prose.Personally, I recommend \\"Diary of Jack the Ripper\\" for readers getting their feet wet on the subject. Whether you believe the Diary is authentic or not, the author of that book at least presents information coherently and informatively. Patricia Cornwell fails on every count."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I wanted to believe Patricia Cornwall.She's a good mystery writer.Yet,she crosses over the line here. The literary line is blurred between proven fact and speculative myth. (My theory)- Sickert may have been influenced by the Ripper case,even knew him and later painted surreal images of the killing on his canvas. The Pall Mall death-scene sketches were common feature-fodder, during the autumn of 1888.The young Sickert ,like thousands of other intrigued London readers,was probably gripped by the lurid case.Sickert may have been one of the young male artists ,who was patronised by the Dr.Francis Tumblity.Sickert,having outlived all parties involved,painted the pictures,leaving viewers to wonder over his own guilt.Was Sickert paying homeage to an old friend Tumblity,who paid his pub-tab??Or was Sickert an average artist,wanting the public to forever speculate over his involvement and arousing interest in his portfolio ?? What really would be an interesting read,is if a proven Ripper book about Oscar Wilde was penned. If any link could be made between Wilde and the Ripper case.Then i would have to read it.I like Patricia Cornwall's novels,yet this one fails to be proven."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I bought this book in the english book section at the Munich airport. I was intrigued by the title's appendix &quot; . . Case Closed&quot;. Well, to close a case you need some proof. To put it simply, Cornwell has none. Beyond that simple fact, you should be aware that this book is rambling and poorly organized. Don't waste your time reading to the end thinking that Cornwell will finally come to the point and prove her case. She never presents one shred of meaningful evidence, not even with her dubious DNA testing. A total ripoff of a book. I can't imagine that she isn't being sued by someone representing the artist Walter Sickert, whom she accuses of being a serial killer."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you're dead set to get a conviction, you see what you want to see. That's the cardinal sin of a police investigator. At the end of the 19th century there were certainly 5000 psychopaths in London. One of them turned into a serial killer. Others, even most respectable men, shared the dark fantasies acted out by the killer, much like the avid readers of reeky tabloids today. Part of Cornwell does, too. Man is a rather complex animal. The painter Sickert sure had a morbid mind and a faulty character, but that's not enough for a conviction. He hated women, yes, but that was a general characteristic of men at the time, when sex was as filthy and degrading as lust was rampant. A man who uses whores gets to despise himself, usually projecting that selfhate on women. It's still common.Somehow I expected Cornwell to deliver the final punch in the last chapter, instead everything is thrown into the first half of the book. Then it peters out in ever growing uncertainty.Take the issue of Sickert's penile defect, his \\"stump\\". What proof do we have for that? None, whatsoever. He was operated upon three times, sure. From that Cornwell surmises an amputation, or rather, insinuates it. But the reason for the repeated surgery might be as simple as a continued leakage. If Sickert was incapable of intercourse, shouldn't that at least be hinted at in the correspondence between the wife and her beloved sister? Sickert did in fact marry twice with fertile women.Sickert reminds me of characters in her novels. It seems to her evil is related to physical handicaps. The crippled turns evil. Psychopaths are born evil (also a recurrent theme in her novels). Still she offers a staggering row of psychological reasons, childhood trauma's of all kinds. She's not very consistent.Most stunning is her treatment of the Ripper letters. First: all of them cannot be written by the same person. You can manipulate your handwriting, but it's very difficult to change it altogether - you can only change what's apparent to you, part of your style. You can hide it by writing in a childlike way or thorough calligraphy, but most of the letters are written in a off-hand way. Any criminal investigator would try to sort them in two groups - those whose style and content somehow match, and the others. He would then proceed checking if any of the letters contained information only known to the police. Cornwell doesn't.There's also the possibility that the devious Sickert wrote some of those letters and still did not commit the crimes. A Piries & Sons stationery shows that the writer is not a poor bloke, but if it was mainly used by civil servants, any clerk could be the writer.The DNA comparison of Ripper and Sickert letters is an anticlimax. It's simply not conclusive. After that setback Cornwell weakens her case by presupposing - without any kind of substantiation - that Sickert was gambling on racetracks (serial killers usually don't, they want control) and sharing with us her hunch, that the wife really \\"suspected the truth about her husband\\".There are comical parts, too, like when she in a painting in the painting \\"Ennui\\" discovers a man coming up behind a lady with bare shoulders. With such investigative techniques, she could make a wonderful case against Kokoschka, Gustav Klimt or Grosz. And she complains that Sickert's father had no respect for authorities - as if that would not be a rather healthy attitude for a German in the 19th century. I mean, Sickert's father read Heinrich Heine, too.The London police was heavily prejudiced when hunting the Ripper, but so is Patricia Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was really excited to read this book, but I have to say, I was pretty disappointed by it. I guess if the goal was convince me that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, then the goal was accomplished. The problem I had with the book is that the presentation was very hard to follow. The book was constantly jumping back and forth between Walters Sickerts history, the different murders and the present in a way that I found confusing. A timeline of when the murders occured (including the ones she speculates are done by Sickert, but are not thought of as \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders) would have been helpful to try to see patterns. Another missing piece for me is why Jack the Ripper suddenly stopped. Patricia Cornwell speculates that he probably didn't stop committing murders, but why did he stop writing the letters? He obviously loved the attention it brought, so why stop after that had been his modus operandi for so long? The last criticism I had of the book is the ending. The book ended abruptly with the death of his 2nd (of 3) wife. Why end there? I couldn't believe when I turned the page and that was the end! There was no wrap up or conclusions of any kind.For anyone who has always wondered who Jack the Ripper was, you must read this book. It's extremely detailed and as I said, convincing. Her insights into the psychopathic mind are fascinating. She also makes a strong case that Walter Sickert was a violent psychopath. However, you may find as I did that the book could have been much better had the presentation been clearer."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is an amateurishly written badly organized mess of a book. The author should either avoid non fiction or get a ghost writer. I don't know if the authors theory on the rippers identity is a good one or not as she made such a mess of presenting her facts. If she is correct hopefully someone will come along and do a better job of presenting the theory. I'm propably being overly harsh but this was a huge disappointment as I had high expectations of this book based on the authors reputation. If you must read this book get it from the library don't pay for it, it's not worth the money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There was a time when Patricia Cornwell was humble enough to let her stories tell themselves. Her early novels were superbly thought out, written, and edited. Sadly, this is no longer true, even with her Kay Scarpetta books, which have become more and more eccentrically written as time goes on. Perhaps Cornwell has simply lost her touch.I can add little new to earlier reviews concerning the sloppy science and historical research, misunderstanding of British culture, illogical conclusions, and poor editing. This book is not worth the time it takes to read.I will only point out that Cornwell has herself supplied a ready review of this book on page 271. On that page, she finds it strange that a newspaper as reputable as The Times of London would publish such a sophomoric letter as that written by &quot;An Elderly Gentleman.&quot; Personally, I find it strange that as reputable a publisher as Putnam would publish such a sophomoric book as this one!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell tries hard to separate herself from the usual run of Ripper books. And, she has some interesting conclusions to offer: usage of DNA testing on possible Ripper letters and the introduction of a possible new bit of evidence with the guest book of an inn in Cornwall.However, none of it is all that convincing. Her DNA testing may show that Sickert actually wrote a hoax letter, but it's a long step from there to calling him Jack the Ripper. The watermark evidence is interesting, but not conclusive at all. Her art analysis shows that Sickert was interested in death, nothing more.Ultimately, there are a number of independent sources that place Sickert in France during September of that year, quite possibly including all of October.Much of this seems to be the case of someone picking a suspect and doing their best to prove he was the one, rather than reviewing all of the information available."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"ln its critique of this book, the NY Times pointed out that the author violated every principle of valid research in hersimplistic endeavor to &quot;prove&quot; her absurd theory. Shockingly, the reviewer also detailed the many, many inaccuracies in this book, including the &quot;stating of possibilities as facts, based on nothing but her intuition&quot;. The reviewer proves that Ms. Cornwall's book is both sloppy and insulting.Ahh, wouldst the publisher have been as thorough in its research! Did they just simply accept the book as irrevocable truth? Shame on them!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell admitted that due to her controversial theory she would be ripped apart by all the Ripper experts who have been on this case for ages and had read everything on the Ripper, while she was someone with only a superficial knowledge of the Ripper case until she started her research. Even by the end of her research when she began to write her book, it can hardly be said that she had a thorough understanding of all the evidence and theories in the case. However, when she was examining the suspects, her subjective intuition told her that a highly unlikely and improbable suspect named Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. The result was a book which is far from proving that Sickert was the Ripper, but it is a fascinating account, which nevertheless DOES prove certain things about Sickert and his knowledge of Jack the Ripper.Here point-by-point is what I objectively believe Patricia Cornwell DID prove:1) Sickert was obsessed with Jack the Ripper, to the point that some of his paintings are strongly influenced by this obsession.2) Sickert might have sent one or more of the Ripper hoax letters to Scotland Yard3) Sickert fits the psychological profile of the killer.Scientifically speaking, this is all that this book proves about Walter Sickert. I believe Cornwell would have come up with much more convincing results if she had put all that time and money into investigating a much more promising suspect, like Francis Tumbelty. Among the amazing articles of evidence agianst him are the fact that he was known to have a collection of bottled uteruses (an organ which was removed from the Ripper victims), he was known to commonly frequent the East End slums, he had a violent hatred of women, especially &quot;fallen women&quot;, he was known to have murdered at least once as a quack doctor, he committed obscenity offences on the days of the week of each Ripper murder, and most telling of all, when the nuns who looked after him went through his personal belongings after his death, they found all the things you would expect a fancy gentleman would own--gold pocket watch, all kinds of expensive jewelry, and then last on the list, two cheap immitation gold rings IDENTICAL TO THE TWO THAT WERE STOLEN FROM VICTIM ANNIE CHAPMAN'S FINGERS.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwall should stick to writing mysteries and far, far away from trying to build a case that she alone has solved the real identity of Jack the Ripper. As a devotee' of &quot;Ripperology&quot; over the last five years, I have read a number of books that detail the evidence and incisively analyze clues which allegedly solved the crime. The majority of these solutions have been disemboweled at a later date by the discovery that apparent facts were only subjective opinions and did not stand up to close scrutiny. For example, many of the clues were taken directly from the journalist of the day reports which were found to be later in error (journalists were inaccurate then as now.) Unfortunately, the author does not seem to feel a need, beyond her creative imagination, to build a case that hangs together or to refute some of the excellent research or theories that others have painstakingly put together. The DNA evidence she provides is not compelling. Her analysis of Sickert's paintings and the linking of them to the imagery and symbolism surrounding the Ripper lore ignores the most likely theory, that any artists of the day with a widely acknowledged dark side would have felt compelled to either emulate or incorporate these images into his art. Her psychological detailing of the personalities of psychopaths is interesting but she again fails to tie them to Sickert's actual behavior. There are fascinating mini-essays on Victorian forensic medicine, the crushing East End poverty, and the life style of the &quot;unfortunates&quot; who were Ripper's victims. Some of the writing is almost stream of consciousness and drifts from topic to topic in a loose manner that is hard to follow. She ignores other likely Ripper candidates, e.g, James Maybrick, the Liverpool cotton merchant, by waving away the evidence and research with personal opinion or superficial generalizations. All in all, if you are a Ripper fan, the book will disappoint for its lack of analysis, evidence, and logic. Only the most compulsive and methodical of Ripper fans will be able to read the entire book. If you are a Cornwell fan, this book will be a long journey that ends nowhere and seems a misuse of her considerable talents."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've always had people tell me I needed to read some Patricia Cornwell. I've always been interested in Jack the Ripper so I thought I'd check this book out and see what she was all about. Apparently she's all about being self-indulgent and writing too many chapters which are basically her restating her already shaky evidence. This Sickert guy is an interesting guy to read about and, hell, he might actually be the guy, but it will take a whole lot more than the circumstantial and non-evidence Cornwell provides in this book. Going by what she writes, the only thing I'm positive about concerning Sickert is that he was a snooty guy who didn't treat his wife too fondly. Cornwell gets way too wordy and the book is just really repetitive as a lot of the same things get repeated over and over. Plus, she constantly reminds us about the handicaps that the police at the time were dealing with, but I'm sure they were not so inept that they didn't look at things like the watermark she is so fond of talking about. Check it out if you're a Cornwell fan or a Jack the Ripper nerd, but just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell's thesis is unconvincing and poorly organized. Her prose, much like the Ripper's victims themselves, is in many places mutilated. I was very disappointed, as I enjoy her Kay Scarpetta books and found them to be vastly more coherent and readable. One quite perplexing decision: Many of Mr. Sickert's paintings that Ms. Cornwell refers to are not reproduced in the book, but instead many illustrations and photographs which have only peripheral connection to her argument are reproduced instead (for example, pictures of other suspects that she only spends a paragraph or so talking about).Ms. Cornwell relies heavily on psychological profiliing of Mr. Sickert -- and uses a jury litmus test -- except that it is highly unlikely a reasonable jury would convict since most of her argument is supposition and conjecture, and her DNA evidence is lacking.Also troubling is the fact that Ms. Cornwell does not provide any in-text citations, endnotes, or footnotes to support her argument - instead relying on a \\"Works Cited\\" section at the end of the document. Although I don't believe she was purposely being academically dishonest, I do find it hard to take this book seriously as scholarly research. She also never establishes her \\"experts\\" credentials - they could just be lackeys on her payroll for all we know."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Perhaps appropriately for a book about one of the original \\"disorganised serial killers\\", Portrait of a Killer is a horrible mess which seems to have been written in a moment of rage. Murders and other events are described out of chronological order for no clear reason. Pictures and letters that are supposed to support Cornwell's argument are described, but not shown. A sketch of a short broad-bladed knife from one \`ripper' letter is not referred to in the text, and contradicts Cornwell's description of the knife she thinks the ripper used, nor does it resemble the knives in Sickert's sketches which Cornwell claims prove his guilt. I applaud her use of forensic techniques (at her own expense) to attempt to solve the mystery, and her exhaustive research of primary sources, but she doesn't explain why she went to so much effort to prove a case against Sickert to the exclusion of other suspects.As in some of her novels, Cornwell depicts the serial killer as a brilliant supervillain, elusive as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Her cunningly disguised Ripper disappears from the scene of the crime with scarcely a trace and zooms around England and France, taunting the police by writing hundreds of letters in different hands and putting obscure clues into his paintings. She blames him for assorted deaths that bear little resemblance to the canonical Ripper murders simply because some \`Ripper letters' were postmarked from the general area at a some time, yet claims elsewhere that while Sickert wrote many of the letters (i.e. those that seem to prove rather than disprove her case), he had associates post them for him to conceal his whereabouts. She uses \\"might not\\" and \\"possibly\\" so often that I soon lost count, and all she ultimately PROVES is that Sickert used the same brand of paper as the author of some Ripper letters, and that DNA from the envelope from one of the \`Ripper letters' may match that from other letters written by Sickert's and that partial fingerprints on the envelope may be Sickert's. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that this letter or any of the 600+ others were written by the Ripper, and none of the Ripper's fingerprints or DNA has been recovered from the crime scenes.Cornwell is not the first to accuse Sickert, who titled a painting of a room in his lodgings \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom\\" - but Cornwell neglects to mention that Sickert's landlady told him that the Ripper had lived there. Sickert was undeniably fascinated by the murders, and may have thought he knew who the Ripper was... but the same is true of many people, including Cornwell herself. A century from now, someone may look at her novels and, using the same reasoning, find them full of clues that \`prove' that she committed many unsolved murders - but I doubt that would be accepted as evidence beyond reasonable doubt. And neither should this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell has clearly gone off the deep end. She has come to the mistaken conclusion that first, she is Kay Scarpetta and that second, the things that makes up for her (truly wonderful) novels are actually true. The result is a tangled batch of supposition that reads like libel.Her method is to pick out something about her Victim (eg the accused), for example that he had a fistula. She prefaces her commentary with a disclaimer that nothing she is about to write is true, then delves into a \\"if the fistula was this bad, and was of thus and so type, and if all the operations were adequately botched, then he'd be so upset that it is reasonable to assume that he'd go off and kill lots of women.\\" This type of diatribe will go on for ten pages or so, during which time she shifts from an \\"if\\" voice to an absolute and accusatory voice.A caveat is that despite her historical novel approach to the subject, the accused may very well be guilty. She does, however, a disservice to her case by confusing the product of her imagined investigations with reality. That confusion shifts the novel from a non-fiction piece to a blended book where it is unclear at any moment whether the evidence provided is real or supposition. Additionally distressing is that the accused has been dead for some time now, and is not in a position to indicate that these suppositions are untrue.Cornwell writes a very good novel, and researches her subjects well. The errors in this case are driven by those excellent skills; she is adept at creating a situation where the evidence indicates the guilt of the subject. Unfortunately, the accused in this case is a real person, yet the \\"evidence\\" is largely the product of a very confused author. What would otherwise be a compelling novel becomes little more than mud-slinging. Cornwell may be correct in choosing her target, but the confusion that she suffers, in thinking that what she makes up for a novel is permissable when accusing a real person, makes the book unreadable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell should stick to writing fiction. Her faulty, incomplete evidence, combined with the lack of any real structure not only makes this the ultimate waste of time and money but a scholastic farce. Her theories are not new (see Walt Vanderlinden \\"Art of Murder\\"; Stephen Knight, 1976), she manipulates each fact to suit her premise, and leaves one to wonder if she has ever studied basic rhetoric. Even freshmen students know that you don't make outrageous claims without proof. She takes up a line of argument, then distracts the reader with details of life in 1880s London. She \\"links\\" Sickert to the scenes of crimes by saying that he didn't keep a diary so there's no proof he wasn't there. Imagine if our judicial system worked this way! She accuses him of having deviant tastes because he wandered the East End, attending plays and hanging out with artists and dancers and actors. (So did many men at the time; they had no television to occupy them.) Her \\"evidence\\" is selective and circumstantial. For example, she goes into great detail about the watermarks on the stationary used by both Sickert and Jack the Ripper. She does nothing to say that MANY other Victorians were using the same stationary or that it was probably readily available to anyone with a bit of money. Iron bedsteads, used in Sickert paintings, a fact she thinks is extremely damnable, were also found in the rooms of the murdered prostitutes. \`Convict him!' She says. But how many other doss-houses had iron bedsteads, a common piece of furniture in Victorian England?She compares the speech and diction used by Sickert to Jack the Ripper. Did she do a full analysis based on general word usage common to the time? Or did she just look for what she wanted to find, based on a precursory scan using as a reference her modern experience of the English language? She includes very few of Sickert's paintings to prove the parallel between life and art and doesn't delve into his other paintings. Sickert was quite prolific and some of what he painted dealt with the seemlier side of life, but the majority is of landscapes and innocent topics. She has examined his paintings and determined that he hated women because of a botched surgery for a deformed penis. I've looked at his paintings and see nothing but the eye of an artist who wanted to depict life as it was-harsh, stinking, and dirty. And the question of his penis is backed up, not by objective evidence, but by the fact that there are no facts; therefore, whatever was done to him must have been bad. If our judicial system did convict based on evidence like that presented here, we'd be guilty right off and be charged with proving our innocence. What burns me is that I paid good money for this book, and I'm positive Cornwell will get very wealthy off this stink."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I agree with many of the other posters here. Cornwell has attacked the reputation of Sickert in this book, providing circumstantial evidence that in no way proves Sickert was indeed Jack the Ripper.She interchanges &quot;Sickert&quot; for &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; in a weak attempt at trying to fool the reader to believe the two were indeed the same person. She consistently uses &quot;proof&quot; such as &quot;there is no way to prove otherwise&quot; when accusing Sickert of being in the vicinity of the murders when they occur. She accuses that because he sketches women's body parts that he is fantasising in his sketches about dismembering their bodies. She says Sickert liked to take long walks, just as the Ripper supposedly did. She tries, rather weakly, to attribute every Ripper letter sent to the police, and even every letter written to the newspapers, to Sickert, simply because there is no proof that he is not responsible. And, Sickert used chalk, as the Ripper supposedly did after one of the murders. You could probably replace Sickert with at least 1,000 other individuals living at the time and come up with the same &quot;proof.&quot;Cornwell's writing style is very disjointed and jumps around from place to place and from time to time, which makes it difficult to put together timelines. Her tone is almost stream-of-consciousness, in that she seems to be discussing one aspect of the murders, then suddenly changes direction because she suddenly thinks of something else.I'm sure the author put a lot of effort into gathering the information for this book, but perhaps she should stick to fiction and not accuse the dead and defenseless of one of the most infamous crimes in history."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having been an amateur researcher into the ripper saga for many years now I am always open to new ideas and theories. Unfortunately this book fails to provide any convincing evidence to 'close the case' on the Jack the Ripper mystery. I am sure the author made lots of money from the book especially with the cliche title but she needs to stick to subjects she knows about.I treasure books when I buy them but admit this hardcover version went out with the trash when I finished it. And a few choice words about Ms Cornwall were heard too.Save your money and invest in something written by people such as skinner or evans who are masters of the game."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Most will say they were not convinced by the circumstantial evidence presented by Ms Cornwell, but I was. Her investigation into Jack was the best laid out one yet and wasn't hyped up by throwing in the Royal family or a secret organization. Yes, she didn't prove conclusively that Sickert was the infamous Ripper, but she provided a thought provoking look at a man who was quite capable of being the serial killer. My only regret about the book is the misleading title (Case Closed). It is a shame the bad publicity (ie. she didn't prove it) will over shadow a great profiling of Sickert as Jack the Ripper. Of course, if too many people believed it, the tour walks in London wouldn't have a show to put on for the tourists would they?

Keep it up Ms Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having been on a \\"Jack the Ripper\\" tour in London and having enjoyed several of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, I had high hopes for this book. I was very disappointed. At best Cornwell has proven that Sickert wrote some of the letters, she has virtually nothing that proves he committed the murders. He paints some violent, misogynistic paintings, therefore he's a murderer? If that's all it took to prove someone as a murderer, surely the violence in Cornwell's books could indict her as a murderer as well.The book is at its worst when Cornwell plays forensic psychologist with comments such as, \\"Sickert's precise way of thinking and calculating was evident in his own description of his work, but also in the way he executedit. His method of painting was to 'square up' his sketches, enlarging them geometrically to preserve the exact perspectives and proportions. ... In the Jack the Ripper's games and violent crimes, the grid of who he was is faintly visible behind his machinations.\\"Cornwell makes leaps of logic all over the book and continuously repeats herself about such things as the Sickert's alleged fistula surgeries and how as an artist Sickert could easily fake different handwriting. The book is somewhat tedious to read and has very little flow. As I said, it was very disappointing."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I think the most telling sign that Cornwell's claim isn't half of what she wants it to be is her use of the sentence, &quot;I could find no record of his whereabouts or activities on August 6th, 1888, but there is no reason to suspect he wasn't in London,&quot; (4). Indeed, most of her evidence seems to based on the supposition, &quot;if there's nothing to prove he didn't do it, then he did.&quot;She completely ignores the idea that one is innocent until proven guilty, and structures every &quot;fact&quot;(and I use the term very loosely) on the idea that because she says it's so, it's so.Often rambling for pages about irrelevant facts that do not support her case, her best evidence is present in the first few chapters, where she presents Mitocondrial DNA evidence, which she blanketly states rules out 99% of the population, when in fact it rules out between 90 and 99% of the population. Further, if you accept her 99%, than of the 5 million plus Londoners of 1888, you would have a list of suspects in excess of 50,000.At best she paints Sickert as a troubled man, with odd interests, and a tradition of family problems. But this is about all she does.I ask you're interested in the case of Jack the Ripper over a hundred years later, doesn't it seem likely that Sickert would have in interest in it too, when he lived era and locale of the ordeal? I would suggest that it is more likely that the appearance of &quot;ripper like&quot;(and again I use this lightly because her evidence in this regard is hardly conclusive or convincing) images in some of Sickert's work stems his own interest in the highly publicized case, than that it points to him as a serial murderer. I would also ask, if you had a troubled family life, and a dark view of the world, wouldn't you be even more inclined to take an interest in Jack the Ripper?Perhaps most disturbing to me is the aloof way in which she claims to have &quot;solved the case.&quot; &quot;Case Closed&quot; my foot. If anything, I have wasted my money on a theory, not a solution. Moreover a bad theory, which is full of holes, and perhaps goes so far as clouding the real facts of the case.

Cornwell provides very little in support of her claim that the artist William Sickert is the killer. Her evidence basically consists of suspect DNA tests, Cornwell's (and her handpicked cronies') own interpretations that some of Sickert's works depict violence against women, and may bear likenesses to Ripper murder scenes/victims. There is absolutely no application of the disciplines of the Scientific Method here to prove her hypothesis of the killer's identity. In fact, this book is tantamount to Cornwell stamping her feet stating that Sickert is the killer just because she says so.Cornwell makes much hullabaloo over her spending $6 Million of her own money on this investigation...seemingly on travel and on buying up Sickert's drawings and paintings. It doesn't take too much imagination to figure that she's bought the paintings and \\"traveled for research purposes\\" to justify expenditures related to this \\"investigation.\\" This in an attempt to beef up the value of the paintings of Sickert, which she now owns, by claiming they were the work of Jack the Ripper.

This could be a very interesting book and in fact the first part is but in all it is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"For those of you with long commutes on public transportation, this is the sort of book you will love, as I did; it's easy reading, with fascinating subject matter and mellifluous writing typical of Patricia Cornwell. Ms. Cornwell writes in a straightforward and well worded prose that holds the reader's attention while managing to convey the myriad scientific facts necessary for her subject matter.That having been noted, she does not make what could be considered a truly strong case against her choice for the title of Jack the Ripper, English artist Walter Sickert. Granted, there are many years of poorly preserved evidence and scattered details forming a significant hindrance to her case, and she surmounts this carefully and skillfully, but in the end, leaves a few too many holes to reinter Mr. Sickert under a headstone reading Ripper. Take for instance her discussions of both the DNA testing and water mark comparisons of the Ripper letters as compared to Walter Sickert's probable DNA sources and personal stationary. Without ruining Ms. Cornwell's study of these facets, suffice to say that they would be highly unlikely to hold up in a modern trial.To state that Walter Sickert was an eccentric who's behavior certainly lends itself to identification with this sort of crime is not a difficult jump to make. However, to end with a statement of having found once and for all the killer (based laregly on snippets of Freudian developmental psychology in relation to Sickert's supposed genital mutilation in childhood) is a bit of a stretch for such a scientifically-minded author.Overall, Ms. Cornwell provides us with an entertaining book, which makes an interesting, if not wholly supportable case. I would state that while I don't believe Jack's necessarily been unmasked, it has developed in me an interest in the art of Walter Sickert, to which I had previously not been exposed; so we may arrive at the point of my review - good for reading on the train, interesting as an exposure to an artist, but just not convincing enough to pull others onto the Cornwell bandwagon."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is well written but the evidence Cornwell presents is definitely not convincing. She seems to proceed with the definite premise that Sicket was the murderer. She then goes on to reject evidence that does not fit this hypothesis and also make a large number of unsubstantiated claims. Take an example. She notes that Ripper letters were posted from several places including France and America. Then she goes on to say, that they must have been hoaxes, because Sickert never visited America!I definitely got the impression that Cornwell was trying to awe people into accepting her evidence by throwing around some jargon[though the book is readable]. This is the oldest trick in the book and does not stand up to scrutiny.Finally, a comment about her generalizations. Cornwell seems fond of making universal generalizations -- about the nature of pscopathic killers for example. She suggests that their 'frontal lobe' is damaged! Leaving aside the question of when someone becomes a psycopathic killer(is Kissinger one? Is Bush one?), the statistics she quotes seem to be untenable. Take an example: Cornwell says that 4% of the population at large and 25% of the prison population have the trait that marks a person as a psycopathic killer[abnormal frontal lobe]. This is completely untenable because it suggests that a large section of the prison population is in prison because of genetic characteristics rather than socioeconomic factors. This thesis has been falsified. A quick calculation-- that I leave to the reader--will show the fallacy of Cornwell's statistic."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwall is a good writer of fictional detective thrillers, these I adore, but perhaps she should stick to her imaginary plots. This book started out well, but got bogged down with unnecessary and often irrelevant tangents and repetition.I suspect Patricia felt insecure about venturing off into a factual arguement about an actual case, so she anxiously tried to convince the reader by lengthy restatement of the same assertions. The book contains 365 pages of text, but could have been edited back to around 200 pages. A reader is capable of accepting that many modern methods of forensic analysis were not available when the 'Ripper cases' occured in the late 1880s, without needing to be told in triplicate that if a certain type of analysis had been available (i.e. DNA or fingerprinting etc.) then successful detection of the ripper's identity could have occured.Let's face it Patricia, given the forensic limitations of the genre conclusive evidence was not (and never will be) available. The book makes a plausable, compelling case for Cornwall's Ripper candidate Walter Sickert, utilizing various recovered data (saliva, fingerprints etc.) reassessed using modern scientific forensic techniques. Patricia deserves high praise for pursuing all available sources and uncovering this evidence, but we will never have conclusive, irrefutable proof as the actual perpetratior is deceased.If Patricia just accepted the fact that all she can achieve is a conpelling suspect and leave it at that then the book could have been wrapped up at least 100 pages earlier. Some truths can never be known (given the circumstances) and bemoaning the 'if only' and 'what ifs' for multiple pages will not change that. I propose she reworks the offering and publishes a revised edition, I do think it was worth writing.I was convinced about half way through the book, the second half was unnecesary straining even my perservance to finish. My conclusion is that Cornwall needs a more ruthless and autocratic editor.

There is a lack of evidence, which is to be expected when the crimes were commited so long ago and the evidence was not all kept by the authorities. My biggest problems with this book come from the format and the use of language. Ms. Cornwell skips around so much in the way she tells the story that you easily loose track of the names, dates, and events themselves. I found it dificult to keep it all straight. If it were written in more of a time-line format, it would have been much easier to follow.Overall, the story is lost in the poor writing.

I mean, Patricia Cornwell and her publishing house have subtitled her work &quot; Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed &quot; All done up nice and tidy, no? Well, perhaps not. Actually for this author to be so presumptuous as to subtitle this novel with the smug &quot;Case Closed &quot; I find almost offensive in its arrogance and finality. As the Brits are fond of saying I believe Ms. Cornwell has indeed gotten hold of the &quot; wrong end of the stick. &quot; Not only is this misinformed book completely negligable of other factors involving the true identity of this madman but so heavy-handed and coarse that at several points during my read I almost had to sit back and wonder at the almost mind-numbing wrong-headedness of Ms. Cornwells beliefs. Yet, like the proverbial 'bull in the china shop' she prattles on ceaselessly, confident in her findings and, no doubt, sure that her loyal readers too will find her mystery-solving skills truly supreme.Patricia Cornwell, who I assume, specializes in 'fictional' mysteries is most definitely out of her element here. Her lack of analytic thinking, lack of logic and her being far too focused on her one and only suspect belies a sense of being out of her depth. Her talents may lie in creating subjects that conveniently do as she writes them but sadly for our author true life is seldome that convenient. Yet, page after page, she attempts to pigeon-hole her characters into doing what she needs them to so they can fit her singular belief of who 'Jack the Ripper' truly was. One can assume that she almost viewed this offering as one of her fictional endeavors as well...happily coming to the conclusion that she had decided upon long before she ever sat down to put pen to paper. Presumptuous indeed!And,sadly, to make matters far worse, playing the role of the 'tortured artist' she includes a chapter where she has a talk with her literary agent describing how fraught she is with this latest work. Even going so far as to state, &quot; I am suddenly in a position of judgement. &quot; Then adding true insult to injury our grieving author states that she has some misgivngs about being wrong as to her identity of the culpprit but after being asked by her agent concerning any misgivings she she boldly states that indeed &quot; No. Because I'm not wrong. &quot; Sadly, this smacks of a writer who simply has an almost religious zeal toward her own talents married with a pathological belief in her abilities to be the only human being worthy of solving this international mystery. At this point any reader should be in awe of this womans supreme arrogance and lack of sublty. And many Americans wonder why we're so dislike by the international community!Well, in the end justice may previal. Ms. Cornwell's &quot; Portrait of a Killer.... &quot; was not exactly a rousing success for this author and today can be purchased as a 'remainder' for the paltry sum of $5.00. Fortunately Patricia will return to the genre that she does best, creating characters who dabble in fictional mysteries and quaint 'whodunnits.' As for real life atrocities I supect Ms. Cornwell should leave that to those much better equipped to deal with things here in the 'real world.'"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is a classic example of the most dangerous mistake made by those attempting to solve crimes: Deciding in advance who your favorite suspect is, and then seeking out (and stretching) whatever clues will prove your case against him, instead of taking an objective approach and following all available clues to see where they lead.I suppose Ms. Cornywell is no more guilty than Alan Moore, or the Hughes Brothers, or anyone else who has taken this fascinating true story and spun an entertaining work of fiction from it. What makes this book somewhat disturbing is that the author appears to believe wholeheartedly in the fictional version she tells.The way the book is written is also extremely annoying, with self-important, breathless passages in which Ms. Cornwell laments the torturous hours she must dilligently spend battling the evil spirit of murder through her heroic writing.However good her intentions may have been, this book just comes off as an over-reaching attempt to prove an unnecessarily convoluted theory by an over-emotional woman.As it has been continuously pointed out in more level-headed, sensible books by behavioral experts in law enforcement and the FBI who have spent their entire careers studying serial killers, murder in real life is just never this intricately plotted or complicated.Sorry, Ms. Cornywell, you screwed the pooch on this one!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell seems to have needed to recover some of the cash she spent in her alleged &quot;investigation&quot; of Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper. Why else would she publish such unfounded trash? Not only is the book poorly written (need a new editor, Patricia?), but the alleged evidence presented is never more than pure speculation from an accomplished fiction writer! The only thing I got from this book was a sincere desire to sue Ms Cornwell on behalf of Mr Sickert for &quot;slander and Libel! I should hope that this book will not be purchased by anyone else so as to deprive the author of any more revenue that may encourage further garbage. I like a good speculation about the identity of &quot;Jack&quot; as much as anyone might, but to offer such flimsy, rambling, accusation about a single person is contemtible and should not be rewarded.I am not a fan of Walter Sickert. In fact I only had a passing knowledge of him as an artist before reading this book. Therefore, I am not making an attempt to clear his name, only that I would like to add my review to the others that call this book what it is - SHAMEFUL, LIBELOUS, NONSENSE! Of all the good reviews of this work I read they all seem to come from long time fans of Ms Cornwell. I had never read her works before this one and after reading this I shall not waste my time. Perhaps I will entertain the idea of authoring my own investigation into the &quot;Whitechapel murders&quot; and implicate Patricia Cornwell as my suspect. I could easily present at least as much &quot;evidence&quot; against her as she did Mr Sickert as being the culprit!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Tosh! What an arrogant book. Ms Cornwell claims to solve the Jack the Ripper case, \\"case closed\\" the book jacket screams yet alas the contents are preposterously wide of the mark. There are some very silly Ripper books out there, what with the Royal Conspiracy fantasies and the Maybrick diary forgery, and this book will quietly join their ranks. Cornwell claims to have blown six million dollars on her quest, which puts me in the mind of the movie \\"Local Hero\\" where the locals band together to fleece an outsider. Has this happened to Cornwell?There are so many problems with this book I hardly know where to start. Most basic is her insistence that the Ripper letters were indeed written by the Ripper, which no other expert on the letters agrees with. She finds that most of the crank letters were in fact written by Walter Sickert and hence he is the Ripper. Trouble is the letters appear to have been written by many many hands (there are over 210 letters kept by the police) yet Cornwell claims to discern Sickert's hand in well over a hundred of them! Why? Well she can tell by the language...oh and the different handwriting? Well multiple personality types can write in many different handwritings! Fact is she never makes the case that even one single Ripper letter was in fact written by the actual killer. She makes the leap then assumes the leap is a fact. Sorry but it isn't. So even if she were to prove that Walter Sickert did in fact write any of these crank letters she still hasn't proven anything beyond the fact that Sickert might enjoy writing crank letters...But this only skims the surface of what is wrong with this book. A great deal of her \\"case\\" seems to be a very philistine reading of what art is. Sickert painted some grusome scenes therefore he must be a killer. Again what simple minded nonsense. I haven't been mugged by Martin Scorsese lately and he certainly made some violent movies. Sickert experts have demolished her readings of the paintings as well as cast doubt on whether he was even in England on the dates of the murders! Truth be told this is a rather sloppy, if expensive, libel of a decent artist. Let's hope if nothing else all the hoopla will renew interest in Sicket's paitings...The thinking is this book is so sloppy yet so arrogantly assured that it gives one pause as to Cornwell's other endeavors outside of her fiction (she claims to have founded a forensic institute).Frankly an embarassment that should soon find its way to remainder bins."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell knew practically nothing about Jack the Ripper before being invited on a tour of Scotland Yard. She says she didn't even know how his victims died or that they were prostitutes. Her interest was in using him in a Scarpetta novel. When she asked Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve if anyone had ever tried to use modern forensics methods to solve the murders, Grieve mentions artist Walter Sickert, who painted a picture entitled \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom.\\" Rather than examine the evidence, consider the various suspects, and seize upon the most likely killer, Cornwell is immediately hooked on Sickert.Sickert is as good a choice as any, actually, at least as good as Montague Druitt, the Duke of Clarence, physician John Gill, or Aaron Kosminski. What bothers me most is Cornwell's blatant hubris. It's been a hundred and fourteen years since the murders; yet, she knows better than the fumbling detectives who worked during the original time frame, one of whom (Sir Melville MacNaghten) had the audacity to write a book about the murders, choosing Kosminski as his Ripper.Cornwell's chosen structure is also aggravating. She spurns a preface or introduction, which would have given her a chance to explain how she came about writing the book in her own voice. Instead, she interrupts the narrative flow, consistently interrupting to explain her superior forensic technique. So, what does she come up with? Sickert was sexually impotent, having had three operations on his penis prior to age six, possibly without anesthetics. She loves that word \\"possibly\\", also \\"maybe\\" as well as the words \\"could have.\\" As a result of the painful operations, Sickert hated women. This despite the fact that he was married three times. \\"Possibly,\\" he married them for money or \\"maybe\\" because he needed a mother figure. What else? Sickert loved attention; he wrote hundreds of letters and articles for the newspapers. Thanks to Cornwell's legion of researchers, she finds watermarks on the Ripper's letters that match Sickert's stationery. She also decides that most of the Ripper letters were genuine. The authorities were hoaxed by the different handwriting, and Sickert, being an artist, could imitate many different styles.Another aspect of the letters she finds incriminating is the Rippers's persistent use of \\"Ha! Ha!\\" Once again that points at Sickert, whose mentor James McNeil Whistler was notorious for that annoying laugh.One wonders how Cornwell can look herself in the mirror when she implies Macnaghten wrote his book for money. Listen to this drivel: \\"\`I hate this book, Ester (her agent). . . .' I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert. He was taking it away from me. \`I want to write my novels,' I said. \`I don't want to write about him. There's no joy in this.'\\"There's not much joy in reading the results either. A better bet is to check out casebook.org to see what the Ripper fanatics do to Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell utilizes 300 pages or her new book to convince us of her belief that artist Walter Sickert was the infamous \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" She is absolute in her conviction and has stated publicly that she is willing to \\"stake her career\\" on her findings. As a trained scientist and clinician, I would argue that Ms. Cornwell's findings are entirely unconvincing and that the majority of her conclusions are based on speculation.Although she makes an admirable attempt to link DNA in correspondence written by Sickert with DNA in letters purportedly written by \\"the Ripper,\\" the results are not conclusive or exclusionary. She is forced to give this evidence (which had it been conclusive would have been very strong) short shrift in her text and builds her case by speculating on Sickert's psychological make-up, his behavior, and his whereabouts. Indeed, the amount of guessing she engages in is so extravagant that I found myself putting the book down and laughing at times. Just a few examples:1. Speculating that Sickert was deformed, sexually impotent and hated women (and murdered them)due to a fistula of his penis. The speculation of psychological problems related to a physical condition might be acceptable, if she had convincing evidence that the physical condition existed, which she does not.2. That most of the letters purportedly written to the press and police by Jack the Ripper were legitimate AND written by Sickert. First, it is extremely unlikely that the Ripper cases, which received so much press at the time, would not result in a multitude of false letters and correspondence. To think otherwise is absurd. Second, the penmanship and literacy of the letters varies greatly. Cornwell argues that Sickert deliberately disguised his writing from letter to letter and feigned illiteracy in some letters, but not in others. However, she never provides a believable justification as to why. Third, the letters are also postmarked from all over the country and she argues that Sickert went on extravagant journeys in order to postmark the letters from different locales, but again fails to convince as to the motive for doing so.In my opinion, were Ms. Cornwell's findings and arguments submitted to a peer-reviewed journal they would be soundly rejected. Or, to use her own analogy, were they presented in a court of law, the defendant would be acquitted. She appears to have formed an opinion and then presented the evidence to support that opinion, ignoring or failing to address the blatant leaps of faith she makes in the process.I had no knowledge of Walter Sickert prior to reading this book and, therefore, no pre-conceived notions one way or the other. Is it possible that he was Jack the Ripper? Certainly. But does the evidence convince me of it? Absolutely not. In fact, I would argue that Patricia Cornwell has done a disservice to the man and his surviving family members."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If anything, this book is perhaps proof that the Jack the Ripper obsession will never die, if only because it's unlikely it will ever be solved, at least 'conclusively'.The book is arrogantly sub-titled 'Case Closed', and of course, it's anything but a closed case that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, or that James Maybrick was the Ripper, or Lewis Carroll was the Ripper, or the royals were involved, etc.I'm not sure what to make of the whole business anymore. There are now close to 20 suspects in the Ripper case, and indeed in the 1990s alone quite a few new suspects appeared on the scene thanks to research and fanaticism on the part of various writers. Now Cornwall has thrown herself into it, and it's somewhat troubling.Of course, at the end of the day, there's no smoking gun. There hasn't been a smoking gun, and given that the murders took place in 1888, and evidence and various records are long gone, it's highly unlikely there will be a smoking gun. The whole business already inspired someone to forge a 'Ripper' diary and try to pass it off. This has since been debunked numerous times, with the author himself swearing that it's a forgery, yet people still believe it. Every year someone discovers someone who was in London in 1888, hated women, etc, etc.Folks who are interested in the Ripper may peruse this book, but it's clear from the 'evidence' and the layout that this is anything but 'Case Closed', if anything, it says something about Cornwall, who writes about her own doubt to this theory. And admittedly, while there are some nice coincidences, and Sickert indeed may have been a bit off his rocker, and indeed may have penned Ripper letters (of which there were many fakes), it's no more convincing than several other theories of the past ten years.Notice the '71% off' price tag of this book, which shows you something in comparison to other books on the subject. There are much better books about the whole case, and you'll likely learn more from those if you care. It would be nice to put the whole Ripper case to rest, finally. The energy and resources some folks have put into 'solving' this business is becoming more alarming. Recommended if you must, but it's hardly a 'final chapter'."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Fortunately, they weren't my 28 bucks. Borrowed my sister's copy of this book. Not history, not fiction. Just pure exploitive, gratuitously gossipy character assassination. Cornwell is fortunate that Sickert has no living heirs to silence this destruction of an artist's reputation.No footnotes, a lot of opinion and little else to persuade the reader of Cornwell's illogical conclusion. And, even if Cornwell could convince her audience (and she doesn't) that Sickert authored the Ripper letters, it is still a huge deductive leap to assume that the author of the letters was the killer.I was also shocked to learn that Cornwell bought some of Sickert's paintings and destroyed them in the failed attempt to extract forensic evidence.Cornwell is not a scientist, art historian nor historian. She should stick with her brand of weakly written fiction.Do I have to give it even one star?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Repetitive conjecture posing as fact does not make fact. I came into this book expecting to be fascinated and convinced. Sadly, I was very bored (which rarely happens to me with ANY book) and finished feeling Cornwell had made a very strong case that the individual she accuses of being Jack the Ripper most certainly IS NOT. Weak, convoluted writing; repetition after repetition of the very same \\"facts\\" in nearly every other page. Exhausting read that left me disappointed beyond compare. Worst book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found the author to be verbose. Too much of the book is information that only serves to fill pages with words. I found her research to be excellent, but her interpretation of this evidence takes one too many a leap of faith that is just not supported or justified. Time and again she says that she has no evidence to prove Sickert did certain things or was in certain places. She then turns and says she has no evidence to prove the opposite. When you base an entire book on the premise that it is impossible to prove a negative, you end up with the self absorbed clap trap that is the logic this author has produced in this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I knew immediately what the problem with this book was going to be when I read in the first few pages that Ms. Cornwell was investigating, not Jack the Ripper, but Walter Sickert. The way to investigate a case is to review all the evidence before formulating a theory which fits ALL the known facts, then rigorously test that theory before coming to a conclusion (and Ms. Cornwell, with her background, knows this perfectly well). The way NOT to investigate a case is to form a theory and then try to find evidence to support it, which is exactly what she does here.The result is that Ms. Cornwell gives undue weight to anything, however trivial or unlikely, which supports her theory and minimizes or simply discards anything which doesn't fit. This means that, far from closing the case, Ms. Cornwell hardly opens it, since she automatically ignores any evidence pointing to suspects other than Sickert.Ms. Cornwell is an entertaining writer, which is why I've given this book two stars. However, treat it as an intellectual exercise designed to pick a person who on the face of it has no connection with Jack the Ripper and then find evidence which shows a possibility that he might have been guilty of the Whitechapel murders. It's my suspicion that this is what Ms. Cornwell did; maybe at some future time she will confess it was all a bit of fun."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell has established several connections between Walter Sickert and Jack the Ripper. However, there is one more connection as plain as the nose on Sickert's disguised face.I shall not argue for Walter Sickert's guilt with regard to the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders themselves. I shall demonstrate that he created Jack the Ripper.After Annie Chapman's murder, the second in the sequence of five, the police received a letter signed Jack the Ripper. The letter taunted them for their ineptness and predicted that they would find more corpses. The police published the letter, hoping that someone would come forward and identify the writer. No one did.Walter Sickert constantly toyed with his identity by changing his name and appearance. He produced name changes through aliases, variations on his name, and different combinations of his initials. Authors Patricia Cornwell and Matthew Sturgis disagree on whether Sickert was the Ripper killer. She convicts; he acquits. They do agree on Sickert's changes in name and appearance. The second most important instance of a name change is found on page 239 in the paperback edition of Sturgis's Walter Sickert: A Life. Sturgis reproduces one of Sickert's signatures as W*lt*r S*ck*rt. He had removed the vowels. He certainly had the ability to build another name out of these vowels.While contemplating Sickert's penchant for name changes, I turned over in my head Walter Sickert and Jack the Ripper. The two names had the same ring. What accounted for this? I did the obvious thing and counted letters. Each name consisted of thirteen, but this numerical equivalence did not come close to explaining the eerie similarity. I had it. If you speak the names, they are rhythmically identical. A poet would observe that each contains four syllables forming two trochees. Was there more? Yes indeed. The same four vowels appear in the same order in Walter Sickert and Jack the Ripper. Each vowel is bracketed by consonants, and all the vowels are short.If the police catch an individual running out of a stranger's house at 3:00 AM carrying a television, then we have either a string of coincidences or a burglary. Either a string of coincidences connect the first Jack the Ripper letter to Walter Sickert, or he wrote and signed it. I vote for the latter."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a person who HAS to finish a book once I start it. I am one third through this book and am considering putting it away. It is full of phrases like \\"he may have...but he may not have\\" in many MANY MANY different chapters and contexts.

Unbelievable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Her first mistake is in the title. If should just read &quot;Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper&quot; and that is it, forget about the 'Case Closed' bit. As a very avid fan of Cornwell, I find it very surprising to find that she has made such a strong judgement on Walter Sickert in this book to proclaim his guilt so definitively with such circumstantial evidence. I do, however, agree that Walter Sicker was not a man in his right mind and perhaps killed women himself at some point. His hatred of women is relentless as has been well documented in other writing but that can only be a contribution to her investigation and not used as evidence as she has done in this book. I am also surprised that she has put her reputation on the line as being someone who has to see hard cast evidence and enough of it to prove guilt to just dismiss this side of her for this book. I feel that she had already proven Sickert's guilt in her own mind before starting her full investigation and used the investigation as her justification to back her opinions up. On the other hand, it is very telling that so much of her time and efforts (even more than her other works) have been put into this case. She has researched so much and yet her evidence still only points in one direction. Sickert could well have been the killer but I still see the case as open and that Cornwell's investigation, although contributes well to finding the killer, is not enough to prove that it was, in fact, Walter Sickert. I did, however find the book entertaining and a gripping read and also educational of that time period. It was very detailed in so many areas, it was excellent to learn those points in itself. I still recommend it for those reasons but not to commit guilt to this man."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell seems not to have read the large body of research done on Jack the Ripper. She proposes a case which hinges on the idea that many, maybe most, of the several hundred &quot;Ripper&quot; letters that were sent to the authorities were written by the real Ripper who was, in fact, Walter Sickert. She asserts that an artist could easily diguise his handwriting but offers no expert corroboration or proof. The touted DNA evidence is equally suspect. This is a disappointing book for anyone who has read anything about Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"An arrogant, self-serving piece of garbage. Ms. Cornwell's arguments are self-referential. At the start of her book, for example, she claims that Sickert's three operations on his penis left him unable to perform sexually (though she later points out that she cannot possibly know any details about the results of the operations, because no records remain on that issue). Later, she takes her own specious \\"facts\\" as the basis for claims that Sickert's impotence was a source of his murderous rage. This book abounds with this sort of slapdash \\"research\\" and so rather than write an essay here, I will disagree with a previous reviewer who said \\"Don't waste your time.\\" It is never a waste of time to examine a sterling example of a category, even if that category is \\"Poorly Written Tripe.\\" Just get it from the library so you won't be adding to her highly publicized millions (How did she get so rich!?!?

Nor have I felt like such a complete sucker for quite some time.From the haughty title of \\"case closed\\", one would presume to find rock-solid evidence inside to substantiate the author's claim that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. But after reading the book straight through, all I came up with were a bunch of \\"maybe's\\", \\"possibly's\\", and \\"could have's\\". All \\"case closed\\" assertions aside, the book might still have been an interesting, if not truthful read had Cornwell's presentation been something more than a cluttered, sloppy tirade of man-hating psychobabble.And \\"cluttered\\" barely begins to describe the whacked-out narrative here. This book has no flow. It reads like a free-association session on a thereapist's couch with Cornwell shifting gears like she was driving an 18-wheeler. I found it impossible to accept even the illusion of Sickert's guilt, much less become factually convinced. The lack of footnotes, careful consideration of ALL suspects, and any kind of objectivity further infuriated me (at myself) for forking out $25 for this swill.If you don't mind rambling fiction then, by all means, feel free to donate to the Patricia Cornwell fund.

She also makes much of Sickert's style and subjects in his paintings.This book was difficult to read because of its lack of a chronology of the murders, and because of its disjointed style.Based on this book and Cornwell's \\"evidence\\", Walter Sickert is the least likely suspect I've come across."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I haven't read any of Patricia Cornwell's novels before; I only read this one because I am mildly interested in the Jack the Ripper case, and have read a few good books on the topic, including &quot;From Hell,&quot; a fantastic graphic novel by Alan Moore.I had been to Ms. Cornwell's website, read the first chapter, read several interviews about the book, and it sounded intriguing, and perfectly plausible that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper.I still think that it's quite possible he was the killer, but if so, Ms. Cornwell makes her case quite poorly. It seems that more evidences needs to be accumulated, and perhaps someone with more criminal background or experience in writing non-fiction should cover the case if it continues to develop. Ms. Cornwell splices forensic science with second-rate art criticism rhetoric and out of context descriptions of life in Whitechapel, speculations on Mr. Sickert's daily habits, all in one jumbled mess. Had this been a criminal case and she was prosecuting Mr. Sickert, Ms. Cornwell would have failed miserably and boringly.I advise others to skip the book, just look at her website, or if you really want to, get the book from the library.

The title interested me, so I checked it out. I was expecting a pretty solid case since the author was claiming the case was closed, but I didn't find that. Instead, a weak circumstantial case was presented, and I was left wondering how the author could have convinced herself that Sickert was Ripper, for she surely didn't convince me.Ms. Cornwell is very fond of drifting far away from the topic at hand - she starts talking about how the bodies of the prostitutes weren't studied well, and ends up talking about a man who died on a toilet during her career, and she devotes a few pages to \\"The Elephant Man,\\" Joseph Merrick, who has absolutely no connection with either Sickert or the Ripper except they lived in England during the same time period. Annoyingly enough, Ms. Cornwell pretty much uses \\"Sickert\\" and \\"Jack the Ripper\\" interchangeably, leaving me wondering how much of the information Cornwell presented about Sickert was factual, and how much was conjecture or something Jack the Ripper did.Ms. Cornwell may be fond of going off in tangents, but she's even more fond of leaping to conclusions that have little, if any, basis in facts. She knows that Sickert has a \\"fistula\\" that required three surgeries when he was a boy. She believes the nephew of Sickert's third wife when he describes what the fistula is (honestly, how much could he have possibly known about Sickert's medical history and problems? That just struck me as odd), and suddenly concludes that Sickert is a deformed psychopath (a word she loves to use, very frequently) who is unable to have relations with a woman, so he must kill and steal parts of prostitutes' organs because he wants to see what had brought his deformed self into this world. Seriously. And that's not the only leaps she made, either.Ms. Cornwell put much emphasis on the Ripper letters. Most people, including those who were working the investigation as it happened, discounted many of the Ripper letters as fake. Cornwell believes that most of the Ripper letters are not hoaxes, but are mostly written by Jack the Ripper/Sickert. There is no concrete evidence of this, although she does bring in a few experts to claim that she could be right (although other experts would disagree with them). She just asks us to believe her. Even if Sickert HAD written a Ripper letter or two, that wouldn't implicate him. People write fake letters in high-profile cases all the time. Remember the anthrax letter scare in the fall of 2001? People sent fake anthrax letters in the mail. Sure, they had very warped senses of \\"humor,\\" but come on, that doesn't mean they were responsible for the real letters. In a similar vein, even IF Sickert had sent a Ripper letter in, that didn't make him Jack the Ripper. In Ms. Cornwell's world, though, if Sickert sent in a Ripper letter, he HAD to be the Ripper.Ms. Cornwell does not make much of an effort to convince the reader that Sickert is really Jack the Ripper. Instead, she pretty much says that Sickert is Jack the Ripper, and spends several chapters trying to determine why Sickert did what he did. The book read like a prosecutor's weak case - it would only take a moderately good defense lawyer to rip the case against Sickert to shreds.It's obvious that she did a lot of research for this book. I think the book does a pretty good job of painting a realistic, dismal picture of what life was like for the poor living in Victorian London. She even raises a few interesting points about Sickert. Maybe he is Jack the Ripper. Maybe he's not. Who knows? At this point in time, I think it's virtually impossible to close this case. And for Ms. Cornwell to state \\"Jack the Ripper...is caught\\" at the end of the book is ludicrous. He's not caught, the case is not closed. To claim otherwise, especially with such a weak circumstantial case, is pure nonsense."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"For someone who writes excellent mystery novels, this book is a mess. It badly needs a good editor to point out the writing faults. For some strange reason Ms. Cornwell can not stay on one subject making it extremely difficult to read and follow. She will make a statement about a certain happening and then go off on two or three semi-related tangents that may or not be pertinent to the statement and never come back to the main topic. It is like a stream of consciousness session that rambles all over the place.There was a TV special featuring Ms. Cornwell giving her theories on the Ripper and it was BORING. It seemed possible from that program that the book would be the same - and it is. But at least the TV editor could keep the thoughts together as the book editor did not.Ms. Cornwell does not convince a reader that she has truly solved the Ripper murders. She has strong ideas, many already proven false. It is an interesting set of possibilities, but nothing that will actually close the case.Years ago there was a book ,\\"Prince Jack\\", that contained just as many facts and possibilities that a member of the royal family was the Ripper. It was better written than Ms. Cornwell's book, but left just as many unanswered questions and possible false statements.Jack the Ripper remains an unsolved enigma."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I finished \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" last night. The book was not one I would have chosen because I have lately tired of Cornwell's fiction, but as a Christmas gift from a friend,I read it. Only now have I looked at the Amazon.com reviews and guess what? I agree with almost all of the objections and petty complaints of the majority of the reviewers. Yes, it is overwritten, arrogant and sometimes illogical, but (and oh,what a \\"but\\") it is fascinating and compelling and altogether a great read. She has convinced me that Walter Sickert did write many of the Ripper letters although his guilt as the murderer remains in question. But never mind, for some reason I cannot explain, this flawed book is a page turner and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is a book is more fiction than fact. It seems like she chose a suspect before she even did any research and then tries to piece together anything she could to try and point the finger at her target. A lot of her evidence is sketchy at best and completely wrong at worse. There has already been a program on tv that completely discredited alot of her supposed &quot;evidence&quot;. Don't waste your time or money of this book unless you're looking for another fictional mystery book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've read and generally enjoyed a number of Patricia Cornwell's novels. If she were a writer of a bit more credibility and stature, I might have taken this book as a clever literary joke -- something like Nabokov's &quot;Pale Fire&quot; -- in which an increasingly over-the-top narrator (in this case, Cornwell herself!) constructs an increasingly ludicrous fantasy world while slipping further and further from reality.Sadly, I don't think that was Cornwell's intention, and unfortunately, about the best I can say for this book is it might have made a good joke. Might have, that is, had her publishers bothered hiring an editor with at least a high-school education to clean up the hopelessly turgid and meandering writing style -- it still amazes me that a tale as compelling as the Ripper's could be told in as dull and aimless a fashion as Cornwell has managed.As for the &quot;evidence&quot; on which Cornwell has based her conclusion that the Ripper case is now closed, as numerous other reviewers have already pointed out, there is almost no substance there at all -- it's all a product of Cornwell's overheated imagination, which moves from mere possibility to probability to &quot;fact&quot; without ever skipping a beat. There are many, many moments of truly Kinbotian fantasy -- a visit to a country inn where Sickert &quot;might have&quot; stayed (no evidence whatsoever that he did) and entries in the inn's guestbook which Sickert &quot;might have&quot; written (had he been disguising his writing!!).For a while, the whole thing is so obviously ludicrous that it the book is genuinely amusing. Unfortunately, laughing with an author like Nabokov can be great sustained fun, but laughing at an author like Patricia Cornwell simply becomes tiresome after a while. Overall, I would agree heartily with Caleb Carr, who reviewed this book for the New York Times and called it &quot;a sloppy book, insulting to both its target and its audience.&quot;"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell has the arrogance to claim, &quot;Case Closed&quot; in the title of her new book. As an &quot;amature Ripperologist&quot; who has studied and read about all there is on Jack the Ripper, this is probably one of the worst books ever written on this subject. It is hard to believe that Cornwell actually did the research she claimed to have done, only to write a book filled with unlikely assumptions and &quot;what if's&quot; on evidence that at the very most, is barely circumstantial. The only thing that Cornwell proves is that there is a very strong chance that Sickert himself became so obsessed with the case that he interjected himself into it by writing and sending his own Ripper letters to the Metropolitan Police Dept. Her book claims that Sickert had no children, yet her research failed to point out one possability. Most Ripper enthusiasts will fail to recognize that she neglected to mention that Sickert possibly did have a son, which was mentioned in Stephan Knight's book, &quot;The Final Solution.&quot; I almost gave up half way through, but held on hoping that at some point Cornwell would reveal some kind of smoking gun, or in this case, knife, but none was forthcoming. The only thing that Cornwell and her so-called research proves is that this case if far from closed, but still WIDE open."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If this book reveals anything it is the grotesque hubris of Patricia Cornwell herself in giving her book such a ludicrous title. She had added nothing to the debate as to the identity of Jack the Ripper and has instead pushed her theory about Sickert, irrespective of the lack of real evidence. The author truly seems to believe that if she could prove that Sickert wrote the ripper letters, which she can not, then it would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt he actually committed the murders. The fact it has subsequently emerged that Sickert was almost certainly in France with his family the night of the double murder also makes her conclusion dubious in the extreme. I have never read any of Cornwell's fiction but I assume it must be somewhat more worthy than this drivel. A feeble effort and a waste of money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Not for the first time in a century and a quarter the case of Jack the Ripper has finally been solved. Sadly, for Patricia Cornwell, this won't be the last time is if finally solved either. Famous for her \\"Kay Scarpetta\\" mysteries author Cornwall throws in lot of money and adds her gripping narrative talent towards proving that the ripper is an artist and dilettante. Her main proof is that he might have written some letters to newspapers claiming to be the infamous Jack.Truth may be stranger than fiction but the annoying part is that it also has to be true. The definitive evidence Cornwell and her crack team find when they examine 100 year old evidence is far from conclusive in most people's opinions. However, most people do not have the kind of money invested in the case that she has, so her bias might be a little strong towards beliefthan doubt. Cornwell writes a good story and sets the stage well for London during those horrific months of terror and years of wondering, but her insistence on solving the case definitively takes away a lot of the fun that might otherwise be had.High Marks for enthusiasim. Low for definativness."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Despite all of the negative reviews I wanted to read this book to find out for myself if it was really as bad as the critics have said. And.....it really was. I was most surprised that, for an accomplished writer, Patricia Cornwell wrote with such a lack of focus. It was as if she took a shotgun approach - blasting out clusters of speculations in hopes that some might randomly find the mark and stick as facts. The previous reviewers have all done a thorough job in delineating all of the non-facts and fallacies in her argument for fingering Walter Sickert as the infamous Jack the Ripper. No need to be redundant here.I did give \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" a generous two-star rating because a) I did finish the book, and b) it did contain a modicum of interest for me. However, in the end it was a totally unconvincing and unsatisfying read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell obviously put-in a good deal of work to write this book. She presents a decent amount of information and findings to support her theory. Given the time which has passed since the crimes and the poor quality of detective work done at the time, she probably presents most of what is available. She also spends a good deal of time defending the theory that Jack the Ripper carried-out more than the 5 killings for which he is best known. However, this book is poorly written. The entire useful portion of this book takes-up 100 pages or less. The rest of the book is babble, including speculations such as Jack the Ripper may have stood in a certain place and watched the detectives work or that he may have frequented a certain bar or eaten at a certain restaurant, etc.. Frankly, Ms. Cornwell comes-off as a snob in this book. She is very critical of the detective work done at the time. That in itself is fine, but she does it in a way that is more arrogant than truly critical. Overall this book presents an interesting theory with a fair amount of evidence to support it. However, it is written in such a drawn-out and arrogant way that it is difficult to read with any enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present, and was very eager to read it. That enthusiasm began to fade with each passing page of this book. I have enjoyed reading this author's other works, but this was like watching paint dry. There is no suspense, and nothing in this book really grabs your attention. The evidence offered is, at most, inconclusive, and I don't think people need to read this book to realize that forensics in 19th century England was not as developed as it is today.In light of the content of the book, I find the title misleading. If you feel you must read this, get it from the library."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell has earned the Erich von Daniken prize for crime reporting."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Endless and tedious investigation of circumstancial evidence. I am convinced that Sickert may well be \\"Jack\\" but the case is not closed. Mostly I was irritated by the author's description of his paintings as evidence of his murderous personality, but without the corresponding illustrations, the basis escaped me. An okay historical perspective on the times of Jack the Ripper, an incomplete biography of Walter Sickert, a good but not complete attempt to convict him (the case is not closed). I only finished it because I kept hoping it would get better, but the last few chapters became even more rambling and disorienting."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I belong to a book group, and this is our pick for June, Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer -- Case Closed. This is my first reading of any of Cornwell's books and will likely be my last. I did not find this book gave me any concrete evidence, but, lots of circumstantial evidence. I couldn't find any hard evidence to support her contention that WS was the Ripper. I suppose I expected something quite diffrent from a woman who is a forensic expert and should not jump to conclusions. Besides, who wants to know who the Ripper really was, not me. I prefer to keep on reading various books about Jack and drawing my own conclusion. I am going to London on June 1st and I will take in the Ripper Walks, the London Dungeon and Victorian London, I am sure I will enjoy this more then I did Cornwells book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell's attempt to name the person who was &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; fails miserably. She does not have one shred of real evidence to back up her theory. My recommendation is that she stick to fiction. Oh, wait! That is what this book is!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Let me start by admitting I'm not a \\"Ripperologist.\\" And let me add that I applaud Cornwell's getting DNA off a stamp from the 1800's. That aside, this book didn't break any new ground. Sickert was considered a theoretical suspect by many people. He painted somewhat disturbing pictures and was reported to be impotent. Okay, that's old news, but he wasn't quite ready to get a Viagra prescription. He was married (at least) 3 times and had numerous illegitimate children. It doesn't sound like he had many problems getting sex. As for the *grotesque* paintings and some looking like morgue photographs/photos of Ripper victims...did the man ever look at a newspaper? Perhaps that's where he got his inspiration. Okay, it's kinda creepy, and a little morbid. Cornwell states that DNA from a stamp of his matched DNA from a Ripper letter. Once again, the guy's a little weird, obviously. However, writing a few letters and slaughtering prostitutes are two very different things. Another point in Sickert's defense is that he died in 1942. You might wonder how that fact might be important. Most (yes, I know there are exceptions) serial killers either stop killing because of imprisonment or death. The Ripper murders ended long before Sickert did. Just a thought there. There are places in the book in which Cornwell admits she doesn't know Sickert's whereabouts (at the time of X Ripper murder.) Then in the next sentence she claims she was 'sure he was in London' Well, if you can't verify someone was AT the murder scene, you probably shouldn't accuse them of the murder. The Ripper murders will probably never be solved, and I think a lot of people actually want it that way. So, to sum up: Sickert's DNA links him to some Ripper letters. He paints pictures of dead women, some mutilated. He must be Jack! Well, that's what I got from the book anyway."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Once you get over the arrogance of the subtitle: \\"Jack The Ripper, case closed\\", and start reading the book, what the reader finds is a collection of mostly circumstantial evidence. A previous reviewer had already mentioned the mDNA evidence. At best this proves that Sickert wrote some hoax letters. From what Cornwell describes of Sickert's unpleasant character, I can readily believe that he indeed did pen some hoax letters. This is the strongest thread connecting the Ripper to Sickert. As for the rest, it is merely circumstantial. The case for Sickert as the Ripper that Cornwell builds is certainly a possibility, but nothing more than that. A possibility. For Cornwell to describe the matter as case closed is a case of sheer arrogance. She does very little to rebut the case for the other key suspects. Druitt is a suspect she does dwell on, as is the Duke of Clarence, for a short while in the book. There are as most Ripperlogists will know other likely candidates; Ostrog and Chapman are two such candidates that spring to mind.Cornwell's book is interesting reading, mainly because it is a splendid example of fitting the available evidence to suit a particular suspect. I chose to give the book only 2 stars, partly because of the title, but also because I felt the subject matter is unbalanced. Cornwell comes across as being one eyed; she was out to get her man, and damn any evidence that might suggest some other person (or persons) may be responsible for the Whitechapel murders. It is still a worthwhile read if only to see how a case for a particular person can be built from circumstanial evidence.I became interested in the Jack the Ripper legend since watching the movie \\"From Hell\\" (which requires perhaps an even greater suspension of belief than is needed for this book; none the less the movie is quite good) and have since read a few books on the subject. Philip Sudgen's book is an excellent read, and I recommend it to other readers. What I have gathered from the material I have read, it is that we will never know who Jack the Ripper really was. Too much time has gone by, evidence has been lost or destroyed, and there are too many suspects. Any book that closes the case to this story has yet to be authored, and probably never will be."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell claims she can 'prove' Sickert was the killer by comparing his handwriting with the Ripper letters, which are widely regarded as hoaxes. She also insists that to have painted his famous autopsy pictures Sickert 'must have viewed the body' as 'he never painted anything he didn't see.' Any casual student of his art is aware that Sickert painted from photographs throughout his career.Sickert experts have also refuted Ms Cornwells claims by providing extensive documentation proving Sickert was on vacation with his family in France when the Ripper killings were taking place in London.Cornwell should be ashamed of herself, as should anyone who concludes that Sickert was Jack the Ripper from the 'evidence' contained in this very poor, flimsy book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"the documentation put forth, the time doing research and the years of experience all came to a wonderful circumstatial case that would stand up better in any court today than some trials I've watched on courtTV!Excellent work Ms. Corwnell! What's next?!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell has given us the solution to a real mystery this time in her latest book, an investigation into the disturbing life of Walter Sickert, English artist and, it now appears irrefutably true, Jack the Ripper. Cornwell did an amazing amount of research, including DNA analysis of stamps and envelope flaps, and comes up with compelling though circumstantial evidence that Sickert was the Ripper.Sickert has been named before as a possible Ripper or as being involved in a cover up of the Ripper's identity, but Cornwell is the first to actually sew all the pieces together for a complete portrait. Sickert was a tortured man, a psychopath warped by a malformed penis which was made even less functional by botched surgeries when he was a child. He delighted in inflicting pain and in hurting those whom he deemed his inferiors. While there is no smoking gun, no confession or eyewitness account, Cornwell does pile up the evidence against Sickert so that it seems irrefutable. Along the way she also does a good job of convicting the London police of incompetence in mishandling evidence and failing to put the pieces together. She also provides strong evidence that the Ripper had a much longer career and many more victims than those usually awarded him. Furthermore, Cornwell exonerates some of the other Ripper suspects like Montague John Druitt and the Duke of Clarence (second in line to the throne). Even if she had not summed up the case against Sickert so well, this would be a worthwhile book just because it puts to rest the tired old rumors of a Royal and/or Masonic conspiracy behind the Ripper murders.Finally, Cornwell convincingly recreates the sad, impoverished world inhabited by Sickert's victims. London in the late nineteenth century was no place to be if you were poor or especially a poor woman. One feels so much pity for all of these women, forced into prostitution and despised for it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Why am I giving this book 5 stars? I suppose it's an \\"A\\" for effort. I have REALLY mixed feelings about this one, which is very unusual for me as I'm almost never a fence-sitter. In fact, I'm MUCH more renowned for being a grouchy old curmudgeon with unyielding views. But Cornwell, in solving this most famous of all serial murders, has actually CREATED a bit of a mess via her incongruous conveyance of the facts. This one recalls to mind Marcia Clark's mishandling of the O.J. Simpson case -- I BELIEVE Clark presented more than adequate evidence that old O.J. did it... but she just TICKED EVERYBODY OFF in the way that she did so!Jack the Ripper plagued London's White Chapel district throughout the year 1888, (The same year as when the Hatfields killed several of the McCoys by burning them up in their mountaintop cabin!), and the list of suspect's since that heinous year of murder has been lengthy -- but DNA is pretty compelling stuff and that is the very pinnacle of Cornwell's evidence. Case Closed? I say, \\"Yes\\".However, in solving this long-standing mystery, Cornwell seems to have really ticked people off -- I think a lot of folks really DESIRED that these grisly serial murders remain an eternal mystery, much like the thoughts of those folks who cling to \\"The Grassy Knoll\\" theory of the Kennedy assasination. I wouldn't want to be the guy who dispells THAT one either!*.*And, I have to agree with a lot of people here that Patricia Cornwell, somehow, comes off as \\"hubristic\\" and \\"arrogant\\" in this work. The Hell of it is, I can't exactly put my finger on HOW she's been a snoot.... but it's in there, I'm certain of it!Getting directly to the purpose of my review of this book, DO I RECOMMEND IT? Definitely. BUT, are readers going to feel personally satiated for having read it??? I don't think so. I think that people who read this book might feel \\"talked down to,\\" to some degree.So, as I have said, I believe that she's clearly, (or, unclearly), done it. But, because of human nature, she is apparently not going to be thanked for it. Maybe just a tad of humility in the title would have helped. Or, maybe people just savour Sickert's paintings so well that they wanted someone else to have been Jack the Ripper! \\"Lazarus Breaks His Fast\\" is my favorite artwork of all time....

The ending about the events at Sickert's second wife's funeral had absolutely nothing to do with the book (unless Ms. Cornwell was trying to input some type of symbology into the end, which I didn't catch). Ms. Cornwell did do what she wanted to do in this book because I am sold on the idea that Sickert was Jack the Ripper, I just don't think that this book was very well written.

She writes about the period as if she experienced it herself, displaying a deep understanding of the time, and a great knowledge of the era shown in the many, many magical details she incorporates into the writing, which simply make the book come alive. She makes every aspect of the book so damn interesting, and so i did find it very hard to put down (even for non-fiction, which can rarely be termed \\"exciting\\")Aside from her brilliance at describing Victorian life, she argues her case for Jack the Ripper's identity very well, inserting so many small pieces of evidence in with the more major ones that the reader will find it very hard to ignore the strong possibility that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. After all, it is practically impossible that all the many, many pieces of circumstance and just coincidental. Even if a few are, many will still stand and implicate Sickert as the Ripper.I have to say, i am not convinced Sickert is the Ripper, though. (only about 85%) But then, i will NEVER be convinced of the true identity of the Ripper, because the crimes are now so old it is impossible that we will ever know for absolute certain, no matter how strong the cases for several of the suspects are. It is possibly, therefore, a little pretentious of the publishers to proclaim \\"Case Closed\\", but then, of course, if they weren't convinced themselves, or prepared to pretend they were convinced, then this book would carry very little credibility.I'm very impressed with the huge volumes of research Cornwell must have done. Ity really shows, not only in how much info she has amassed about Sickert's life, and trhe lives of those around him, but in the masses of period detail.It is incredibly unfair that people have criticised this book so much. It may not be conclusive, but no Jack the Ripper book ever will be. People immediately jump at her throat claiming there is proof that \\"Sickert was in France during the killings\\", but not once has anyone mentioned what this proof actually is, where it can be found, etc. And, honestly, does anyone think that this book would EVER have been published if it could be proved conclusively that Sickert was not even in the country at the time? Of course it wouldn't have been. And thus, it cannot be proved.This is a fascinating book, especially in her analysis of the Ripper letters as compared to Sickert's, and Sickert's artwork when compared to the crime scenes (which were seen by very very few people). the evidence of the guestbook is particularly interesting. Also compelling is the psychological portrait Cornwell paints of Sickert, from what she has learned about his actions and the events of his life. All in all, his personality just \\"clicks\\" when you think of how similar it is to those of killers already caught...Not necesarrily conclusive, but fascinatingly written, and Cornwell presents a good case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I just read \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper -- Case Closed\\" by Patricia Cornwell, who's not only a bestselling author, but also the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine chairman of the board.In the book, Cornwell accumulates a spectacular amount of circumstantial evidence to prove that British painter Walter Sickert was the infamous Whitechapel serial killer, including some interesting analysis of Sickert's paintings.Although Ms. Cornwell's detractors and Sickert's defenders are many, the tantalizing evidence of DNA is too hard to dismiss, and I for one do not believe in coincidences. Apparently, Sickert has been a suspect for many years, and Cornwell has just tied the case into a tight, if not so neat, package.I found the analysis of the artists' doodles (and compared to the Ripper's doodles), as well as evidence from his letters and recollection of his friends, to be a pointer to the case; however, the bit of DNA closes it for me.This book is a terrific read, and Cornwell has convinced me that the case is closed!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was a Christmas present. By April, I had only made it halfway through. Why? I haven't been able to read more than three pages without falling into a nice, deep sleep."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"For more than a century, the mystery of \\"who was Jack the Ripper\\" has fascinated both sides of the Atlantic. Who perpetrated the brutal murders of so many Whitechapel prostitutes in England in the late 1800s? And why?Numerous theories have been put forth over the decades: a lunatic, a crazed doctor, a member of the royal family, a famous artist. And now, for the first time, someone has taken Scotland Yard's evidence, along with other letters and ephemera, and applied modern-day forensic science to the still-open investigation.The someone is Patricia Cornwell, author of the critically acclaimed Kay Scarpetta mystery series and a forensic specialist herself. The results, while not entirely convincing, are compelling.Cornwell asserts, with great confidence, that Jack the Ripper was the impressionist artist Walter Richard Sickert, an apprentice to Whistler, and, in his own right, a highly accomplished and recognized artist. In fact, Cornwell posits that Sickert's work is perhaps one of the greatest clues of his culpability. First, his paintings are menacing and threatening, particularly towards women of a lower class. Also, known as an artist who painted what he saw, a few of Sickert's canvasses eerily resemble the Ripper's crime scenes. Coincidence? Perhaps. But Cornwell interprets his work as revelatory, confessional almost. In profiling the famous serial killer she suggests that the Ripper would have been a man who harbored a keen, deep-rooted hatred of women, most likely founded in his own sexual inability or inadequacies. Sickert at a young age underwent a series of corrective penile surgeries, which quite possibly left him impotent. There is no proof one way or another that he was entirely sexually dysfunctional, but there are hints at problems that lend some credence to Cornwell's theory.The Ripper did not exist in a vacuum, and Cornwell did an extraordinary job of setting the scene, placing the reader in late 1800 England. Detailed references to John Merrick (the elephant man), Henry Irving (one of the stage's greatest stars of the time), Henry James (author and constable) and others frame Cornwell's story. The Ripper was very much a part of the happenings of the time, and his name was as likely to be found in the pages of the newspaper as any of the abovementioned notables. Sickert, a voracious reader with morbid sensibilities would have been captivated by the stories of the Ripper. As a prankster and prolific writer, he might even have been tempted to pen a faux Ripper letter or two to the police or the daily paper. (At the time, many of the Ripper letters were thought to be hoaxes.) As a murderer, if he was a murderer, Sickert's well-known vanity would have thrilled at and thrived on the publicity. To be mentioned on the same pages as royalty and celebrities would have fed his hungry ego.Cornwell offered much supposition and hints at Sickert's guilt. For instance, he was a master of disguise and could have easily lured a prostitute to her death and then escaped undetected, Cornwell suggests. He was enthralled by the music halls and the \\"unfortunates\\" who frequented them, and he was known to walk the streets of the Whitechapel area late at night for long periods of time. He had an unhealthy fascination of the anatomy of the human body that went far beyond an artist's natural curiosity. And the Ripper letters included allusions Sickert would have known and drawings in the fashion of Sickert's own work.From DNA to mitochondrial DNA, from handwriting experts to watermark experts, from newspaper articles to authentic Sickert paintings, Cornwell left no stone unturned. She described in lay terms --- using easily understood analogies --- the forensic methodologies she and her impressive crew of colleagues used in their thorough investigation. Along the way she spent an exorbitant amount of money trying to prove his guilt. (She even went so far as to purchase several of his paintings, and destroyed one in the hopes of finding conclusive evidence.) The science is fascinating, albeit more often inconclusive than convincing. Her research did not always glean the results she had hoped for. But taken all together, the evidence, mostly circumstantial, is damning and probably would have been enough in today's court system to bring Sickert to trial.Case Closed? I can't say I was convinced by book's end that Sickert was indeed the Ripper. I wanted a smoking gun that left no room for doubt, and Cornwell did not deliver a smoking gun because she did not find one. She found compelling evidence that makes the strongest case of guilt to date. But with no death bed confession, or bloodstained canvasses, or eyewitness reports, we will never really know his innocence or guilt. The strong science, the history lesson, and the story of Sickert's life make PORTRAIT OF A KILLER an intriguing read, and on those fronts I recommend the book. But I leave you to decide for yourself if she has found enough evidence to label Sickert the Ripper --- or not.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Sadly this book goes nowhere. After the first few chapters in which Ms Cornwell attempts to make her case the book becomes a boring restatement of the premise. The book should have been no more than a 50 page magazine article. Ms. Cornwell should have saved the millions of dollars she spent on this project and donated it to something more worthy."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was interested in this book because of the prime suspect, Walter Sickert. Sickert was a genuinely good and important English artist and I was surprised that he is considered &quot;the Ripper&quot; by Cornwell. She makes a fun, readable case but that doesn't mean it's convincing if you look at other viewpoints. I find her psychology rather silly and she seems ignorant of certain facts about 19th century artists, such as the fact they often painted prostitutes as models. In addition, her interpretation of Sickert's artwork wouldn't be taken seriously by any Art Historian and is highly subjective. Nevertheless, I found it pretty entertaining reading and I hope it will make people take a look at Sickert's actual artwork, which is pretty good."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"\\"Solving , or attempting to solve, old \`unsolvable' crimes of murder is finding truth, justice, compassion and dignity denied to those victims who have no voice.\\"People have pet theories about Jack the Ripper.....like the Kennedy assassination. People chose to believe only what they want to believe. ...An open mind and a balanced viewpoint are needed to appreciate this remarkable book.The Ripper murders were almost certainly committed by a perfectly sane, psychopathic serial killer who was also sexually frustrated and/or impotent....P>Walter Sickert was a talented actor and artist who, in his personal life, showed a type of psychopathic personality. He probably was a classic psychopath. He was possibly impotent.Many of his paintings were very dark and disturbing, sometimes morbid and violent. . Some of his art could easily be called \\"psychopathic murder art,\\" \\"horror art,\\" or \\"snuff art.\\"He drew his own violent pornography...mutilated women..... or erotic and/or sinister sketches of women being attacked or menaced by men. He was prolific in this \\"pastime;\\" somewhat similar to a modern-day psychopath collecting violent magazines, videos, or snuff movies.The strongest evidence is mitochondrial DNA from saliva on the back of a stamp on a Ripper letter. This was matched to DNA from his personal stationery.With a probability of 90-99%, he was almost certainly the author of two to three of the 211 letters supposedly sent by the Ripper to the Police and to other places.There is more than a coincidence here.One or more of these same letters was a \\"confession.\\" This is very strong prima facie evidence.Other, unmatched, evidence (stationery watermarks and handwriting analysis) shows that the writer of these same letters was almost certainly an artist. He was very possibly the author of most of the others.The strong anecdotal evidence of his psychopathic personality and some evidence of alleged sexual dysfunction do closely tie in with Douglas' profile of the Ripper in \\"The Cases That Still Haunt Us\\"There is a link here that is not final, not definitive, but much too important to ignore.Together with the other \\"evidence\\" it compels and points to one person who might today possibly be committed for trial on the total evidence available. (A conviction might be difficult with a good defence lawyer!)At the time of the killings, with the absence of any other clear suspects and with today's evidence and knowledge, there is no doubt that he would have easily been convicted.In his life he was a misogynist (not uncommon in that age!) and a compulsive, almost pathological letter writer, a night-time street rambler and insomniac, very familiar with Whitechapel and the East End of London, where the most publicised murders occurred. He had a habit of disappearing for long periods. He was known to have several \\"bolt-holes\\" (secret residences) in the area at all times. He had an unpleasant habit of staring fixedly at people for long periods.All of this behaviour may not be unusual for an artist. It also, however, provided him with ample opportunity.The \\"prolonged, fixed stare\\" is a universal characteristic of psychopathic people.If he was not the actual Ripper, there is a strong suggestion that he had deep fantasies about being the Ripper and possibly committed several \\"copycat\\" or \\"imitation\\" murders.There is also a powerful reason to suspect that if he was not the actual murderer, he had some very sinister connection with the crimes. If definitely not the actual murderer, there is an overwhelming sense that he at least knew the Ripper intimately, and personally, and sketched the actual killings.He may also have written letters claiming to have committed other similar murders in other parts of London and England. He travelled extensively across England and also to France.On the evidence of the DNA, the Artist type letters, and his psychopathic personality, I would say that he is the definitely \\"the very, very best, most promising, suspect to date.\\"It's ridiculous for Cornwell to suggest that the book has been criticised because she is female and American. It has mostly been criticised because it pretentiously claims to be \\"case closed\\" (when it is nothing of the sort), and because she colours most of the work with an assumption that because Sickert was a famous misogynist, then he must have been guilty. (In a misogynist age? He was only one of a number.)But its critics do not understand that her work is groundbreaking and very important, and delivers probably the best, most believable theory to date.The book is full of irritating structural problems, omissions, irrelevant details and useless tangents. It has no useful footnotes, cross-links or cross-references to other crucial experts and evidence. .... but no other book has been able to thoroughly cover all of the available evidence or discuss completely all the non-available Ripper evidence anyway.The book has many flaws.It does promise a lot more than it actually delivers.But....no other book, to my knowledge, has delivered such a compelling result, in 114 years.This is the first time a Jack the Ripper suspect with a classic psychopathic personality has been possibly linked to strong DNA evidence.At its worst, it's no worse than all the other Ripper theories...at its best, it at least has some tangible evidence to show.......the other theories don't.A large quantity of sometimes-ambiguous circumstantial evidence completes a very creditable theory on this 114-year-old case of the first modern serial killer.Absolutely not \\"case closed.\\" But Walter Sickert, definitely, for this reader at least, has \\"a prima facie case to answer.\\"Well done, Patricia Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There is not a shred of evidence linking Sickert to these killings.

While the basic theory may be interesting, it is haphazard at best in this book and is not convincing at all. Just because Sickert painted scenes that could be construed as \\"Ripperish\\" does not mean he was there. Another poster has stated that artists paint what they are interested in..... This does not necessarily mean they were INVOLVED.

I was very disappointed. Many of her points only work if you're willing to go waaaaaaay out on the limb with her, and accept a bunch of &quot;possible&quot; clues, including a host of extra Ripper victims not usually associated with the case.Plus, the book was very disorganized, with no rhyme or reason to how it was arranged. There's a chapter at the end that seems to be more of an afterthought than anything, and should have been towards the beginning during the discussion of other victims. In addition to that, she often goes off on tangents bemoaning the modern forensic methods that were unavailable at the time. Pages are wasted discussing how easily these murders would have been solved if they happened today. Well, duh!I thought it really could have been better, she raises many interesting issues.

I usually enjoy Patricia Cornwell's novels, but this one turned out to be a huge disappointment. I agree with the previous reviewer, in that it should have been titled &quot;Walter Sickerst's Biography&quot;. I found myself extremely bored with the book and would skip ahead to see if it got any more interesting. The writing is chopping and does not flow.

Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"She bases her reputation on THIS?!I, too, had major problems with this book.Pat Cornwell cites many pieces of seemingly irrefutable circumstantial evidence but I have trouble believing that evidence when I see so many illogical or naive conclusions.I will not detail all my problems with her theory but here are two:One is her ideas about the supposed killer's artistic style. When I saw her interview on a news magazine show she was describing Impressionism! Certainly not all of the Impressionist were murderers!A second is her idea that using prostitutes as models somehow made him a prime suspect. Again, in the times, artists often used prostitutes as models as many &quot;respctable&quot; women would not shed their clothes for an artist. Also, Degas, for one, thought they were more &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; than professional models. P.S: Ballet dancers were considered just a step above prostitutes and a number crossed the line.I just cannot take this book seriously. Don't buy it; the other recommended books by a previous reviewer are better."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What's not to like? Murder fans' favorite unidentified serial killer and America's bestselling crime novelist together at last? Who could resist such a pairing! I read the much-anticipated latest from Patricia Cornwell with a great deal of disappointment. The style is tangential (or the organization of the material just escapes me); the evidence to support Sickert's guilt is compelling, but doesn't make for a good read, interspersed as it is with Ms. Cornwell's insistent speculation about his behavior and the meaning/connection of events. There is no tension in this book and, despite her success as a novelist, Ms. Cornwell is neither a forensic pathologist or a psychiatrist--how does she become such an expert on the evidence, then? And where is Kay Scarpetta when we need her most?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When I was in London in 1944, I saw a scary movie, The Lodger, about Jack the Ripper. Afterward, I decided to visit London's Whitechapel district, scene of the murders. Maybe it was the blackout and fog, but the place was creepy. I got the same, creepy feeling from reading Cornwell's book. She is a master writer, and here she intertwines sinister pictures of nights in Whitechapel with analytical findings from a modern forensics laboratory. The London police in 1888 never caught Jack the Ripper, although he wrote letters taunting them. Many men have been suggested to be the murderer, but the results of Cornwell's study point to Walter Sickert(1860-1942), an artist known for his dark paintings. As a scientist, I found the DNA evidence to be especially noteworthy. It showed that the saliva from the backs of stamps on letters from Walter Sickert was 99% likely to be the same as saliva from stamps on letters posted by Jack the Ripper. Cornwell puts together a good case for a mystery more than 100 years old. The book combines the feeling of the late 1800's with depictions of the murders and with forensic analysis in a very readable book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I rather enjoyed this audio, even though it has suffered much backlash. I would hope that people would be as dedicated to solving a mystery killer crime as this author. I find that her claims are not all stupid but to me are most interresting, and that this possible person stated in her audio could very well indeed be the Ripper. There is to many coincidences envloved in the imformation she gives for someone else to be the the killler, also this person dies and the series of ripper type murders than stop. The ripper murders I knew of were only what was talked about on the tv shows in past years, she describes so many murders here that do infact go with the writtings and such of the ripper that this very well could be the true killer. High 5 to you Patricia for giving so much detail and interresting forensic insight."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell comes as close to solving the Jack the Ripper murders as is scientifically and technically possible. There is more to this case than is traditionally associated with the name Jack the Ripper and Cornwell puts it forward brilliantly. She delves into not just the results of the use of the latest forensic science, but into the social mores and customs of the time period. She explains how the formation of the London Police Dept and Scotland Yard only a few years before the murders actually made it easy for the killer as well as encouraged the police and media to dis-associate other murder victims to the case. She also discusses the results of attempts to link the suspected individual and the evidence from Jack the Ripper using DNA samples collected from envelopes and stamps from the actual evidence files at Scotland Yard. Cornwell paints a fascinating portrait of the Ripper murders and her background as a forensic scientist gives an accurate an assessment of the identity of Jack the Ripper as anyone can with modern technology. If these subject matter appeals to you (if you like Discovery Channel's shows on forensic science and CSI, etc) you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"That letters written by Sickert and Jack the Ripper came from the same batch of stationery, and a batch of only 24 sheets, is Cornwell's best evidence--and pretty good evidence, at that. But you could easily miss that skimming through because nobody's going to read this book word for word. Do we really need every speculation that's ever crossed her mind about what a sicky Sickert is?I guess she couldn't get permission to reproduce the paintings of mutilated women which support her argument. Instead we get several photos of Sickert which &quot;show his many faces&quot;--Not. Frankly, he looks intelligent and kindly and not a bulgy-eyed maniac like, say, Ted Bundy.My suggestion for further research: get Don Foster to do a professional comparison of Sickert's and Jack the Ripper's language and publish an article about it rather than a book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is subtitled &quot;Jack the Ripper: Case Closed&quot;. That is a bit of a leap. Then again, &quot;Jack the Ripper: Yet another loosely based theory&quot; just doesn't sound too catchy, does it? I thought this book presented an interesting case, but it had a few definite flaws.First of all, it's very difficult to take &quot;evidence&quot; seriously when the person presenting it is blatantly biased. Cornwell has obviously made her decision about who commited the murders and is unwilling to present material objectively. One of the biggest things that bothered me was that she used quotes out of context to support her point. This bias hurts the purpose of her book greatly.Secondly, this book is disorganized and disjointed. I'm not sure whether it's the fault of the editor or the author, but this book could have used another year of work. Anyone knows that if you want to convince someone of something it's best to be organized. It was clear to me that Cornwell had done a fair amount of research, however, research means nothing when it is not presented in a manner that is understandable.All in all, I enjoyed this book even though it left me somewhat confused and unfullfilled. I wouldn't say that Walter Sickert is without a doubt Jack the Ripper, but I'm willing to accept him as a likely suspect. If Cornwell had been able to abandon her bias and put together a reasonably organized book I think her case would be much easier for me to stomach."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is the very first book by Pat Cornwell that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it as I am fascinated by true crime and forensics. Pat gives an account of two people: the life of Richard Sickert and what anyone can glean from the evidence of Jack the Ripper and she lets the reader be the judge. All of us know that someone was indeed Jack the Ripper and it's amazing that the traditional suspects have continued to remain suspects all through the years when there was no shred of evidence at all other than the fact that these people were a little odd, such as Queen Victoria's son, or leading an alternate lifestyle as perhaps Montague Druit led and, therefore, open to all sorts of attacks and misconceptions and stereotypes. I love reading true crime but I'm not a Ripperologist. One thing the reader can walk away with after having read this book is that prejudices, stereotyping and the public's view of lifestyles and \\"occupations\\" was a perfect breeding ground for the Ripper to exist. To this day we have gone after and even executed people who were guilty of crimes because of their backgrounds or lifestyles and later on it turns out they were innocent and yet the perpetrators are still out there.We all can agree that Jack the Ripper was someone in a class above reproach and Richard Sickert with his background in languages, and ability to act out any person he wanted to be was perfect for the role of Ripper. I did know about Mary Kelly but Pat Cornwell, has researched the lives of his victims, putting a human touch to these women and showing the need for social reforms which are still needed to this day. We know that from the horrid things that were happening to those women in Vancouver just recently.Pat is very honest in her findings and does not attempt to force pieces of a puzzle to fit. Please understand that the evidence they do have is 100+ years old and I think that's what makes me believe even more that she's on the right track with her assumptions. And yes there is a DNA match, a mitochondrial DNA match.I encourage everyone who has read this book to go to their local library and see if there are any books on the painting of Richard Sickert. I went to my library and what I found was disturbing. Pat does talk about some of his paintings, such as Ennui. I'm not the type of person who tries to look for subbliminal messages in a can of cola or a Disney movie but when I looked over his work which, when it comes to his paintings of women, I find it, overall, to be eerie. Furthermore, the men and women never interact in a positive way. Men consistently have the advantage over women in his paintings, or the women appear to be sitting alone and yet if you look at a mirror, they're appears to a glimpse of a face in it such as \\"Rehearsal\\". In \\"Suspense\\" the girl is looking up at something and your eyes take you to an outline on the wall of what appears to be a figure. Again, look at the wall in \\"Maria Bionda\\". In \\"La Carolina in an Interior\\" the woman appears to have a horrified expression on her face as one who has just witnessed something terrible will happen and look in the mirror behind her. You see her image but another silhouette as well. However, this is Impressionism and therefore whatever he wants people to visualize in his paintings or what he wants to hide an Impressionist can easily get away with \\"murder\\". You almost sense that he is taunting us with these dark impressionist figures in much the same manner the Ripper taunted the police in his letter. \\"The Painter in his Studio\\" is of a man standing beside a torso of a woman. \\"King George V and Queen Mary\\" you get the complete profile of George's head but half of Mary's. \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom\\" is nary to be found in the entire book. Funny ain't it! Richard Sickert is certainly a prime candidate for the role of Ripper more so than the other suspects and although he escaped the judicial system of this world, he certainly could not escape a Higher Judicial System.Pat, I loved your book!!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What was Cornwell thinking?

However, I have read nearly everything I could wrap my eyes and brain around on Jack the Ripper for many years.Patricia Cornwell has presented a case that is not only stronger than any other but contains worlds of information that had never been brought to the forefront. She makes connections that, had they been made close on the heels of the crimes, would have possibly led to the resolution.While some doubters are satisfied to accept the status quo on the identity of JTR, Cornwell has given us a candidate who, at the very least, fits the bill better than any other."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having recently watched a documentary on Jack the Ripper, I found it interesting that during the documentary's conclusion, several experts stated that many people do not want this case to be solved. One expert stated that if someone with all the evidence in the world would state that they have finally solved the case, \\"no one would believe them\\". Another stated that many people make their money from books of this unsolved mystery and from \\"Ripper\\" walks and it benefits no one if this case was to be solved. Well, I guess the reviews of Patricia Cornwells book proves their point.I am by no means stating that the case is closed. I am merely stating that, despite what her many critics say (and she was several as evidenced here and in the many Ripper forums), Cornwell presents a pretty good case. However, over a century after the killings, it is very difficult to state with confidence that Walter Sickert is the Ripper considering the amount of time that has passed and for the simple matter that circumstantial evidence is just that, circumstantial evidence. I do agree that maybe Cornwell should have refrained from naming her book \\"Case Closed\\" even if she had convinced herself that she had solved the mystery. It appears that smug ego that is reflected in her works title has turned many people (and many Ripperologists) off. Had it been titled in a way that illustrates Sickert as an alleged suspect only, it may have been better received. Maybe? Who am I kidding? Maybe not?The thing that I find interesting is that out of all the men who have been suspected of being the notorious killer, IN MY OPINION, Walter Sickert is one of the few with the most circumstantial evidence against him. There are several men who have made the list and I still cannot understand why. Cornwell addresses her concerns with Montague John Druit who has been a Ripper suspect for over a century yet there is little evidence that he was infact the killer. He apparently commited suicide the month after Mary Jane Kelly's horrific murder. Others on the lengthy list of suspects are David Cohen, Dr. Robert D'Onston, Prince Albert Victor: The Duke of Clarence, Sir William Gull (I admit the Royal conspiracy makes a fascinating story), Michael Ostrogg, Aaron Kosminski and even the author of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" Lewis Carroll was named a suspect although not many people took it seriously. This isn't the first time Sickert was named a suspect in the Whitechapel slayings but Cornwell's theory in my opinion makes sense and the circumstancial evidence helps to solidify her case.I remember watching 2 TV specials on Patricia Cornwell, and the case presented pretty much convinced me that Cornwell found her man. Many have stated that the only thing she proved was that Sickert mailed some pesky \\"Ripper\\" letters to the police which doesn't mean he was the killer, especially considering that many of the letters are regarded as hoaxes. But I, like Cornwell believe that the Ripper wrote more letters than he is given credit for. How can the police of 1888 and Ripperolgists today, state with confidence that \\"Saucy Jacky\\" did not write several of those letters? Especially considering how shoddy the investigation was at the time (the erasing of the enigamtic \\"Juwes\\" graffiti is one example of their miscalculations), I take what the investigators of 1888 said with a grain of salt. What is interesting to me is that even the letter that is deemed authentic; the \\"From Hell\\" letter, is met with skepticism from several experts today. Cornwell manages to link Sickert to a couple of the letters through Mitochondrial DNA, and the papers watermark. She also speculates that a talented artist like Sickert could have easily changed his writing styles to throw the police off, perhaps using his left hand in some instances which explains the shoddy hand-writing. In many of these correspondences, the grammer is poor but the misspelling of certain words makes one wonder if they were spelled wrong on purpose. The graffiti on some letters also shows a man with artistic skill (one letter was allegedly written using an artists paint brush) and some of the doodles mirrors some of the graffiti of Sickerts own letters to friends/relatives. For those many out there who believe that 99.9% of these letters were hoaxes, this means nothing, but there are several out there like myself who do believe the Ripper may have been responsible for far more of those taunting and diabolical mailings than just the one or two that are deemed authentic today and Cornwell's theory makes us question Sickert when taking her circumstantial evidence into consideration.Sickert's artwork is also interesting. In the 2 TV specials I saw, more of Sickerts artwork was presented that is not shown in the book. I remember seeing a painting of a woman looking stiff and motionless wearing what appears to be a pearl necklace on her neck. The painting was then compared to a mortuary photograph of Catherine Eddowes and the similarity was striking. They showed several other paintings of woman whose faces resembled those of Ripper victims, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly who received several facial mutilations. Cornwell states that only those who witnessed these killings would have been able to translate these images into art since mortuary photographs were not easily available at the time. All of this is speculation of course and doesn't alone prove that Sickert was the killer but his constant illustrations portraying prostitutes and women, some with a slash across their necks did seem interesting enough.Having read several Ripper books and having read the stories of several Ripper suspects, Cornwell's theory is interesting and I find the circumstantial evidence quite damning to Walter Sickert. With that said, I will not state he is in fact the notorious killer but she has convinced me to put Walter Sickert high up on the list of suspects. Overall, I found this book an interesting read and I was unable to put it down until the very last chapter. Whether you believe this book to be a work of fiction or non fiction, it was engrossing and for those who are interested in the subject matter and most importantly, who have an open mind may find it interesting reading as well. You may not agree with her theory but you may find yourself unable to put the book down."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am not normally the type to read murder mysteries, preferring to keep my mind locked in a nice saucy romance instead. However, I felt it a sense of mild curiosity to investigate for myself the Jack Case.Patricia Cornwell is an excellent Detective writter, and her other novels are enlightening to the mind. The woeful job of a forensic pathologist all boils down to the gruesomness of their job. I found the facts that she presented to this case an interesting turn of events. Having been a student of many art schools and taken many classes on various painters, I find her presumption of Sickert to be more than a little nail-on-the-head-ish. In his London paintings, one can definately get the feeling of his dark and oppressive nature. However, his works from Dieppe are quite the opposite of anything he ever did while in England.Her way of tracing him as a possible suspect brings to light many questions, the first being why would a supposed gentleman of the era be caught dead near a crime scene as horrific as those found to have been commited by the Ripper? The sheer gruesomeness of the scene would make anyone not weak in the stomach faint from shock at the atrocities.While I agree with some of the other reviewers here, I find Miss Cornwell to present a very believable case, with evidence lurking in the terrible paintings put out by Sickert during that time. She does, however, tend to jump around, and this work was not as well written as some of her others, lending one the thought that perhaps she was really uninterested in this book. From a fictional standpoint, it was an easy read.This is a subject that one could study for the whole of their life and never come to the same conclusion twice as to who they think the Ripper truly was. Unfortunately for Miss Cornwell, whatever evidence there might have been to link her favorite suspect with Jack perished in the incinerator's flames when Sickert was Creamated. However, if there was an \\"illigitemate\\" child, though based on her supposition, I don't see how there could have been, one would have only to trace that person and compare their DNA to that taken from the Openshaw envelope.Checking Mitochondrial DNA against any survivors, including Sickert's siblings and their offspring would seem the logical course of action, as Mitochondrial DNA is passed along by way of Maternity.Over all, I was impressed with this book, and, being fairly new to Ripperism, have taken to doing my own research and not relying on what others have said. For anyone to truly enjoy this writing, they would first have to be a fan of Miss Cornwell, and a serious Ripper Hunter to boot.I recomend this book, though keep in mind that this work comes from a fictional writter."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I find it hard to believe that this book was even published, or that the editors actually permitted it to go to press in this disordered, rambling, repetitive mess of words. The writing is so poor that I was appalled. Cornwell may be able to crank out some detective fiction, but she is certainly completely deficient when it comes to putting together an argument concerning a topic of non-fiction. A publication attempting to implicate a person in crimes as horrific as those of Jack the Ripper should not only resemble a more scholarly work, but should be written by someone capable of presenting the case in a straightforward and intelligent manner, without dramatic embellishments or overtly self-conscious opinions as Cornwell does.While subject of Jack the Ripper is an interesting one and may keep you barely hanging on to this book, Cornwell's assumptions and misjudgments about the \\"evidence\\" will leave you hunting for information from different, more reliable sources. Her connections are shaky at best, and her writing form and organization (or lack thereof) destroy any hope she might have had at convincing anyone of Walter Sickert's guilt. This is unfortunate, for it may be possible that Sickert might have been the Ripper.In the end, the self-indulgent \\"Case Closed\\" title is laughable.Jack the Ripper himself must be \\"Ha ha\\"-ing in his grave."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is astoundingly intelligent in gathering facts in a world that offers so many countless configurations. Exhausting work, indeed. Comparing this book to supposedly better Jack the Ripper &quot;websites&quot; (if you enjoy those, check out Area 51 and/or Elvis spotting websites)is laughable at best. Earlier writings on Jack the Ripper abound and are often very interesting but they lack the intense detail and availability of modern technology. Is Cornwell believeable in her facts/assumptions/conclusion? More so, than any past writer on the subject due to the vast research completed and intensely detailed investigational techniques. The best part? It was fun to read! An engaging book through and through. Some may not agree with her conclusions but you cannot argue against the fact that Cornwell did her homework and did it very well. (Note to reviewers who go overboard trying to get someone to notice and possibly offer them a job...too many details ruin a good review. Please don't describe the entire book content to future readers. They are checking out the reviews to get a sense of what the book is all about. They are not reading reviews to get the entire story retold by YOU.

Nothing.Maybe Walter Sickett's family will sue Cornwall. Let her prove that he is who she claims."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"the case is closed: cornwell is nuts."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Not only is it about this case, but includes bits of history on police/detective work and coroners work in late 1800's England. There are several pages of photos, artwork (comparisions of sketches by Sickert and 'the Ripper') and even photographs of the mutilated women. I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's writing, and own several of her books, and this one did not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It's almost redundent to add anything to the already vast pile of reviews from fans of Cornwell's fiction work that agree that this is attrocious bilge.Cornwell's fiction career points to the two problems that ripple through the existence of this book. Firstly, without the success of the Kay Scarpetta books, there would have been no way that a respectable publishing house would have published her theories on the true identity of Jack the Ripper. Secondly, as a novelist, she's used to re-shaping reality to create her story and putting the guilty party on the spot, leaps of logic not withstanding. When she tries to incriminate painter Walter Sickert as the killer, she has to ignore every single piece of evidence produced to date, most especially the fact that the London Police actually had a suspect at the time and lost him (a quack named Tumbletee, not an artist named Sickert).There is no evidence to point the finger at Sickert whatsoever, beyond some vastly mis-guided art interpretation. Basically, her theory comes down to the belief that Sickert must have been a killer because he painted killings. Since Cornwell writes about murders, is she telling us something about herself? Some clue to a butcherous little side-line? Of course not. This is 'research' on a par with that which concludes that the pyramids are lighthouses for UFOs. It's just the latest in a long line of cod-historical novels that have tried to claim that Jack must have been someone famous, like Royal Surgeon Sir Withey-Gull or prime minister Gladstone or even Queen Victoria herself. Avoid under all circumstances."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I wasn't so much disappointed as shocked by this book. Maybe poor Ms. Cornwell is so used to writing fiction, that not being able to control the facts of her case, to write what she wanted, and tie up the neat ending she'd decided on when she typed \\"Chapter 1\\" into her computer made her crack.Certainly I wasn't shocked by the long, long passages on watermarks; I wasn't even shocked by the no-holds-barred descriptions of the disgusting life suffered by people living in the East End of Victorian London-- which incidentally I thought were the best part of the book. Few books on Jack the Ripper are so honest about the misery that drove Jack's victims to the desperation of street prostitution.What I was shocked by were occasions of outright dishonesty from a writer I had once admired.To begin with, Cornwell never lets on that Sickert has been connected with the Ripper murders before. In 1990 a woman named Jean Overton Fuller wrote a book called Sickert and the Ripper Crimes. Fuller, like Cornwell, detects shadows of the Rippers victims in many of Sickert's paintings, and like Cornwell, assumes that he must have committed the murders, not seen photographs of the bodies, or illustrations in the papers.Also, as far back as 1947, Sir Osbert Sitwell wrote that Sickert persistently spoke of knowing the identity of Jack the Ripper, because he once rented a room, which he landlady told him she had previously rented to a veterinary student who was Jack the Ripper. Apparently the landlady regaled Sickert with stories of the student's comings and goings, and Sickert loved to listen.More damning though, she states things such as this, on page 33: \\"With rare exceptions they [the Ripper's victims] were in their late thirties or early forties.\\" The Ripper had five victims, according to the police at the time, four of whom were in their forties, and one of whom was twenty-five. Cornwell writes the word \\"exceptions\\" as plural, because she has added to the total murders outside the accepted provenance of Jack the Ripper, that she alone believes Sickert committed.Then on page 121, she states \\"if Sickert had seen [victim] Mary Ann at the mortuary, her eyes would have been shut by then, just as they are in her photograph.\\" I couldn't believe it. I flipped through the illustrations in the book wondering whether I could trust my memory. Cornwell had included a copy of Mary Ann Nichols' mortuary photograph, but it is so vague, I could barely discern a face. The eyes were two black lines, and I could not fairly judge whether they were open or closed. I picked up a book ten years older than Cornwell's book, The Jack the Ripper A-Z. This book also includes Nichols' mortuary photo, and it is the same photo, with a half-circle tear on the right side. In the much clearer print of the photo in A-Z, Nichols' eyes are CLEARLY OPEN.Cornwell lied. She lied, to make a point; a point that Sickert once made a sketch of a woman resembling Nichols as she lay dead, but with eyes open. Cornwell claimed Sickert must have seen Nichols dead before the mortuary worker closed her eyes, as though Sickert were incapable of imagining her with open eyes. Then she published a deliberately vague photo in order to cover up the fact that Sickert may well have seen a photo of Nichols with her eyes open.I would not go on like this if it were one instance in a nearly 400 page book, but it's not. When Cornwell is not outrightly insulting the reader by condescendingly introducing background information as though the reader grew up in a hothouse, then she is slyly insulting by assuming the reader cannot question or double-check anything she says.And it may simply be that as a fiction writer she is too accustomed to writing in a vacuum, where the reader must accept everything she says. Maybe she intends no malice, and is just lousy at non-fiction, and should go back to novels, which she does well.I hope, I hope.I hope not, as another reviewer said, that this is all because she owns many Sickert paintings, which would go up in value if people believed he were Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The book was useful in educating me about the Jack the Ripper case, about which I knew almost nothing. However, the book is poorly constructed and confusing. The author may have a persuasive argument that the English painter Walter Sickert committed the crimes, but the book is so disorganized that it is difficult to determine. The endless reminders (one would have been sufficient) that police agencies in 1888 had virtually no forensic capabilies (and then to list what they couldn't do) are tedious."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Cornwell broke the cardinal rule of scientific investigation: she started with a THEORY, and tried to find evidence to support it, rather than starting with the evidence and trying to build a theory that matches all of it. Every other paragraph contained something like &quot;Well I have absolutely no proof, but it's certain that X did Y.&quot; How wrong can you get?! For someone like Cornwell, who prides herself on her realism and scientific truths, this book is an embarassment. I got so sick of mentally responding &quot;can we say the word 'coincidence'?&quot; to each sentence (i.e. Sickert painted a woman with a man coming up behind her, ergo Sickert is Jack the Ripper because his paintings show violent tendencies; Sickert spent time in France and there is a Ripper letter *supposedly* from France, ergo Sickert wrote it) that I finally just gave up, totally exasperated.I respect and enjoy your fiction immensely, Ms. Cornwell. But don't give up your day job to write nonfiction."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I won't even get into whether or not the evidence Cornwell submitted proves that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. What drove me absolutely nuts was all the conjecture. Egad. How many times did she say someone could have, would have if only, might have, etc. All these things were made up in her mind, as if she's writing fiction. Hey, wait, that's what she normally does! What a coincidence. Seriously, all of her possible scenarios, many of which are just extraneous information, just detract from the presentation of \\"evidence\\". She should have written this as a newspaper article, not as a novel. The other really weird thing is part of this conjecture involved whether the Ripper started cutting a person up either here or there, and what that person may have felt. Yikes. First, she's completely guessing, second, what's the point of such sickening guesswork? I made myself finish this book. She might have a good point, might have found the killer, but could have written about what she found in, oh, say 20 pages."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell adds the artist Walter Sickert to a long list of Jack the Ripper suspects, but does little to prove her case. Sure, she has a fairly impressive pile of circumstantial evidence, but none of it, by itself, is at all convincing. She goes out on several limbs (the rather benign guest book at the end, which is owned by Cornwell. How's that for conflict of interest!), and leaves Sickert dangling from a noose she so eagerly wants him to fill. Some of the &quot;evidence&quot; is so speculative, her case would have been stronger if she left it out. The book takes the form of Cornwell playing prosecutor, agressively cross-examing a witness who is not alive to respond. In addition, the book is so poorly organized and so full of digressions that it is difficult to read. On the other hand, her descriptions of the East End of London, while derivative of other works, are well done, informative, and compelling."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I generally enjoy Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, finding them well-researched and intriguing. I also enjoy historical discussions of the Jack the Ripper murders and his possible identities. I found this book to be completely unorganized and poorly written. I was also skeptical of many of her assertions of &quot;facts&quot;, wishing that she had substantiated more. I shut the book believing that Sikert was indeed a disturbed individual, but unconvinced that he was beyond a doubt Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I divide my personal library into three categories: fiction, biography and history. Having just finished Patricia Cromwell's Portrait of a Killer - Jack the Ripper Case Closed,I tucked it away in its proper section - fiction.You may want to purchase this book if you have a morbid interest in forensic science or a very casual curosity about street life in late 19th century London. But a serious study of the \\"Ripper Crimes\\" it is not. Conjecture, speculation, unfounded conclusions and wild flights of fantasy characterize this work of fiction that takes a misplaced stab at solving an historically significant series of crimes.Jack the Ripper's true identify remains at large."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As I read this book, I just kept wondering if anyone edited this book. And if so, has he or she ever heard that a narrative should have a certain flow and cohesiveness? This book was a jumble of personal thoughts and introspections, confused with a mixture of slanted &quot;evidence,&quot; doused with many unnecessary historical facts, and that was just chapter 1. Needless to say, I was not impressed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am an avid reader of books on true crime and forensic science and have read many, including those about the crimes of Jack the Ripper. When I came across Patricia Cornwell's account of the crimes and her assertion that Walter Sickert was the killer, I was stunned. She has obviously done only the research needed to achieve the end that she was after, and has neglected one of the crucial elements of forensic science, that of criminal behavior. I have read many books on criminal behavior, written by those who have pioneered the field of Behavioral Science in the FBI, such as John Douglas and Roy Hazelwood, to name a few. Just by reading books written by these highly qualified individuals certainly does not make me an expert on the subject of criminal behavior, but I certainly feel that I have a much better understanding of the subject than Patricia Cornwell. To anyone interested in reading about Jack the Ripper, I would suggest \\"The Cases that Haunt Us\\" by John Douglas. Not only does he provide the history of the case, but he also profiles the killer and gives his opinion of who the killer might have been. It is a very interesting and informative read for true crime enthusiasts, written by someone with over 25 years of experience in his field."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have been interested in the Jack the Ripper case for a number of years and have read quite a few books on the subject. I'd put this down somewhere in the middle of the list -- not really convincing, but not worth completely disregarding either. Both better and worse cases have been made for various JTR suspects.My biggest problem with Cornwell's case is her seeming lack of knowledge of other serious Ripper suspects, or willingness to discuss them. In my view, to build her case she needed to compare and contrast her findings with those of other Ripperologists who have valid arguments for their suspects; she didn't do this. On the other hand, she provides quite a lot of interesting, if largely circumstantial, evidence that may stand a further look.The quality of the writing itself is pretty weak; reading her novels one may conclude that while Ms. Cornwell may be a fairly good plotter, she's not a particularly good writer. For topnotch mysteries by women, please see those by P.D. James, Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine, and Minnette Walters. These ladies can write!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"the early consensus is that this book is a lot of gibberish from a supremely arrogant, self-important charlatan; save your money and visit casebook.org for all the informations you would ever want on this subject. if you must waste your money on this, wait a few weeks until it's remaindered."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's style of writing for her novels. However, it is not particularly suited to a scholarly research work, especially not one that purports to &quot;close the case&quot; in regards to one Jack the Ripper.The tome could have very well been half its size, were it not for her suppositions and verbal meanderings. Some of the verbiage contains obvious question-begging, such as the subsequent murders (1889) that were unsolved. Cornwell draws no conclusion to the fact that the cases were unsolved, and just leaves to information to hang in the reader's mind.The ending was decidely downletting: there was only a dramatic portrait painted of Sickert, who Cornwell asserts was the Ripper, throwing his late wife's ashes into the wind at his friends. What are we to conclude from that?Cornwell's book may very well have been a more conclusive work IF she had left the drama to be drawn simply from the facts of the case and not her own part in the research or her verbal prowess at argumentum ad hominem. Leave that to your fiction works, Ms. Cornwell, and please us with a new version of &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; that doesn't insult our intelligence.Readers, I suggest checking out this book from the library, as I did; it will save you money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"So many assumptions, from such little factual basis, made this book a very difficult read. I expected much more . A very disappointing book that, sadly, I cannot recommend. The book seemed disjointed, unorganized in its thought process, it just did not flow and was, frankly tough to finish. The pictures were interesting but could have been tied in with the text to make their reference much easier. Like the authors fiction, hope she gets back to it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The reviews of this book seem as passionate as the writer herself. It's this passion that carried me through this at-times difficult book.I agree that Cornwell displays terrific arrogance by titling this book \\"Case Closed.\\" She is presenting nothing more here than her theory. A firmly believed and well researched theory yes, but certainly not definitive. I can see where this would turn readers off.On the other hand, Cornwell's disgust with the crimes and with the public's fascination with the monster that was Jack the Ripper is real, personal and fascinating. She names the victims and fights to make them three dimensional. She portrays the times, mores and situations the victims found themselves in with realism and compassion. She seems intent on avenging them and bringing them justice. Her passion, while laudable, certainly gets in the way of her objectivity.In all, this book reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, the film about the crime of the century (perhaps of my lifetime) that I am far more familiar with. While that film has its share of inaccuracies and should under no circumstances be interpreted as a definitive history, it's still an important work about a crime that haunts us still. Likewise, Cornwell's book is a valuable addition to the dialog about Jack the Ripper, his times and his crimes. And those not to be forgotten poor women, with their desperate lives of oppression, deprivation, poverty and finally horrible death.Beware! None of the reviews I've read thus far have mentioned how really grisly this book is at times, even by Cornwell standards. One reviewer actually said he laughed while reading this book. Trust me, I found no laughs in it whatsoever! If you pick up this book, please know that it details crimes of genuine horror."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I found this book entertaining, I cannot say Patricia Cornwell convinced me of anything more than the fact that she should stick to writing her Kay Scarpetta series. I thought this book was all over the place--jumping from one thing to the next &amp; then back again. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to entertain all of the theories about who Jack the Ripper was, but I would never tell anyone I believe what she is selling here."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm an avid reader of crime thrillers, so I know Patricia Cornwell well. Unfortunately, her latest attempt at non-fiction isn't as clearly organized as her thrillers. A few charts and timelines would help the reader understand all the murders she attributes to Sickert. As for objectivity, Cornwell misses the mark, since she only presents facts that support her theory. She could learn a thing or two about presenting the facts in an entertaining yet objective manner from investigative reporter Anthony Summers' who wrote &quot;Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe,&quot; an excellent and well-researched book regarding the assasination of Marilyn Monroe.However, if you want to better understand violent psychopathy and how forensic medicine is utilized, Cornwell does a wonderful job on both of these topics. Overall, not her best writing effort, but worth the read to understand the diseased psychopathic soul."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A police officer in London suggests a name to Ms. Cornwall, saying he would have investigated this person. Ms. C. now has a suspect, and massages certain facts to substantiate it, and ignores those that do not. This is certainly not police procedure. From the evidence you find a suspect. Not the other way around.Also, since the police in the 19th century were aware of Mr. Sickert, it is quite possible that they investigated and cleared him. They may even have known he wrote some of the \\"fake\\" Ripper letters. So many Ripper evidence has been lost or stolen.Mitochondrial DNA, which is 99% + accurate, only proves that Mr. S probably wrote some of the MANY fake Ripper letters which were discounted by the police, who were in the only position to know which were real and which were fake.There are also some paintings of Mr. Sickert which Ms. C writes, that she can \\"sense\\" menace, even though in one picture the \\"menacing\\" character has his back to the viewer.In addition to Mr. Sickert having slashed seven women, Ms. C. also charges him with the murder of several children. Yet, she never explains why a serial killer changes his victimology from prostitutes to children. Totally unbelievable.In other material I've read, Mr. Sickert had an alibi for the murder of Mary Kelly. This is something Ms. C. ignores since it doesn't fit her suspect. For some of the murders she states that Mr. S. \\"could have done it,\\" even though she doesn't know where, or if, he was even in England at the time.Sloppy police work."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"How did she zero in on this one person? She never gave definitive reasons why the other's were not guilty of being the ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Try as I might, I can't give this a one. A one is the book I threw across the room or tried to return to Borders. I actually consumed this book voraciously (in about 2 sittings). It was readable. It was interesting. It was creepy. Hey, any book that gives you in depth analysis of the life and habits of \\"strumpets\\" can't be a total failure. I also learned all about poor houses -- it gave me a lot less respect for Ebeneezer Scrooge. Granted, there are probably more stunning and edgy social commentaries on Dickensian London (Jack London, Charles Dickens himself), but I'm guessing Cornwell's is going to be the most digestible for the casual reader.It was also (in places) laughably bad. Bad in it's insistance that the killer had been nailed by the flimsiest of evidence. Bad in it's meandering and chronological schizophrenia (other reviews suggest this was intentional; I can't help but agree). Bad that in a world where children die in the third world from treatable illnesses and malnutrition, someone would have the ego and the folly to spend 6 million dollars on apprehending a killer who's, uh, dead. It's the only thing I can't forgive Cornwell for.It also falls into, IMHO, the category of being so bad it's good! When someone has the audacity to write and publish such whimsy as fact, there's inherent fun in picking it apart, laughing at it, going on the internet and checking the true facts. I certainly don't want to give Cornwell snaps for her ability as a historian or writer of non-fiction (both of which are atrocious), but nor do I wish to dissuade people from reading the book, which is an experience unto itself, an exercise in critical thinking, a morality play on personal pride, and for all that, a great experience all around.Put aside the Doestoevsky and hell, even the Truman Capote.

Maybe I should get her to adopt me; I'd make better use of her funds.Other reviewers have already mentioned her lack of sources, her erroneous DNA conclusions, and the like. One of the things that really caught me was her assumption that a dark lantern provided hardly any light at all, simply because she experimented with one. On her patio. Not in the East End of London. She claims that a dark lantern was NOT the brilliant, illuminating tool shown in contemporary illustrations, but a weak and hotly burning liability.If that were the case, why would dark lanterns be issued to London's police force? Why would a lantern that, as Cornwell claims, can't illuminate an object only six inches away, be thought of as a helpful instrument? It wouldn't. Clearly, Cornwell's \\"test\\" was just as useful as the money she spent in \\"research\\". The $6 million dollar book. She'd have done better to try to create a bionic man."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"most of the reviews nail the stupidity of this tome... its frustrating how something that has garnered so much attention could be so poorly constructed... for me the main point is this: contemporary artists are very very frequently fascinated by grim current events... certainly no less in victorian times and Sickerts being interested in the murders and naming some of his work after what was a huge media event at the time is a pretty feeble reason for naming him as the killerthere is a little bit of color here but on the whole this is an exploitative travesty... also Sickert was a truly great painter... anyone who looks at a bunch of his work should see how ridiculous these claims are... are there any actual serial killers on record who went on to have major careers in the arts? or vice versa? this is a silly hollywood conception"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell has a great need to try to prove to the world that she isn't just a fiction writer but someone who can actually catch criminals. Right now she's in the news for trying to solve the \\"mystery\\" of how Princess Diana died. Even her fans have got to start to realize that she's in over her head.Take this book. The main problem with it is that she picked the killer before she ever did any amount of research. She even admits it. Someone offhandedly mentions the name of a famous painter, Walter Sickert, that another poorly researched book (Stephen's Knight's thoroughly discredited Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution) claims was involved as someone suspicious. So then Cornwell spends a fortune trying to prove that Sickert did it, and the best she comes up with is that DNA she assumes is his can't be ruled out as being the same as DNA found on a letter claiming to be from the killer. And, while every other researcher thinks that most of the Ripper letters were hoaxes (including the one with the DNA Cornwell tested), she is of the opinion that they are all real. Has she never even talked to a police department about how many hoaxes they get when a serial killer is on the loose?It's also telling that the only people she allows to examine any evidence is the same group of people she has donated gobs of money to and who apparently are afraid to speak out in public to explain that the DNA evidence wouldn't even be enough to hold a suspect for questioning, let alone be useful in a court of law to try to prove anything.The rest of the book is innuendo and outrageous character assassination that would get her sued if Sickert were still alive. And, of course, she glosses over and tries to deny any inconvenient facts that might get in the way, like, say, that Sickert was in France at the time of the murders, obviously didn't have the sexual dysfunction she claims he did because he had several children from various partners, and so forth. She also refuses to attend conferences where reputable ripperology scholars can debate her on any of it and has withdrawn from radio interviews when she knew the host was going to ask questions prepared by an expert on the case.This awful book is what happens when ego and an expensive PR firm replaces legitimate research.

In the end, one wonders if it were worth it. Ms. Cornwell provides a tenuous link between Walter Sickert and one or two \\"Ripper letters\\" in the guise of a matching mtDNA sequence, but all that tells us is that Sickert can not be eliminated from the percentage of the population (ranging from 1% ro 10%) that could have written those letters. Considering the fact that the letters that provided mtDNA matches are all considered to be definite hoaxes, Cornwell's theory falls apart like a house of cards.Cornwell should certainly be praised for taking the initiative to fund modern forensic research on the few remaining scraps of Ripperana, but in the end, the results should have been more critically examined. Instead, it appears as though Cornwell decided who the Ripper was first, and then scrambled to find evidence to support it. When DNA matching fell short, she relied on watermark and handwriting analysis, as well as comparisons between drawings on the letters and those in Sickert's sketchbooks. All of this is meaningless, of course, as the Ripper letters she uses are all considered hoaxes. She also fails to discuss the possibility that Sickert was in France at the time of most, if not all of the murders. There is ample evidence that suggests this."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwall tries. And she tries. And she tries some more. But ultimately she proves nothing in this book, while asserting her conclusions.Does Cornwall have evidence? Technically, but considering that her mitochondrial DNA evidence only narrows the suspect pool down to 100,000 people or so... and that the letters she extracted mtDNA from as well as words and pictures she \\"matched\\" to Walter Sickert are not even generally regarded among the Ripper community as anything other than fakes. So what does she prove? Maybe Sickert wrote fake letters to the police.Her entire theory is also debunked as there is sufficient evidence to put Sickert in France during the bulk of time the Ripper was stalking London.Patricia Cornwall is an excellent fiction writer, but she is a lousy investigator. She found her suspect and then dug up evidence to support it... completely ignoring any evidence that contradicted it.This is guilty until proven innocent. Even guilty WHEN proven innocent. If you don't want to know what really happened, read the book. If you want to know the facts and the truths behind the case, PLEASE look elsewhere"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell is like a football player who picks up a fumble and runs to the wrong endzone. She is so dogged and myopic in her determination to assert her thesis that she fails to step back and take a wider view. She rarely, if ever, considers that she may have missed the mark.The notion that the artist Walter Sickert was involved in the Jack the Ripper murders is not a new one. (And I'm not giving anything away here-even if you somehow managed to miss the media frenzy that surrounded the release of this book, Ms. Cornwell reveals her theory in its first few pages.) However unlikely, it may even be true-the case has remained unsolved for 115 years and seems certain to stay that way. Of course there are numerous other theories that are equally compelling; but given the lack of evidence in 1888 and today, it is as likely as not that none of the \\"solutions\\" that have gained currency over the years is entirely correct.While Ms. Cornwell may be an excellent writer of detective fiction, she is no historian and this attempt at nonfiction is feeble. She too often meanders into extraneous digressions, such as generic discussions of male violence towards women or ruminations on actual cases involving psychopaths who raped and slaughtered women. Often, these have not even a remote relationship to Walter Sickert or the case at hand. She fails to support her stated facts and opinions with footnotes or other reference citations. She frequently makes assertions and expects the reader to believe them, apparently for no other reason than that they fit her theory.For example, there is the business with the watermarks on the supposed Ripper letters and stationary used by Sickert and his wife. Most people who have investigated the Ripper case believe that the vast majority of letters written to the police and newspapers during the investigation were hoaxes. Ms. Cornwell acknowledges this, but says she thinks everyone else has been wrong and that most of the letters were actually written by Sickert, who, as she has already assured us, was the real killer. Her proof: Sickert was a talented artist, so he certainly would have been able to disguise his handwriting. It would have been nice if Ms. Cornwell had heeded the advice given her by an old friend, whom she quotes in Chapter 7: \\"Never look for unicorns until you run out of ponies.\\" In fact, Ms. Cornwell needs us to make an unlikely leap of faith on this point because her case depends on it. Her murky DNA \\"evidence\\" and the watermark \\"evidence\\" require the real killer to be the person who wrote specific letters, which, in fact, may have been nothing more than hoaxes.At the end of the day, this book is like a trial, with Ms. Cornwell playing the prosecutor presenting her highly speculative and circumstantial case. Unfortunately, there is no adversarial process-no opposing counsel to raise objections or put up a defense. As the jury, we are asked to convict Walter Sickert based on our faith in Ms. Cornwell's intuition and a paltry collection of uncontested \\"evidence.\\" This is where the book fails. While her conclusion may or may not be valid, it is impossible for the reader to judge because Ms. Cornwell's arguments tend towards the facile and, lacking the legs to stand on their own, are woefully unpersuasive."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell may be a wonderful mystery writer (I've never read her, so I wouldn't know), but she should stick to what she knows - writing fiction. I have done extensive studies on Jack the Ripper and other serial killers and while her &quot;evidence&quot; is quite intriguing, it is fallible.She believes that she has solved this great mystery as have other, more acclaimed Ripperologists. However, where she errs greatly is by saying that she is 100% absolutely positive and there is no margin for error. Her theory may be correct, but it will only be added to the other Jack the Ripper as a theory.Cornwell has received scathing reviews from others who have studied Jack the Ripper more extensively and longer than she has. Why should she suddenly have the magical key that everyone's been looking for. Her suspect has been studied before along with countless others - what makes him different in this instance?She purchased most of his art and reviewed letters sent to Scotland Yard and obtained DNA samples. However, the only thing she was able to prove with this was the fact the her suspect may have sent a letter or two taunting the police. Crime experts over several generations have concluded that the real Ripper only sent maybe one or two letters that the press and police received if any at all.Read it if you have extra time to waste, but don't take it to heart. There are many other, better books about Jack the Ripper that are more thorough and informative."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is an unorganized list of factoids and speculation. I kept waiting for the punchline, but her &quot;case&quot; falls apart because of her approach of assuming the positive by attempting to prove the negative. Her continual statements such as &quot;I see no reason why Sickert wouldn't have been there. . .&quot; get extremely tedious and increasingly unconvincing. She can't prove Sickert was in Whitechapel by failing to find him elsewhere. She can't prove he wrote the Ripper letters just because he was a talented artist who could have written in many different styles. The only things she DID prove was that forensic science was abysmal and that most people didn't care about the women who were murdered.There is no smoking gun - just a bunch of could've would've should've."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I started this book with an open mind. I had only a passing familiarity with the Ripper case and was eager to get a fresh point of view on the case. Ms. Cornwell's point of view is certainly fresh, but ultimately not compelling. Were I serving on a jury trying the case of Walter Sickert as the Ripper I'd have to conclude that she has not proved her case. She would like you to believe that her conclusion is based on a modern forensic analysis of the case but that evidence boils down to only a couple of hard facts - an analysis of the watermarks on paper used by Sickert and purportedly used by the Ripper, and a partial mitochondrial DNA match again between letters written by Sickert and allegedly by the Ripper. Both require you to believe that a significant portion of the several hundred odd letters signed by the Ripper were indeed written by him. Ms. Cornwell seems to have no problem believing that to be the case, while most Ripper experts seem to believe that at most 2 or 3 letters were actually penned by the Ripper - and not, significantly, the letter used for the mitochondrial DNA evidence. Even without that doubt, the mitochondrial DNA evidence is less conclusive then the more typical nuclear DNA used for identification.The rest of her \\"case\\" amounts to 361 pages of innuendo, speculation and coincidence. But worst of all it's all couched in muddled logic and bad writing. A favorite example, referring to murder victim Elizabeth Stride, \\"Swedish, her native tongue, is a Germanic language closely related to Danish, which is what Sickert's father spoke.\\" Huh? How is that at all significant? Similarly bizarre logic leads Cornwell to write that a bloody knife found after Stride's murder which was \\"\\"smothered\\" with dried blood and the sort a baker or chef might use\\", points the finger at Sickert who \\"was an excellent cook and often dressed as a chef to entertain his friends.\\"Ms. Cornwell could probably make a good case for Sickert being author of numerous Ripper hoax letters. Her presentation of Sickert's personality makes that plausible. But that would hardly sell a large number of books. As for the identity of the Ripper, well, keep the case book open."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell bases her conclusions about the \\"guilt\\" of Walter Sickert on a number of pieces of \\"evidence,\\" none of which, taken in isolation or combination, serves to build a damning case against the man. Her evidence, such as it is, is frequently self-contradictory, thus:1. Sickert was supposedly left impotent by a series of childhood operations to correct a genital malformation. This lack of ability to perform sexually is alleged to have led to a hatred of women, leading to formation of a motive . Cornwell neglects to mention a child (Joseph Sickert) he fathered illegitimately and who survives to this day. Joseph Sickert, in fact, was a key source of information for Stephen Knight's \\"Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution\\" (1976). Whilst lamenting that no Sickert DNA survives to be compared with that obtained from various Ripper letters, it appears to be a gross oversight to not have considered approaching this man for a simple blood sample. Had this happened, I suspect the whole house of cards would have come tumbling down in any event.....2. Cornwell asserts that Sickert's preference for painting \\"ugly\\" models in his art is an indicator of his hate for women, his choice in this regard lessening any sexual threat that attraction to a woman might have posed. She staes that he chose, presumably as an extension to this line of reasoning, to murder unattractive prostitutes, whilst describing at least one of his victims as having been extremely attractive. Sickert's second wife, indeed, seems to have been particularly attractive.....3. Over 200 letters puporting to have been sent by Jack the Ripper were received by the investigating police of the day. Most of these were written off by the police as being hoaxes, an opinion confirmed by the vast majority of serious Ripperologists in the decades since. Cornwell chooses to accept (?most of) these as having been sent by Sickert, and uses what is known about his whereabouts at the time to match his location with the postmark of various letters. Where certain knowledge of his location is lacking, she resorts to the \\"could have.....no evidence that he did not......may well have been\\" sort of woolly argument that fails to advance her case. That many of the letters she uses to advance her cause were written in different hands proves no obstacle...Cornwell asserts that disguising one's hand would be a simple matter to any accomplished artist! She further asserts that Sickert loved \\"playing games\\" and was a prolific writer of letters to the editor, frequently under assumed names, yet fails to acknowledge the possibility that he may indeed have written some of the \\"Ripper\\" letters, but as a hoax!4. Cornwell attempts to argue that Sickert was a psychopath (ie. that he had an antisocial personality disorder), and indeed she presents a large amount of evidence from his published correspondence, and from that of his relatives and associates, that he lacked empathy and was interpersonally manipulative ( key components of ASPD). he appears to have had, however, no criminal record, and Cornwell fails to provide any evidence from her sources that he was interpersonally violent at any point. Even if he were a \\"psychopath,' so are 4% of the general population! Psychopathy on its own does not mean he was the murderer.Overall, Cornwell's book provides an interesting, yet incomplete portrait of a fascinating man, and paints a vivid picture of both investigative methods and the squalour of Victorian London.As such, the book proves essential reading for anyone with more than a casual interest in the Whitechapel murders, but is otherwise seriously flawed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a rule I don't write negative reviews of anything, but I feel that I was cheated out of [PRICE] hard-earned dollars for this book, so hopefully I can prevent others from making the same mistake. Painter Walter Sickert has previously been considered by others as a candidate for Jack the Ripper, but has always been dismissed for lack of evidence. Unfortunately, the lack of evidence doesn't stop Patricia Cornwell. For \\"Ripperologists\\" or even anyone interested in a good true-crime tale, this book is a total loss. It is disjointed and dull, rambles on in scattershot fashion, and ultimately offers absolutely no evidence that Sickert was Jack the Ripper beyond the kind of creative interpretation and \\"clue\\" hunting that has \\"identified\\" everyone from Cervantes to Queen Elizabeth I as the true genius behind William Shakespeare. Worse, Cornwell suffers from severe \\"I-strain,\\" personally inserting herself into text so often that it virtually becomes a book about her, rather than Sickert or Saucy Jack. The Blowhard School of personal journalism can work if the story is written well enough (such as with Thomas Hoving's \\"King of the Confessors\\"), but this book is shockingly poorly written. In the course of her \\"research,\\" Cornwell ripped up an original Sickert painting. She'll have a lot harder time restoring the tatters of her reputation after this debacle."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book cannot be taken seriously. The author hangs her conclusions on ethereal threads of conjecture and intuition; one supposition after the other, that somehow become \\"facts.\\" A backward step for anyone interested in this case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's investigation into whether British painter Walker Sickert was in fact also infamous murderer Jack the Ripper has been fascinating to follow in the media over the last year. As the essence of any good investigation is clear, accurate perception, precision, and a rigorous search for the facts and truth by objective methods, it is by these standards that Cornwell's book must be considered.The author has accumulated an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence against Sickert, but Portrait of a Killer is amateurishly written, sloppily executed, and poorly edited. For a famous crime writer, Cornwell has produced a weak book unlikely to stand up to scrutiny or survive the brunt of attacks by Ripperologists the world over, written as it has been for the uncritical light reader. Every facet of Portrait of a Killer seems rushed, as though Cornwell wrote with little consideration for structure and then submitted the manuscript without rereading, rewriting, or thinking it through as a whole. The awkward title alone suggests Cornwell's hesitations: 'Portrait of a Killer / Jack The Ripper / Case Closed.' Why not 'Walter Sickert: Portrait of a Killer,' or 'Walter Sickert: Jack The Ripper?' Why the reservation about damning her subject in the title, as she does so heartily in the text?For Cornwell damns Sickert before she's made her case, and from the first page. She immediately refers to Sickert as a killer as if this were an objective fact, and as a 'psychopath,' a phrase she bandies about loosely and without proper definition throughout the book. By contemptuously referring to his rented East End studios as 'ratholes' upon their first mention, Cornwell makes her biases entirely clear. As a result, Sickert's habit of long walks become 'obsessive walks,' and his love of walking at night becomes evidence of his psychopathology, when night walking was also the habit of Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Paul Bowles, Walt Whitman, Thoreau, and Charles Baudelaire. Sickert's penchant for watching and studying people is also interpreted as a sign of his predatory madness, rather than as an attribute common to most visual artists, actors, and writers - to say nothing of detectives and crime writers. Describing a poem sent to the police and signed 'Jack the Ripper' which she believes was written by Sickert, Cornwell describes the poem's rhymes as \\"not those of an illiterate or deranged person.\\" Since she believes Sickert was a \\"psychopath,\\" by what criteria was he a \\"psychopath\\" but not a \\"deranged person?\\" Cornwell says of the broken, middle-aged Sickert, \\"He subsisted in filth and chaos. He was a slob and he stank,\\" but on the next page states, \\"he traversed the surface of life as a respectable, intellectual gentleman.\\"The same easy logic the author uses to turn the lights on Sickert could be used on anyone, at anytime. Cornwell has been obsessed with and made a career of criminal behavior, death, and murder herself; by her own what - makes - madness equation, shouldn't she explain her own morbid preoccupations to the reader?In light of the many sound accomplishments found here, it's unfortunate how many errors in judgement Cornwell has made, especially if \\"staking her career\\" on this volume as she says she is. Sickert is portrayed on any number of pages as manipulative, bizarre, cunning, misogynistic, treacherous, desperate for attention, and dangerously arrogant - Cornwell states these are facts about his character - but provides almost no sources for her information, when this should have been scrupulously documented. The worst others have to say about Sickert comes to almost nothing. Under oath, former teacher Whistler says, \\"Walter has a treacherous side to his character,\\" his first wife's sister, who clearly disliked Sickert, perhaps with good reason, says \\"they cannot know what he really is as you do,\\" and Clive Bell refers to him a man of \\"no standards.\\" In exaggerated fashion, Cornwell calls Sickert a \\"master of disguise\\" - a master, not just an afficionado - but again provides no sources.Viewing early drawings by Sickert-or, she admits, perhaps drawn by his father-Cornwell believes she already sees clear evidence of a woman-hater and a violent, disturbed mind. But when the reader refers to these drawings, the figures are hardly more than stick figures; one male figure Cornwell ominously perceives as \\"about to spring\\" at a defenseless woman looks more like a hemorrhoid sufferer hesitantly lowering himself onto a cold toilet. Yet two Ripper letters containing drawings obviously done by a talented hand are called \\"crude.\\" An in-profile caricature of a woman is said to have \\"an ugly mole\\" on the nose, but the \\"mole\\" is clearly just an oversized, if still unsightly, nostril. Readers will get the sense that one thing Cornwell isn't is a visual artist, a race she seems to have little understanding of or sympathy with.Sickert's relationships with his wives is barely touched upon until the end, and what first wife Ellen thought about her husband, whom she loved until her death, is never made clear. Since Cornwell believes Sickert was impotent all his life and perhaps left without a penis after three traumatic childhood surgeries, the reader should know a great deal about his marital life, and what his wives felt about marrying a man only to discover a eunuch in their honeymoon beds.Cornwell, in sadly PC fashion, quotes her mentor Dr. Marcella Fierro as saying \\"a woman has the right to walk around naked and not be raped or murdered.\\" In the theoretical and idealized Garden of Eden of liberalism, that certainly may be the case. Reality, again, is something else. Cornwell embarrasses herself by stooping so low to make an unnecessary case for the Ripper's desperate, tragic victims.The author should have spent several more years on this book and then written a scholarly, definitive account of her presently unfinished investigation. Why the rush to publication? Cornwell's errors and misjudgements throughout will only raise powerful doubts about her methods and conclusions, and prejudice the reader against the more solid fruits of her labor."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is simply terrible. Corwell piles up a number of &quot;could have beens,&quot; &quot;maybes,&quot; and &quot;we can never know for sures&quot; and finds that these speculations add up to her suspect being Jack the Ripper. She proudly states at one point that a Scotland Yard Official would have presented her evidence to the Crown Prosecutor. I would suggest the Crown Prosecutor would laugh the the official out of the office and suggest counseling.What is most disturbing is that Cornwell dismisses previous efforts to identify the subject as speculative and relying on flawed notions of personality types. She indicts Sickert largely based on a psycho-babble interpretation of his lifestyle and drawings. This effort seems to me to be a 21st Century version of the phrenology which disgusts her in reviewing 19th and 20th Century efforts to identify the Ripper.I could go on about the the substantive weaknesses as they are legion, but suffice to say, as an attorney, I could have Sickert out without presenting a case. As a former state's attorney I wouldn't bothering bringing charges. She often tries to anticipate what a defense attorney would do with her evidence. She simply shows how little she knows about defense attorneys. Her &quot;evidence&quot; would be shredded by any competent attorney.From a literary standpoint, Cornwell seems to follow a lose chronology of the killings and then throws in whatever sticks to the wall: A little wife abuse here, a little deformity there, and mix it all with the fact that Sickert had a strange and dark personality (how strange for an artist) and sprinkles liberally throughout the book. She may have made an in depth analysis of these matters, but the information is so loosely presented in such a poorly organized manner that I had long since stopped caring by the end of the book.This book is substantively weak, organizationally chaotic, and tinged with such presumptions of superiority and righteousness on behalf of the author that the final product really should not have been published. I enjoyed Cornwell's first few books, but stopped reading them because it became obvious that either her talent had peaked or she was mailing in the newer books. I tooks a chance on this book based on an review. I feel like suing the reviewer for the $7.99 I spent on the book. I'd have a better chance of winning that case than Cornwell would winning hers."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell spent six million dollars of her own money researching Jack the Ripper, and the result is this book. Did she really close the case? Unfortunately, no.Walter Sickert was in France while at least four of the five canonical murders took place. There are nearly a half-dozen independent sources, that we know of, that attest to this fact. Only one of those sources, a letter, is mentioned by Cornwell, and then summarily dismissed because there was no post-mark to prove when it was sent.Ms. Cornwell claims to have found a match between Sickert's DNA and the Ripper. This is not true. She found a sequence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on both letters signed \\"Jack the Ripper\\" and letters written by Walter Sickert. This is an important distinction. mtDNA, unlike nuclear DNA (which was not found on any of the correspondence), is not unique. A particular mtDNA sequence can be shared by anywhere between 1% and 10% of the population. Ignore the countless problems of DNA contamination and provenance that comes with examining documents over a century old, and you still have the problem that these \\"Ripper letters\\" are known to be hoaxes (nearly 600 of them were sent to the press and police from all corners of the globe in 1888 and beyond). On top of that, Sickert's DNA no longer exists - he was cremated after his death. There is no way to tell whether the mtDNA found on Sickert's letters was his, his wife's, a friend's, or that of any of a thousand researchers and students who have handled them in the past sixty years.Although Patricia claims that the evidence she has amassed would be enough for a jury in 1888 to say \\"Hang him!\\", I have to disagree. At best, she has found partial evidence to suggest that perhaps Walter Sickert hoaxed one or more Ripper letters. But even if that were proven beyond the shadow of a doubt, there is nothing to suggest that these \\"Ripper letters\\" were actually from the murderer. Most students of the case believe them all, with the possible exception of the \\"From Hell\\" letter, to be hoaxes.I would suggest that readers interested in the case pick up Phil Sugden's \\"Complete History of Jack the Ripper\\", which was just recently reprinted in paperback. Alternatively, you can check out the web site \\"Casebook: Jack the Ripper,\\" which contains a great deal of information on Cornwell's book, Walter Sickert, and all manner of Ripper-related topics."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Do not read this book if you want reliable information on the ripper case. As the CASEBOOK website on the ripper crimes argues, there is much wrong with Cornwell's evidence and her use of it. For example, she ignores evidence that her suspect Sickert was in France during the commission of several ripper crimes. She also provides absolutely no evidence that Sickert had violent tendencies or ever had any residence or spent any time in the area of the killings. Her emphasis on the ripper letters is largely useless, since there is no way to determine their authenticity.The preimier book on the ripper is Philip Sugden's THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF JACK THE RIPPER. A trained historian, Sugden explores the vast evidence meticulously. It is really THE book to read on the ripper case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It's almost funny, Patricia Cornwell has conned a lot of critics and her pubisher - but the reviewing public here at Amazon sees right through the garbage. Cornwell's theory about poor old Walter Sickert is so full of holes that I frequently found myself chuckling as I read.Only allowed a thousand words here so I can't tear this book apart line by line. But here's a fun example: Cornwell points out that Jack the Ripper often used horse racing slang in his letters, even gave the cops tips on the ponies! The tie-in to Sickert is clear she says - the Ripper once referred to \\"Bangor Street\\" in a letter and there is no Bangor Street in London. But don't go away now, there is a city called Bangor in Wales which has a racecourse! Stay with old Patty now, here's the clincher, and I quote: \\"While I have no evidence that Sickert bet on race horses, I don't have any fact to say he didn't\\".CASE CLOSED, as the cover says. Hey, while I have no evidence that Patricia Cornwell wears men's size 12 Bruno Magli shoes, I have no proof that she doesn't either - call Mark Furman.It only gets better. Cornwell finds a guest book at some obscure coastal England bed and breakfast. The guest register was defiled and doodled in by a guest Cornwell assumes to be the Ripper many years after the Ripper murders. She points out that poor old Sickert was never seen there (he was semi-famous), and never registered there. But she's happy to spend a chapter assuming that he registered there under an alias, and disguised, decades after the Ripper murders because it was the kind of place he would have liked. CASE CLOSED!You want evidence of a crime, folks, it's on page 184. Old Patricia found evidence that she thought might point to a London cop, not Sickert. Her reaction: \\"I was completely unnerved and thought my life might disintegrate right before my eyes.\\" Looks like Ms. Cornwell had a lot at stake in nailing Sickert. Why Sickert? My guess is because he is the only one of five or six well known Ripper suspects who has no family left alive to sue Patricia Cornwell.Oh, there's a lot of 21st century psycho babble that he hated women in spite of the fact that he kept marrying the darned creatures (as a child he had an operation on his private parts - so MAYBE he couldn't perform sexually - Cornwell doesn't know this, but she guesses). Unfortunately she accuses the Ripper of murdering a young boy too, so much for the woman-hater theory. But logic doesn't deter Kay, I mean Patricia. And there's DNA evidence too, yeah - sure, and let us pray that they're not springing convicted murderers today on DNA evidence this weak.Listen, I'm an old Kay Scarpetta fan who has seen a huge drop-off in the quality of Cornwell's work in the past few years. I think Pat signed her Hollywoood contract and stopped working hard. The last Scarpetta novel was really bad. I'll bet a Kay Scarpetta movie is coming out soon, and I'll bet her Hollywood backers were screaming for some publicity. Well, they got it. CASE CLOSED."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms Cornwell starts the book by calling Walter Sickert a murderer, and continues the theme throughout. Unfortunately, she fails utterly to provide any evidence at all of his involvment in the Ripper murders, or any other murder for that matter. Stridency and repetition do not constitute proof.What most shocked me about the book was what was missing from it. A key point of her theory about Walter Sickert was his apparent impotence. Ms. Cornwell fails anywhere in the book to mention a certain Joseph Sickert, who maintains to this day to be Walter's illegitimate son. A bit of a hole in her theory that needs to be addressed. Either she was unaware of his existence (unlikely as she discusses the Dr. Gull/Masonic conspiracy, which was published in 1976 by Stephen Knight, who is also not mentioned in the book or bibilography, and which was based on allegations made by Joseph Sickert) or she made a deliberate decision to not mention him. The one case indicates an appalling lack of basic research, which casts doubt over the rest of her assertions; the second indicates either an inability to refute his claim or a cowardly refusal to challenge someone who is alive and able to file the defamation suit that Walter Sickert can't.Ms. Cornwell also fails to credit, or even mention, Jean Overton Fuller, who nominated Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper in 1990 based on exactly the same artistic grounds that Cornwell uses.Ms. Cornwell states that she can't prove Sickert was in London in Sept 1888, but can find no proof he wasn't. Again, she must not have looked very hard. Sickert was on his usual summer vacation with his family in France in Sept, proved by letters from his mother, his wife, and Jacques Emile Blanche. This should be particularly embarassing for Cornwell as she quotes from Blanche heavily throughout the rest of the book.I am not a Ripper expert. All of the above information I was able to find on the Internet in a matter of a hour or so.The book has been called poorly edited by other reviewers. I suspect that the editing style is deliberate; to hide the complete lack of any sustance to her allegations."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Like many others, I was more than a little annoyed at Ms. Cornwell's effrontery in the \\"Case Closed\\" part of her title. I had a \\"Who in the world do you think you are??\\" attitude before I read a page. So before going further, I would like to commend her on her hard work, and the fine investigating she did on the late Victorian era, and depictions of the poverty stricken East End of London, particularly White Chapel.Ms. Cornwell shows her inexperience in handling historical material by her woeful lack of sources and citations. Her opinions are just that. Her bibliography does not list one source by any of her colleagues who have devoted years of study to the case. Her villain of choice, the artist Walter Sickert, is not a new suspect, nor has all her investigation elevated him to prime suspect level. The degraded mtDNA found on an envelope enclosing a letter sent to Scotland Yard purportedly from Jack the Ripper could belong to 40,000 people in London alone as well as Walter Sickert. Ms. Cornwell refuses to believe ANY crank letters were sent to the Yard and London newspapers, that every last one was from Walter Sickert. This would entail Mr. Sickert traveling the length and breadth of Great Britain and France during a two-month period. Ms. Cornwell \\"proves\\" Sickert was in London at the time of the murders by flatly stating no one \\"proved\\" he wasn't there in spite of the fact that a contemporary letter from Sickert's wife places him in France. She places hidden meanings in his dark forbidding paintings that try as I would, I couldn't see \\"weapons\\" and \\"hidden faces.\\"All through the reading of this book, I had the uncomfortable feeling Ms. Cornwell was trying to squeeze a size 16 model into a size 8 dress, slicing off a leg here or an arm there; anything to make it fit.

This book is worse than awful; it is an abomination for which the publisher should be ashamed. It is one thing for Ms. Cornwall to write dreadful novels (though her first ones were quite good), but it is another matter for her to tackle non-fiction and write [bad stuff]. If her \\"Ripper,\\" Walter Sickert were still alive, he could sue her for libel and win every dollar she has earned. Pages 64-65 sum up her work.

Plus awful writing that no high school teacher would accept. This book is a disgrace. I will never read another thing she writes."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm going to avoid certain points other reviewers have covered, such as whether her case for Sickert as the Ripper is convincing. I didn't think so, though I was interested in her evidence regarding the great number of letters received, particularly that some were painted. My point is her rather incredible contempt for Victorians and other historical persons, whether they were the police, the victims, the press, or random people.I first read this book in 2005, and initially, I thought my reaction was based on irritation. I've never cared for Cornwell's primary heroine, Kay Scarpetta, who strikes me as arrogant, overbearing, and essentially snobbish, surrounding herself with people who are sick, neurotic, deranged, or otherwise unwell. The mysteries are competent enough, so I read them, but Scarpetta herself doesn't engage or interest me. My interest in the Ripper goes back to high school, and, while I don't consider myself an expert, I do read about the Ripper with interest, and I think I'm reasonably well-informed about the crimes.Whenever someone proclaims that they have \\"solved\\" the Ripper murders, I am somewhere between cringing and eager - I buy the book, and brace myself for embarassment; all too often, the bracing is needed.Cornwell does a terrible job of laying out her case. She jumbles together letters (frequently undated, and certainly lacking good citations), incidents (again, lacking citation - how do I find these cases, ma'am?), speculation about the Ripper's actions or motives, and rants (they cannot be called anything else) about Walter Sickert's life and activities. Then Cornwell gives her conclusion; a reader unacquainted with the Ripper might end up bowled over by her forceful statements and restatements of her premise.Worse, Cornwell imagines herself as a compassionate and enlightened, even objective recorder and observer. Her relation of the East End pictures the people living there not as individuals, but as distinctly depressing statistics, and relates (as if it were all there was to the people of the era) an overwhelming sense of some mass of dirty, alcohol-impaired, brutish mass. Certainly, the East End of London, in the 1880's, was not a happy place, but not every resident was illiterate, drunk, ignorant, dirty and hopeless. Most of the witnesses at the inquests of the Ripper's victims are not well-off, certainly, but most of them are working, at least reasonably intelligent, and not entirely unobservant.Further, Cornwell cannot make up her mind. First, she disparages the British medical establishment and its autopsy reports and observations; next, she relies upon a newspaper account of an inquest (or at least never makes a clear citation of an actual medical report) to say that a boy murdered in Bradford had his heart \\"plucked\\" out, rather than cut. She may have it one way or the other. She may not have it both.To make matters worse, Patricia Cornwell displays a truly appaling ignorance of some historical matters; what trial by ordeal consisted of; the legality of swimming a suspect; how much was understood about rigor mortis by the 1880's (um, I hate to break it to her, but some of the classic relations of the stages of rigor were written up almost fifty years before - and I'm just a reader, not someone making my living writing about murder and its investigation); the sociology of Britain in this era. On none of these subjects do I claim expertise; on the other hand, I'm reasonably well-read, and Cornwell is flat-out wrong, and superficial in her dismissal of the actual facts.Worst, from my point of view, is that Cornwell manages to get things wrong about the actual Ripper cases. For instance, in Elizabeth Stride's murder, she never once cites Shwartze's evidence. She doesn't explain why she doesn't, she simply acts as if he never existed. Cornwell mis-spells two victims' names - Martha Tabram is listed as Tabran (not a favored spelling (though possible), and Catherine Eddowes is consistently referred to as Eddows (much to my irritation). Charles Warren comes in for undeserved condemnation, particularly regarding bloodhounds (never mind that he never thought hounds would do any good, and in fact participated in a test to prove it), for no good reason I can see, but Robert Anderson is never mentioned, and Swanson is cited only a couple times.So far as I can tell, Cornwell began this book convinced of the guilt of one, particular person, and did not bother to acquire more than a casual acquaintance with the rest of the case, or the era, which she wrote about.The case is far from closed (no, I have no candidate for the Ripper), and Cornwell, while her evidence regarding the many letters possibly written by Sickert is interesting and possibly valuable, needs to get over her sense of superiority, and take a more honest, complete look at the case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is without a doubt the worst book on Jack the Ripper that I have ever had the misfortune ro read. And, masochist that I am, I struggled through 342 pages, hoping to find some redeeming quality--some sort of smoking gun...er...bloody knife, that is, that could give this work some grounds for its pretentious &quot;Case Closed&quot; title.Why was it so bad? Because the way Pat Cornwell jumps to conclusions about gave me whiplash. Her favorite words, apparently, are 'could' and 'perhaps'. As in, (paraphrasing), &quot;He could have worn disguises.&quot; Nothing to back it up, mind you, just a 'could have'. And that 'could have' becomes gospel truth for the rest of the book. He could have done this, he could have done that. Perhaps he did this, perhaps he did that.Where is the evidence? Where is objectivity?Granted, evidence is scarce in the Ripper case, and so much has been poured and sifted through many, many times before. But as I read this book, I got the strong, overriding impression, that Cornwell found her suspect first--and *then* built a case to fit, rather than examining the case to find a suspect. And all of the gaps of logic, leaps of faith, could have's, and perhaps's fill in the gaps, otherwise she wouldn't have had a book.The much hyped DNA evidence she depends on basically relies on letters that flooded London in those days, both to police and newspapers and others. The vast majority are thought now, and were thought then to be hoaxes. Many different handwritings, pieces of stationary, locations the letters were sent from.Pat believes that all, or nearly all of them, are real, and all of them come from her favored suspect, Walter Sickert. Apparently Mr. Could Have can do just about anything, from being a master of disguise, to being a master of disguising his handwriting and writing a vast amount of letters in all different styles. What a clever boy, he is.DNA has supposedly been found that links Walter Sickert to the Ripper letters. This is crucial to her thesis, so they cannot be hoaxes in her opinion. She waffles on about the DNA evidence throughout the book, here and there, but really only gets into it for about ten pages or so.I'll save you money by quoting her findings (if only someone else had done me the same service):&quot;At best we have a 'cautious indicator' that the Sickert and Ripper mitochondrial DNA sequences may have come from the same person.&quot;Hardly sounds like &quot;case closed&quot; to me. And that is Pat putting the best face on it. The spine of her case, and it can't be proven. And even if it was, would that make Sickert the Ripper, or, more likely, one of the many hoaxers of the time, instead?Pat also seems to link every single murder case in Europe to Jack the Ripper's door, all over England, to France, to Italy. Never mind the different MO's. Never mind the different victimologies. While it is true that a killer can change MO's, styles, change his victim prefrences, its not that likely, is it?Pat will pick a murder case, seemingly from a hat, and mention it on one page 'such and such was killed here etc etc', describe the details, and then plunge right back into her theme without *ever* tying it in or proving that it was a Ripper crime at all, much less Sickert's.I guess all violent deaths in those days were all Jack the Ripper victims. Who knew?I'm surprised she didn't take it farther. Extend her own logic about unsolved crimes into other areas. For instance:Sickert COULD HAVE faked his own death in 1942, lived on, and have been standing on the Grassy Knoll in 1963 to kill JFK. His MO and victimology have changed, sure, but perhaps he was really only aiming at Jackie.Why not? He could have done it. Perhaps he did. Its physically possible. No one can prove he wasn't there. Its a perfectly valid theory.Oh dear, did I just give away the plot for Patricia Cornwell's sequel?The above arguement sums up the book, really. No one can prove or disprove it, so she will write it and claim it is true.If Walter Sickert had indeed faked his death and is still around, I'd say he would (not just could, but *would*) have one hell of a libel suit.Save your money.

He realized his imagination would be better put to use writing novels, since he had too much a flight of fancy for the objective life of a doctor. Cornwell should follow Crichton's lead, as she has too much imagination for her own good, and should stay in the realm of fantasy and stay away from fact, since she gets the facts very wrong in CASE CLOSED."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"That this book is a success is demonstrated by the passionate love -hate reviews. A &quot;good read&quot;it is, and in the end, that is what we want from Patricia Cornwell. I got the impression that she would very much like to be what she writes, but I don't have that expectation. I thought this book was a good page turner and lovingly researched for a true crime production. Whether it was six million worth, I don't know, but it kept me entertained with all sorts of doubts about her theories and methods.And, what I loved was her very humanizing portraits of these victims. She gave us real human beings in this work. A part of me thinks this should have been worked into a novel, a delightful Cornwell novel. But I admired its passion and willingness to step into the abyss of this controversy and put it all out there.I saw an interview in which said she was &quot;risking her professional reputation&quot;in this book. Well, she really isn't. It is a bit overreaching for the excellent crime novelist to think that her reputation is as a crime investigator. She is very simply one of the very best at what she does best. She writes about bad guys, brings them to justice, keeps us awake at night turning the pages, and just a wee bit nervous about what is outside the window.This book has some of that and gives us a glimpse of her as the newspaper crime writer. It also tell the story of Jack the Ripper as well as it has ever been told. And really, readers isn't that enough? She got all of you ranting and raving, yes she did, all the way to the bank. Ripper industry? Maybe. But, if you can't enjoy this book, maybe it is you, not the author taking her/himself too seriously."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've generally enjoyed Cornwell's novels which, though inevitably formulaic, are tightly composed, full of information, and of a length suitable for finishing on a cross-country flight. Were it not for Patricia Cornwell, Michael Conelly, and John Sandford I would dread air travel.Portrait of a Killer, on the other hand, falls into no ready category. I would describe it as a combination of Freud's \\"Psychopathology of Everyday Life\\", \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", and the Minneapolis white pages.The topic should be a sure-fire hit -- everybody loves this case except the shade of poor Fred Abberline, who is remembered only for his failure to nail the Whitechapel killer. But somehow, Portrait of a Killer veers off into an eccentric orbit of uncorrelated facts, impressions, and observations, unreferenced and apparently without chronological structure and innocent of any framework to bring before a grand jury.The book is about Walter Richard Sickert, a known creep protected by his art like an Edwardian Roman Polanski; but the life and times of one unsavory sociopath are of little interest to those who bought the book without the parallel development of the Whitechapel murders. In this case, anyone trying to understand the crimes will be hopelessly confused. The core murders -- Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddows, and Kelly -- are listed only incidentally and without a clear chronology, and are interspersed with later events that may or may not be part of the Ripper's corpus of art. To confuse readers further, sketches from Sickert's life are inserted almost randomly into the Ripper narrative, sometimes with connection and sometimes (apparently) just to insert text. The only real forensic result -- a tantalizing but indeterminate DNA result -- is buried in text early in the book. The graphological clues and doodlings of the murdered (?) and Sickert are similarly pursued to nowhere because no organized case summary is ever presented. I could make one by reading the book page by page and entering points on a legal pad (and doodling in frustration), but that should not be the reader's task.I am not a Ripper buff. I've read one book other than this one and sat through quite a few films hoping to find enlightenment. There are still no answers after Portrait of a Killer. And perhaps it is better that way. As few of us wanted Lee Harvey Oswald to have acted alone, so we would be disappointed to learn at the end of all the speculations that Saucy Jack was not an eccentric artist, a Freemason, or part of a Royal conspiracy, but finally just one or more illiterate thugs acting out their brutal psychopathic lives in the alleys of London's East End."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell has some serious hubris to come to, and stick to, this conclusion. Let us hope that she is never run up on charges backed by as little evidence as she presents in this wild goose chase. I understand the case is about as cold as they get a hundred years after the fact but the very circumstantial leaps of faith she builds her case with is very laughable and not even the basis of an indictment let alone a conviction. Now Walter Sickert [yeah, a name made to order] may have been a tyrant and misogynist but these are not crimes. In fact a lot of artists are these things, fueled by their own self import and ego but that doesn't make them murders.The most likely explanation tends to be the correct one, which is that Jack was a nobody [not a nationally known artist with several biographies to his name]. And it is most likely that he died in 1888, was committed, or imprisoned for other crimes. Sickert was none of those things, if he was even in London at all during the canonical five murders. Cornwell goes on the assumption that since she finds no evidence that he was out of London, therefore he must have been there [though he was a frequent traveler]. It would be a stronger case if she could get strong traction in handwriting expertise in the Ripper letters and Sickert's. She says that some experts conclude them identical but is awfully skimpy on the experts' names. She should mention the evidence against her own case. Take it head on.The situation kinda reminds me of people that deal in reincarnation. They always claim they were someone famous in another life and never the common nobody. It's selling sensationalism, and that's this book. The two selling points about this book are the presented facts of the Ripper murders and letters [and not the baseless conjecture of Sickert's involvement]. The second selling point are that the chapters seem to end precisely when you have had enough of them. That kind of pace is refreshing actually. My advice, get it from the library [as I did], and skip the biographical chapters about Walter and his wife and family."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A book on historical matters thats what! The whole book seemed contrived from the very beginning. This was the absolute bottom of the barrel of the Jack the Ripper books in my opinion."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm not saying much that the other 450 or so reviews already here haven't said; more just adding my thumb to the scale of those disappointed by how dramatically short Ms. Cornwell's &quot;case&quot; comes to being &quot;closed.&quot;Perhaps my biggest problem with the book has nothing to do with the soundness of the theory, but instead with how poorly written it is. It is in serious need of an a competent editor. Chapters start with lofty premises that never pan out, or, worse, are never tied to anything concrete. The meandering narrative weaves between things presented as fact to things that, eventually, one learns are sheer speculation, with little warning of the transition. You will find yourself frequently wondering, &quot;how does this relate to anything I've read previously,&quot; and then later, &quot;how did that relate to anything that came later in the chapter.&quot; It's really bad. Actually, as I think about it, my hunch is that this is all deliberate and that Cornwell would like anything but a competent editor -- some of the &quot;evidence&quot; on which she has &quot;closed&quot; the &quot;case&quot; is so sketchy (see below) that obsfuscation really is her friend. Clarity would probably reveal a lot that she doesn't want revealed.Equally troubling is how unconvincing Ms. Cornwell is. It's certainly an interesting theory. But much of the book is simply conjecture piled on top of speculation, as Cornwell attempts lamely to convince you of what she has apparently already convinced herself. Some of it is so absurd that I quite literally laughed out loud. One theory that repeats itself randomly thoughout the book is that that Walter Sickert is the Ripper, because some Ripper letters use the at-the-time rare expression &quot;ha ha ha,&quot; which, Cornwell assures us, is an American affectation, and one that Sickert probably would have heard because he hung around as an apprentice to an American, and that American, Cornwell believes, had a good sense of humor, so therefore probably liked practical jokes, and thus, quite naturally, surely laughed at times, and when he did certainly did so by using &quot;ha ha.&quot; Really. That's a central theory to the book. I'm not making this up. The genital mutilation theory, on which the book puts much emphasis, is equally sketchy -- one waits patiently through 400 pages to learn what evidentiary basis she has for the theory, but it's really just pop-psychology, 120 years after the fact.Which is not to say that the entire book is all conjecture. I think Cornwell does an admirable job of making a case that Sickert wrote some Ripper letters. If she had limited herself to that modest, but startling, premise, and then asked the next natural questions, the book would be quite valuable. But that is hardly enough to put &quot;case closed&quot; on the cover, which of course is not going to sell many books. And that, fundamentally, is my problem with the book. Cornwell gets trapped, because she doesn't want to admit that the next natural question -- did the writer of Ripper lettes have special knowledge that demonstrates he was acutally the killer and not just some twisted prankster -- has no answer. Instead, she glosses over it, by use of slight of hand, and about how images in the Ripper letters are similer to coroner's photographs and those photographs show the body as only the killer could have seen it. It's pretty shallow.Anyway, you get the point. My last point is only a quibble, but it really was unnecessary and completely annoying. Throughout the book, Cornwell writes how she would have analyzed the crime scenes, if the murders happened today, and all the wonderful evidence that she, super slueth, would have preserved. These passages really must be read to appreciate their self-congratulatory and pedantic nature. It's extreme.The true value of this book, if it exists, and the reason I give it two stars instead of one, is the portraits it paints of the victims, who have been forgotten as the legend, if that's the right word, of the Ripper has grown. Cornwell is not the first to do this, by any means, but she handles the victims with dignity and with honor, which is, in my view, this psuedo-novel's chief redeeming feature."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Do I really care to know how a Virginia Forensic Team would have handled a crime scene from the 1800's?

I have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. Both Cornwell's writing and her &quot;evidence&quot; are just embarrassing. All this book proves is that her ego has far surpassed her talent. The majority of her &quot;evidence&quot; consists of: &quot;There's no reason to suspect he wasn't in London that night,&quot; or &quot;he might possibly have walked home this way.&quot; Her so-called forensic evidence (DNA and handwriting) are inconclusive and less than convincing. The entire book is nothing more than any of her other books: fiction. I'm embarrassed to even own it. Try John Douglas's nonfiction instead if you want real criminal science."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Actually, Jack the Ripper was the late Victorian novelist, George Gissing, author of New Grub Street -- at least Gissing is as credible a culpert as Sickert when applying the same type of \\"evidence\\" and \\"logic\\" as Cornwell offers in her sophomoric excuse of a book. After all, Gissing caught a venereal disease and endured social disgrace and great poverty as a result of his affair with the prostitute, \\"Nell.\\" Certainly a reason for this shy-spoken and self-effacing classical scholar and realist novelist to harbor a deep-seated homcidal rage against all prositutes and to revenge himself by serial murders in the East End. And here's the clincher: within six months of Nell's death in 1888, while Gissing was living in London, the first of the Ripper murders was committed! Notice also that the Ripper murders abruptly had ended by the time Gissing had moved to France in the 1890s. Case closed, eh? Or perhaps the Ripper was Jude Fawley, the main character of Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude the Obscure, who was given in its pages to drunken acts of self-destruction, or then again perhaps the Ripper was none other than General Charles \\"Chinese\\" Gordon -- four years after Gordon's mysterious \\"beheading\\" and \\"disappearance\\" at Khartoum the near-decapitation murders of East End prostitutes begin.My point is that this sort of speculation can go on forever, as Cornwell's seemingly intermittable book does, and anyone could write this type of god-awful speculation, even without the temptations of a millions-dollar advance, if only one \\"would abandon one's mind to it.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"In this author's case, success has obviously bred an arrogance that's in a league of its own.

The low ratings are from people who are more familiarwith the complexities of the Ripper case, not to mention a fewdie-hard Ripperologist's opinions as well. Anyone quite familiar with the case could immediately dismiss her claims outright. At the time of the murders Scotland Yard gave SOME credence to only one letter among hundreds received at the news agencies. This is the famous FROM HELL letter which included a piece of a kidney (may or may not have been human) which MAY have come from one of the victims. All the others were considered hoaxes by the authorities, many determined to have been created by journalists to sell copy. Thus linking Sickert to a bunch of hoaxed letters tells us zip. If any of you want to read an excellent account of the Ripper case with only primary source material (ie actual coroner reports, news articles, etc during the time of the murders) and painstaking research I highly recommend Philip Sugden's Complete History of Jack the Ripper.

Even if she had indisputable evidence as outlined by her audacious title, it still wouldn't save horrible writing and appalling pacing.Her evidence consists of some DNA evidence to prove that Sickert may have written some hoax letters and some in depth analysis of painting which as a trained artist I find laughable.Her painting analysis is outrageous, as any educated art historian knows Sickert painted from photographs almost exclusively. Violence towards women is not all that uncommon among artists by Cornwell's rationale Picasso, Cezanne, Dali, DeKooning, any painter of any version of the Rape of Sabine Women, and any 17 year-old \\"brooding\\" artist could paint a picture that would make Cornwell suspicious.As for Sickert the man, yeah he was a jerk prone to outrageous behavior. However, being a jerk is less than being a murderer. About terrible behavior read a biography of Picasso's wonderful attitude towards women or Freud with his attitude towards women and obsession with sex. The point is, while art, like any other profession has its share of disreputable people, Sickert would be by no means the first person to be accused of being a less than stellar person. However, it must be said that lots of less than stellar individuals go through life without killing someone.What about some of the other suspects? Few of them are mentioned in passing and summarily dismissed.Finally, there is resonable evidence that Sickert was in France during the Whitechapel murders. Hmmmm. . not being there does pose a problem.Cornwell also neglects to mention she bought several paintings of Sickerts work, looking for her conclusive DNA evidence to tie her suspect to letters that have been dismissed as mostly hoaxes. She is rumored to have completely destroyed one (inexcusable to those who love art) and I wonder if the others are going to increase in value once her book comes out. Hmmmm. . . .Cornwell, like many Ripper slueths before her, puts the cart before the horse and wants the facts to fit her suspect. I can fully understand the desire to prove beyond a doubt your solution to one of the greatest crime mysteries in the world, but to propose this circumstantial evidence as fact and pronounce case closed is dubious at best."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Poor Patricia Cornwell. She has fallen into a trap of her own making. She has stated publicly that she &quot;stakes her reputation&quot; on her conclusion that Walter Sickert was the Ripper, and has boasted that she spent &quot;four million dollars of my own money&quot; on research to attempt to prove it so. I guess if I spent that much money on such a pursuit, I would want something to show for it, too. Unfortunately, all she has to show for her effort is the fact that she has made herself look like a buffoon.I first heard about her ridiculous theory on &quot;20/20&quot; when she was interviewed by Diane Sawyer. Even in the limited time she had in this forum, she demonstrated the gaping holes in her theory. So Sickert painted some disturbing pictures? Oh, no! I guess we'd better call the cops on Picasso, Van Gogh, and Goya as well, to name a few. I strongly doubt that Sickert was the only London artist whose work was influenced by the murders.But the &quot;Rosetta stone&quot; that makes her theory fall flat on its face is this: the letters. Cornwell jumps through hoops, making a big fuss about the Ripper letters as if they were the key to the entire case. They are not. Why? It's simple: THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THAT THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDERS WROTE A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE LETTERS. No way at all. There is no REASON to think of any one of the letters as anything other than a hoax. Even if one or two of them are genuine, the rest are obviously hoaxes. Hundreds of them. Cornwell does make a fairly convincing case that Sickert wrote at least one or two of them. BIG DEAL! All that means is that he wrote a couple hoax letters, as dozens--if not hundreds--of other Londoners were also doing at the time. It does not make him Jack the Ripper. How could she be so shortsighted? Testing the stamps and letters for DNA and fingerprints is a great idea... IF you can prove that the murderer wrote the letter. Since you can't, it is completely pointless.In Cornwell's line of work, she should be familiar with the work of former FBI agent John Douglas, who poineered behavioral profiling. To him--and trust me, he knows his stuff--it is a no-brainer to state that the Ripper was NOT the type of personality who would write letters to the police and press. Appartently Cornwell thinks she is smarter than Mr. Douglas.Cornwell made the mistake common to rookie investigators: she started with a suspect, then worked backwards, trying to bend the facts of the case to fit her theory. That is not how you solve crimes. You do the opposite: work with the facts, and find out which direction they point.When Sawyer asked her, &quot;Can you prove that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper?&quot; she responded, &quot;I'd like somebody to prove to me that he wasn't!&quot; For cryin' out loud. Give me a break, Ms. Cornwell. This is YOUR theory. The burden of proof is on YOU. And you have failed. There was not one shred of physical evidence left behind by the Ripper, and not even a solid eyewitness description. Therefore, there is no way to EVER solve the case, which is why it remains so fascinating to armchair &quot;Ripperologists&quot; such as myself. Anyone who claims to have solved the mystery is deluding themselves. Walter Sickert was no more Jack the Ripper than the ludicrous Maybrick diary, or Prince Eddie, or Donald Duck.But, hey... nice try, Ms. Cornwell. Stick to fiction.Readers looking for a general overview of the Ripper crimes should steer far clear of this book. There are numerous better ones out there. Start with Philip Sugden's &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, arguably the best."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I just don't buy Ms. Cornwell's assertion that the case is closed. Part of my reluctance to accept her conclusion has to do with the methodology used in building her &quot;proof.&quot; She has a habit of introducing a possibility which somehow becomes a probability and then grows into an absolute. She seems to believe that enough assumed possibilities constitute overwhelming evidence. Hence, in her mind, &quot;CASE CLOSED.&quot;The easiest way for me to illustrate this point is by opening the book to almost any page and let the author's words speak for themselves.Page 65: &quot;I am inclined to suspect that . . . .&quot; -- &quot;It may also be that he was physically different . . .&quot; -- &quot;The repeated use of the phrase would have been humiliating . . . &quot;Page 72: &quot;. . . . could not have possessed the coping skills . . .&quot;Page 126: &quot;If the killer had been standing . . . the killer must have held the knife in his right hand.&quot;Page 162: &quot;Many of the locations mentioned (in various Ripper letters) are places well known to Walter Sickert.&quot;Page 166: &quot;It would have been in character for him to . . . .&quot;These are but a few of the great number of &quot;could haves&quot; and &quot;might haves&quot; and &quot;it is possible thats&quot; that fill PORTRAIT OF A KILLER . . . CASE CLOSED.&quot; Assumptions abound.It is well known to scientific investigators that if you start an experiment with a predetermined result in mind, you will probably find enough facts that fit and that your experiment will yield the desired result. In Ms. Cornwell's case, I believe that, in the absence of hard facts, she was able to make enough assumptions to prove to herself that Walter Sickert really was Jack the Ripper.I suppose that it is sometimes possible that a correct conclusion can be reached using bad methodology, but it is stretching the point to call it a proof.

She is not a forensic expert, not a psychologist specializing in abnormal or clinical pathological behavior, not a specialist of brain dysfunction, and not a historian, yet makes claims to all of the above in her audacious statement of having &quot;solved&quot; a hundred plus year old historic event. She handles history clumisly, ignoring context (e.g. suggesting fear of blood-borne pathogens, hardly a concern for the Victorian age), gives misleading neurologic information (cites frontal lobe deficit as tantamount to homicidal profile), and uses terms like &quot;psychopath&quot;, couched in psychiatric jargon that is no longer current.

In my opinion, this is not a well-researched, well-written, or objective book. Ms. Cornwall suffers from the same problem that many of the Ripper authors do--she starts with a pet theory, a pre-conceived solution, and then sees the evidence the way she wants to see it in order to &quot;prove&quot; her theory.What has she proved? Well, if you can follow her badly presented explanation of DNA evidence and how it works, she has proved only that Sickert may have written some of the Ripper letters. Not much of a payoff for a book subtitled, &quot;Case Closed.&quot;Still, it would have been a worthwhile read if it had been organized better. The book felt like it was rushed into production.

She provides only a tenuous link between Walter Sickert and letters signed Jack the Ripper and no link at all between Sickert and the actual crimes. The rest of her evidence is might have, could have, I don't know but. The most ironic connection she makes is that one of his paintings is entitled Jack the Ripper's Bedroom and other paintings have violent themes. This from a woman who writes novels about gruesome murders. Should we check to see if there are any unsolved murders where she lives? Of course not. Sickert also liked to take long walks at night - o my goodness - in London - and attended music halls. This is the only true crime book I have read, and I have read many, where I was so disappointed in the lack of content that I wanted to send the book back to the publisher for a refund. Patricia Cornwell's editor should be ashamed of herself and Patricia Cornwell should learn the basic tenets of historical research - for example following the facts to find a conclusion as opposed to bending the facts to fit a theory.

This book took a lot of criticism when it was first released, but it is very well researched and documented. Definitely worth the read by any true crime fan."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I bought this book while I was in my Patricia Cornwell novel phase. We will never know who the Jack The Ripper murderer actually was, but it was an interesting and informative read. There is alot of speculation, but what can you expect from an event which happened so long ago."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have not read this book, but I feel that it is not fair for Patricia Cornwell to say accuratly that the case is closed and the person she says is Jack the Ripper really was Jack the Ripper. Many other people have studyed years of their lives on this case and have not figured out who Jack really was. There are many people that it could be, but no one person can be definitivly be called Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"not compelling, not well written"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I honestly cannot understand the criticisms of the way this book was written.

I read this after \\"The Crimson and the White\\". the books complement each other well. After reading I revisited the DVD of \\"From Hell\\"...interesting to contrast."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"For what can be described as one of the &quot;coldest cases&quot; known, as far as evidence is concerned, Cornwell makes a compelling case. I read this book in four days, and could barely put it down. Some previous reviewers have made comments regarding the use of profiling in this book. Profiling has, on the whole, been a very useful tool in solving crimes. Roy Hazelwood and John Douglas are experts in the field and have been instrumental in solving some of the most violent and shocking crimes of our lifetime. The extensive research, thoughtfulness, background information and care put into this work shines through on every page. Agree with her theory or not, you cannot, once you finish this book, dismiss it out of hand.Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I liked this story and I usually enjoy most of the books written by Ms. Cornwell.

At the same time, Cornwell enables the reader to become absorbed in the history of the time of Jack the Ripper that only the section of photographs in the middle of the book reminds of the truth it represents! It is a wonderful and enlightning book to the wonders of modern investigative technics and is a fascinating read for passionate fans or \\"newbies\\" to her work!... Highly recommended!..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It seems that a lot of people hate either this book, Patricia Cornwall, or both. Fair enough. But some of the reviews I've just been perusing have seemed unjustifiably vicious. Since the late 19th century, people have been speculating--with a great deal of confidence--on the identity of Jack the Ripper. Patricia Cornwall has the professional resume to take her turn, and in her defence, I believe she makes a very strong case for her conclusions.I cannot believe the nastiness of some of these other reviews--particularly the ones calling her names that have no business in a public forum. Really, it's probably the first time I've ever actually felt sorry for a wildly successful writer.Cornwall's a novelist, and her writing of nonfiction is enlivened by the prose that's made her successful in her established medium. This is no dreary textbook; quite a lot of it is narrative, following her tracks as she researches the White Chapel murders. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Does this mean she knows better than Scotland Yard? Probably not--but, then again ...(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel: \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.)"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"In response to the other reviewers who complain about a lack of Cornwell's forensic evidence and \\"knowledge\\" of the suspect, Sickert's, actions: did we both read the same book?: The part where she discussed the manufacture and form of Sickert's vs. Jack's paper upon which the Ripper's letters were written? (matching watermarks, sheets ripped in half along matching lines, Ripper letters on Sickert's wife's stationery, etc. . )? The fact that Sickert paintings hauntingly and very convincingly match unpublishable photographs of crime scenes (shown side by side)? Matching up Sickert's travels on the Continent with gaps in Ripper activity in England, and prostitute butchers in France and other Sickert retreat locations? And, almost as telling as the paper stock matches (which are correspondence existing in modern day, which Cornwell subjected to in-person examination and forensic testing), the fact that The Ripper's letters contained illustrations almost exactly matching in ink and skill quality as that of Sickert, a published artist?Forensic evidence abounds, and is convincingly argued and presented. LOOK at the photographic comparisons. Judge for yourself.. .I did, and I was convinced. (And condemning a book based on self-admittedly accepted name spelling variations, when original records are handwritten? Criticizing Cornwell for criticizing Victorian authorities' dismissive investigations of the murders of homeless prostitutes? These only bolster Cornwell's investigations, rather than doom them.)I've recommended this book to historically inquiring minds who like to see for themselves, and I recommend it to you as well."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If, as Patricia Cromwell states, the mitochondrial DNA found on the stamps of letters written by both Jack the Ripper and Sickert matched - how can there be so many people who don't believe she has proved guilt? Wouldn't that be enough without ANY of the other piles of circumstantial evidence??I get the feeling from many of these reviews that I read an entirely different book. The one I read was fascinating beyond belief. I wish some real DNA specialists would weigh in on this and explain the likelihood of finding multiple people with matching DNA."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The other night I told the Englishman sitting next to me in a tavern that England's most notorious criminal had at last been brought to the bar. When I explained that Patricia Cornwell had solved the case of Jack the Ripper with a mountain of circumstantial evidence. He replied \\"Yes, but it is circumstantial.\\" As though any evidence after 114 years could be anything but!! As I read the one- and two-star reviews of this book here at Amazon. com who claim that the case is not proved, all I can say is that, should I ever be at the bar for murder, I hope these [people] are on my jury! \\"If you are innocent, go before a judge, if you are guilty [as Sickert surely was] go before a jury.\\" The old adage is still good advice. Most people are skeptics and can't believe that the shadow they see on looking out between both their eyes is their own nose, even though they can see it clearly by looking through one eye and then the other. One of these \\"jurors\\" said that since only 99% of the people are eliminated by [mitochondrial] DNA, that such hardly constitutes a good match. We have a criminal in our sights, and, regardless of all the other evidence against him, there is one-percent of the population who is not eliminated by the DNA: Sickert-Jack fall into the one-percent together and that is not a good match? Just take the evidence of the \\"HA, HA.\\" that taunting phrase appears in about half of the Ripper letters. Cornwell demonstrates from painstaking research that the English did not use this phrase at all, and found it terribly rude--that it is an Americanism pure and simple. It is an important clew left by an arrogant killer. The German-Danish-French-Englishman Sickert would not know \\"HA HA,\\" nor would a low-life Eastend murderer--except that Sickert learned it from the American painter James Whistler to whom he was apprenticed, and who was well-known for his obnoxious HA HA. Had the Metropolitan Police force been sensitive to such matters, they'd have had their man. Too bad Patricia Cornwell and her staff were not available.This Sickert beast murdered not just helpless down-and-out unfortunates but a number of helpless children, as well. Disgusting animal! If I never look at another SICKert painting it will be too soon. And I am not alone in finding him guilty; the only law-enforcement person who comments in these reviews had this to say: \\"Not only was this a well researched and written book, I belive it to be the most convicing book on who Jack the Ripper was. I spent most of my life in Law Enforcement, in an Crimnal Investigator capacity. I have read almost all of the books on this Subject. The evidence is really quite convincing, for a crime this old. I believe that the author, has her man. When there is this much evidence, you just cannot walk away [even] with a reasonable doubt.... I too would take it into court. I belive a Judge would convict.\\" [Slightly edited]I only wish I had Ms. Cornwell's resources and skills when I go about investigating all the misunderstood issues from classical antiquity that are moot or stamped \\"issue closed.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I cannot see how anyone would not be convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack The Ripper after reading Ms. Cornwell's tediously researched book. There simply are far too many coincidences that cannot be explained away. To me the case is closed, conclusive DNA evidence or not. Most convincing to me are the letters that foretell of the \\"ripping (of)3 children\\" and then two weeks later the murder of a young boy who's heart was literally ripped out. I would suggest anyone who has an interest in the identity of this fiendish killer read this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Living in Australia, we didn't get all the same hype Americans did when Patricia wrote this book. I vaguely knew she'd been buying paintings and spending millions and people were saying she was crazy....but I believe she became so deeply involved with this project because once she started digging she knew she was onto the truth. I have read every previous book about the Ripper, and I have studied Criminology for many years and in my opinion, she's right. I was convinced, and I went into reading it sceptical. My only criticism is that it ended rather abruptly, but I always think Scarpetta novels do also. I would have liked to have known about the last 20 years of his life, his third wife, the paper landfill in the studio, whether those who knew him at the end - some of whom could still possibly be alive if he died in 1942 - had accounts of his last days, what he spoke of, did he lose his mind? Because serial killers often eventually do go mad (if not executed etc when younger), like Ian Brady (Moors murderer).I'd love to know what Patricia thinks Sickert would have made of her investigation? If alive today he would have read her books, certainly, and would probably have been rather secretly pleased that such a fine mind took on his psychopathic one.I was perplexed at some of the criticism levelled at the book, such as not being able to offer 100% proof - did anyone honestly expect that?? How on EARTH could anyone provide that?! As Patricia said, if Sickert himself had confessed to being the Ripper no one would have believed him. Pages and pages of postmortem reports have not survived the years, so the criticisms against Patricia are largely unfounded and should instead be blamed on time, thieves, the wars, any number of things but she did brilliantly with the material she had to work with, and her painstaking DNA testing was admirable. Bravo to you Patricia, I believe you."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Frankly, the people who have trashed this book haven't fully thought about its content. Granted, it doesn't read like smoothly like a novel. It's not supposed to! It's a CASEBOOK. There is WAY too much evidence for the Ripper NOT to have been Sickert.Let's see ... whom would I trust: someone who hasn't researched the case and has only read about it in crime novels and maybe a factual book of info OR a woman (Cornwell) who has viewed more crime scenes than most people in the USA, has done vast amounts of research and has actually found MATCHING DNA? I trust Cornwell. She knows her field."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Of course, the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders are probably the most famous of cold cases. In \\"Portrait of a Killer ...\\" Ms. Cornwell takes a new look at many facets of the Ripper murders and makes an excellent case for her prime suspect. The book is gripping and eye-opening. Ms. Cornwell paints a fascinating picture of London of the Victorian era and fills it in with details connecting the murders to one, very specific person. And goes on to give us a complet picture of him as well.If you're interested in the Ripper murders or you're just a \\"fan\\" of unsolved crimes, this book is a must-read. Ms. Cornwell's book is compelling and convincing. I loved it and have read it twice now."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I FOUND PATRICIA CORNWELL'S BOOK \\" portrait of a killer\\" very enlighting. Ms Cornwell knows her forensics, and she brings us up to date by giving the \\"MO\\" of the era. She has done a lot of research on this book. I throughly enjoyed the history and back round given."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There's been so much speculation about Kennedy's assassination that, despite compelling and strong evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald (In Case Closed) did it alone, the subject has taken on a literary and profitable life of its own. The same could be true for Jack the Ripper. More time has passed and, as a result, the evidence continues to become more and more distant from the present. I was dubious about the conclusions of Patricia Cornwell's book--how could a one mystery writer tackle and solve such a difficult case?While much of the evidence is circumstanial (outside of the DNA evidence), Cornwell convinced me that she may have solved some of the Ripper murders. I'm not someone that has had a fascination with these type of things, but her observations (both physical and psychological), evidence and conclusions are pretty daunting. Walter Sickert was a well known artist of the time. He demonstrated qualities similar to what is suspected about Jack the Ripper and had a physical infirmery that could have led him down the path of murder and mutilation. Cornwell looks at Sickert's background, art, his writing, where he lived and many other elements and comes to the conclusion that he was, indeed, saucy Jack.Is it possible? Very. One point, though, is that copycat mutiliations, murders and letter writing (along with time) has obscured much of the evidence. It's possible that there was more than one murderer. It's also possible that Sickert may have written some of the letters attributed to Jack without actually being Jack. There's no way to know for certain. Regardless, Cornwell makes a strong case for Sickert as Jack. The type of concrete evidence we're accustomed to in our day and age wasn't available then and there.There's also been so much misinformation over time that it's getting very sticky to separate fact from fiction so 100% certainty may continue to elude us as to what face the Ripper wore. Either way, Cornwell's well researched book is thought provoking. You may disagree with her conclusions but until you're able to come up with first hand evidence and observations about the case, it'll be mere idle speculation. Her speculation isn't idle--it's on target most of the time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I could not put this book down once I started it. My skin crawled when I stared into the eyes of Sickert in the photos and read the accounts of his childhood medical experiences. Whether or not you believe the theories, this book gives a disturbing and memorable account of life in London the late 1800s. Ms. Cornwell obviously did extensive research into the various 'Ripper' theories and compiled a thrilling book which keeps the reader turning the pages and jumping at every noise. I read a library edition of this text and was so enthralled that I purchased a copy for my personal library."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I just don't believe what I read in this book, first of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 50 pages, all the stories around the main story are boring and boring, and she compares what would happened if Jack the Ripper were alive in these days, how would you know that? When you write a story that really happened you don't compare what would happened if that story would be in our days.I wrote a book of the story of Cleopatra and I wrote my novel in the Antarctica, but I never made any comparison if Cleopatra were alive today, you just can't do that.I put 2 stars to this book because I just can't put one star to a book.But at the end you really think that Patricia Cornwell knows who was Jack the Ripper?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have read a number of Patricia Cornwell novels and this one is not in their class. I was bored to tears. I was convinced within 50 pages of the findings and the rest was too repetitive."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although Ms. Cornwell does provide much of the common data used by modern &quot;Ripperologists&quot; and provides a handful of new propositions, the book is fragmented and redundant in tone. Huge liberties are taken in her deductions and square pegs are forced into round holes more violently than the Ripper dealt deathblows. I imagine the only reason this book was released was to offset the losses she occurred in her obsessive and extravagant research of the case. IN SHORT: I would not recommend this as a Ripper primer, but only if you are interested in the greater span of Ripper theories."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After reading the reviews posted by others, I was suprised at the malice towards Cornwell. Anyone who expected this to be a tell-all about Jack the Ripper will be sorely disappointed. The evidence is over 100 years old, and much of it is missing. Did they expect anything new to come to light? Having said that, I would like to say that this is an enjoyable, well written piece of work. It brings to light new theories for anyone interested in Jack."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell presents absolutely no facts for her case. Moreover, she reveals an overall lack of knowledge about the case; not suprising since before she started the book she admitted she knew hardly anything about the Ripper murders.Instead of presenting facts, Cornwell shamelessly maligns a great artist with her blind, baseless assumptions. At best, she might have a case for Sickert having written a few hoax letters, but there were thousands of such hoax letters and absolutely none of them have ever been successfully tied to the killer.I think Cornwell should stick to writing fiction, for she certainly is no journalist and doesn't seem to understand the difference between investigative reporting and stroy telling."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's attempt to pinpoint Jack the Ripper is presented in this novel. However, this account is somewhat presented as a reference novel; that is, this book goes through historical material and heresay.What \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is not is a historical fiction novel that takes you through the events as if it is 1888 and you are able to see Scotland Yard unfold with Sickert as Jack the Ripper. If you're looking for an entertaining historical-based fiction novel, this is not it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"At first, I was excited to read this account because I have been such a fan of the case. However, upon conclusion of the last page, I was still asking the question, &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot;As a few other reviewers have already noted, Ms. Cornwell bombards the reader with a more circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot; like similar handwriting and watermarks used by Sickert, and an overabundance of verbiage. The closest she comes to any type of proof is a few traces of mitochondrial DNA on an envelope which does not even lead back to Sickert himself. She seems to spend most of her time with quotes such as &quot;Sickert most likely was here...&quot; or &quot;Chances are Walter Sickert used the same...&quot;. It appears she felt more of a need to prove to us her knowledge of foresnics rather than prove the case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, and have always had, as any history buff/mystery reader probably does, an interest in who Jack the Ripper really was. Unfortunately, I have to say I'm no closer to an answer now than I was before reading this atmospheric and descriptive, but not definitive, book.Clearly, Walter Sickert was a very odd man (to put it mildly.) The problem is, as we delve deeper into his habits and paintings it becomes clear that while it may be possible that he was The Ripper (although lines like \\"I have no proof he was in London at the time, but no proof that he wasn't\\" don't inspire a lot of confidence) it is more likely that he was just someone who was deeply fascinated by the Ripper, much as in our modern times there are \\"serial killer groupies\\".I can even accept that perhaps his mDNA (see other reviews for explanation of this) was the same as that found on one of the Ripper letters. The problem is, Ripperologists have apparently long considered that letter to be a fraud. As Ms. Cornwell makes a strong case that Sickert was the type who thrived on attention, and has gone to great trouble to detail for us his obsessive need for publicity and the many letters he wrote to newspapers, it seems likely to me at least that he would have though it fun to fake some Ripper correspondence.Certainly, Walter Sickert was creepy. I'm just not convinced he was a killer. I'm afraid I still have to agree with Alan Moore on this one. (If you have any interest in Saucy Jack you really should read his From Hell.)"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwall's 'case closed' part of her title here is laughable. Her so-called \\"evidence\\" is a small fragmented DNA comparison which matches painter Walter Sickert's personal letter sample with one he supposedly sent the police as Jack the Ripper. The problem is that the 'match' without getting too scientific does not eliminate other potential suspects due to the nature and type of mitchondrial DNA compared. She then assumes that his violent paintings somehow reveal him to be the whore-hating murderer who carved his name into the history books. The leaps she makes in her case are far from conclusive based on the fact that she had access to much of the evidence still kept by Scotland Yard. Painting violent pictures of women etc hardly qualifies someone as a fiendish mass-murderer. If this were so, we would have a lot more of our artists locked up on death row. The only really redeeming aspect of the book (and why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1) is the descriptions of Victorian London of that time and some of the character portraits. These showed a novelist's eye for detail and provide a good sense of place and time. My conclusion is that the author should stick to writing the mystery novels which have made her famous. Fiction is clearly her best medium. If you buy this book looking for answers to one of the greatest all-time mysteries--- prepare to be disappointed. Rather than providing a conclusive answer, it merely adds another name to the frustrating list of potential ripper suspects in what has proved to be a cottage industry in the world of crime."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There is not a shred of evidence linking Sickert to these killings. All Cornwell does is try to prove it's \\"not impossible\\" that he did it. Totally unconvincing. Cornwell should stick to fiction, where this book belongs."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell rips apart Walter Sickert's reputation in an attempt to sell a book about Jack the Ripper. The only things that is made entirely clear in this book is that Ms. Cornwell really hates a dead artist named Walter Sickert and she has no proof that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Apparently, it is not that difficult to pin a series of crimes on a dead man when one uses unreliable evidence.Ms. Cornwell does offer some interesting circumstantial evidence which makes me wish I could hear Sickert's side of the story. Or that there were any information about his location at the time of any of the crimes of which she accuses him. Or she had anything other than evidence that he may have written some letters signing them as Jack the Ripper.I hope she plans to return to righting full out fiction like the Scarpetta books and stays out of the historical fiction realm where she trys to be her character Kay Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I have tremendously enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series of Cornwell's, her attempt at real-life detective work and forensics in the Ripper case is probably heroic, but ultimately, unfulfilled. There is no denying that she has approached the Ripper riddle armed with the latest in forensic technology and has made a credible argument for Sickert. However, the case is far from closed. Cornwell's success with her body of fictional work lends credence to the title of the book, \\"Jack the Ripper Case Closed,\\" but to say that the case is closed is misleading at best... Moreover, the book was far from a pleasant read, and not for reasons of blood and gore. Rather, poor grammar, tortured syntax, and lack of overall organization all combine with the oversold title to make this Ripper book a [bad choice]."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I got a headache before the first fifty pages.By the ,,,, next ten I know I was wasting my timeI hope you find much better Books to buy and read"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was filled with speculation, unsubstantiated rumors, unsupported suppositions and pure conjecture. Cornwall owes the family a big apology."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, and find all of her fiction well written, intriguing, and fun to read. However, this book is so poorly written and so completely unorganized that it takes away from the incredible research and the exclusive story. The editor within me wanted to take this material and organize, re-write and give it some continuity and congruence. Overall, the book is a unique and an execeptionally well researched answer to the Jack the Ripper mystery, but the reader has to yank and pull to get the story and the facts out of the book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I do have a problem with assessments of who killed whom after all the subjects are dead (how would YOU like it if after you were dead, someone theorized--incorrectly--that YOU were the murderer in an unsolved crime!), I did find this a gripping read. It helps to be interested in Jack the Ripper to begin with, as I am, but even if not, I think you'll find this as good as Cornwell's novels. Probably the most gripping read I've had since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE. And, frankly, I'm VERY impressed that Cornwell spent--according to the \\"New York Times\\"--$6 million investigating the case!! Has a writer ever spent more than that researching a book?! If so, I'd like to know its title!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I read her book years back when it first came out, loaned out my copy but it wasn't returned. So I bought a second. I was surprised how much of it I had forgotten.

The book held up well to a second reading, and the newly added information was interesting. I have tired of Cornwell's Scarpetta character and her dreary, unhappy life, but Cornwell presented the most interesting and convincing look at the Ripper case and who-done-it that I have read. The application of current crime detection techniques to such a cold case was interesting, and the read compelling. Ms. Cornwell - more non-fiction, please."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although I enjoy the writings of Pat Cornwell, and respect that she has indeed worked with some professionals, I don't think that she can truthfully say \\"case closed\\" on this issue. The way she goes about writing is excellent, but to assume she knows all the answers to this case is a bit conceited."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I found this book entertaining, I cannot say Patricia Cornwell convinced me of anything more than the fact that she should stick to writing her Kay Scarpetta series. I thought this book was all over the place--jumping from one thing to the next &amp; then back again. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to entertain all of the theories about who Jack the Ripper was, but I would never tell anyone I believe what she is selling here."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I finished Patricia Cornwell's Ripper book late last night, having read it in about a day and a half. Once I picked it up and started reading it, I was hooked. Cornwell has a style that is both compelling and suspenseful. I have thoroughly enjoyed her fiction, and this latest book is consistent with her others in that &quot;can't put it down, gotta read it&quot; sense. But when I finally did put it down, I was disappointed. When all was said and done, I wasn't so sure she'd convinced me that Sickert was the Ripper. Yes, she has put forward some interesting theories and research, and yes, it is possible she is correct. I agree with some other reviewers that the book bounces around quite a bit. Several times I, too, had to go back and make sure exactly what dates/years she was writing about. I would have appreciated a somewhat more linear approach so that the timeline was more distinct. She spoke about several paintings, but only had a few as example. She has some letters and pictures reproduced that she barely discusses, or doesn't even discuss at all. If an author is going to bring something up, they need to at least discuss it. I think the thing that bothers me most about this book is that there isn't enough facts to thoroughly convince me. I found it extremely thought-provoking, and some of her insights about the Victorian era were quite illuminating, and I actually found those segments in some ways more interesting than Sickert himself. As an English teacher and former Debate coach, I found her organization and the development of her argument weak. She starts out from the get-go with Sickert as the Ripper, and doesn't stop to put it in perspective during the course of the entire book. I think I would have found it more convincing if she started out much broader, introducing her subject in context of other suspects, and then showed the reader exactly how she came to her conclusions, following her conclusions with the evidence to support her claims. Instead, as a reader, I get the feeling that she is trying very hard to show us why she is right, instead of validating her argument against other, previously established theories. My rating is based on the readability of the book--I found it really interesting and couldn't put it down. But I hold back on giving it more than three stars because it was confusing, and because it lacked something more substantial (and what that is remains elusive to me, as I don't know that I can really name it) that would convince me that Patricia Cornwell has finally solved the mystery of Jack the Ripper. To be fair, she does admit that part of her research was difficult due to the lack of records and the loss of important documents through time. But still...something nebulous nags at me, and makes me feel disappointed in the end, as if the much-anticipated dessert just wasn't the right capper to the end of an otherwise enjoyable meal."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found the reactions of some of the other reviewers of Cornwell's book puzzling. I had never read a Cornwell book before this one, but I heard her interviewed about the book several months ago, and I was fascinated by her discussion. I vowed at that time I would buy the book as soon as it came out, and I did. I found her main premise interesting, but what I really enjoyed about the book was her depiction of the Victorian era, in particular the place of women in that society. Ms. Cornwell had obviously done quite a lot of research into the historical period, as well as into the particulars of the crime. And as she herself admits, with most of the evidence from the crime scenes themselves destroyed long ago, sometimes before the police at the time could even make a thorough investigation, it's difficult at best to make a positive claim; however, she has used the techniques we now have available to link Walter Sickert without a doubt to the Ripper through letters, through his art work, and through his general character. Criminals today have certainly gone to jail based on such circumstantial evidence. And since all the witnesses are dead, I suppose no one will ever be able to definitively prove Sickert's guilt or innocence. Readers certainly don't have to agree with her, but Ms. Cornwell certainly makes a fascinating case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've never really followed the \\"Ripper legend\\" but I found SOME of this book compelling. I don't think it would get a conviction in court though. Cornwell makes a lot of ambiguous qualifications in this book, statements that discount the likelyhood of certain slang terms of the period used in the letters etc. Short of getting a time machine, that would be nearly impossible to call. These are her drawn conclusions with the evidence available. The problem with them is that Sickert lived a long life. Serial killers don't just stop on their own and it would have been obvious that murder would have followed him everywhere. He would have increasingly become the primary focus over the years by Scotland Yard and was not. A fun book to read but NOT a case closed. Cornwell claims to have spent 6 Million of her own money \\"cracking the case\\". First of all, that is a business write off and the hype of the book made her personal collection of Sickert's art work worth a fortune well beyond the 6 million. She remarks about Sickert's lack of conscience but Cornwell's personal life has been a self centered sham. She allegedly has quite an appetite for wrecking (FBI)marriages and shouldn't be putting herself off as some Elliot Ness type. It's too bad she didn't spend those resources trying to solve an ongoing case that would do some real good in stopping a killer that is currently walking the planet. Stick to fiction."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ripperologists have a passion that rivals that of Talmudic scholars and an ability to savage any position that runs counter to their own. Therefore, it is not surprising that Patricia Cornwell's attempt to close the case of Jack the Ripper would be met with disdain, hostility, and outright invective.Of course Cornwell claim that the artist William Sickert was Jack the Ripper is open to debate. We need to remember that EVERYTHING involving this case is open to debate. One of the initial decisions you have to make in trying to reason out the real identity of the Ripper is to determine who his victims were. Even the acceptance of the canonical five (Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) is a basic assumption that is easily called into question. Stride and Eddows were both killed the same night; Strides body was not mutilated, the assumption being the killer was interrupted. The horrible mutilation to Eddows' face is assumed to be because the Ripper was enraged that he had been interrupted in his first killing. But what if Eddows had not been killed? Would we still assume Stride was a victim of the Ripper? If Eddows had been the sole victim that night what motivation would we have ascribed to her mutilation? Any and all assumptions made to deduce the Ripper's identity are debatable.For most people familiar with this case the most astounding part of Cornwell's case against Sickert is the argument that he wrote MOST of the Ripper letters. The assumption has always been that only one or two of the letters might have been real, so Cornwell is making a radical argument in this regard. Ultimately this is the strongest part of Cornwell's case, especially given her repeated observation that these letters are confessions as far as the law is concerned. Given the prolific number of letters Sickert wrote to newspapers in his life, it would not be farfetched that he would do the same thing as the Ripper.The other key part of Cornwell's argument is the psychological profile of Sickert. The problem is that this is more of a premise in the book than a cogently laid out argument, with bits and pieces scattered throughout the book. I think the problem is more organizational than argumentation and I would have appreciated a more clinical presentation of the profile.The weakest part of Cornwell's case is also her strongest. Cornwell dredges up everything from Sickert's life and work that she can use to pin these crimes on the artist (e.g., suggesting an unopened letter by his first wife given to her sister contained suspicions Sickert was the Ripper) and there will be times when you think she is pushing it. But the sheer volume of accusations is such that you have to be open to the possibility that some of them are valid. From an argumentative standpoint, she does not have to be right on ALL of these accusations to prove her point; she only needs to be right on some of them.One of the things that makes me think Cornwell might be right are the argument raised against her thesis. Cornwell repeatedly points out that she does not have \\"hard\\" proof of Sickert's guilt, so pointing out the inconclusiveness of her DNA matches is irrelevant. Yes, there is evidence that Sickert was in France during some of the killings, but Cornwell deals specifically with the problems of that evidence (Sickert claimed to be in France with friends who were no longer there, etc.). To be fair, it is hard to make substantial arguments against Cornwell's case in the context of a review limited to 1000 words, but you still have to deal with the specific points she raises. In the end Cornwell rests her case on an accumulation of coincidences sufficient enough to have Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve and an expert on the Jack the Ripper crimes to endorse her conclusion by saying he would be happy to put the case before the crown prosecutor.One of the other things that works against \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is that Cornwell uses more of a disjointed narrative structure than an argumentative one. The six murders that Cornwell ascribes to Jack the Ripper serve as a basic chronology for the book, but interwoven are chapters devoted to various parts of Walter Sickert's life that are unstuck in time. At one point I was convinced that maybe an editor had decided to rearrange these chapters and that I might be able to put all of them in a more traditional chronological order. With each of the murders Cornwell provides the main details and then talks about the limitations of forensic medicine at that time in contrast to what could be done today. \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would work better if it were divided into a section that looks at the murders and then another making the case against Sickert.The book is illustrated with tinted autopsy pictures of the Ripper's five canonical victims, including one of the horrible human wreckage of Mary Kelly. Cornwell uses these images, not only as a way of remembering the victims, but usually with the additional goal of showing how they are reflected in Sickert's artwork. Certainly the book would have been enhanced by more reproductions of the various works by Sickert that Cornwell alludes to in making her case. As it is, the key examples here have to do with the Ripper letters, the Lizard House guest book, and sketches known to be by Sickert.Despite the presentational problems, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is going to be required reading for Ripperologists, all of whom will make of it what they will. Just be sure to read it before you dismiss it (or diss it). This is not something akin to the creative fantasy of Alan Moore's \\"From Hell.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"My philosophy is that a lot of coincidences usually add up to something bigger. Even though there was no DNA, Cornwell relied on basic detective work. I buy her theory.On to the nitty gritty, this book lacked organization. For example, a murder would happen on September 1, years would pass, and then we were back to another murder that happened around the time of murder one. I like things to go in chronological order. Call me crazy, but my brain works better when things are laid out in proper order.Kudos on the great detective work, but the lack of organization made the book a pain in the butt to read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've read a lot by Cornwell and I admire her research and enthusiasm for this subject as well as her other books. This book particularly delights in uncovering and revealing many details that, if previously known, were not widely known. She makes a strong, circumstantial case that Sickert was in fact Jack the Ripper but I don't feel it reaches the level of a case that would win in court. There is way too much assumption and pushing the circumstances toward a pre-conceived end. We'll never know for sure who was Jack the Ripper. But because of that fact, this book has merits and certainly provides a lot of entertainment. It is an engaging revisiting of a subject that still fascinates. Cornwell adds to and doesn't detract from that fascination. On the other hand, Cornwell is certain she has the offender and she tries so earnestly to persuade the reader. I followed and I could see it with some straining of incredulity but in the end I just can't buy it. I have to go forward still wondering who was Jack the Ripper and what were his motives."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"One of the most enduring murder mysteries in Britain today, and possibly the one that causes the most drunken arguments in pubs from John O'Groats to Lizard Point, is who really was Jack The Ripper. There are many theories from the downright absurb to the almost plausible and this is where Patricia Cornwell's book comes into being. Her case for Walter Sickert is extremely good but that is only to be expected from someone with her background in journalism and ambulance chasing style of reportage.The case for ir having actually been Sickert is well presented, if a little confusing at times, and unless there has been very clever manipulation of the evidence it is a case with few glaring holes and inconsistencies. However, there are the usual leaps of faith taken that you would imagine from any book that aims to deal with a series of bloody murders over a century ago. Had they happened in the here and now I do not believe that catching the killer would have been any simpler than it was then. If the ripper was anything it was cold, calculating and intelligent enough to mask his movements.This book will have many tearing their hair out in disgust as Patricia Cornwell is so convinced that it truely was Sickert so much of the reasoning gets lost in a barrage of &quot;Look at this, it must have been him can't you see it too&quot;. However, the case is, on the whole well presented and you do find yourself wanting to believe it if only because of the obvious hours and money spent on feeding her obsession with the case.At the end of the day you do feel a little dissatisified with the book, mainly because it does raise unanswered questions, questions that could only be answered by the ripper him or herself - now thats an interesting proposition to go out on, why would the ripper necessarily have to be male?If you are a ripper fanatic or just want to know more about social history in late 19th century britain this book will give you far more information than you really may require but it is well constructed wnough to keep you well and truly absorbed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"With what I would begin?Maybe with the fact that Patricia Cornwell, crime novelist by heart has made a new book that proves nothing or even gives something so significant that whole mystery would have to be seen in different perspective.I'm no fan of crime novels even though I have read more than few. The mystery of Whitechurch murders is close to me as I have read almost all possible info about Jack during my life.As I want to keep this short I will just say that for me Walter is strong suspect. However this has nothing to do with Patricia and his funny little book. Patricia makes complete fool out of herself claiming that she has solved the case. Yes, as everybody else Patricia can point with her finger person that possibly made the murders but...where is the prove?During the Victorian time Walter could have been convicted to hanging with the info Patricia gave. However so could have been so many other suspects with the things we know now about them. Nowadays nobody would be sent to prison or executed with such evidence that Patricia shows us. Sorry had to say that even though innocent are convicted everyday all around the world.It's strange that Patricia wants to &quot;give peace&quot; to victims and stop the mythology around Jack and then he writes a book about him? And...isn't innocent man said to be Jack a victim too? I don't see Patricia's logic...If Patricia would have wanted to stop the myth he would have studied and studied the subject then said that the murderer was just some escaped lunatic that isn't worth of book to write.Patricia Cromwell surely does write inconsistently and I don't like her writing style and there are way too many &quot;maybes&quot; in this book. However I give two stars because for someone it can be entertaining and also introduces the case to those who never have really read about it.Actually more fitting name for the book could have been:&quot;Jack the Ripper - Open case: Portrait of possible killer PART I &quot;Comes to my mind that Patricia is like prosecutor who tries desperately show that the accused is guilty still knowing that he might have the right man but that the evidence police has given her is deeply lacking so instead of backing the case with cold and hard evidence he makes theories that end up being as good as anyone who has even read some of the information about the subject. She tries convince the jury playing with emotions. &quot;Walter was crippled.&quot; &quot;Walter was strange artist.&quot; &quot;Just look at him, doesn't he look like Jack?&quot;Unfortunately even though I agree with those things I can only repeat that there are also other strong suspects.In the end court rules Walter not guilty and as Patricia looks at him...Possible Jack is smiling at her. Jack the Ripper was just too clever...again.BTW my name &quot;Jack-Of-No-Trades&quot; have nothing do with the actual Jack and I wish it wouldn't be used as &quot;evidence&quot; against me in Patricias next book about the subject. As Walter I possible was also just joking around with the subject."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have only read one Patricia Cornwell novel, so I'm not a fan. This was a very interesting book on Jack the Ripper and kept me turning the pages. I got it as a gift and thought, &quot;Oh great, another Jack the Ripper book.&quot; You can only read about the same five murders so many times before you know the stories by heart. But this book actually had something new to say.It interests me that PC could and would go back and reinvestigate the crimes. I thought the DNA off the Ripper stamps was an ingenious idea. However, although PC does a good job of making her case against the artist Walter Sickert, I would have to agree with People Magazine's review. All she's done is prove that Sickert probably authored some of the Ripper letters. Nice try, though.

This is my least favorite (I never read her Billy Graham Book). It has too much scientific babble going on I get what she is saying but it is boring. I also wish she said how she considered him a suspect to begin with. I have read many different stories of Jack the Ripper both Non-fiction and Fiction and I do not think we will ever really know. She does show how a lot of the crimes happened in a lot of detail but without any real physical evidence just a few journals and speculation. To me this is all kind a myth anyway we do not know if there were 2 people playing the part or one. I do not think that you can say the case is closed. These murders are too old and too many people have tried to figure them out and muddled everything. Too many therories and very little evidence. These murders were tampered with and I read one book that said eventually The Ripper would not have been able to live among society anymore and this guy lived too long. I think he most likely was him or wished he was the killer but she does not convince me enough. Yes her DNA testing does point to the man she says was The Ripper but I have a hard time with any of the theories. I do not think she should say case closed but was an interesting read but kind of boring for her. Otherwise I commend her effort and did enjoy some of the book.

I detest armchair critics, amateurs who purport to know more than the author of a well researched, and well written book. Ignore such wannabes, and read this book. Ms. Cornwell's expert, investigative, and convincing expose on Mr. Ripper, is one of THE MOST exhaustive of the many books on the subject. The problem is, people have such entrenched notions, and narrow minds when it comes to new information that might possibly render their \\"knowledge\\" obsolete. So, they write negative reviews like the ones above. They are wrong. Yes, this book may challenge every preconceived idea you have had about the killer, but truth doesn't really ask anyone's opinion. It is what it is, and this book is worth considering truthful. A job well done, Ms. Cornwell.

Her approach is inflated and highly speculative--lots of \\"would have-could have-must have\\"--and rests to a surprising degree on pseudo-Freudian \\"profiling\\" of Sickert.

We all know that JTR exsisted and I think that Cornwell came mighty close to closing the case. Closer than anyone else I have read about. I believe people don't want this case ever closed, and I bet this was one of the most difficult books she has ever writen. Can you only imagine all the hours of research that went into this book. I commend you Ms. Cornwell for JTR. This was a very hard book to put down once you started reading it.

Unfortunately, I won this one!Since I am a teacher, I automatically notice grammatical errors. In fact, if there are too many, I actually get stressed out.

As a plausible case for the identification of Jack the Ripper, it's lacking. Of course it is. It's a crime novel.

It already &quot;errs&quot; in that direction too much to be an effective crime novel. And unfortunately too little to be an effective legal or forensic assessment of the Ripper or of Sickert.

And the rest of us can enjoy the ride, remembering that is an amusement after all."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was very engrossing and hard to put down. Cornwell builds a strong case with all her research with the limited evidence she had to go on. I also appreciated the background information she provided on the Whitechapel district, hospitals, and Scotland Yard to name a few. I look forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Has Patricia Cornwell unmasked the beast of Whitechapel - the original \\"Hannibal the Cannibal,\\" who, by his own taunting admission, ate one of his victim's kidneys?This purported solution, in which Cornwell confidently lays the blame on the English painter, Walter Sickert, is a ripping good read.Cornwell is, clearly, obsessed with her subject and driven to hunt down the most famous serial killer of all time. She is a formidable researcher who uses a potent mix of forensic evidence, psychological profiling, gut instinct and a bombshell discovery of one of Sickert's lost paintings that is as convincing as it is nightmarish.Sickert is not a new suspect in the Jack the Ripper rogue's gallery. Nor are the author's observations that some of Sickert's paintings show eviscerated female bodies that mimic the actual Ripper killings. However, whereas past researchers have used less than credible speculation about the killer's ties to Freemasonry or to the Royal family, Patricia Cornwell sticks to the more sober path of modern criminal tools and profiling. Moreover, she looks for (and finds) similar killings in areas that Sickert was known to have lived in, both before and after the infamous Ripper killings of 1888.It is unlikely that history will accord this book the ultimate epitaph - \\"case closed\\" - any more than conspiracy theorists will accept any one \\"final\\" version of the JFK assassination. The Ripper legend has entered into that peculiar realm of the cultural Rorschach test that reveals more about its interpreters than it does of its own inscrutable nature.Yet, there is a sense, towards the book's conclusion, that Patricia Cornwell has made the best case thus far and perhaps, just perhaps, finally revealed the face of a man whose actions presaged so many 20th century horrors.A truly strong and compelling book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A little too conclusory for my taste.

Did I think that Cornwell could definitively name the killer? Not really. I imagine that would be impossible without DNA evidence which does not exist.Does the investigation Cornwell conducted establish the identity of Jack the Ripper with a high degree of confidence? I believe that it does. Cornwell manages to document substantial alibi's for other major suspects and documents layer upon layer of circumstantial evidence that points directly to Sickert being the killer.To the people who are hot under the collar saying that circumstantial evidence isn't enough, I refer you to the Scott Peterson case in California. Circumstantial evidence can convict and get you sentenced to death, even today - and with evidence flimsier than that Cornwell documents. A couple of coincidences a murderer does not make but a dozen or more? It's statistically probable that Sickert is the Ripper.The book paints a portrait of Jack the Ripper through excerpts of letters and provides highly atmospheric descriptions of London at the time of the murders. There is a lot of personal detail about the victims and very detailed descriptions of the murders.It's a fun read but it does get convoluted at times because it's not a typical novel with a plot the author just imagined. It's more a presentation of divergent evidence, forensics, and contextual information that Cornwell has had to weave together so that the end product is entertaining.I enjoyed it very much and you will if you find the case's history interesting and enjoy forensic detail."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Despite Cornwell's claim on page 22 that she actually went there, any map shows that there is no frontier whatsoever between Argentina and Peru.As for the rest of the book, I only hope that her account of events that took place more than a century ago are more thoroughly researched than her notions of 20th and 21st century geography..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is a wealth of information.

For true Ripper enthusiasts, I think half the intrigue is not knowing.I think the book was a little chaotic and unorganized. Her theories are amazing and well thought out. I could not put the book down. It is a great read, however, I don't think the case will ever be closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I haven't read another book about Jack the Ripper but I have to admit that the story of the Ripper has always been intriguing. So, once Patricia Cornwell wrote her book, declaring \\"case closed\\" and after seeing her on Book Notes on C-Span, I decided to give the book a try. To be honest, I've only read one of her other books, one of the popular novels about a crime investigator named Kate Scarpetta called \\"The Body Farm\\". I didn't particularly enjoy that book and after reading it, I wondered why she was such a popular writer. This book, however, was good and I enjoyed the thorough and time consuming research and interest she took in this case. The suspect she is convinced that commited these crimes is an artist named Walter Sickert, a semi-famous painter from England who was known to go missing for days and weeks at a time and had a pension for painting prostitutes on beds being approached by men, the women positioned like the victims of the Ripper. This is, of course, not the only point Cornwell makes to support her theory that Sickert was the man who went on a killing spree in England in the late 1800s. She studied letters the Ripper sent to the police, the watermarks on the these letters, had the DNA analyzed that was on the back of the stamps, and on and on. Cornwell seemed to become obsessed with proving that Walter Sickert was the Ripper and after reading her book, I am pretty much convinced that he was too. Since the DNA results were not positively conclusive and because Sickert was cremated and there are no means to compare his DNA to that found on the back of the stamps, I can't say I believe 100%. But Cornwell's very persuasive and her efforts in solving this hundred year old unsolved case are commendable and her theories are well thought out and quite plausible. The one problem I had with the book was how the book ended (which was my main problem with \\"The Body Farm\\" too---which I felt came to a blunt and unsatisfying ending). Cornwell ends the book after the death of Sickert's second wife, with a particularly wicked story that showed what an evil man Sickert was, regardless of him being the Ripper or not. I would like to have known more about his time with his third wife, how he died, etc., but Cornwell chose to end her telling of this account at this point in Sickert's life. Overall, though, I think Patricia Cornwell did a great job on this unsolved mystery and I think that maybe nonfiction-crime cases may be her true calling. She certainly has the background for investigating cases like the Ripper and her interest and approach was much more compelling than the fiction she has written prior to this book. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys true crime and especially to those people interested in the Ripper case. For the rest of us (I'm not particularly a fan of true crime) I still recommend this book. It is interesting and makes for great conversation with friends and co-workers."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Since this is a review on Amazon.com, let me start by saying: this book is a great read. Forget the agendas you see here in these reviews, just know that whether or not you agree with Cornwell's findings, you won't be able to put this book down. It is an exhaustive, impressive work, and if nothing else, for the case she has so compellingly collected, she deserves to be commended.In my experience, \\"Ripperologists\\" are not interested in having these crimes actually solved. A survey of Ripper websites reveals appalling closed-mindedness and surety in their own opinions, with little respect for the opinions of others. (In fact, I've noted refutations of Cornwell's books that conveniently ignore any of her own caveats or disclaimers, to suit their argument better.) If you are a person with only casual interest in the Jack the Ripper subject, I advise you to take the reviews by Ripper fanatics with a very large grain of salt.As a person only mildly interested in the case before reading this book, I was hooked. The psychological analysis of Sickert is fascinating -- even if he wasn't the Ripper, he was a very sick man -- and the details of English life in that era are fascinating. Perhaps most importantly, Cornwell does not spare any of the gory details of these murders. She helps us to remember that Jack the Ripper was not a glamourous figure, but a sick, twisted, psychopathic killer, who is not deserving of the glitzy mythos that has sprung up around him. Many women died -- probably more than the 5 victims who get all the \\"P.R.\\", and there is nothing romantic about that. Whether you leave the book convinced of Sickert's guilt or not, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" will provoke you to think, and remind you all too well that there is evil in this world. Kudos to Ms. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love this book and have become a NEW Patricia Cornwell fan. The \\"Ripper\\" case has sparked my interest for years. Now a long awaited work like Patricia's book is a sight for sore eyes.\\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is grounded in it's information, not to mention making a hell of alot of sense. With the kind of time and money that Miss Cornwell put into this project i'm not surprised if she spent a past life on this very case....in some form.READ THIS....Truly the \\"Ripper\\" case is Closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am intrigued by The Ripper. Reviewing his crimes from a modern forensic - pathological angle is refreshing. Although Cornwell is uncharactaristically emotional about the subject matter, the book appears to be well researched."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell claims to have solved the murders of Jack the Ripper that took place in the late 1800's in the Whitechapel area and the East End of London. One of the first things presented in this book is who she says was the real Jack the Ripper- a young, charming, good looking, intelligent artist and actor named Walter Sickert. With that, she provides an abundance of background about Walter as a boy and his family. Not only does she give the reader great insight and background of the killer, but she also provides the reader with sufficient background knowledge of the victims. I would have liked a bit more background on the first victim (Martha Tabran). She also contributes enough information about Victorian living in London, specifically in the Whitechapel area and the East End, that it is almost as if we visited an entire museum dedicated to Victorian living in the slums of London. She then proceeds to astonish the reader with an immense amount of physical, testimonial, genetic, and inculpatory evidence. All situations, lab results, testimonies, and physical documents are thoroughly examined and explained. Scientific and legal terms and processes are well explained and understandable. Not only does the author provide us with a multitude of information, but it is all cohesive, fascinating, and creatively put together. I am very glad that she decided to put all her findings in a book, that her writing style is simple and straightforward, and that she took the time to find background on everything she possibly could and explained in great detail all the evidence (both Victorian and modern) found that can prove Walter Sickert's guilt. This book does not keep you guessing the killer's identity like most books about murders, both fiction and non-fiction, but instead satisfies the craving for answers of the mystery surrounding Jack the Ripper and the crimes he committed. Along with this, Patricia Cornwell also presents us with a lifelong lesson- just because a person is attractive on the outside doesn't mean they aren't ugly on the inside."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While this book had quite a lot of interesting facts and ideas it did not, for me at least, present an iron clad case against Walter Sickert. He probably was more than a little weird, and as Ms. Cornwell suggests, his paintings may show a perverted obsession with women. His art was quite dark in nature, but I did not always agree with Ms. Cornwell that it presented murder scenes. It's too bad he was an impressionist, maybe we could see more clearly what his artwork did represent.I thought that Ms. Cornwell's writing was very sporadic, she jumped around quite a lot. If she really wanted to convince the world that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, then her book did her theory a great disservice. Perhaps if she had presented the facts that she says she has in a more direct way, it would be more convincing. I came away feeling that she should review her facts and do a rewrite.In spite of all this I did find the book interesting and enjoyed reading it. It gave me more information on the Ripper murders that I previously had known."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Since 1888 sleuths of all types have been struggling to unmask a killer whose real identity will never be known. Patricia Cornwell comes along and, in less than two years, claims to have cracked one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of crime.I have long had an interest in the Jack the Ripper slayings. Going into Cornwell's book, I didn't believe she had actually solved the case. Having just read the final page, I now know for sure. The case remains far from closed. Her evidence pointing to famous painter Walter Sickert is circumstantial at best. She relies mainly on coincidences and the nature of his violent artwork to pinpoint him as the killer. The book sometimes reads like a big slander piece. Yes, he was a somewhat deranged individual, but that is far from being a brutal serial killer. In the course of the book, Cornwell fails to provide any concrete evidence to back up her theory.Most of her conclusions are pure conjecture. DNA she retrieved from a Ripper letter and a correspondence written by Sickert proved to be inconclusive. Far from proving he was the killer, all Cornwell has done is show he makes a likely suspect -- there's a big difference between the two. The fact is we will never know who Jack the Ripper was.In some places, the book is a bit unorganized. The author has a habit of going off on a tangent here and there, especially when cheerleading the skills of the Virginia Instituteof Forensic Science and Medicine (an institute she helped establish). That said, the book is an interesting read and a good introduction to the slaughter that occurred in Whitechapel those many years ago."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've never read Patricia Cornwell but having recently attended an exhibition at the Tate Britain in London which included works from the alleged Ripper and artist Walter Sickert and being a sometime Londoner have always been interested in Jack the Ripper, I thought I would try her account. Like most the reviewers here, her work is shoddy, threadbare, based on circumstantial evidence, poorly written, organised and repetitive just like the work of the Metropolitan and City Police she criticises. I'm still not convinced Sickert wasn't Jack the Ripper but she doesn't convince me he is either. And no case can ever hang on doubt. Back to the drawing room."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you are looking for a detective story, an investigation of Kay Scarpetta this is book for you. If you want to know what had really happened in the Autumn 1888 in London this is not the book you should buy. JTR Case Closed of \\"closed\\" has only the title. This book is bad researched and contains many false informations on the case. All the book is written to prove that Walter Sickert, a painter of the victorian London, was The Ripper. Fiction, speculations and suppositions are mixed with what had really happened and after having finished reading it you really don't know nothing on the case. Mrs. Cornwell used the modern science to prove that some of the ripper letters were written by him. Unfurtenately, all the ripperologist agree that most of them (all?) as hoxes! Even if he was the author of the ripper letter, nothing proves that he was JTR. It's important to remember that nothing, I repeat nothing links Walter Sickert with the Whitechapel Murders. If you want to read sominthing good on the subject I suggest you The Complete History of Jack The Ripper of Sugden or Jack the Ripper's Black Magic Rituals of Edwards. To summarize avoid this book!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I bought this book 2-3 months ago in an airport. It has taken me this long to finish it, because I kept putting it down in disgust. I kept coming back to it assuming that it wouldn't be a best seller if it didn't have some good qualities....I was wrong.I have never reviewed an item at Amazon before, but this is such a shoddy piece of journalistic trash, that if I can save someone some money, then it is worth the time and energy.Cornwell does a terrible job of presenting any kind of case. Her &quot;suspect&quot; may have been a terrible person, but there is no evidence in here at all. If someone has the time and energy to go through and and count up all of the times &quot;maybe and possibly&quot; show up inthis book....you'd get some sense of how poorly this was investigated.Bottom line, skip this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Other reviewers have provided a great overview of why the Jack the Ripper case is far from closed, as the author claims. I concur with the other reviewers that the books is replete with guesswork, innuendo, and sketchy reasoning. Further, I can provide an example as to the sloppy research and mistaken \\"facts\\" presented in the book.In discussing the murder of Mary Ann Nichols, Cornwell notes that the body was found with her eyes wide open, and attempts to connect the body with a sketch drawn by Sickert of a woman with open eyes. She argues that Sickert must have been at the scene of the murder, because otherwise, how could he have known that Nichols' eyes were open? Cornwell argues that Sickert would not have known \\"unless the detail was in a news story I somehow missed.\\" It took me about 30 seconds to pick up \\"The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion\\" by Stewart P. Evans and Keith Skinner and read the London Times September 3 edition, in which police constable John Neil is reported as saying that \\"her eyes were wide open.\\"Not only does the auther make many claims that are specious at best, some are based on untruths and distortions of fact. If you are looking for some fun fiction, read this book. Otherwise, for a thorough, accurate, and objective study of the Ripper case, I highly recommend \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper\\" by Philip Sugden and \\"The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"First, let's just say Cornwell needs to stick with fiction. After reading this farce I believe a novel would have been more appropriate considering the abundance of speculation and juggling of the facts. To say the least I was disappointed. From claiming Sickert's artwork gives clues and mirrors the murder scenes is just one leap of fantasy used. I really don't want to state all the issues I have here, just know that if you want revelations about the case you won't find them in this charade."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Once we discover the author has very few facts to back upher assertions and theories, this book has little of interest.Plainly, there is just too much of the author's personalconjecture, and too many broad jumps in logic, for her to makeany case at all for knowing the identity of Jack the Ripper.The book reads like a poor attempt to support a conclusionmade before research and writing began, and that serious failingreally shines through in her writing.For a serious student of those crimes, and that period in history, this is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I read the other reviews before writing mine. I think that anyone who reads these books actually believing that someone has \\"closed the case\\" needs to understand that this is all just theory. I do not believe the case of Jack the Ripper will ever be solved (and that is what intrigues us all). The story of Jack the Ripper will always be alive. Perhaps the true Ripper is watching us from below and laughing because he got away with the perfect crime.I am not a fan per-se of Patricia Cornwell, actually I believe this is the first book I have read by her. I bought this book as I am fascinated with the cases of Jack the Ripper. I first saw Patricia Cornwell on Dateline, or one of those shows, discussing this book and felt that I needed to read it.Yes, some of her \\"evidence\\" is rather weak but she does point out some very interesting items such as the doodles that Jack the Ripper had on his letters to the police and those that Sickert drew. She does find some interesting DNA information that really makes you want to know more but I believe she also stated that due to the lack of care taken to seal the evidence for future scientific advances it was hard to get a good working amount of DNA off of the envelopes.I do not feel the case is closed after reading this book, but I do feel that Patricia Cornwell has some good circumstantial evidence. I believe that if anyone did solve the case, the draw of Jack the Ripper would end. I truly feel that people do not want the case to be solved. If it is..where is the fascination?Overall, I feel this book is a good read for those interested. I am not disappointed I bought the book and am looking forward to many other theories that are likely to come in my lifetime."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I must say I've been shocked to see some of the vicious negative responses this book has sparked. In my mind it has been very underrated. Cornwell's style in writing this book is, perhaps, not the best for a work of its type, and I think this may have made it difficult for many readers to pick out the significant points she does make. There are parts that almost have the feel of a narrative novel, and the author does present countless trails of speculation which are interesting but not provable. However, I feel the need to respond to some of the criticisms of this work that I've seen by highlighting a few things.Cornwell's work here definitely does prove beyond all reasonable doubt that Walter Richard Sickert wrote a large number of the Ripper letters that were sent to the Metropolitan Police. There are definite DNA matches from stamps on at least three of the letters. The Ripper used several kinds of stationery which Sickert was also known to use, and indeed it has been proven that some sheets used for Ripper letters came from the the same package of 24 sheets as some letters Sickert sent to his acquaintances. There are countless other details that tie Sickert to the Ripper letters and I have no doubt that he wrote most of them.The problem comes in that people seem to be assuming that ALL Patricia Cornwell has proven here is that Sickert wrote Ripper letters. It takes only a little mental puzzle-piecing to see that this is not the case. Some of the Ripper letters (written by Sickert) hint at events yet to come, often connected with future murders - events that did indeed end up playing out as predicted. The Ripper letters also show a knowledge of details about the victims and their murders that were never publicly released. These are things Sickert could not possibly have known unless he committed the murders (or at least some of them), or was somehow connected to the person that did.The author makes mention of an incident where Sickert claimed that he had once stayed in the very room where Jack the Ripper once dwelled. He stated that the landlord had told him the identity of the killer, but that he could no longer remember the name. This seems unlikely in the extreme. Cornwell points out that when he was 80 years old, Sickert could still remember and correctly spell the name \\"Maharaja Meerzaram Guahahapaje Raz Parea Maneramapam Mucher,\\" which he had come across while passing a church memorial with his father when he was a young boy. Sickert had an astounding memory. Assuming for a moment that Sickert was NOT Jack the Ripper, it would still be obvious that he had an intense fascination with the killer, as evidenced by his having penned many Ripper letters and also in his violent art, some pieces of which make direct references to the Ripper killings. I find it unbelievable that someone so obsessed with Jack the Ripper would fail to recall his real name after having it revealed to him. So it is almost certain that Sickert was lying about the incident, possibly to shift suspicion away from himself.I have seen some people mistakenly assume that Cornwell is arguing that the Ripper was left-handed. This can only be a case of mis-reading, since she is not saying anything of the sort. Cornwell argues that most of the victims seem to have had their throats cut from behind in a way that indicates a RIGHT-handed perpetrator. She also makes note of the fact that Sickert was known to be primarily right-handed, but that he was capable of writing with his left hand, as evidenced by a video. She makes this point only to show another method he may have used to disguise his handwriting (writing with the left hand rather than the right).Some people have complained that Cornwell did not include enough of the art works she references in her book. Many of these are easy enough to look up on the internet - Sickert was a well-known artist in his day and his works are by no means obscure.I was shocked to see one person respond by saying that Sickert looked like a very nice man based on the photos of him in the book, and that he did not look like a killer. What does a killer look like? It is a fact that a large percentage of rape and murder victims are assailed by someone they knew and trusted, a \\"nice person.\\" We've long since moved out of the days where supposed criminals are identified based on physical features that are assumed to fit the profiles of murderers, rapists, thieves, etc. A murderer can be sinister, ugly, and frightening in appearance, or they could just as well look like the sweetest and most mellow person imaginable. A murderer can look like anyone.So was Walter Sickert the murderer known as Jack the Ripper? We can't be 100% sure, but it seems very likely. Cornwell has shown that he certainly had the opportunity to have committed the murders (he was in the right place at the right time), he fits the profile of a violent psychopath (though I must admit this word is beginning to sound a little hackneyed what with the number of times Cornwell uses it), and he had a very plausible motive. The fact that several other similar murders (other than the six we hear about most often) occurred in the decades following the highly publicized Ripper spree, and that these murders occurred within miles of wherever Sickert was living at the given time, is also very suspicious.As I stated earlier, Cornwell could have written in a style more suited to this type of book. Many of her important points (and they ARE there!) get hidden between her numerous speculations and historical asides. I did, however, very much enjoy reading these seemingly tangential passages, as they actually paint a very good picture of life in London's East End during the late 19th century and the methods and tools utilized by criminal inspectors of the time. She has clearly done a phenomenal amount of research and I think she's hit upon something very big. So far her theory seems to be the most plausible one out there.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I understand that it is difficult to trace the footsteps of a killer that struck a little over 100-years ago but any shred of evidence to substantiate the conclusion would be much appreciated. It's not that the author does not provide any evidence, but she fails to provide solid evidence that was credible. Without giving the context of the book away to the \\"would be readers,\\" I want to share with you my frustration when reading this book and all of its \\"highly speculative\\" guesses. Example of my frustration arises with the Ripper Letters. There is absolutely no shred of evidence provided by the author to link the letters to her suspect. There are no sworn affidavits by today's experts to say that \\"he or she\\" was the author of ANY of the letters. It is all based on a hunch by the author. I think that this book needs to be reclassified as FICTION for there is nothing non-fiction, at least in my mind, about this particular piece of work. I am utterly disappointed by the author and all of the money supposedly used to research her conclusion."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a fan of Patricia Cornwell's fictional writing, I settled down to read this book with great anticipation.I was disapointed.It is conjecture from page 1.Patricia Cornwell had decided from the outset that Sickert was the Ripper and nothing -not facts or logic- was going to stand in the way of this premise.It is a little disorganised, some of the facts that she cites seem to not to have been understood fully.The writing is wooly and Patricia Cornwell has made a mistake that other authors have. &quot;I have so much research material. Not all of it relates all that well to the subject matter. Oh, what the heck! I'll just use it all, anyway!&quot;Patricia Cornwell fails to notice that some of the clues in the letters indicate that another of the supsects -an American doctor- might have been the Ripper and the author of at least some of the letters.Would any English person of the 19th century have used the word &quot;guess&quot; in the way that the Ripper did? No, I suppose not.The word suppose would be used in those circumstances. And would be to this day, too.As a Patricia Cornwell fan this pains me, but please do think very carefully before you buy this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The research and conclusions in this book are so think you could floss your teeth with it.Cornwell makes a semi-lucid case for Walter Sickert having scribed some of the letters signed by \\"Jack the Ripper\\", but people who had nothing to do with the murders wrote letters supposedly from the killer (a fact Cornwell states). Nowhere does Cornwell make the necessary connection of: because Sickert wrote this specific letter, he must have been the killer because it contains information only the killer would have known.The information on the Ripper murders were, to say the least, widely reported in the popular press -- and Sickert, along with countless others, could have written fake letters \\"from\\" the Ripper based on the information in the newspapers.Much of her research is sketchy, at best (I wouldn't trust myself to know information about private medical procedures done on any of my uncles while they were young boys -- but Cornwell laughably takes the word of Sickert's nephew as absolute -- and the same nephew later retracted what he had said about Sickert's \\"penile\\" fistula, so Cornwell's entire \\"motive\\" is toppled.)Fortunately for Cornwell, nobody can 100% state that Sickert was not the Ripper, but she definitely does not even remotely prove her case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Anytime an author publishes a new book in which they claim to have singlehandedly solved the greatest criminal mystery of all time, Jack the Ripper's identity---beware. Remeber the Maybrick diary? This book, Jack the Ripper: Case Closed, is no exception. This book is getting far more media hoopla than it deserves (a Vanity Fair article and TLC cable special just to name two). Its actually not a bad book as far as it goes, with some very interesting observations on the nature of psychopathic behavior and analysis of the wounds, crime scenes and coroner's reports of the Ripper's victims, however the author bases her claim that Jack the Ripper was actually a Victorian artist and student of the great James Whistler named Walter Sickert (who has already been considered and dismissed as a suspect by Ripperologists) on some rather shaky assumptions and speculation (such as Sickert's having a fistula on his male member, that several of his paintings bear striking resemblences to Ripper murders, that he wrote several of the Ripper Letters, that he was actually in England at the times the murders were committed-this is not at all verifiable, that Sickert/Jack the Ripper killed again outside London, etc.) all of which are pointed out and answered in great detail in the Casebook: Jack the Ripper website's review of her book. Cornwell sees too many coincidences between the Ripper and Sickert for it to be a coincidence. Her main argument seems to be &quot;I can't prove he did it, but you can't prove he didn't do it.&quot; The DNA analysis Cornwell conducted on the some 200 letters (most of which are considered hoaxes by serious Ripperologists) allegedly written by the Ripper which are on file at the Office of Public Records in London is interesting, and according to Ripperologists, may provide serious clues, but as Sickert's remains were cremated we do not have any of his DNA to know for certain. My main gripe with this book is that the author appeared to me to be a maverick, disregarding or ignoring most of the published work of experts such as Donald Rumbelow, Paul Begg, Martin Fido and Keith Skinner; only two works by expert Ripperologists are cited in the extensive bibliography-Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell and The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, both by Evans and Skinner. The only caveat to professional Ripperologists is a sentence at the end: &quot; I honor those who have gone before me and dedicated their efforts to catching Jack the Ripper. He is caught. We have done it together.&quot; As others have said, Cornwell picked a suspect and then made the evidence fit.

It appears as if Cornwell selected Walter Sickert as her patsy (she never does say how she settled on him) and then viciously interpreted his every action (and various pieces of his artwork) in the worst possible light while offering elaborate conjectures to fill in the gaps. The only thing that she comes anywhere near \\"proving\\" is that Sickert was a fairly unpleasant manipulative man who had an interest in Jack the Ripper and may have written a number of the letters that claim to be from Jack the Ripper (letters which most historians regard as hoaxes).Overall: this poorly organized, rabbit-trail-filled book contains far more vitriol than proof. There are a few interesting tidbits on Victorian society, and a fairly thorough presentation of the basic facts of the Jack the Ripper murders, but that may very well be the only value to be found here."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Had Jack the Ripper not existed, he would have been invented. Jack the Ripper, the first serial killer to achieve worldwide recognition, has since the Terror of 1888 become not the inadequate, pathetic creature he was in real life, but a tabula rasa upon which thousands have wondered who and why. Books on him, about him, which mention him, inspired by him, could line a house. Films, movies, documentaries, radio plays, theatrical productions--Jack the Ripper is not a man but a myth.A myth--and not a good one--is the kindest description of Patricia Cornwell's excursion into Ripperology. At a reported cost of six million dollars, Patricia Cornwell set out to prove who Jack the Ripper was. She decided it was the painter Walter Sickert. Her basis for that assertion is . . . that she says so, so it must have been him. The proof is that he was alive at the time of the murders, he could have journeyed hundreds of miles from where he was known to have been on the days of the murders, and he made a drawing that fairly closely resembled the murder scene of Mary Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last known victim.That's it. That, really, is it. Six hundred pages of could, might, can't prove, no evidence he was not there, along with Ms. Cornwell's dramatic emotions, her feelings of sisterhood with the Ripper's victims, her closeness to them, her this, her that. Six million dollars for a bad biography of Walter Sickert and a Jack the Ripper book that could as easily have proved Ms. Cornwell was Jack.Other books on the Ripper have 'proven' it was Prince Eddy, first heir to the throne. Others it was a cover-up of Prince Eddy's morganatic marriage to Mary Kelly. Others have speculated it was James Maybrick, whose death created another murder mystery that has lasted to this day. Others that it was the founder of the Welsh National Library. All of those books and others have this in common; a better read, and better research."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm only about 67 pages into this book and I don't see a portrait of a killer, I see the near-manic ramblings of an incredibly arrogant woman. Cornwell herself admits in the opening pages that until up 2001 she knew almost nothing about Jack the Ripper and didn't even know that his victims were prostitutes. Yet the reader is supposed to believe that in the space of a year or so (the book was published in 2002), she has solved one of the most famous mysteries in history. Right.Cornwell zeroes in on painter Walter Sickert as Saucy Jack. If she ever suspected anybody else it isn't mentioned, at as far as I've read. Anyway, Cornwell claims that some of Sickert's admittedly morbid drawings and paintings resemble the crime scenes and mortuary photos, and Cornwell treats these resemblances, however small they may be, as cold hard facts that Sickert is the Ripper. Cornwell also appears to see crime and death and murder where there is none. In one Sickert painting called \\"Ennui\\" (there's a small b+w pic of the painting in the book) Cornwell writes that \\"[l]eaning over the left shoulder of the woman in the painting on the wall appears to be the partial face of a man coming up behind her.\\" After viewing a much larger color version of the painting on internet, the \\"face\\" isn't a freakin' face, it's either a harmless splotch of paint or a bird. *gasp!*More problems show up as Cornwell claims that Jack/Rickert's first victim was prostitute Martha Tabram, who was killed on August 7, 1888, about three weeks before the first canonical victim Mary Ann \\"Polly\\" Nichols. Cornwell goes into a weird rant about Tabram's murder, moaning about how little press the murder received, how no tests of any kind on the blood were done, and no blood spatter analysis was done. First, as sad as this may be, the murder of a prostitute isn't exactly front page news, then or now. Second, it would kind of hard to do any kind of tests on Martha Tabram's blood to see if it the blood was human or animal, or spatter analysis seeing as how the first book on blood spatter analysis wasn't published until 1895. Second, it wasn't discovered that humans had different blood types until 1901 (with type AB being discovered the following year). Third, tests to distinguish human and animal blood didn't come along until 1901. It took me about about 10 minutes of googling to find that all that blood information, if that. You'd think that Patricia Cornwell the \\"forensics expert\\" would already know it.I can't wait to see what other facts Cornwell twists and gets just plain wrong."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan, and I got very excited when I saw a TV interview with her about the upcoming release of this book and all that had gone into the research, etc. So as soon as it came out, I immediately purchased it and sat down to read it. It was SOOOOOOO boring and slow and repetitive that I found myself having to go back and re-read passages I had just read because my mind wandered off. I finally had to throw in the towel when I reached my 100-page limit on a book. If I am not hooked by the first 100 pages - or at least somewhat interested! - I give it up and go on to the next. I was so, so disappointed in this one!

Having survived the theories about Frances Tumblety, Maybrick and even Lewis Carroll(Really that one is weaker than the one against Sickert)I am always up for another stab at the game of who is Jack.However, I really wish it had been Kate on the quest and not Cornwell herself. I'm sure Kate would have realized that the people in Britain had seen an American with deep pockets coming. I have no idea how much she was taken for in purchasing all her ripper (and Sickert) memorabilia but I'm sure it was a packet. At least it's tax deductible and she can problably sell it on eBay if she gets tired of it for more than she paid.Second point, I think this book is disorganized, but I think it is deliberately disorganized. The easiest way to pad a weak case is by muddling in a lot of other stuff. The more you can distract the reader with extraneous points, the less they can recognize the weak points of an argument.Finally, I think that there was an interesting idea at the center of this case. It just got lost in the author driving the point home about Sickert. On one hand,It might have been very interesting if Cornwell had written a book about her actual search for information, the qualifications of her experts and how they worked. On the other she might have turned it into a compelling piece of fiction. As it is, the book sort of drags in the middle but it's readable if the reader doesn't mind rolling her eyes occasionally"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell's books, this was my first major disappointment with her work. Based on her presentation, the case is not closed! She offers many circumstantial bits and pieces, but is far from proving her case. I am surprised that she would weaken her reputation for careful work by releasing this volume and even more surprised that a publisher would print it. While offering some interesting insights into police work and crime during the era of Jack the Ripper, and while possibly eliminating one or two of the traditional suspects, this work fails to convince and had her &quot;evidence&quot; been presented at trial, I suspect he would have gone free. Patricia, return to writing what you do best and apologize to your fans for this mediocre work. It is not worthy of you."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan. I have all her books. I realize this was a very different project for her to undertake. However, I feel the book should have been titled &quot;Biography of Walter Sickert&quot;. I also feel that all the evidence sumbitted was circumstancial. I also found the book to have to much irrelevant information. However, I did find the book interesting but I am not convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper.

From her Scarpetta novels, I expected a tightly wrapped story. Instead I felt she was all over the place -- her personal struggle with the material, as ourlined in her conversation with her editor in the 1st chapter, added nothing to the story in my opinion. Her constant harping on what would be done today in an investigation did not add to the original thesis of the book -- to prove that Sickert was the killer -- and was distracting. Her laundry list of unsolved murders post 1888 was reptetitive and redudant."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found the book interesting reading, but not powerful science as the other reviews would indicate.

I too re-sold my book, which is something I have never done with a brand new book before. Sure I lost money, but I also lost several hours reading!! I've enjoyed the author's fictional books and couldn't wait to read this one. How disappointing! Disjointed, full of conjecture, information notated under photos that was never mentioned in the text, with a totally lousy ending that kind of petered off. The book felt unfinished, like that of a pre-teen writer who had to turn in a book report on Monday morning and wasn't quite done. (I've been there, so it was easy to recognize.) I was unfamiliar with Walter Sickert and would have really appreciated seeing at least one picture of his work to realize what a talented artist he was and why he was famous. Maybe he was Jack the Ripper, but Patricia Cornwell's argument was absolutely unconvincing. I think she's damaged her reputation with this one."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As many other readers have pointed out, this book's subtitle (\\"Case Closed\\") is an obvious overstatement. Cornwell's evidence is circumstantial and speculative, certainly not enough to convict Walter Sickert either in 1889 or today. What I found more objectionable about \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" were the endless, repetitive descriptions of life in Victorian slums - befouled water, tainted food, horrible diseases, unsanitary hospitals, filth everywhere, nauseating odors, rampant alcoholism, etc., etc. Yes, we get it - life was bad! How much of this does the average person really want to read? Just when we think we're finally done with these long descriptive passages, more of them turn up. For me, at least, it was a case of authorial overkill. These bleak and morbid details, combined with Cornwell's claim that writing this book threatened to \\"ruin\\" her life, actually made me wonder if she is suffering from depression. This is no joke - the book reads as if written by a severely depressed person. Certainly any reader of this book is likely to come away from it feeling depressed - but probably not convinced."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Exactly who does Patricia Cornwell think she is to think that she can resolve this case where all these other people involved haven't?Cornwell has already placed herself on shaky gound with at least some of her fans with \\"The Last Precinct\\" and \\"Isle of Dogs\\". Has she taken leave of her senses in publishing these two titles? And who does she think she is trying to kid with her so called sense of humor?On her former web site she made a big deal about all the research she was doing in Colonial Williamsburg and how she was planning to incorporate it into her next Scarpetta novel. It is time for her to produce is it not? Instead we get her take on Jack the Ripper.Listen to those reviewers who tell you not to waiste your money on Cornwell's Jack the Ripper book. They make good sense. That seems to be a rather large sum to spend just to get a point across. Cornwell is perfectly welcome to publically express her opinions just like the next guy. But that doesn't mean the rest of us are obligated to agree with her."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I really admire Patricia Cornwell, and I have read some of her other books, so I was really enthusiastic when I heard that she had solved the Jack the Ripper case and she had written a book about it. Sixty pages into the book, I kept hoping that she would show me some piece of tangible evidence that would finger Walter Sickert as the killer. Even when I was towards the last chapter I kept saying to myself \\"Okay, here it comes. She's going to surprise me in the end\\". Nothing. All of her evidence was completely circumstancial, simply for the fact that she based all her facts on letters written to Scotland Yard at the time supposedly by the killer. If in fact Sickert wrote the letters to the police, it still does not mean he was the killer. Throughout her book she states clearly that Walter Sickert was fond of making crude jokes, and this could have been one of his sick jokes, provided he wrote the letters. If this case were prosecuted in modern times, all of this evidence would be completely inadmissable. I was really disappointed in this book and hope this doesn't affect Ms. Cornwell's career or credibility."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is an excellent writer of fiction. Unfortunately, this book is not supposed to be fiction.This is, without a doubt, the worst piece of journalistic research I have ever read, and I read a lot. Cornwell spent millions of dollars, apparently, and 365 pages to amass not one shred of real evidence. She makes leaps of logic so startling that one is left literally breathless. In the course of the book, she constantly loses sight of what is fact and what is merely her supposition. Referring to Sickert and Jack the Ripper interchangably from the very beginning is just bad journalism, no matter how convinced she may have been. The only real reason that I can see as to why she was so convinced is that she did not like Sickert and really wanted him to be the Ripper. Her evidence amounts to the facts that Sickert lived in the area, liked to paint prostitutes, was fond of the musical theatre, had a low opinion of women, she says, and had very eccentric habits. She seems to think that every letter written by someone claiming to be Jack the Ripper was written by Sickert, no matter that in one case the letters were mailed from 8 different cities on the same day, and all with different handwriting. When evidence contradicts her theory, she simply dismisses it as obviously wrong. In my opinion, any reasonably intelligent 6th grader could find the holes in these arguments, and it is lucky for Cornwell that Sickert has no legitimate descendents to sue her for this slander.On the other hand, I did read the whole book. I can only explain it as the same kind of fascination which causes otherwise intelligent people to read tabloids. But the fact that she managed to keep me reading is the only reason that this book got 2 stars from me, rather than 1."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Even to someone like me, who was not familiar with the Ripper case (other than the most bare-bones outline of those events) when I started reading PORTRAIT OF A KILLER, the glaring flaws in Cornwell's book soon became apparent: (1) Throughout the book, Cornwell consistently treats her own unfounded assumptions and unsupported suppositions as if they were -facts-. (2) The book is VERY poorly organized, jumping around so erractically, page after page, that I found it very hard to get a sense of the chronology of the Ripper murders or the events surrounding the murders, and equally hard to get a clear sense of what were/are the known facts and events of the case--as opposed to what are Cornwell's assumptions and suppositions.These two problems increasingly made Cornwell's argument seem so lacking in credibility, as well as her account of the case so confusing, I paused in my reading of her book to start reading up on the case elsewhere... which is when it became all-too-apparent to me that no one interested in learning anything about the Ripper case should be reading THIS book, which is FAR more full of inaccuracies and sheer nonsense than even I suspected when, finding it illogical and confusing, I started doing some other reading. For example, she treats evidence as \\"genuine\\" which (it turns out) is generally NOT regarded as genuine, and she doesn't even mention this, let alone explain or support her minority interpretation; she also doesn't EVEN MENTION evidence or incidents which, at the very LEAST, make her theories and interpretations seem highly improbable; and so on.This book is a mess--even a disgrace, considering that it emphatically accuses a specific man, artist Walter Sickert, of heinous multiple murders without convincing evidence, and without discussing (or even acknowledging) information that substantially contradicts this accusation. The late Walter Sickert certainly doesn't sound like someone I'd ever want to meet; but to publicly accuse him of brutually murdering multiple people on the basis of this flimsy, fanciful argument is unconscionable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"\\"I knew the identity of a murderer and couldn't possibly avert my gaze\\" so states Cornwell. Give me a break. Enough people have spent their time defending Sickert now, so I won't take up the space. Though he could be a suspect... The Jack the Ripper cases will most likely never be solved. Some people kinda' want it that way.This is a good book for its documentation of the killings. Its also good for its in depth, yet ungrounded Sickert accusations; such as him having had a fistula. Pure speculation. I don't know if that would really be enough to drive a man to mutilate... but it doubtlessly would drive a person mad with \\"impotent fury\\"! And other phrases that will leave you giggling."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm an amateur ripper-ologist and am interested in who everyone thought did it, so I picked up Patricia's book at the local library. I was sadly disappointed. Patricia is an excellent writer, I'll give her that, but the way she put this book together made me think, \\"HUH?\\" She says, \\"Here's who did it,\\" and that's about it. She had a theory and nicely fit all the facts around it, which is the WORST case of detecting I've ever seen. Every good detective, professional or amateur, knows that you never fit the facts to fit your theory. She doesn't even explain how she came to figure out Sickert was Jack. She just says, \\"He is, and here's why.\\" I've read other books that gave just as compelling arguments for other suspects, but at least they explain why they believe their choices are right.Ah well, can't wait to get to heaven and find out who the real Jack the Ripper was. Believe me, it's the only way ANYONE's going to find out for sure."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I tried to read this book, but found it to be very 1 sided(which comes to be expected with JTR single-suspect type books). I think that she did a very good job with her research, but it just wasn't enough. I believe that maybe the only point Cornwell made was that Walter Sickert was probably the author of many of the Ripper Letters... in fact, the DNA evidence she wrote about proved this, but everyone who knows a little about JTR knows that the killer may not have written any of those letters, and they were all written by different people. It was a good try, and Portrait is a very well authored book on a very popular theory, but its just not good enough to convince most ripperologists. I would recommend at least skimming through this for anyone interested in the Ripper murders, because Cornwell does touch on a few good points, but I would also recommend checking out some other works. I would recommend that maybe you invest in a nice ripper encyclopedia, such as Phillip Sugden's &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot; and/or Paul Begg, Martin Fido, and Keith Skinner's &quot;Jack the Ripper A-Z.&quot; I would also recommend the on-line casebook, which includes info on every single JTR suspect, witness, and victim. It also includes articles transcribed from several old newspapers and magazines, oficial documents, and almost everything else. I'm not supposed to put in urls, so I'll just recommend you do a search for &quot;Casebook: Jack the Ripper&quot; on any online search engine. If you are intrested in Sickert as a suspect, you should certainly check out Cornwell's book, but definitely also check out those other materials."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found this to be a hard read. The author jumped all over the place and made it hard to follow. I don't think she made a good case against the &quot;Ripper&quot; no matter how hard she tried to tie unrelated facts together. Most of it was speculative at best with little or no hard evidence."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Unfortunately I get the impression that this book wasn't written by one person only. It looks like a poor compilation of modular, sub-contracted research work, which hasn't been reviewed in its entirety before going to print. Example: It is assumed that one is familiar with the background of individuals in the story - although this individual's background is explained hundreds of pages later. Or another example: There is repetitive insistence how a murder investigation would be handled today. It seems that the various teams involved in writing didn't interact very much.Patricial Cornwell might have a point with Walter Sickert's involvement. But such an accusation should be her conclusion after reviewing all of the facts at the end of an investigation. Instead, the accusation of Walter Sickert is the very building block of her book in the first chapter. This leaves both the authoring team and the reader in a dead-end trap of either trusting a non-professional investigator or not.Read this book only if you feel you want to read yet another theory about the Ripper case. The sub-title (&quot;Case Closed&quot;) is plain wrong/misleading and seems to serve the only purpose of increasing the sales."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've read several non-fiction books which I felt inadequately supported the writer's thesis. But, I have never read a non-fiction book where the thesis was lost due to the author's poor organization of the material. Unfortunately, I have now read such a book in Portrait of a Killer: Jack The Ripper Case Closed.For some obscure reason, Cornwell chose to present the facts supporting her assertion in a haphazard manner. To give an example of this manner, one can look at Chapter Ten , which is titled \\"Medicine of the Courts\\". Given this title, one would reasonably expect a discussion about medical evidence presented in the court inquests surrounding the Ripper case. The chapter does indeed start out that way. However, Cornwell diverts off into a discussion of how the painting \\"Ennui\\" is further proof of Sickert being the killer, then discusses how Sir William Gull and the Duke of Clarence couldn't be the Ripper, goes back to the medical evidence at the court inquests, veers off to discuss a psychological interpretation for the victims' wounds, and finishes with various definitions for \\"Jack\\" and \\"Ripper\\". Sadly, the poor organization portrayed in this example isn't unique. Each chapter contains the same convoluted presentation of facts.Simply put, Portrait of a Killer is a mess. There are some interesting assertions in the book. However, the poor organization not only confuses the reader, it also clouds the evidence to the point that the central thesis remains unproved."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Jack the Ripper - Case Closed made me laugh so hard that I cried, so I had to give the book at least 2 stars. I don't know if Cornwell came up with her art critiques by herself, or if it was one of her \\"Team\\" (incidentally, her impressively large Team takes up just over two pages worth of solid credits). Either way, the \\"evidence\\" she derives from reading meaning into Walter Sickert's art is absurd. For example, in Sickert's sketches, what Cornwell describes as a \\"crouching, frightening-looking man who is about to spring on a woman\\", I see as a crouching, frightenED-looking man tip-toeing *away* from a woman.But even if Cornwell's unconvincing analysis of Sickert's art as depicting terrible violence is correct, so what? As Cornwell herself explains later in the book, the Ripper murders \\"made the covers of tabloids\\" and \\"artists rendered sensational, salacious depictions of the murders\\". So ... perhaps Jack the Ripper was not *one* artist, but many!One very enjoyable aspect of this book is that it is an account *of* a celebrity, written *by* a celebrity. This is a rare treat indeed!Cornwell the celebrity belongs to the inner-sanctum of wealthy and well-connected crime writers, and she wanders through her book buying up artefacts and pieces of \\"evidence\\" that most people would be happy just to look at in a museum. She is also something of a namedropper, and clearly loves trotting out technical terms just for the sake of it (for instance, Sickert's studio \\"would not have eluded the scanning electron microscope, the ion microprobe, the x-ray diffractometer, or thin-layer chromotography\\" - if *only* his crimes had been committed 100 years later!)One thing I do admire about the book is Cornwell's vivid recreation of time and place. The historical information about London's East End in the 1880s is detailed and intriguing (although I have no idea how accurate the information is).At the end of the day, I find speculation regarding the identity of Jack the Ripper about as useful as arguments over the identity of the person who may or may not have written Shakespeare's plays. Afterall, *someone* did the deeds. Someone with certain skills and character traits, who lived at a certain time in a certain place. Someone who is dead. Someone whose work we'll never see the likes of again. Does it really matter *who* that someone was? It makes no difference to me."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Firstly, I admire Cornwell for her thorough research and the effort that went into this effort (how much of it really was hers?). Is the book well written? No. Is it conclusive? Of course not and it could never be so I'll give her a break there. This book is interesting as a ripper theory but it proves only that Sickert \\"may\\" have written some of the letters. An artist depicting the social scene of the times he or she lived in does not say 'murderer' to me, in fact it is incredibly normal. Martin Scorcese makes violent films about gangsters but I sincerely doubt he went and killed a bunch of people to get the feel for it. My main problem with this book is Cornwell's extroadinary ego! She has stated that she is \\"staking her career\\" on this. I don't think so, this is a marketing tool and one so transparent she should be ashamed of herself. Also it is screamingly obvious that the ripper hated women and the endless passages on male psycopaths are preeching to the converted. What is interesting is the thourough contempt she holds for men in general. There is a real thread here, men are either incompetant, impotent, gay, violent, psychopathic, dumb or heinous villains. Indeed in 100 years time she could be seen as Patricia the ripper based on her own disdain and mistrust of men as she seems to think this alone is enough to make a person a violent killer. Why she doesn't even mention Francis Tumblety is a bit fishy if you ask me."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's book left me very unimpressed. I have read all her Kay Scarpetta novels, and I don't remember feeling that they were full of holes and fluff, like I felt with this book.Unfortunately, I feel that instead of doing the research first and making her conclusion based on that research, instead she came to her conclusion and built the research around it. Her psychological &quot;profiling&quot; seems completely fabricated. She takes quotes completely out of context. She refers to artwork and paintings of Sickert's that she doesn't include. The whole book seems like an essay that she had a word count to complete, and she's filling in with alot of fluff because she doesn't have enough meat or real evidence to make her case.As far as the much-ballyhooed DNA evidence, even that wouldn't hold up in court, much less the court of my armchair. Even if it conclusively proved that Sickert's DNA was on a letter that was signed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; that couldn't possibly prove that the letter writer was also the murderer.I'm very disappointed in the book as I thought it would have a much more scholarly feel to it. Probably only dedicated collectors of all things Ripper will want to read this as it probably does, at the very least, bring a few new things to light."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"With such piercing logic along the lines of \\"I can't find any evidence he was there, so that proves he did it\\", is it any wonder I have no desire to read any of her other books?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A little story about this book with an unsolved mystery of my own: I first came across \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed\\" when a coworker purchased it on a long flight from Phoenix back to Connecticut. We had an hour stopover in Las Vegas and the stewardess neglected to tell us to take our belongings off the plane so it could be cleaned. The book was left behind-it disappeared when we returned to our seats.A few years later, I saw the book at a bookstore and my interest was piqued. I'd reviewed true crime books about serial killers before and learned that, unfortunately, serial killers can be horribly predictable. The problem is that the people around them willfully ignore the signs. So it was only a matter of time before someone applied the latest in forensic principles to the most famous serial killer in history.Cornwell doesn't mince words: Walter Sickert is the killer (you can find this out if you turn the first page of the book, so no, it's really not a spoiler). The book is less a true crime mystery than a non-stop attack on Sickert-physically, socially, mentally, philosophically, and artistically. And he's an excellent candidate too; Sickert was fascinated with Jack the Ripper, painted creepy art that involved threatening and dismembering women, and traveled in all the right places where Jack the Ripper skulked. So he must be the Ripper, right?Well, not quite. Although Cornwell makes a convincing case, the book is almost entirely dedicated to proving she's right...as opposed to finding out who the Ripper is. Sometimes, it's ridiculously over the top: Cornwell refers to Sickert as guilty, never allowing even the possibility that she might be wrong. Sometimes, it's insidious: Cornwell often glosses over discrepancies that other historians have unearthed. It's easy to start thinking Sickert's the Ripper when Cornwell refers to \\"his murders.\\"By the end of book, Cornwell paints Sickert as a supervillain of comic book proportions. If Cornwell is right, Sickert was the ultimate bogeyman. He could forge multiple handwriting styles at will, knew the ins and outs of every back alley, killed with calculated precision, was a master of disguise, and lied with incredible aplomb. \\"From Hell\\" was great, but I'd love to see \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" as a movie if only to experience the sheer audacity of an artist who dismembers his victims and then turns them into works of art.That said, Cornwell provides an absorbing look at the life and times of the era in which the Ripper thrived and a compelling insight as to why the system failed. She bounces from modern forensics to Scotland Yard, drawing eerie parallels across a wide variety of fields: handwriting analysis, DNA analysis, and psychology. We learn most of all about the Ripper's (notice I didn't say \\"Sickert's\\") victims; in that regard \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is an important contribution to helping readers understand Ripper through who he killed and where he lived.The biggest flaw in Portrait of a Killer is that it really is \\"case closed.\\" Cornwell's work hands down a verdict before any evidence is presented, making the whole book an entertaining but ultimately flawed argument about who Jack the Ripper really was."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"By far the worst book Patricia Cornwell has written. Instead of a compelling story, this one is fragmented and a real chore to read. The font is so tiny that it is hard to read. I love all her books except this one. Her Sarpetta series are hard to put down, this one I cant wait to put down, in fact I may not finish it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Just because Patricia Cornwall spent a lot of her own money investigating Walter Sickert, does not mean that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I got sick of her writing style, especially when she told the reader NUMEROUS times that you can't get DNA from ashes (Sickert was cremated). Okay, I think we get it, once was enough. I didn't see any conclusive proof presented. She would say things such as, &quot;There was no evidence that Sickert was in town the night of this murder, but there's no evidence that he wasn't either.&quot; Well, that certainly narrows it down. He must be The Ripper!A long-winded waste of time. Can't recommend."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This was by far one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. With all the publicity and build-up going around about this book, I was eagerly looking forward to reading it. What a let down! This case is closed ONLY if you buy into theories and circumstantial evidence. The author presented not one bit of hard evidence to support her contention of who the Ripper was. Her book is full of innuendos and possibilities: He could have done this... He was in the habit of doing this... He would most certainly have known this... and so on and so on and so on. I kept reading because I kept waiting for a payoff that never came. Don't waste your time on this one!!!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As an historian, art historian and scientist, Ms Cornwell makes a great crime novelist. Poorly constructed and edited, I had the distinct impression this book was written in a hurray for publication. Whole passages could have been cut, such as the potted history of police and coroners, and the hypothetical description of how the murders would have been investigated in the modern day US. Ms Cornwell comes across as an outsider, and dare I say it, an American outsider, who is suspicious and critical of UK authorities and commentators. I can't help thinking the lucrative Jack the Ripper industry must have been very attractive to this popular crime writer. The only authority behind her assertion that the case is solved is Her Considerable Presence - 'I say so. Do you know who I AM?' I am really pleased that she was in Aspen when the penny dropped at various points but was it really necessary to tell us? If you think the reading public is stupid, think again! One of the most telling moments of her art criticism is when she innocently informs us that close forensic examination of paintings reveals brushstrokes. I would seriously be interested in an art historian's critique of her methods, because even an unqualified reader such as myself can see that it is flawed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is the only Patricia Cornwell novel -- Oops!

I don't know that I shall ever be able to believe in her research, however, having read \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper-Case Closed.\\" Actually, I take that back, the research itself isn't the fault of the book, but rather, the author's reckless twisting of the facts to suit her hypothesis.To decide based on similarities between letters signed Jack the Ripper and letters signed Walter Sickert, that Sickert was Jack the Ripper is a leap. The most that any of Cornwell's mitochondrial DNA evidence proves is that Sickert may have been one of many people who sent hoax letters. This seems in keeping with the Victorian public's fascination with the Ripper cases, and the many facts available in the tabloids at the time. Most other people who are Ripper experts believe that all but one Ripper letter was a hoax. Several people were actually brought to trial for writing these hoax letters, which Cornwell never mentions. Cornwell never proves that the Ripper letters were written by one person (Walter Sickert, of course) just that they really, really could have been, if you really stretch the facts, since an artist could disguise his handwriting, and spelling, etc. As for the watermarks found on the stationary, is it surprising that after digging through hundreds of Ripper letters and hundreds of Sickert letters that Cornwell would come up with similar watermarks from one of the largest stationary companies of the time?She constantly points to similarities between Sickert paintings and mortuary photos. Surely the killer would be painting the subjects as he left them at the crime scene if he wanted a souvenir of the crime, not from mortuary photos that it is unlikely he ever saw. Cornwell's constant judgment of Sickert's paintings seems shallow and unimaginative. He painted macabre scenes (Cornwell's judgment, not mine.), thus he must have been a tormented psychopath. What tripe! How many other artists have painted disturbing paintings and never been accused of such crimes? Besides which, to prove her hypothesis, Cornwell has pulled a few painting completely out of the context of the bulk of the artist's corpus, a body of work which is highly sensitive, and in keeping with the Impressionistic tradition. I think that this reactionary thinking about art offended me more than anything else in the nov...-(there I go again) book. To find out that Cornwell actually cut up a Sickert painting in a quest for evidence struck me as mad and highly insensitive.Nor did Ms. Cornwell ever convince me that Sickert was impotent or that he had a rage against women. She never found any evidence that Sickert had a fistula on his penis other than the hearsay of a nephew. She never shows any evidence of him treating women in a cruel or abusive way. He is portrayed rather as a wastrel and an adulterer (an impotent adulterer?)-geez, how many other artists could that be pinned too? Does that mean they all hated women and had the tendencies of serial killers?My overall impression after reading this book was that Ms. Cornwell had an overactive imagination in some areas and too little imagination in others. Her twisting of the facts was evident about half way through the book when I came to the DNA evidence I was waiting for and nothing was proven. Case closed? I don't think so. And since Ms. Cornwell is staking her career on this case, I don't think I'll be interested in reading any of her other novels, err books."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Perhaps the subtitle ''Case Closed'' led me to expect too much, but this book by Patricia Cornwell doesn't present a very convincing case that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She makes some interesting points about the possible use of painters' materials in the Jack the Ripper letters, which she argues are mistakenly considered phony by some who examine the murders. She also makes the rather startling claim that the number of murders attributed to Jack the Ripper is too low, and that crimes across England might have committed by the same man even decades after the well-known spree.Those are valid avenues to pursue, and may be true. But the weakest part of the book is its main theme. She simply fails in her contention that there's strong evidence that Sickert was the murderer. She spends numerous pages arguing that Sickert was weird and could be mean, that he liked to go for long walks and not tell people where he was at all times, that he liked the theatre(!) and that he created disturbing paintings. All that may be true, but would be laughed at if offered as evidence in a court of law.Over and over she returns to the same idea popularized by many conspiracists: Since there is no proof that something isn't, then it must be. We have no proof that Sickert was elsewhere, so he must have been at the murder scene. We have no proof that Sickert didn't visit an inn where doodles on the wall are similar to ones in the Ripper letters, so he must have been there.I was severely disappointed in this book. While I think it's almost impossible for anyone today to definitely prove who was Jack the Ripper, I think Cornwell's attempt is one of the weakest. Buy this book only if you are one of those \`\`Ripperologists'' who like to read everything about the case.You can find more book reviews by me by searching for ''goldenrulecomics'' on squidoo."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It would be unfair to describe Ms Cornwell's Jack the Ripper theory as being the most ridiculous to date. In Ripper & the Royals by Melvin Fairclough, it is claimed that the Ripper murders were committed to cover up the marriage of Prince Albert Victor, grandson of Queen Victoria, to a catholic commoner. This notion, which also forms the premise of the movie 'From Hell' starring Johnny Depp, is, in my estimation, the stupidest 'solution' suggested so far, but Patricia Cornwalls effort in this book runs a very close second.The title of the book informs us unequivocally (and, some might say rather arrogantly) that the Jack the Ripper case is now closed and the inference is quite clear that Ms Cornwell is the lone sleuth who investigated all the evidence and was thus led to the ultimate conclusion that Walter Sickert was the murderer. Unfortunately, notwithstanding all the media hype following the publication of the book that suggested that Ms Cornwell's theory was ground-breaking, the fact remains that Walter Sickert has already been offered up as a suspect in Sickert and the Ripper Crimes by Jean Overton Fuller. Clearly, this is a case where Ms Cornwell has become aware of a theory, become enamoured with it, and then made the all too common error of stretching and straining the facts in order to fit with her preconceptions rather than objectively analyizing the evidence to see what conclusions may be drawn. Several other reviewers have discussed the errors and weaknesses of her 'investigation', such as the feeble nature of the DNA evidence and her questionable assumptions concerning the provenance of the Ripper letters. I won't reiterate those arguments here, but I would note that anyone with more than a passing knowledge of the Ripper murders won't have to read very far into the book to have serious doubts about it given Ms Cornwall's unquestioned assumptions about just who it the Ripper is supposed to have killed.The actual number of Ripper victims is the subject of considerable disagreement, ranging from 3 to a dozen or more. Sir Melville Macnaughten, who became Chief Constable at Scotland Yard after the Ripper murders, left a memorandum in which he stated quite definitively that there 5, and *only* five, Ripper victims, naming them as:Mary Ann (Polly) Nichols;Annie Chapman;Elizabth (Long Liz) Stride;Catherine Eddowes; and,Marie Jeanette Kelly.These five women are often referred to as the 'canonical victims' because, for decades, Macnaughten's pronouncement was accepted more or less at face value. Book after book on the Ripper case has discussed the case on the assumption that all five women were murdered by the same hand and it is only in the last couple of decades or so that this assumption has been widely criticised. Many 'Ripperologists' now believe that Elizabeth Stride was not, in fact, a Ripper victim at all, and a smaller, but increasing number of theorists, including myself, also believe that Marie Jeannete Kelly was not killed by the same person who killed Nichols, Chapman or Eddowes. Ms Cornwell has clearly read enough to be familiar with the canonical five, but not enough to be familiar with the controversies as to their status as Ripper victims. Surely, in a proper, objective and full examination, one would expect this important aspect of the case to be addressed, or mentioned at the very least. Ms Cornwell, however, appears to have swallowed the canon whole without being aware of the significant objections to the conclusions. Even apart from all the investigating deficiencies noted by others, this glaring weakness in the book will immediately signal knowledgeable Ripper theorists that Ms Cornwell is signally less informed than she and her publishers would have us believe.I could go on but I would like to close by offering advice to Ripper 'newbies' to steer clear of this book, at least until you have a few more reputable works under your belt. I gave the book two stars because I finished it and because I believe that it is a volume the hard-core Ripperologists will wish to have read and have in their collections. However, if you are new to the case and wish to get familiar with the facts, you might be wiser to stick to something a little more objective. Personally, I would recommend Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook by Donald Rumbelow. It is a well-balanced book that looks at the general facts of the case and also provides some very interesting background material.C.

It's dishonest."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is an arrogant, self-indulgent, ego trip from title (Case Closed??? Not by a long shot) right through to the final page. Even the dedication comes off as insulting. \\"You would have caught him\\"...if what? He had been as good as you are? Oh, please!I think that her theory would have held much more credibility had she arrived at Sickert as a suspect from the evidence, as opposed to presenting the evidence only as it related to Sickert. And even with her I'm-right-because-I-say-so investigation, she still couldn't make a case that a first year law student wouldn't blow out of the water.Ms. Cornwell writes excellent fiction. That is a world that she can control right from the beginning. But it seems that Investigative Journalism isn't what she is cut out to do. Things don't always fall into place quite the way you may want them to."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I am not nearly as critical or disappointed as are many of the other reviewers posted here, I do find much weight and worth in what they have to say.There *are* some problems with Cornwell's examination of Sickert. She often \\"goes out on a limb\\" to use supposed and circumstantial evidence as a way to prove Sickert's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; while she prefaces or qualifies these assumptions with the fact that she and the rest of the world will never know for sure, I became irritated after a while. The book could certainly be better organized. An actual clinical analysis of Sickert would have been more helpful and perhaps would've provided stronger assurance of Sickert's actions as Jack the Ripper.But, for someone who has not read any previous books or articles examining Jack the Ripper's murders or motives prior to this, I found Ms. Cornwell's book to be interesting, challenging, and strongly suggestive of Sickert's guilt in the Ripper murders. Ms. Cornwell has found new material and some evidence (fingerprints, similar but rare paper watermarks) that she uses to support her premise that Sicker is the Ripper, along with new views on some of the more disturbing paintings and doodles that were done by or are attributed to Sickert. As a social historian, I found her attempts to put the Ripper, the police, and Sickert into their proper context wonderful detail and history.Even if Sickert never murdered anyone, the reader must admit that, at the very least, Sickert was quite an eccentric, even weird, bird whose habits (doodles, compulsive letter writing, the possible defacing of the Lizard Point hotel's guest book, etc.) and artworks were certainly evidence of a dark, pained man. Perhaps now, the truer picture of Sickert-the man, the artist, and his legacy-can be written by his biographers as a result of Ms. Cornwell's book and newly found evidence."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After expending a great deal of ink and, reportedly, a large amount of cash, Patricia Cornwell has succeeded in proving that some of the hoax letters purportedly written to the authorities by Jack the Ripper MAY have originated with the painter Walter Sickert. Hardly an earth-shaking discovery...hardly worth writing another book about. (Sickert was previously identified as a suspect by Stephen Knight in 1976 and by Jean Overton Fuller in 1990.) Absolutely no new evidence linking Sickert to the murders is presented. Ms Cromwell would have been better advised to save her money and our time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Wow, this is so weird and - I'll hand her that - imaginative. If I will ever commit a crime I'd want her to prosecute me - that would make a jail-free card.

She might have even had the real Jack the Ripper and messed things up by jumping to different conclusions that are irrelevant."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I really have enjoyed nearly all of Cornwell's fiction. I have admired the versimilitude of her work and respected her as a former coroner in Virginia. I have even enjoyed some of her non-fiction as well--\\"Recipes to Die For\\" is a hoot and I have enjoyed using her mandatory literary cookbook.Portrait of a Killer, on the other hand, is a sad effort. If you enjoy sophistries, non sequitors, logical fallacies, and a myriad of assorted inanities then this is the book for you. I found this one of the most annoying books I have ever read.She spent a lot of money producing this book and seems to have gotten caught up in the process. Poor Walter Sickert and his descendents! I hope that the family successfully sues Cornwell.One piece of advice: Don't Bother!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I can only get through 3-5 pages before my eyelids get heavy.

I think I will use the pages to start fires in my fireplace."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When I picked this book up I thought that it would be fascinating, if a tad morbid, to learn a bit about the Ripper murders. After slogging through Cornwell's book however all I feel is certain is that there isn't actually much left to know. Little to no evidence is left to examine, police reports and other key papers have long since disappeared, and forensic examination performed by the doctors and policeman was woefully insufficient to build any kind of case against a suspect. Yet Cornwell persists in arguing that Walter Sickert, a painter and student of Whistler, was the true identity of Jack the Ripper. She sounds definite in her opinion, but I fail to see how such specious reasoning could convince anyone else. All in all 'Portrait of a Killer' is an unsatisfying read. The reader comes away with scant information about the killings other than that it was a forensic nightmare, and no more of an idea who Jack the Ripper was than they had when they began the book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was really curious about this book. I have had a moderate interest in the Ripper case for a long time. I have to be honest, I was disappointed with this book. It feels to me like her choice for the killer was predisposed, and she tilted the evidence to support this.I also think that if you are going to take the time to research a subject and write a book of this size, it would be better to site the sources as you show the evidence, not just list sources at the end.I think Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction, which is what this feels like to me.If you want a better book on the subject, read From Hell. At least the authors of that don't make the claim to have the only answer, and they wrote something entertaining, not dry and boring."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If a prosecutor went to court and presented a case against Walter Sickert with the evidence the author gives us in this book, the judge would go \\"ha ha\\" and require of the prosecutor to chose another profession.So let's see what are some of the evidence that would make Sickert the killer. He knew a guy who was american and laughed with a \\"ha ha\\". In the ripper letters, the ripper writes \\"ha ha\\", so he's gotta be Sickert! Or because Sickert occasionally wrote on a certain type of paper, that happened to be the same type as the one used in the ripper letters, then it had to be him! And he wrote most of the 250 (????) letter jack the ripper sent to the police too! Also, Sickert drew pictures that were called jack the ripper and showed women being mutilated by a man, so he's guilty, who else would paint such things? Sickert was a sexually frustrated man who was very morbidic, selfish, weird, a pathological liar and since he lived in london, he had to be the ripper, right?This all sounds very stupid doesn't it? This is just a brief summary of Cornwell's ridiculous evidence. She goes on and on about the type of paper used in the ripper letters, and does say that maybe even if the paper is the same it does not mean Sickert is the killer, yet she decides that he is. From the beginning she does not just accuse him, she tells the world that she knows and refers to the Ripper as Sickert. On what basis? That maybe he wrote one of the hoax letters because the handwriting was very similar. That's the only evidence i agree with, that maybe he wrote a letter. And so what? Does that make him the killer? How can it be proven that those letters were real anyway?The couple points i agree with: he did not have to be a doctor like often suspected. You don't need to be one to open someone's abdomen and take their organs out. It's not surgery, no skill is needed. I further agreed with her as she explained how each murder was more and more gruesome which showed how he was learning his \\"craft\\".I give this book two stars because i like the profile she makes of the killer, even if her whole sickert thing is a stretch of her imagination. And if she's right, it's by luck, not thanks to her investigating skills. Sickert could be the killer, just like every single other man living in London at the time, but she was not able to prove it one bit.It'll never be solved, his name was Jack the Ripper, that's who he was, that was his name, not Walter Sickert, Ha ha!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. But if you're looking for one scientific fact that will nail Sickert as the Ripper, you'll be disappointed. After all, the science that we enjoy today didn't exist in 1888. The police then would not have treated a crime scene, preserving evidence, the way they would today.Rather, Cornwell has put together a picture that includes many facets of Walter Sickert. She compares the stationary both Ripper and Sickert letters were written on, some of which were identical. She finds linguistic patterns in the writings of both that are similar. She psychologically profiles Sickert, which I found convincing. She takes a look at his paintings and sketches. She has Sickert's artwork compared to the doodles in the Ripper letters. She discusses a congenital fistula, which a descendent of Sickert's 3rd wife says was a \\"hole in his penis\\", Sickert's 3 childhood fistula surgeries(1860's style!), and factors the effect of this on Sickert's mind and sexuality into his profile. She enlists the help of various experts to evaluate her data. She quotes Anna Gruetzner Robins, art historian and Sickert expert, as saying(paraphrase) she doesn't know how anyone can study Sickert, and not consider the possibility that he is the Ripper. I agree.Mitochondrial DNA is found to match in at least 2 Ripper letters, and 2 Sickert letters. Ok, sure, I have a B.S. degree. I know it isn't conclusive. But I do think it is interesting that the same set of sequences, though found in less than 1% of the population, are found on more than one of the letters written by Sickert and the Ripper.All of the reviews I've read so far have not evaluated this book on its merits. That is, it isn't a scientific treatise. It's basically a profile, with a study of the hundred year old \\"evidence\\" as supportive of the profile. As such, it is both entertaining and very suggestive.More than that; I think Cornwell has found the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was interesting and I felt it was worth the read. However, I give it three stars instead of a higher grade for the following reasons.First of all, it failed to convince me that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I wanted to believe; to be convinced. While there were a lot of evidences and coincides that were brought forth, too many of them seemed interpreted to fit, and didn't seem to me to exclude anyone else. Least convincing was the supposed evidence in Sickert's artwork. While there were indeed similarities between some of the subject matter and the post-mortem photos of the victims, they were no more that similarities.Secondly, while much of the book is very well written, particularly the parts that descripe the victims and Sickert himself, other parts aren't. Plus the overall organization of the book makes it difficult to keep track of all the evidence and the author's interpretations.The best evidence Cornwell provides is her reasons for excluding the more well known suspects. While Sickert could have been the Killer, here evidence didn't exclude anyone else. Though it is true that much of the original evidence has vanished making a definitive revelation of the killer difficult if not impossible, that weakened the arguements in my opinion.Still, it was an enjoyable read, and worth the time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A poorly written account of an interesting subject. The editor should be ashamed at letting this one go to the presses.All of the &quot;evidence&quot; is circumstantial at best - and more precisely; ridiculous.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Did Scotland Yard's John Grieve (to whom the book is dedicated) use Patricia Cornwell? The Yard wouldn't reopen this case, but Grieve saw an opportunity and moved quickly -- give Cornwell access to all the Ripper files and let her do what The Yard did not. Point her directly towards Walter Sickert and, voila! (Did Grieve mention only Walter Sickert's name?)\\"When you go after the King, you'd better bring him down.\\" Cornwell's book is probative, not conclusive. Interesting, not compelling. Contrary to her statement, \\"He is caught,\\" he is not caught. Cornwell ignores Occam's razor at her peril.The bibliography contains neither Stephen Knight's work, Jack the Ripper; the Final Solution, 1976, nor Colin Wilson's A Casebook of Murder, 1969. Knight's book became problematic -- Freemasonry, Gull, grapes, etc., but Knight did bring Walter Sickert into play. Knight was disturbed by Sickert's paintings and felt Sickert may have been the murderer. (Knight also claims his primary source was Joseph Sickert, Walter's illegitimate son. Joseph Sickert recanted his story, but did Joseph state he was not related to Sickert?)Wilson concluded that Ripper was not a renowned Londoner and his identity may, alas, be known only to history.Footnotes. You read a sentence like, \\"Nothing mattered to Sickert unless it somehow affected Sickert.\\" Source? Sickert's nephew, John Lessore? (Lessore thought the idea that Sickert is the Ripper was \\"rubbish.\\") \\"The anticipated connubial bliss of the flamboyant artistic genius . . . James McNeill Whistler must have been disconcerting to his former errand boy-apprentice [Sickert.]\\" Source?\\"One might almost have called [Sickert] pretty, except for his mouth, which could narrow into a hard, cruel line.\\" We see Sickert photos and you could look at one and, yes, \\"a hard, cruel line.\\" You could then look at that same photo and, no, that's not a hard, cruel line. (Are there photos of Sickert smiling? They are not in this book.)Other authors have read things into Sickert's paintings; Rorschach revisited? Sickert's piece, \\"Ennui\\" -- there is a painting on the wall behind the two subjects and Cornwell says if you look closely at the background painting-within-a-painting, you'll see a man coming up behind the woman there. You see no such thing. You need to get on-line, copy \\"Ennui\\" into photosuite -- increase contrast until an image of a man's head appears behind the woman. The problem is the \\"figure\\" isn't rendered in the same style as the rest of the painting.In another drawing, we're told it's \\"a man stabbing a woman to death.\\" Find a knife in the man's hand. (The piece is from Oswald Sickert's collection. Oswald was Walter Sickert's father.) Alongside the knife-attack sketch, a drawing of \\"a brute lunging for a woman.\\" It looks more like a woman being solicitous of a chap who has fallen into a pal's arms. (Again, from Oswald's collection.)Take \\"Persuasion,\\" from Walter Sickert's collection. Is the chap whispering sweet-somethings to a scantily clad woman? She's alive and likes what she's hearing. (Cornwell ties this painting to a murder in Camden Town, 1907, and Walter Sickert.)Joseph Sickert is problematic to Cornwell. If Walter Sickert did father a child, then he wasn't rendered impotent as a result of surgery for hypospadias (a penile fistula.) If Sickert was potent, then Whistler's marriage and happiness may have been of no import to Sickert. This is important. (Some of Sickert's contemporaries describe him as a ladies' man, a flirt, not afraid of a good time.)Sickert may have had complications with a fistula in ano. His surgeon, Alfred Cooper, specialized in anal fistulas. There were qualified penile surgeons in London and the Sickert family had the means to send Walter to the best specialist.There is no DNA evidence, and Sickert was cremated. (Cornwell may write a sequel if more evidence appears. But every time pieces of Ripper evidence are \\"declassified,\\" released, whole pieces \\"grow legs.\\") Cornwell found some \\"egg white,\\" but not the \\"egg yolk.\\"She found mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) traces in an etching on a Ripper letter and matches between an allegedly authentic Ripper letter and letters handled by Sickert. (Cornwell sets herself apart from Ripperologists concluding Sickert wrote virtually all the letters. Most experts believe only a handful were written by the killer.)Remember, with respect to Ripper DNA and mtDNA evidence, the potential for degradation, 1888 forward: the paper itself, London weather, re-handling of the letters by too many people, repeated sealing, unsealing, continual packing, unpacking of the evidence. Can DNA stand up to these insults over the years?Here mtDNA is close, but no cigar. In fact, \\". . . the maternal inheritance pattern of mtDNA might also be considered problematic. Because all individuals in a maternal lineage share the same mtDNA sequence, mtDNA cannot be considered a unique identifier . . . apparently unrelated individuals might share an unknown maternal relative at some distant point in the past.\\"With an mtDNA match, one can only conclude that Sickert -- along with one percent of the London population, 1888, some 40,000 people -- can not be eliminated from consideration as mailing the letter. If you prove conclusively that Sickert handled a letter, via mtDNA or what remains of fingerprints, that doesn't make him a serial killer. Would Sickert, the prankster, send a hoax letter to The Yard?Much is made of A. Pirie & Sons' watermarks on some of the correspondence. Two are highlighted by Cornwell -- the Ripper's letter to Dr. Openshaw, and a letter from Sickert to Whistler. Remarkable until it's discovered that Pirie stationery blanketed London, 1888.Mary Kelly's body was discovered November 9, 1888. Cornwell pins the Kelly murder on Sickert, but Peter Corris writes in the Sydney Morning Herald last year, \\" . . . he (Sickert) was having dinner with Oscar Wilde in the Cadogan Hotel\\" the night of the slaying.Is Colin Wilson right?

Patricia Cornwell's latest book &quot;Portrait of a Killer. Jack the Ripper Case Closed&quot; is no exception. This book is getting waaay to much media hype. Actually, its not a bad book, as far as it goes, and Cornwell has contributed some valuable and interesting research to add to our knowledge of these crimes. But the book has NOT in any way proved that Victorian artist and student of James Whistler, Walter Sickert was the Ripper. No published Ripperologists I am aware of still consider Sickert a viable suspect. Other reviewers have listed the flaws of the book, so I will forbear doing so here-and a succint review of the book can be read on the Casebook: Jack the Ripper website. My main gripe with this book is that Cornwell comes across as a maverick, disregarding the work, much of it groundbreaking, of published, established, expert Ripperologists such as Rumbelow, Stewart, Evans, Skinner and Begg. To hear all the media hype, Cornwell is the only serious Ripper student to publish a book in the last twenty years! She studied the case for about two years and came up with the man she feels is the murderer, whereas these guys have been studying the Ripper crimes for over twenty years and still haven't claimed to have solved it yet. It's as if in her mind the contributions of the other Ripperologists were negligible. Or, she acknowledges their conclusions, then ignores them. Cornwell seems to pay little, if any attention to their work in her book (only two of the standard Ripper works are cited in the extensive bibliography, and in her recent TLC cable special on the book only one noted Ripperologist was interviewed-Donald Rumbelow-and his comments were edited down to two or three minutes). The only caveat to the work of serious Ripperologists is one line at the end of the book where Cornwell acknowledges the work of others who have studied the Ripper case and says that she and they have solved the case together. This would be akin to Donald Rumbelow or Keith Skinner suddenly writing a crime fiction novel and comparing their work to Agatha Christy or Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels. Mrs. Cornwell picked a suspect and then, perhaps even unconsciously, made the evidence fit. Not a bad read, but if you're new to the Ripper case you would do better to star off with Donald Rumbelow or one of the other acknowledged Ripper experts.

She believes that Walter Sickert, a prominent artist of his time, was also one of the most infamous serial killers in the history of well...killing. She has many different reasons for her controversial opinion. She states that he was dark, even by artistic standards. He would paint things that are similar to the Ripper killings: a girl with a mysterious figure over her, possibly stabbing her. She also states that Sickert didn't need human companionship; he would take strolls for multiple hours, leaving his wife constantly wondering of where he might be at any given time. He also had many different apartments where he would go to hide out and paint his paintings, where he could also kill his victims if he was indeed a serial killer. These are just many of the points that Cornwell has to make in her giant case study of Jack the Ripper.The story is actually very easy to get through; it goes quickly and keeps the reader interested because the topic is quite interesting. The imagery throughout the entire book is immaculate, especially during the murder scenes. One can easily visualize the prostitute being gruesomely murdered in the dark streets of Whitechapel. The diction isn't too hard for the general population to get through in a reasonable amount of time. This book does a lot well; however, yet sadly it also does a lot of things badly. At times it was hard to keep track of what was going on because the book jumps from past to present, to murder to murder, and from America to England in the blink of an eye. Also the largest thing that is done wrong is trying to convince the reader that Sickert did these killings. She provides a lot of circumstantial evidence that could do little in today's justice system.My opinion is that the topic is quite interesting and yet the book itself is not right. This is because she could possibly be condemning an innocent man to the title of vicious killer for something that he didn't actually do. It would be similar to a local lady trying to get together a lynch mob for the local dark minded artist because there has been a murder and he may have done it. I would recommend this book to the reader who can get past the whole lynch mob mentality and just see this book for what it is: an entertaining case study into the life of Jack the Ripper and Walter Sickert.The gist of this review is that the book is interesting, but flawed. These flaws take away from the reader's overall experience and make the reader feel bad for Sickert because he may not have murdered those women. The author loses her case from the start because she doesn't use pathos to draw the reader in she uses it to push the reader away, exactly what an author doesn't want. Overall I'd give this book a 5/10; you won't miss anything spectacular if you choose not to read the book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"A lifelong fan of all things Ripper, I tried my best to muscle through this but failed about halfway. Cornwell's arrogance and hysteria, her muddled, muddy presentation, and above all her amazingly petty, philistine, old maid-ish hatred for Sickert were just too much. This woman is a buffoon."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell's \\"evidence\\" for Sickert being Jack amounts to her feeling very strongly that it was very likely that Sickert was probably Jack. Her tone throughout this abomination is closer to that of the hysterical Victorians she supposedly despises than that of the cool, objective, level-headed investigator she tries so hard, and fails SO hard, to be. Her self-absorption is comical and irritating simultaneously. She likes to imagine she's carrying the weight of all the world's dead on her shoulders because, well, she writes crime novels for a living. She's noble because she really feels for murdered prostitutes etc. Cornwell's psychological naivete is astonishing. Based on her profiling technique and insight into the human soul generally, Dickens, Poe--hell--EVERY great artist obsessed with the grotesque and sordid should be condemned as a psychopath and maybe subjected to intensive investigations regarding unsolved murders in their neighborhood. Only an utter fool, swooning, vulgar, and ignorant, would take this book seriously. (Just read some of the 5 star reviews. Good God.) Cornwell, an enemy of art, deserved every bit of the scorn that came her way as a result of \\"Case Closed\\"; may Sickert's shade haunt her the rest of her days."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I liked it, no one knows for certain who Jack the Ripper is, I like her thoughts and have read other books that don't produce much if any backup to their claims, its was a good read"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The trouble with this book is that half way through everything seems resolved. Cornwell does a fine job of lining up the facts and does indeed make a convincing enough argument (evidence is mostly circumstantial) for whom the tittle of Jack the Ripper really belonged to however after awhile it looses it's appeal and quickly becomes redundant. Once we figure out that we're in on the whole thing it quickly becomes a flavorless read.There are some high points in here however, namely the little tidbits and facts that one picks up on almost any reading of a historical investigation book. There were a few hilarious scenes in the book where she goes out and buys a standard police issue lantern and takes a walk down a dark London alley in order to recreate the conditions in which police officers at the time would have had to work under while investigating the case. Much to her dismay she finds out that instead of the large, far reaching beam that illuminates the skullduggery of the common criminal in the night time she gets a small glow bug type illumination that works so poorly she quickly has to switch to an electric torch in order not to trip over herself and break her neck.Over all this was a good read but it still is in need of some editing. Personal dramas and all the extra information after she makes her final argument over the identity of the killer should have been kept to a minimum or cut all together."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When a forensics expert pens \\"case closed\\", I expect tangible evidence that would convince a jury (or at least give a prosecutor some probable cause). Cornwell has a theory but doesn't show any evidence to support the idea that Sickert was deformed, much less a psychopath.On the other hand, she spends most of the book (and does a fine job of) comparing Sickert's art to artwork on many of the Ripper letters that the police of the day dismissed as hoaxes. This was the first book I read on the subject and I would definitely consider Sickert to be a person of interest in the case, but that's all."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ripperologists have a passion that rivals that of Talmudic scholars and an ability to savage any position that runs counter to their own. Therefore, it is not surprising that Patricia Cornwell's attempt to close the case of Jack the Ripper would be met with disdain, hostility, and outright invective.Of course Cornwell claim that the artist William Sickert was Jack the Ripper is open to debate. We need to remember that EVERYTHING involving this case is open to debate. One of the initial decisions you have to make in trying to reason out the real identity of the Ripper is to determine who his victims were. Even the acceptance of the canonical five (Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) is a basic assumption that is easily called into question. Stride and Eddows were both killed the same night; Strides body was not mutilated, the assumption being the killer was interrupted. The horrible mutilation to Eddows' face is assumed to be because the Ripper was enraged that he had been interrupted in his first killing. But what if Eddows had not been killed? Would we still assume Stride was a victim of the Ripper? If Eddows had been the sole victim that night what motivation would we have ascribed to her mutilation? Any and all assumptions made to deduce the Ripper's identity are debatable.For most people familiar with this case the most astounding part of Cornwell's case against Sickert is the argument that he wrote MOST of the Ripper letters. The assumption has always been that only one or two of the letters might have been real, so Cornwell is making a radical argument in this regard. Ultimately this is the strongest part of Cornwell's case, especially given her repeated observation that these letters are confessions as far as the law is concerned. Given the prolific number of letters Sickert wrote to newspapers in his life, it would not be farfetched that he would do the same thing as the Ripper.The other key part of Cornwell's argument is the psychological profile of Sickert. The problem is that this is more of a premise in the book than a cogently laid out argument, with bits and pieces scattered throughout the book. I think the problem is more organizational than argumentation and I would have appreciated a more clinical presentation of the profile.The weakest part of Cornwell's case is also her strongest. Cornwell dredges up everything from Sickert's life and work that she can use to pin these crimes on the artist (e.g., suggesting an unopened letter by his first wife given to her sister contained suspicions Sickert was the Ripper) and there will be times when you think she is pushing it. But the sheer volume of accusations is such that you have to be open to the possibility that some of them are valid. From an argumentative standpoint, she does not have to be right on ALL of these accusations to prove her point; she only needs to be right on some of them.One of the things that makes me think Cornwell might be right are the argument raised against her thesis. Cornwell repeatedly points out that she does not have \\"hard\\" proof of Sickert's guilt, so pointing out the inconclusiveness of her DNA matches is irrelevant. Yes, there is evidence that Sickert was in France during some of the killings, but Cornwell deals specifically with the problems of that evidence (Sickert claimed to be in France with friends who were no longer there, etc.). To be fair, it is hard to make substantial arguments against Cornwell's case in the context of a review limited to 1000 words, but you still have to deal with the specific points she raises. In the end Cornwell rests her case on an accumulation of coincidences sufficient enough to have Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve and an expert on the Jack the Ripper crimes to endorse her conclusion by saying he would be happy to put the case before the crown prosecutor.One of the other things that works against \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is that Cornwell uses more of a disjointed narrative structure than an argumentative one. The six murders that Cornwell ascribes to Jack the Ripper serve as a basic chronology for the book, but interwoven are chapters devoted to various parts of Walter Sickert's life that are unstuck in time. At one point I was convinced that maybe an editor had decided to rearrange these chapters and that I might be able to put all of them in a more traditional chronological order. With each of the murders Cornwell provides the main details and then talks about the limitations of forensic medicine at that time in contrast to what could be done today. \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would work better if it were divided into a section that looks at the murders and then another making the case against Sickert.The book is illustrated with tinted autopsy pictures of the Ripper's five canonical victims, including one of the horrible human wreckage of Mary Kelly. Cornwell uses these images, not only as a way of remembering the victims, but usually with the additional goal of showing how they are reflected in Sickert's artwork. Certainly the book would have been enhanced by more reproductions of the various works by Sickert that Cornwell alludes to in making her case. As it is, the key examples here have to do with the Ripper letters, the Lizard House guest book, and sketches known to be by Sickert.Despite the presentational problems, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is going to be required reading for Ripperologists, all of whom will make of it what they will. Just be sure to read it before you dismiss it (or diss it). This is not something akin to the creative fantasy of Alan Moore's \\"From Hell.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a fan of Cornwell. I find her to be an intelligent woman, an interesting interview, and a talented author...and she's a fellow Davidson alumnus, a definite plus for this fellow Wildcat. I purchased the unabridged audio of this book eager to listen to what surely must be a well-reasoned, well-grounded theory backed up by at least some evidence. I was horribly disappointed.Even if Cornwell is correct, this is the farthest thing from a closed case I have ever encountered. Some of the logical leaps and contortions in this book are downright laughable and should justifiably draw outrage from Sickert's admirers or surviving relatives. As other reviewers have noted, it is POSSIBLE (as far as anyone knows) that Sickert might have been a creep, that he might have written a ripper letter, even that he may have been the famous killer, but anyone wanting to bring a case against Sickert would find almost nothing useful in this tome.The conviction with which Cornwell delivers many of her conclusions (the narrator is suitably melodramatic and judgmental in tone), no matter how tortuous, absurd, strained, or self-serving they may be, makes this book one whopper of a bitter horse pill to swallow for any reader/listener who has somehow managed not to either: a) toss the book into the wall in frustration, or b) fall asleep while attempting to follow the last convoluted line of argument to it's &quot;inescapable&quot; conclusion.I WANTED Cornwell to come up with an exciting new theory I could buy in to, but at best this book is premature in it's title and conclusion (unless evidence is no longer a prerequisite for closing a case), and at worst this book may be both intellectually dishonest and shockingly irresponsible.Sadly, this is a must-miss that will leave the reader with more lingering doubts about Cornwell than Sickert."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"One of the most insidious phrases in the English language is: \\"It's obvious that...\\" Nasty little phrase. It's usually used to cover weak logic, but it convinces people because of the implication that whoever says it is more knowledgeable than the listener.So imagine an entire book based on that phrase.Unfortunately, \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper -- Case Closed\\" is one such book. Bestselling mystery writer Patricia Cornwell tried her hand at unravelling the century-old mystery of who Jack the Ripper REALLY was. Too bad her book is a steaming pile of... well, you get the idea.In her investigations, Cornwell primarily focused on Walter Richard Sickert, a British impressionist, actor, and pal of Oscar Wilde. While Sickert was open about his interest in the serial killings, Cornwell delves into the bizarre to reveal what she clearly sees as irrefutable proof of his double identity. Makes you wonder what the poor guy did to tick her off.Perhaps the problem is Cornwell's fiction -- her imagination is way too active. She seems to be treating the Jack the Ripper case not as a true event with hard facts, but as something that can be spun into a semi-fictional narrative, with clues that no jury would vote for. It would make for a good detective novel, but not a serious cold case investigation.Watermarks, coincidental poses, perceived signs in his paintings, hoax letters and mitochondrial DNA are all touched on, but Cornwell never actually produces any hard evidence -- in other words, evidence that would make a jury sit up and listen. At best, the evidence is circumstantial. For example, Ms. Cornwell has no actual proof that any of the letters that were tested were even from Jack the Ripper, or that the mitochondrial DNA was from Sickert. However, this doesn't stop her from asserting that both are the case.And her leaps of logic are almost impossible to swallow, unless you have a festering hatred for Sickert. For example, his apparent fascination with the crime makes him clearly guilty in Cornwell's book, despite the fact that many others -- also presumably innocent -- were similarly fascinated by the crime. The big difference is that we know of Sickert, whereas we do not know of Robbie the night porter.Cornwell also tends to damn without reason, exhibiting an almost shocking smugness. Sickert is proclaimed a cunning \\"psychopath,\\" and her disdain for certain parts of London is obvious. Worst of all is Cornwell portraying the cops of the time as inept losers who could not find their own backsides with a map. The \\"dumb cops, smart li'l me\\" tactic works in fiction, but it is absurd in the real world.And finally, what did Sickert do to earn Cornwell's wrath? In her eyes, he is a cunning psycho, a woman-hater, a eunuch, a \\"slob,\\" a master of disguise, a predator, and a guy who was obviously insane because he liked to take nighttime walks. Every small facet of his personality is twisted into a sign of predatory madness. If liking nighttime walks shows that you're a deranged killer, then chain me up.While Patricia Cornwell -- who destroyed at least one Sickert painting in her quest -- is a passable fiction writer, her real-life investigations are nothing short of demented. \\"Case Closed\\"? I think not."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell did a great job researching this project. As one reads this book, you can see and feel all of the research that she did.As you continue to read the book, you quickly feel that this is not just a research project for her. It has become an obsession.She makes an interesting case against the British artist, Walter Sickert. Some of it is convincing. In fact, I believe that he is the most credible suspect to be Jack the Ripper. Cornwell got her hands on a lot of letters and paintings from the Ripper/Sickert. The problem is, she has no conclusive evidence that Sickert was the Ripper.If she presented this case to a Grand Jury or a Preliminary Hearing, I doubt it would ever see a trial. She confesses that without Sickert DNA, we'll probably never know for sure if Sickert was the Ripper, as he conveniently had himself cremated upon his death.The part of this book that disturbs me the most is how she arrogantly labels her book: Jack the Ripper Case Closed. Really? According to whom? First, there is lack of evidence and nothing conclusive. All she has are theories and small pieces of circumstantial evidence. And many of those, she confesses, \\"We don't have evidence that Sickert was there. But we don't have evidence that Sickert wasn't either.\\" And?!? If this is the best she can do, then she's a long way off from PROVING anything! As a former medical examiner who has years of experience of working within the law, I feel the Cornwell should know better.She has no qualms whatsoever about literally calling Sickert, the Ripper. She may be right. That is not what I'm disputing. She hasn't the facts to back it up.Personally, I feel there is a great chance that Sickert was, in fact, the Ripper. A man of high standing, incredible intelligence, and a twisted mind to boot, seems to answer a lot of unanswered questions about why the Ripper was never caught. Cornwell's theory is that he simply outsmarted them. It's a good theory. A really good one. But again, not enough evidence to support it.This is a compelling read, and it wasn't that I didn't enjoy it. I found it very interesting as she gives insight to the times, places, and people of the time period. If Cornwell had just come out and said that she SUSPECTS that Sickert was the Ripper and allowed the reader to come to his/her own conclusions, then this would be a credible book. But, she oversteps her bounds and removes much of that credibility from her work.Unfortunately, she's done a better job of damaging her reputation than she has in putting Walter Sickert under the spotlight. If Sickert was the Ripper, then he's done it again...outsmarted Patricia Cornwell 114 years later."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"With Ms. Cornwell's considerable forensic skills highly advertised and on display, I was expecting much more. Thus, it is an understatement to say that I was disappointed in this fictionalize non-fictional hunt for Jack the Ripper.It seems to me it did not take highly touted forensic skills to rummage through history's dustbin. Do so in a very disjointed way; throw out a few rehashed random facts and theories, and then add a few of your own -- like Walter Sickle's paintings and a concocted theory about his missing testicle or \\"penile or anal fistula\\" -- and then like magic claim them to be the holy grail and the missing link to the Ripper's murders.To her credit, Ms. Cornwell does go through the motions of building a circumstantial case. She draws on paper watermarks, on graphology and handwriting analysis, mitochondrial DNA analysis, and then delves quite extensively into Walter Sickert's eccentricities.However, this all seems to have come together in a contrived way. Sickert had been waiting in the wings all along to save the storyline. Suddenly, Sickert was trotted out just as the story was about to fall apart due to lack of any semblance of convergence. It all came together so quickly, and in such a disconnected way it left the reader the impression it had been done as a last ditched plot-saving desperate act to find a neat ending -- as a way of pulling together almost by fiat, so many disparate threads that could never come together otherwise.Maybe I was expecting too much to think that with newer forensic techniques there would be a neater more conventionally linear scientific convergence of the existing evidence. In this version, there was no convergence at all. We simply were led down one primrose path after another: all to dead-ends; and then suddenly, as if a bolt from the blue, in walks old \\"one nut\\" Walter Sickert and his paintings to save the day for Ms. Cornwell's story and presumably her reputation.Two stars"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I managed to finish this book eventually - but it was through gritted teeth. If Patricia Cornwell has worked in the field of criminal investigation as she suggests, I would have significant concerns about her objectivity. She paints a picture of Sickert which may or may not be accurate. She builds a case purely on a mountain of circumstantial evidence and hearsay. If I were a member of a jury and she were the counsel for the prosecution I would be less than impressed by the arguments advanced or by the totally random manner in which her &quot;facts&quot; are presented.The &quot;evidence&quot; advanced always tantalizes, but somehow never quite closes the argument. Its always along the lines of - his wife's theatre company visited these Northern towns and these murders occurred in these same towns; or Sickert could have caught a train to the North of England, murdered someone and been back in London in time to go the theatre; or the stationery used by Sickert was the same brand as that used in Ripper letters.When I saw an exhibition of Sickert's art many years ago in Liverpool - long before I read this book, I found his paintings dreary and depressing and not at all uplifting like Renoir or other impressionists. Clearly his Ripper type paintings could suggest a warped mind and possibly misogynistic tendencies, however maybe he was fascinated by the Whitechapel murders and used them simply as subject matter.Obviously it is very difficult to apply modern investigative and forensic techniques to a case that has grown so cold. However, it is unacceptable for Cornwell to act as judge and jury on a long dead man on the basis of such a ragbag of snippets and assumptions. Looks like a case of an author doing what any good author does - lay out the basic premise and plot of a novel and then mould the rest of the events of the story to conform to this framework. In this case Sickert it guilty, and so all the evidence must be crafted to point to this conclusion.Don't waste your time and money on this lightweight effort."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Nearly every paragraph of this book is an astounding revelation-of poor logic, muddied thinking, circumstantial coincidences and forced argument. If Cornwell constructed her mysteries with the same reckless reasoning as we have here, she'd retain few of her fans. The sins here are many, including a complete absence of historical context for Sickert's \\"sick\\" art, a strained feminist slant to her interpretation of Sickert's early life, an almost willful misinterpretation of the artwork and an almost insulting disregard for pure common sense. Case in point, just one of many: Cornwell address the commonly held belief that most of the so-called Ripper letters to the police (more than 200) were hoaxes, affirming her belief that most were written by the same person. Sickert, being an artist, found delight in disguising his handwriting in a number of different ways, which explains the variations of handwriting styles in the letters. He often played at being illiterate, misspelling words deliberately, but on occasion wanted to remind the police he was educated and submitted letters with flawless grammar. (We regular folks might think that the variations in style and appearance suggested several different authors, but apparently not.) The logical leaps don't stop there, but they're too many to list here. The most fun a reader can have with this book is to read Cornwell's descriptions of Sickert's paintings and drawings, which she describes as being too-close-for comfort reproductions of the actual murder scenes-and then look at the artwork yourself. A few drawings are included in the book itself, which will make you scratch your head and wonder how Cornwell could possibly have interpreted it in this particular way. (My theory? A big advance from the publisher, but don't listen to a cynic like me.) When you look up the drawings and paintings that are not included in the book, you'll think you've stumbled onto the wrong documents; they're that far from the descriptions. As for Sickert's morbid subject matter, the reader should keep in mind that the Gothic tradition and the Grand Guignol were both extremely popular at this time. It's not unusual that Sickert, a disciple of Whistler and an acquaintance of Beardsly should include skulls, violence and corpses in his work; it would be more unusual for an artist of his background if he hadn't. Check this one out of the library along with a book of Sickert's prints. Better still, find out where Cornwell got her information and dip into \\"Sickert and the Ripper Crimes\\" by Jean Fuller, now out of print but worth tracking down, so long as you don't have to buy it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I wondered why Cornwell included a very odd section about her frustration and depression when writing this book. After reading it, I understand -- it was probably intended as a sort of &quot;apology&quot; to her readers.This book desperately needed editorial intervention. It is incredibly disorganized and meandering. Cornwell starts on one area of evidence and then suddenly drops it, veering off to a new topic. Then chapters later she may raise the same item of evidence again. There are no transitions and the whole thing is confusing as heck.Her overall argument is not convincing. It is particularly hard to believe that all of the Ripper letters were written by one hand. Her analysis of artwork is just plain laughable.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having read the other reviews posted here, I must confess that I'm no Ripper expert and have read little on his crimes prior to now. However, I am a student of forensic psychology, and as a sporadic reader of Cornwell's fictional works, I was interested in her take on the Ripper case. I was rather disappointed by this offering. The main complaint I have with the book is that it was horribly disorganized. While her novels are tightly organized and logical weavings, I found her Ripper tale to make huge leaps in chronological sequence and she often littered the account with oblique historical references that confused its flow. The chapter headings seem to at times have been chosen from a hat as they had no bearing on the text. I learned much valuable historical information of relevance here and am intrigued [and dismayed] by the horrific crimes. However, I agree that her 'conclusions' are often drawn from facts that are anything but conclusive. For instance, when she compares the watermarks of the Ripper letters to watermarks of Sickert letters, I found myself wondering how often one would find that certain brand of paper in London society in the late 1800s. Buried in a small paragraph pages later was a dismissive reference to the fact that the paper was 'not the most common' at the time...but in comparison with her statistical analysis of mitochondrial DNA results, I found the lack of numbers wanting. To put it bluntly, I came away from the book feeling that Sickert COULD be the murderer but the evidence is too flimsy to support a definitive conclusion. Despite this, Cornwell's depiction of life in London in the 19th century is compelling, if bleak. The book was still an interesting read for the uninitiated and it has spurred me to begin reading experts' opinions on who else the Ripper could be."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What a disappointment - what a muddled mess. This book could never be mistaken for a scholarly analysis. Ms. Cornwall should have started with a paper published in a peer review of criminologists. But then again, she's a fiction writer with deep pockets - not a criminologist. She makes an interesting case, but destroys it with strong bias and supposition throughout the book. It seems at every point when she is describing the known facts of the case, and possibly related cases, she gets off track with baseless speculation. I began to wonder what Sickert was really like, since her portrayal was so strongly biased, I started to distrust it. Enough circumstantial evidence to bring Sickert to a Grand Jury - I doubt it. Her editor should have taken a strong hand to her manuscript. A suggestion: First describe the known events and facts. Then describe your suspect. Next, show how the circumstantial evidence connects the two. Then show how modern forensics science relates the two. Then, for fun, show how modern forensics techniques, applied 100 years ago, would have proven guilt, or not. And keep your bias out of the book. Keep to the facts, and only the facts.

Those in search of better and more imaginative work on the Ripper case should look to From Hell by Alan Moore and The Complete Jack the Ripper by Donald Rumblelow. Moore's From Hell shows a much deeper insight into the English culture surrounding the Ripper slayings and Rumblelow's book has a much better collection of reliable facts.

This weighty volume by crime writer Patricia Cornwell was no exception.I will admit to being initially put off by the self-congratulatory, smug, tone prevalent in the media surrounding the release. But, I hoped that this was the publisher and agent's doing and wouldn't be evident in the actual book. In this regard I was disappointed. From the book cover to the last page, Portrait of a Killer; Jack the Ripper - Case Closed is full of an almost palatable contempt. Cornwell writes in a style that is both critical of the authorities at the time and of other contemporary theories. This might have been forgivable had the book actually \\"proved\\" that her \\"Jack,\\" artist Walter Sickert, was the Ripper.Unfortunately, the book is extremely lacking in the proof and evidence that one would expect from a famous crime writer. While in a 100 year old case, one would expect a great deal of circumstantial evidence, I came away feeling that had Cornwell decided that anyone of the numerous others that had been investigated and discounted for lack of evidence, were her favorite pick she could have made just as strong a claim for their being Jack. I was also put off by the very obvious attempts to force circumstance to fit her theory. Every aspect of Sickert's character seems to be darkened to make him seem more menacing. His art is particular is referenced as proof that he was a psychopath. However, if you study art produced by almost any other artists of the time who painted and drew \\"the common man,\\" you would find a similarity in the starkness and degradation profiled.Had the book approached the subject in a \\"here is an interesting theory\\" sort of way or even promoted the idea that this is a fiction with some historical facts thrown in, the book would have been more enjoyable. But the constant bombardment of \\"these are facts because I say so\\" without any real substance is draining and sucks the enjoyment out of a typically riveting subject."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It is not quite easy to understand how one is expected to take this book. At first, one is expecting a big revelation that lives up to the sub-title, Jack the Ripper Case Closed, but it quickly becomes apparent that Portrait of a Killer has no revelations to impart or, what is even more strange, any no information not discussed in many previous books. DNA evidence is hinted at but never delivered. Despite this, Patricia Cornwell presents all of her vague posturing as proof positive never realizing that just because it is new to her does not, in fact, make it new or, even, proof. To give the book its due, some of the forensic information concerning how the case would be handled today is interesting. Sadly, though, the book is marred by very bad editing as many paragraphs seem entirely unrelated to their neighbours or even to the chapter it is in, and very bad historical research. If a mystery writer were to tackle this time period perhaps Anne Perry would be a better choice as Victorian Britain is quite distorted by Cornwell's attempt at portraying it. I thought this book would be fun in the way some preposterous conspiracy theories can be a secret, silly delight to read. This book never even achieved that level of shameful pleasure. A frustrating, dissappointing book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Walter Sickert was an interesting painter and case study, but despite the estimated $6 million author Patricia Cornwell reportedly spent investigating the Jack the Ripper mystery, no smoking gun is revealed in these pages. Cornwell, an author with previous crime lab experience who has gained fame and fortune with best selling novels about the exploits of forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta, provides potential DNA evidence to be used against Sickert to link him to the grisly Jack the Ripper murders, but as critics have noted, it is far from conclusive. Two important factors need to be remembered, 1) scores of letters purporting to have come from Jack the Ripper were received and reviewed by police, with most dismissed as coming from cranks; 2) Sickert was cremated, rendering the prospect of any conclusive DNA finding linking him to the killings virtually inconceivable.The book has merit, however, on several fronts, just as long as one is circumspect about drawing too much on sometimes fragmentary conclusions concerning Sickert. Victorian England is revealed in fascinating detail, along with the shadowy world of London's East End, Whitechapel, where the Jack the Ripper murders occurred. Sickert is a fascinating figure, with his bizarre artistic genius and ability to hobnob with leading figures of late nineteenth century London. He was the apprentice of the legendary Boston expatriate who took London society by storm and remained to prosper, artist, journalist and bon vivant James McNeill Whistler.While Sickert's artistic tastes revealed ghoulishness, the desire to paint luckless prostitutes with their hapless customers, it is understandable that he might draw attention as a potential Ripper possibility. He also was known to take walks in the dangerous Whitechapel area in late evenings. These are attention drawing elements, and perhaps render one a suspect, but it takes much more to pin the crimes on Sickert and establish that he indeed was the Ripper.Due to the fact that so much time has elapsed since the murders were committed over a century ago, it is understandable that interest abounds with a number of prospects being considered. It is also understandable, and indeed likely, that after all the time that has elapsed that speculation will continue to abound without the Jack the Ripper mystery ever being solved."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is a vulgar, speculative exercise in self-delusion. Cornwell spent over $4 million dollars to chase a red herring, the result of which is this ridiculous book. In the process she destroyed 5 Sickert paintings, taking an intolerable liberty in order to match DNA to someone whose body was cremated and unavailable for testing in the first place. Aside from these philistine actions, Cornwell shows no understanding whatsoever of Sickert's work, or indeed of the working processes of any artist. For example, she says Sickert's habit of enlarging a drawing by squaring it up means he must be &quot;Mathematicus.&quot; Before the age of photocopiers and projectors, this was, and still is, an acceptable means of enlarging a drawing onto a canvas. Meaningless allusions to Punch and Judy scripts, common styles of bed frames, neckerchiefs, etc. are only a few more examples of how the author, determined to make her case, sees only what she wants to see to support her conclusion. Perhaps Sickert was not the most moral or even likable man, but it is ridiculous to assume he was Jack the Ripper. The entire book reveals far more about Cornwell's character and the workings of her own mind than it does Sickert's. Anyone interested in Sickert or Jack the Ripper should look elsewhere. The author should be ashamed to have put her name to something so appalling, and to have indulged herself in so much destruction of a great artist's work and life."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This was possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. Patricia Cornwell should be ashamed of herself for writing this book.I am not a huge Cornwell fan; I read her book on the Body Farm and found it to be poorly written but not terrible.This book, on the other hand was a complete disaster. Her writing style is insane. It is almost as if the publisher printed her first draft. She CANNOT keep a train of thought going for more than a page and often jumps to completely unrelated story lines mid-paragraph. This was obviously annoying, but the worst and most irritating part of this book was complete lack of evidence or supporting information.For someone who is \\"friends\\" with Bill Bass, NONE of his pragmatic thinking or unbiased presentation of facts has rubbed off on her at all. She uses Sickert's paintings as proof that he was violent and deranged much the same way the Nazi's used avant-garde art to prove that modern artists were degenerates. Shame on Patricia Cornwell, shame. She makes unsubstantiated accusations throughout the book, uses pieces of 'evidence' that are not even attributed to Sickert OR Jack the Ripper to 'prove' that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She also used extremely misleading language throughout, but especially in regards to her forensic evidence. The whole book is a sad joke. Her assumptions range from baseless to irritating to inflammatory. Patricia Cornwell should leave the real-life detective work to professionals. All she did with this book was embarrass herself."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell's attempt to prove painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper left me not only unconvinced, but confused. Her book is full of irrelevant digressions and unfounded assumptions. A good editor should have helped Cornwell better focus her ideas. (Perhaps an editor tried, and Cornwell's baffling book is the result.)Cornwll flits from one subject to another every few pages, rarely stating a hypothesis, offering supporting evidence and reaching a conclusion. She offers far too many &quot;could haves&quot; and ignores or dismisses any evidence that doesn't support her ideas.Writers far better than I (Stephen P. Ryder or Wolf Vanderlinden) have articulated the many problems with Cornwell's hypothesis. Find their articles online and read their analyses."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Interesting theory but Case Closed? I don't think so! There are some remarkable points made here and should be read by anyone interested in Jack the Ripper. However Patricia Cornwell's policy of, there is no evidence to prove I'm right, but there is no evidence to prove I'm wrong so I must be right, just doesn't cut it, pardon the pun. As far as saying it must be true because the experts said they would arrest Sickert, anyone can find an &quot;expert&quot; to agree to anything. Doesn't mean as much as it used too! So all in all, read the book for a good possibility for who The Ripper was, but don't expect that we've put the mystery to bed just yet."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book would make an excellent college casebook for teaching logical fallacies. It is replete with prime examples of the errors of circular argument and tautological inference. As history, it is beyond flawed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms Cornwell book on Jack the Ripper does exactly what other reviews have stated! It is not laid out logically so the reader can easily follow her evidence and research She jumps around and appears to force down her opinion on who Jack the Ripper was I didn't finish her last book and I almost didn't finish this one! Very sad I truly enjoyed her first efforts at writing where she researched the forensic side of crime I thought I'd give this book a try but am very disappointed She should look at Bob Snow's book &quot;Searching for Carol Beckwith&quot; and see how well the format and lay out is and how the reader prefers to make their own conclusions"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"...at least two stars for effort and being so damn silly! i'm not one to be a party of a pooper, but this book sucks the big green weenie. good photos tho... ."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell presents somewhat convincing evidence, although the presentation of the evidence was disorganized, repetitive, and too drawn out at times. It took me quite a long time to get through this book, it was way too much of a struggle. Also, I concede with another reviewer in that it would have been nice to have pictures of the art pieces discussed included in the book to refer to."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Somehow I expected more. Not that Ms Cornwell didn't put forth some convincing evidence, but the manner in which she rambled from topic to topic to topic and back again, and the defensive tone of some of her arguments bothered me. I found the narrative hard to follow at times, as it bounced from modern DNA testing to Sickert's personality flaws to watermarks on stationery and so on. It's true that writing convincing non-fiction and gripping fiction are two very different talents. Worth a read, but has its tedious moments."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As an avid Cornwell and true crime reader, I couldnt wait to get my hands on this book. I read the excerpt in Vanity Fair and found it less than compelling but I was certain the actual book would be better. It was not. Cornwell does not prove her case scientifically as I had hoped. She does create a strong circumstantial case. Her writing is cloudy and she harps on the same points too many times--almost to the point of making them ludicrous in the reader's eyes.This book will certainly be a disappointment for Cornwell fans. It also will not do much for Ripper scholars. I would check it out at the library but not purchase a copy."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a gifted writer, and her knowledge of forensic and pathologic sciences has been thoroughly documented in many Dr Kay Scarpetta novels. Thus, I was expecting the same logical approach to the problem: theories with clear deductions and proofs - after all, she said in her title \\"Case Closed\\". In my opinion, she failed to close the case on Jack the Ripper, but she did succeed in presenting a plausible theory. The problem lies mostly with the structure of her book. There is no clear time line, as references are plucked from different time periods to support a specific theory. Most disturbing is the fact that many of her theories rest on the fact that Sickert painted dark scenes showing murdered/mutilated women. Too many of her theories are prefaced by \\"we have no evidence of this, but we could assume...\\". There are some very interesting half-proofs such as the watermarks on stationary used by both the Ripper and Sickert, but one cannot feel entirely convinced that this fact is sufficient to assume guilt. More perturbing is the fact that Patricia Cornwell has very little to offer in support of her theories that Sickert was a highly disturbed man. Excentric yes, but she acknowledged that nothing in writing - from wifes, families, friends, any one - has been preserved to support the notion that his behavior was arousing the suspicions of such friends and family. He may very well be the Ripper, but her book left me unconvinced. She tried too hard to bring up annectodal evidence, or at least this evidence is presented as annectodes and do not carry much weight to her theory: police reports were wrong about times the victims were last seen, the doctors were wrong about times of death, etc. She may be right, but she cannot prove it, hence, there is no case closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I admire the intrepid readers who were able to slog through this tedious book long enough to form a conclusion as to whether Sickert was or was not Jack the Ripper. I'm willing to take Cornwell's word for it. Just don't ask me to try reading the book again."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is just too circumstantial to close the case on the Ripper. A real let down after all the hype. Ms. Cornwell should get her $6 million back from the investigators that helped her reach her conclusion"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Seems to me Ms. Cornwell is getting tired. Of course, she's earned it. I wish I could write even one book the caliber of her earlier ones. For more than a decade, I've looked forward to her new book every year, but I didn't bother to finish this one and returned it the day I bought it. Beginning with The Last Precinct, which was really over the top with 'unnecesary roughness' (please, Patricia, no more old dogs at the bottom of swimming pools with bricks tied to their feet), it seems that either Ms. Cornwell personally or Kay Scarpetta has gone from melancholy to clinically depressed, and I hope whichever one of them it is feels better soon. I miss the smart, sensitive (to be sure) but 'together' Scarpetta, and Lucy as an FBI agent (and Benton Wesley ...I wish he'd come back from the dead a'la Bobby Ewing on Dallas). One other point re: the Ripper &gt; Into the lives of his unwashed, diseased, and semi-toothless victims and the seaminess of London's east end is not a place I care to go so explicitly (and it isn't the gore; it's the smell). Frankly, I found myself thinking 'who cares if they're dead?' Come to think of it, who cares about Jack the Ripper? I thought I did, but, nah."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I don't like the pompous title and I don't like Cornwell's tendency to use phrases such as \\"heartwrenching\\" and \\"in shambles\\". But that's the end of my criticism. This is a fascinating book, my first exposusre to Cornwell, but not my last. To the repeated assertions on these web pages that the Ripper letters are \\"known to be hoaxes,\\" I say that 110-plus years of repeating a falsehood does not make it true. Cornwell ACKNOWLEDGES that the letters are almost universally considered to be hoaxes; her theory is that they are NOT. Her theory may be wrong; most Ripper theories are wrong, since they cancel each other out. But her case is as convincing as anyone's, and makes a darned good book. The tendency of the 19th-century police to dismiss evidence is chillingly like the same tendency now. Perhaps Sickert even had a normal sex organ and a normal sex life; that does not mean he was not violently misogynistic, as his art indicates. That's a common failing. You can find it in these \\"reviews.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Jack the Ripper, people have had a fascination about him for many years. This is the best of Cornwell's books. She researched this case and gives her readers an authentic view of what probably happened in London in 1888. Her personal knowledge of forensic science enabled her to identify the author of the Ripper's letters. I have read and seen many ideas of who the identity of Jack the Ripper was. Cornwell has the best answer to this old question.

She has to overstate her case even though she has to know she didn't really prove it. She wants to make money off her name, and a scholarly discourse on one suspect isn't what her readers are interested in. I do agree that the chonology is very confusing and given that people with a lot of knowledge about the ripper case aren't going to like her book that much, it would have been a good idea to provide a summary of the murders and the other theories early in the book. Her failure to pursue things that might weaken her case is a little irritating and distracting too. For instance when she tries to link other murders to the ripper/Sickert. OK there was a brutal murder when Sickert was in town. Well, how many brutal murders were there the week before when he wasn't in town? Put it in context!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell makes an interesting case on who Jack the Ripper maybe and in all honesty, she is very convincing. Whether you agree with her or not, definitely read this almost biographical study on the first known serial killer of the 20th century.The reader will learn about life in London during this century among the 5 known victims and who they were. Cornwall is so concvincing at times, that you can't help but agree with her views and insights.You will learn about the horrible crimes this madman committed, among who he is and why he may have killed. Cornwall tried to put to rest the souls that died by \\"Jack's\\" hands and the countless more that were also possibly his victims. Again, whether you agree with Cornwall is up to the reader but she makes a very good case.If you love history and the criminal mind, this book is very recommended!Katiebabs"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I gave this book four stars because of Patricia Cornwell's excellent writing style. She is very smart, of course, but writes with a smoothness little known in this genre. She certainly does provide convincing tidbits about Jack the Ripper, enough perhaps to make some people believe her choice of killers did it, but I had to think about reasonable doubt. So long after the infamous crimes, it is inevitable that Ms. Cornwell would be unable to collect enough physical evidence, even in conjunction with Scotland Yard, to prove her case. If I were a juror, I would have to plead not guilty. There is more than reasonable doubt, and some of her \\"facts\\" (for want of a better word) are definite stretches. In my heart, she almost has me convinced, but there is still that little bit of \\"almost\\" hanging around that insists this case is not closed. Having read most, if not all of Ms. Cornwell's books, I'm more on the believer side, as she is indeed an excellent forensic pathologist, usually in the person of Kay Scarpetta. I also thought that she gave Scotland yard an unfair shake, considering what they had to work with back then, often it sounds as though she blames the nearly unsolvability of the case on their shabby police work, when in fact, they simply did not have today's technology. She also balances this at point with some commendations for Scotland Yard, but I ended up feeling she was not pleased with their work back in the Jack the Ripper days and thought that even with little technology, they could have done better. It's your turn to be the juror."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was so excited about getting this book after seeing Patricia Cornwell interviews, articles about the book, and reading a couple of excerpts from it. Generally I don't read non-fiction, but I felt that I would try the genre. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Case Closed? Not really. At least not for me. It took me a lot longer to finish this book then it does most the ones that I read. There was no sense of organization to the book. It jumped around so much that I was easily confused. It was like Cornwell just started writing and when she remembered a detail, she stuck it in.After spending millions of dollars of her own money and writing a book, I expected the case against Walter Sickert to be airtight. But it wasn't. At the end of the book I was still asking myself who had really done it. While there are a few things to connect Sickert to the crime, there are a lot of things that just don't pan out. I just think there are too many &quot;possibilities&quot; that will sadly never be proven and seem a little far-fetched.Now I did get a lot of information and learn things that I otherwise would not have known. But as a whole I felt gypped into reading a book that promised something that it wasn't. There were no shocking revelations or airtight cases. And for that, I gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Where was her editor? Although Ms. Cornwell's prose is well-written, the ideas in this book jump around in a very distracting manner. Just when she is developing one idea or factual scenario, she will go off on a tangent and either not finish the first idea or come back to it so much later that the reader has forgotten where he was. It's as if the whole book were written as an initial draft and any ideas that popped into her head (&quot;that reminds me&quot;) were added right then and there.I thought her premise and much of her evidence were quite interesting, and I learned a great deal about the Ripper cases, which I have always found fascinating. However, I never thought that a writer of Ms. Cornwell's caliber and ability would publish a book so amateurishly constructed. Her points could have been made far more forcefully had the book been better organized."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The other reviewers have it right--a very confusing story is revealed by the author. The strongest evidence for Sickert being the Ripper is (1) the mitocondrial DNA which he shares with the Ripper and 1% of the human race, (2) a rare note paper that they both used, (3) a surmise that Sickert's sexuality was bent due to a birth defect dealing with his ***, (4) the writer of the Ripper letters was well educated and familiar with painting techniques (some letters were painted rather than written with a pen), and (5) Sickert was a weird, selfish man who might have done it. Without a breakthrough in the evidence (for instance, finding Sickert's mother's grave and stealing some tissue since the rest of his brothers and sister were cremated and he had no kids), this is just a case of coincidence. Sorry Patricia.I watched her talk to the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science on CSPAN about two weeks ago and was sufficiently impressed to go out and buy the book with some Christmas money. I just skimmed the last half of the book--her case had fallen apart by then--I want my money back. She was never able to prove that Sickert was even in the area of the killings though she tried. I am convinced that Sickert was a weird person, and he treated his three wives rather badly."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I give a lot of books four stars instead of five. Most books I read are good (if a book is bad, I might finish it, but generally I don't waste my time reviewing it), but few are fantastic. This is one is good.I like this book because it's non-fiction that reads like a story. Cornwell hasn't abandoned her trademark compelling tone for changing genres, in other words. I wasn't sure at first if Kay Scarpetta (heroine of most Cornwell novels) would be the one delving into the mystery of Jack the Ripper in Fiction-Land. That would have been interesting. But I wasn't disappointed to learn that it's a first person from Cornwell herself.I don't know Cornwell but through her books, and I bet if I met her, I'd find she's meticulous and thoughtful (as in thinker, not as in considerate). Just from reading her novels, I feel comfortable with believing in the validity of her research. In other words, I would count on her having done her legwork well. I trust that she herself believes in the deduction of her research, that Walter Sickert is Jack the Ripper.That doesn't make me believe it, though.I've read other books that claim to solve the Jack the Ripper mystery. This one is at least as well done as those; many times, it's better. Yet, Cornwell's evidence is largely circumstancial. The piteous lack of real evidence over 100 years after the fact makes it impossible simply believe her, period. Also, her research is prone to her interpretation, though she tries valiantly to minimize those times.Another thing that bothers me about this book is her categorical disinclination to explore the other \\"suspects.\\" Based on her research, she is convinced that Walter Sickert is the Ripper, and even says at one time that it's her goal to follow the research, not to discredit other suspects. I guess, if we can't prove negatives, we can't prove that the other suspects DIDN'T do it, but the absence of addressing other popular candidates (except, I think she does discredit it being the Duke of Clarence) does disgruntle me.Buy this book if you're an ardent Cornwell fan, Ripper \\"fan,\\" or a true-crime fan. You'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I admire Patricia Cornwell's fiction writing. She is one of the best authors out there in the fiction genre. Her skills as a non-fiction writer however, leave some things to be desired. Her research is meticulous, but, it seems to be grasping at some points, especially in reference to Sickert's art. She also bogs down in some areas when trying to prove her point, making the reader get lost in factoids. The ending, was the most disappointing aspect of this book, and led me to question the merit of writing such a sweeping indictment of a single person."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Using her multi-talented background as a forensic expert and considerable amount of her own money, Patricia has compiled such a massive amount of circumstantial evidence against one suspect that is would be impossible to suppose that anyone else could be the \\"Ripper.\\" Unfortunately, far too many people want this cold case to remain open to continue their own 'cottage industry' of speculation, articles, etc., but anyone willing to consider the case she has built, the logic of her arguments, and the overwhelming circumstantial evidence to support her conclusion will agree with her conclusions."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"this book was writen so wonderfully i could not put it down. defianlty somthign i will read over and over"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's methodical and untiring devotion to this project (book) is obvious and she is to be applauded for taking what even she believed to be a risk! I rate this book 4 stars because of the research. However, I would've preferred the book to have been written strictly in chronological order. Because it often jumps from one time period to another, it could at times be a more difficult read than it needed to be. Towards the end, it became laborious; but I do believe Patricia Cornwell has finally solved the identity of Jack The Ripper. Perhaps the early surgeries performed on him had something to do with the 'ripper' part of his moniker. The book is a page turner, interesting and shows Cornwell's dedication to finding and telling the truth via her extensive research and its results. There is much to be said for an occasional coincidence when trying to link a person to a crime; but a virtual lifetime of them? Chances of that are slim to none. Nay-Sayers will continue to hunt for the 'real' Ripper and disregard Patricia Cornwell's fact-finding mission, but that is their privilege. ME?

Would it make his otherwise wretchedly muddy paintings all the more bearable? Would it make Jack the Ripper's ghastly crimes that much more amusing? After reading this book, and frankly I haven't, it seems clear that the Ripper was not Walter Sickert but Walter Winchell. Or was it Paul Winchell? I get them confused. Nevertheless, the truth is that there is more to historical inquiry, particularly art historical inquiry, than just cursory examinations of artworks which are then assimilated into the assumed truth of history. The point is, really, that I hate books. Despise them. There are just SO MANY of them. Who could read enough of them to make a dent in the Truth? Well, not me, I'll tell you that. It's for this reason that my reading mainly consists of sugar packets and the sides of cereal boxes. I don't know if Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. And for the millionth time in my life, I couldn't care less. I've been looking for other uses for books: window props, coasters, flyswatters. You get the point. People keep on writing books and people keep on buying them. It doesn't end. The writers end and the buyers end, but the books just keep flooding the earth with pulp and ink. I may buy this book at some point, when my contempt for the written word has waned. I may even read it. Or I may save the universe the trouble and burn it as soon as I buy it.

Immediately after that idea came the thought that if anyone could do it Patricia Cornwell can and started reading the book only to find out it is so well written and fascinating, that it impossible to put down until the last page is turned.She and her team applied modern day forensic techniques and crime scene methodology, and historical sleuthing to determine whom Jack the Ripper was. Several tons of documents and other physical evidence such as fingerprints, photographs, museum paintings, fine arts accouterments, and even DNA, etc. were evaluated. Using the assumption that Jack remained free and still operated after his several month killing spree in 1888, Ms. Cornwell follows the paths of the prime suspects and looks at police blotters near where they lived. This concerted effort led to Ms. Cornwell to declare unequivocally that Jack the Ripper is none other than: read the book.PORTRAIT OF A KILLER: JACK THE RIPPER CASE CLOSED is a fascinating version of the Ripper case and the chronicle of how Ms. Cornwell and her team step by step drew their conclusion. The key to this true crime account is not the final claim though that is appealing, but the powerfully interesting nonfiction elucidation that hooks the reader to follow along as if Dr. Scarpetta was working the crime scene. Ms. Cornwell shows she could rule the true crime genre if she permanently switched fields perhaps to try to uncover the identity of Deep Throat next.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is GREAT!!

Plus it's just a book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having just finished this book, I am convinced that Ms. Cornwell \\"got her man.\\" In light of my belief, almost all of the evidence presented is circumstantial and her supposition based upon coincidence but as is stated in the book, coincidences don't routinely occur without reason (or something to that effect). Ms. Cornwell presents ample alibis for other suspected Rippers, effectively discounting many alternate theories to the killer's identity while bolstering her case against Sickert.Saying that, I did find this book somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow. Ms. Cornwell jumps from victim to victim, chapters are not in chronological order and a timeline is difficult to establish. At one point during this read I was tempted to get out a pencil and paper to visualize the crimes and the concurrent location of Sickert. I was also disappointed in the unexpected \\"blunt\\" ending of the book. The way it ended left me expecting another chapter when I turned the page. How surprised was I to find the author's acknowledgements!I plan on reading this book again to see if my opinion changes. If you are into forensics (as is in vogue these days) you will probably enjoy this book despite its organizational difficulties. The process is fascinating and her theory is quite plausible. Give it a shot, you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"You people that wrote reviews...Have you ever experienced art? The whole point is that no one really knows for sure who did the treacherous murders but take this: Some murderers look at murders as a type of art and since Sickert's paintings may create an angle as to how they affected him and his involvement. Obviously he was a very smart man and a talented painter and by the looks of it his attire and tendencies as an individual link him in some way to the murder. Cornwell's account may be far fetched in your eyes but as an artist i think he is a possible candidate."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"For years I have been fascinated by the story of the \\"Ripper\\" but wondered why no one was attempting to use modern forensic methods to solve the case. Finally Paricia Cornwell has done it! This work is brilliant and intense. Her descriptions are traditional Cornwell, graphic, detailed, and descriptive.She not only details the murder scenes, she also gives a history lesson on policing in the late 19th century and explains how DNA works in the crime laboratory of today. Her horror at what she has discovered and her revulsion at the conclusion is evident. I couldn't put it down and have recommended it to many of my friends and patrons at my library. If she hasn't solved this \\"unsolvable\\" crime then no one can. I believe she has."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was never really interested in the Jack-the-Ripper movies and I didn't expect much interest from my favorite writer. However, she has captured my interest with this new book. It is very interesting in the way it is put together with the pieces of science breaking through a hundred years of silence. How strange the layperson can put together her imaginings of his crimes? It is amazing how much one can understand when put in other ways. She seems to have done her research and so have the others that she contacted for help in these killings. How very interesting human behavior can be?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwall has certainly stirred up a storm of controversy with this one. She takes us back 113 years to the Jack The Ripper murders and paints a very interesting picture of the people and places of that time. Using letters, newspaper articles and police reports, she builds a case against the artist Walter Sickert. I personally found Cornwall's conclusions believable....much more so than other theories I have heard. Reading this account of events was like being a juror and hearing the prosecution's case. It will be interesting to see how many defense \`attorneys' will come forward to present an opposing view. Some of the crime scene pictures included in the book are not for the faint of heart. I would have liked to see more examples of Walter Sickert's paintings, but that might have been difficult to arrange. They are available from other sources of course. Cornwall has a disconcerting habit of introducing a piece of information then dropping it, only to reintroduce it later with a more complete explanation. Although the story is not told in true chronological order, the whole picture does come together eventually. Whether you agree or disagree with the author's findings, this book makes for a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you want to know absolutely everything about this killer, this is the book. Sometimes the details are too gory, but that's not Ms. Cornwell's fault. She has done an extremely thorough job and her case is quite convincing. For me, there is too much detail, too much history, too much about the man she preports to be Jack the Ripper. But, thats only me. For others the detail would be just right. It is a fascinating book and she has done a supurb job. A nice change from the Kay Scarpetta books, which I really like."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you love history, unsolved crimes, and forensics, -you will love Cornwell's PORTRAIT OF A KILLER, Jack the Ripper Case Closed.Ms. Cornwell admits that there was no joy in writing this book, and I would have to agree that there was no real joy in reading it. Portrait of a Killer is a dark, oft times frighteningly discriptive account of what probably happened over a hundred years ago.Yet, I could not put the book down. Once I began reading, I felt obligated to finish. We may never really know if Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, but Cornwell magnificently wrote from her heart, drawing from conversations, old police files, letters, newspaper clippings, and yes, forensic testing.If Walter Sickert painted what he saw, then he convicted himself. Great book, that I would highly recommend to all Cornwell fans.Vickie Adkins, Reviewer and author - Tattered Pages, the light blue ribbon."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While I do have a problem with assessments of who killed whom after all the subjects are dead (how would YOU like it if after you were dead, someone theorized--incorrectly--that YOU were the murderer in an unsolved crime!), I did find this a gripping read. It helps to be interested in Jack the Ripper to begin with, as I am, but even if not, I think you'll find this as good as Cornwell's novels. Probably the most gripping read I've had since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The great detail involved in Patricia Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer makes it a worthwhile book to read. The facts were all there to believe entirely that Walter Sickert, the supposed \\"Jack,\\" murdered these 19th century English prostitutes. However, the book doesn't allow much room for making an educated guess on who the murderer is. The book is somewhat biased in that sense, but the author was able to back up any assumptions with clear, logical evidence.The book is an enticing, titillating thriller, but unlike other murder mystery stories, this one is entirely fact, thus increasing the excitement of the reading process. The gruesome pictures of the four dead women, as well as Sickert and his family, could make a statue bend over in queasiness. The detail of the women's sufferings are graphic, but to a point that makes you feel for them but not pity them. It is a great book and especially good for fans of notorious murderers and the crimes they committed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book. I expected to see mostly positive reviews. Then again, I'm no expert. I just like to read and like many, I am fascinated by the mystery of Jack the Ripper. This book appeased my curiosity. I thought Patricia Cornwell did an excellent job of making her case. She compiled an impressive amount of evidence against Walter Sickert and wrote a compelling book about it.I realize Cornwell is not popular with many Ripperologists, but I think everyone needs to remember that this is just her theory. As far as theories go, I think hers has a lot of merit. I will say that her rambling about stationary for an entire chapter was extremely boring. Other than that, I thought the book was a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I don't know how anyone could read this book and not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Walter Sickert is Jack the Ripper. Yes, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence, but people are convicted on strong circumstantial evidence every day. Why? Because if the evidence is strong enough, even though circumstantial, it can leave no 'reasonable' doubt. Yes, anyone can say they're not convinced beyond a 'shadow' of a doubt, but 'reasonable' doubt is all that is required. And how often can a person be convinced about anything beyond a shadow of a doubt anyway? Rarely or never. Shoot, I heard enough evidence to indict him on Primetime! Anyone who reads the evidence about the 'Gurney Ivory Laid' paper...knows that Sickert, without a doubt, wrote some of the Ripper letters. That, coupled with the fact that some of his paintings resemble Ripper crime scenes that he couldn't have been familiar with unless he was there, would be enough for a prosecutor to take to a grand jury. Jack the Ripper:Case Closed? ABSOLUTELY!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Even Patricia Cornwell admits that the case isn't closed when it comes to Jack the Ripper but she does come up with some hard and convincing evidence that Walter Sickert could have been Jack the Ripper. Most convincing to me is his art as well as the fact that she is able to make me see how THE RIPPER doesn't necessarily need to be a surgeon as one theory suggests. I believe Patricia is on the right track and look forward to hearing more when she is able to get more of the test results back."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"In her book Portrait of a Killer, crime fiction novelist Patricia Cornwell claims that she has uncovered the true identity of Jack The Ripper, the madman who haunted the lives of everyone in London in the late 1800. But who was the real Ripper? His identity was never found. Only conspiracies and theories exist. Cornwell, through years of research, scientific analysis and very intelligent deductions, might have stumble upon something that is very close to the so-called truth.Walter Sickert, a somewhat renown painter of the time who died in the 1940s, is the man Cornwell accuses of being Jack the Ripper. Sickert has been one of the many men named during the course of history, and now Cornwell has tried to prove his guilt.Many of Sickert's painting bear frightening resemblances to the crime scenes and the victims themselves. The letter sent to the police and newspapers echo the things Sickert was living at the time. And Cornwell, through unduly research, can even place him at the scenes of the crime most of the time. Sickert's background is the kind that would undoubtedly help at creating a killer.What I liked about the book is that Cornwell's argument isn't one-sided. When some of her research failed, she is not afraid to say so. For example, DNA testing on a letter Sickert sent compared to that of a letter the Ripper sent were inconclusive. But many other tests Cornwell did offer some new light on the subject at hand.Was Walter Sickert Jack the Ripper? I'm not sure the book fully proves that. But it makes a very strong argument for it. The Ripper story is filled with falsities and fiction. Cornwell does erase all of it to give us the bare truth and the real facts. She goes back to each and every murder scene and analyzes them. She tries to go into Sickert's mind and show us his many mood swings, his dark personality and his abnormal behaviour.All in all, Cornwell does make her point, and quite strongly. The book is very informative and written in a very entertaining way. After a series of fiction duds, Cornwell is back full-force with this non-fiction effort."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Being a huge Dr. Kay Scarpetta fan, I was at first hesitant to purchase Patricia Cornwell's first venture into non-fiction. Boy am I glad I changed my mind. This is the best book I have read in years. Being a fiction mystery and thriller fan at heart, this book has changed my hesitancy to read non-fiction forever. This book is exciting and hard to put down from page 1 to the very last sentence. Not only does Patricia Cornwell present you with overwhelming circumstantial evidence as to who Jack the Ripper was, but she gives you extensive background about London in the 1880's, the Victorian mindset at that time, the abilities and inabilities of the local police and Scotlad Yard to effectively investigate these crimes. The writing is so descriptive and detailed that you progressive from one mental picture to another easily.The circumstantial evidence that that has been discovered by Patricia Cornwell and her team of experts will have you convinced of who the real Jack the Ripper was within the first fifty pages, but the volume of evidence just grows and grows to the very end. This is a must read for all Patricia Cornwell fans and will become her most famous and most enjoyed book to date, even for fiction buffs like myself."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Very interesting....I'm a big fan of Cornwells...the book read somewhat like a textbook. Very through. It would be hard to believe anyone could discount her conclusions."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book would be perfect if you are into reading term papers. I personally enjoy the Kay Scarpetta series and thought this books was too dry and boring to say the least."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cannot believe that a rich and well suceeded suspence novelist like Patrycia could write such junk, and, worse still, call it CASE CLOSED!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwall uses a dead man, Walter Sickert to bolster her non-existant case.With any kind of karma, Mr. Sickert's relatives will sue her for her outrageous claims."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I don't know if Sickert was Jack the Ripper but Patricia Cornwell does give a pretty solid argument about Sickert as a candidate for Jack the Ripper. I was impressed but not willing to accept her explanation in solving the century old murder case. We will never know truthfully who Jack the Ripper was and that is why it has become a legend. Of course, knowing would be great but not knowing allows us like Patricia Cornwell to look at possible suspects. So I don't know who Jack the Ripper is because every author has their own theory of who he was or she was but it's a good and well written book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I enjoyed some of Patricia Cornwell's early Kay Scarpetta stories, but I'm afraid she's permanently lost me with this book. I can't believe that someone who prides herself on how closely she's studied criminal science and forensic practices could fail to see how weak a case she's built here. Early in the book, in a spate of hilariously self-indulgent whining about how the evil Sickert was taking over her life, Cornwell tells us that her agent offered to get her out of having to write this book. If only she'd listened.Her \\"smoking gun\\" appears to be DNA evidence that could still encompass thousands of people in the general area at the time of the killings (no matter how many times she repeats the misleading \\"DNA that excluded 99% of the population\\" figure), found on letters that are widely considered to be hoaxes. And things go downhill from there. She recounts key moments of Ripper history and tries desperately to get Sickert to fit into the picture, as if Sickert were the only artist in recorded history to be drawn to eccentric behavior or violent and disturbing imagery, or even the only artist of that time period to produce works clearly influenced by the Ripper murders. I did find one redeeming feature in this whole mess -- I hadn't heard of Walter Sickert before reading \\"From Hell,\\" but I found the Sickert artwork reproduced in \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" rather interesting and want to seek out more. Maybe I'm a psychopath too.If you want to read a profile of a potential Ripper suspect that's far less flashy but probably closer to the truth, read John Douglas's chapter on the Ripper in \\"The Cases That Haunt Us\\" (it's worth noting that even the notoriously egotistical Douglas shies far away from claiming that he's \\"solved\\" this case). If you want to read a fantastic and imaginative Ripper narrative that has no pretensions of being a final solution, read \\"From Hell.\\" If you're a Cornwell fan who wants to continue to have a shred of respect for her, stay far away from this one."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I thought the text of the book needed some editing; the evidence was not laid out as clearly as it should have been and sources were not always explained well. I also thought that given the notoriety and history of this case, the size of the book and Cornwell's own expense, the book underutilized illustrations. I wanted to see more of Sickert's paintings and more of the Ripper letters. If this is the definitive book on Ripper, the last word, then no expense should have been spared in convincing the audience and displaying all the evidence. Nonetheless, I found her argument persuasive."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book starts off with portraying Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper with no lead up as to why.The book proceeds to eliminate some of the more common suspects such as the Duke of Cornwall and others, leaving us with Sickert.To an amateur like myself, Cornwell presents some evidence that seems fairly convincing, if we know why Sickert is a suspect.What is really interesting in this book is the history of various aspects of Victorian England. Details of each case. History of the Metropolitan Police. Forensics of the era. Paper manufacture and watermarking. English approach to coroners and medical examiners. All very interesting reading.I recommend the book, unless you are looking for a scientific treatise."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is the first Cornwell book I've read, and very likely the last. I started this book expecting something more mature than the movie From Hell, and found that there are actually several parallels and it's still purely circumstantial. While her accusations are compelling, they are not fact. Facts in this book are scarce. I give this three stars instead of one because the cover says \\"Portrait\\". She certainly does create a portrait. If this were a fictional novel and she didn't include herself in the book and make herself seem like Nancy Drew, this would've been a good, interesting read. But her constant interjections of \\"I found\\" or \\"I researched\\" or \\"I discovered\\" just make you want to slam the book shut and chuck it in the trash.Thus, if you're wondering whether or not you should read this book, there is only a certain type of audience that will enjoy it. You'll enjoy this book if you know absolutely nothing about Jack the Ripper and the facts that dissuade people from thinking it's Sickert which Cornwell blatantly ignores. Or, you'll enjoy this book if you're willing to pretend that it's a work of fiction, because as a work of fiction, she does a really fabulous character description. The Walter Sickert she portrays is a morbidly fascinating person - if you're willing to pretend that it's a fictional character. If those two types of audience aren't applicable to you, don't bother with this one. There are better books on Jack the Ripper with far less bias and just as much research."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Believe me. I tried. I really tried to finish this book on tape, but Kate Reading's manner of speaking drove me crazy. Her cadence and over enunciation, in my opinion, detract from the &quot;story&quot; she is reading, rather than enhance it. For example: I was so distracted by the way she over pronounced &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; I found I couldn't concentrate on Patricia Cornwell's text discussing the medical examiner's office in that state &amp; had to rewind the tape. That's about when I gave up on this book on tape. I thought about getting the book to fill in the rest, but honestly I am really not enraptured with the tale on it's own feet. I'm not sure if my interest waned due to Kate Reading's recitation, or whether I was just bored by the needless inventories of victims' clothing or the many graphic paragraphs dedicated to Walter Sickert's genital surgeries &amp; the possible conditions of his hospital stays.It seems that people interested in Jack the Ripper should probably *read* this book for nothing else than to say they've studied Cornwell's Sickert as Ripper Theory. I think Cornwell has a lot of interesting points about Walter Sickert as the Ripper, &amp; her research, especially into Victorian London, seems impeccable. I'd recommend staying away from the book on tape in favor of the reading the actual book though."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After seeing Cornwell on ABC's Primetime, I was intrigued and keenly awaited this book. I have to say, however, that I don't believe she really makes her case. She uses bits and pieces of data to support her theory and dismisses others out of hand when they don't suit her needs. Perhaps the most damning bit of evidence is the art of Walter Sickert which in and of itself is disturbing, although little of it is seen in the book. I found myself slogging through the last half."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found the book compelling, well-told, researched and credible. Her depiction of l9th century London slums is bleak but when one visits some of those places today, they appear rather dismal still, even in daytime."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am not a &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; expert - so I cannot compare or contrast this book to competing theories. While the book was well written and painstakingly researched ... it was poorly organized. It jumped back and forth on timeline and content. It reads more (from a flow standpoint) like a second draft. It looks like the editor was in a rush to get this published and they relied on the author's name and subject matter to sell the book. While the evidence is compelling, I think the subject would have been better served if she had compared or debunked the other theories. I few charts and grids would have helped for some time-line comparisons. From an &quot;O.J.&quot; perspective, she might have enough to get a civil judgement against the &quot;accused&quot; but I don't think there is enough to get a criminal conviction. Glad I read it but it sure was ponderous."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell, the author of the popular Kay Scarpetta mysteries, has done some historical research and come up with a startling conclusion: that Jack the Ripper was really a famous English painter named Walter Robert Sickert.A lot of readers and reviewers have taken Ms. Cornwell to task because she didn't write the Ripper book they wanted to read, because she can't prove by today's standards that Sickert was guilty, and because of her lack of objectivity, the last of which I agree with. Additionally, some people may have a vested interest in keeping the Ripper's identity a mystery or in protecting Sickert's image.What Ms. Cornwell has done with her book is paint an empathetic portrait of the people involved in the Ripper case - including the victims - and try to discover possible links between \\"saucy Jack\\" and the elusive, secretive Walter Robert Sickert. There's not a lot of DNA evidence, but Cornwell has examined what does exist. Furthermore, by trying to get inside Sickert's life, she has come up with a ton of circumstantial, but horribly suspicious, evidence that points toward Sickert as either Jack the Ripper himself, or a sick wannabe.I am by no means a Ripper expert, but this theory seems by far to be the most believable one I've read so far. If you are interested in Jack the Ripper, this book is worth reading just for the details of the lives of the victims and her descriptions of 19th century Whitechapel."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was intrigued with Mrs Cornwell's idea, and some of her ideas do have merit, but she almost goes at it with too much glee to the point at sometimes that you have to wonder if she was blinded by her eagerness to point the finger at Sickert. Some of her leaps in logic are just too far for me to agree to.And then came the ending. It abruptly ended in the middle of a discussion on how he treated his last wife. I turned the page looking for another chapter, a resolution, a final word form the author, but there was none. One of the most empty finishes I have ever read.Do I think she is correct? She has someitneresting ideas, but I still hold to the idea that the murders were carried out by one man...and a bunch of copy cat killers. Was Sickert one of them? Possibly, will we ever now? Not from this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"To quote the author herself, &quot;It is sad that men whose lives and careers were touched by the Ripper cases would spin theories almost as baseless as some of those offered by people who weren't even born at the time of the crimes.&quot; Patricia Cornwell case is as baseless as those she criticizes. It offers little more than an ego trip, with occasional salacious details, often unrelated, to keep the average reader titillated. She offers little of substance to prove her case. Rather, she starts with an assumption, not even original to her, and warps facts to fit her hypothesis. And the book is not even well written. It is poorly organzed and jumpy."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Hopefully this book sinks into oblivion - and fast! The absolutely ludicrous libel that is printed in this book about a rather accomplished artist of the late nineteenth century is appalling! If I were one of his descendents I would have her prosecuted for defamation.There is not one single shred of evidence linking this man to the crimes. This book is so damaging to the reputation of Walter Sickert and the study of the Ripper crimes!Not even worth reading it for entertainment -A waste of paper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It takes very little actual research to determine that Cornwell's alleged murderer was in France when the murders occurred. Cornwell unaccountably goes to extremes to twist and distort facts and jump to false conclusions to accuse Walter Sickert. She mischaracterizes evidence and presents opinions as evidence. Why Cornwell became obsessed with Sickert is a mystery, but she should be ashamed of herself for making money slandering an innocent artist. If you enjoy reading the National Enquirer, you might be obtuse enough to enjoy this book. Case closed? What a joke!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell falls far short of the claims of her title. Her \\"proof\\" is circumstantial evidence at best, and, like most Ripper investigators anxious to promote their pet candidate, she conveniently ignores or dismisses any evidence to the contrary (in this case, most notably the evidence that Sickert wasn't even in England at the time of several of the murders). Add to this her strange and unhelpful habit of \\"quoting\\" only one word at a time from her sources, giving no useful context whatsoever, and you have a very disappointing book. (Such quoting practices would never be allowed in even a school term paper, and should certainly never have been allowed in an internationally distributed book. Cornwell should have known better.) I've read much of the Ripper literature out there, and this effort does little to solve the mystery. Though her descriptions of Victorian England are interesting and informative, Cornwell also inserts herself into the book in a way that is both distracting and appears to be sheer propaganda for herself as a (fiction)writer. In the end, the book is a somewhat interesting read, but nearly useless in solving any crime at all."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I tried to watch the tv special Patricia Cornwell had about this book. I tried to, and turned it off after the first 15 minutes. For a documentary about Jack the Ripper and his victims, why was she always there, and why was she the only topic? The end for me came with her and her crew walking towards New Scotland Yard--my God! Maybe it was not deliberate, but honestly, the scene was right out of The Right Stuff, that scene where the astronauts are walking over the tarmac to the launch bay. Or of gunfighters walking down a deserted, dusty street on their way to a showdown. That was too much for me. Then I tried to read the book. Maybe I did, I'm not sure. I could have, I can't prove I did, but then again I can't prove I didn't, either. So obviously I must have, mustn't I? Which was the evidence against Walter Sickert. As for his drawing from real life, as for his not being able to draw 'disturbing scenes' without having first seen those, then all I can say is, the illustrators (for instance) for the Honor Harrington and Miles Vorkosigan novels must have contacts and capabilities far beyond mere mortals. Not to mention those who work for Marvel and DC."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have been a fan of Cornwell's but do think her work has gone downhill lately and has turned episodic and predictable.Thinking that this book would be a nice change of pace, I was rather disappointed. Since I am not a Jack-the-Ripper-file Iwas unfamiliar with the details of the case and would have found it helpful to have at least a primer on the actual serial killer evidence before throwing Mr. Sickert under the bus.It must be assumed that Cornwell wrote the book this way to help the reader believe the evidence. But there is no direct evidence that Sickert was the Ripper. It is all circumstantial, and if he was the Ripper, he was far too clever to get caught in 1890's London. I do believe Mr. Sickert was not a candidate for \\"Humanitarian of the Year\\", \\"Decent Artist\\", or even \\"Good Husband\\" but that does not make him the Ripper.The most offensive part of this book is the title, since Ms. Cornwell should very well know that no case is closed until a Jury finds someone Guilty. Or if the case is so old that the killer is dead there should at least be direct evidence showing this person committed the crime. Without that evidence this case is not even close to being closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwells attempt at closing the case of Jack the Ripper intrigued me at first.Her main suspect Walter Sickert was already cited by a few other ripperologists as a potentially good candidate for being the real Jack the ripper. In fact there are certain characteristics and habits and possible clues that could tie Sickert in with the behavioral patterns of Jack the Ripper.Unfortunately Cornwell does not offer any solid evidence that actually can convince us that Sickert was or could well have actually been the Ripper.Her DNA testing of Sickerts letters with those of JTRs proves inconclusve.Also disturbing is Cornwells narrative which firmly takes the line that Sickert was a serial killer and an insane woman hater, anyone can make accusations but without providing solid facts to demonstrate to the reader and prove that he actually was, the accusation comes across as being absurd.Nowhere in her book though can she cite solid sources of evidence to prove her point.I believe this book was somewhat rushed, the research was in some cases very interesting however too many assumptions were made and virtually no actual proof was presented by cornwell that would have cemented her claims as fact.Overall we are left with a rushed work...perhaps if Cornwell was willng to invest a few more years and if she had recruited the expertise of a few more specialists in crimnology, handwriting analysis as well as historians and DNA experts we may have had a work which would have been more logically laid out with supporting evidence.If one re reads the book a few times one can start to actually get the sense that Cornwell being a prolific writer of crime novels has somewhat taken liberties and made up a lot of the missing pieces to support her aleady weak argument.Unfortunately Cornwells work can only be considered in its present form as a deliberate attempt at character assassination, i cannot recommend this work as a good JTR casebook, because t is devoid of any supporting evidence.Sickert may have been the JTR of old, however this book does not deliver the evidence we need to satisfy that the case is closed...fa from it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have never read any of Patricia Cornwell's mystery books, but if they are as narratively compelling as Portrait of a Killer, they must surely be page-turners. She knows how to characterize a psychopath; how to illustrate a depraved and violent mind. But I'm not convinced that Walter Sickert, 19th century artists and minor celebrity, was such a mind, or that if he was, he was the infamous Jack the Ripper.Cornwell is clearly meticulous in her research, but here she seems to have been meticulous with a purpose. She concluded that Sickert was the Ripper, and gathered the evidence that supported her theory, giving minimal attention to the evidence that opposes it. Her argument would have been more convincing had she elaborated on how she determined Sickert was the Ripper; what were the steps that lead her to that conclusion? As presented, her epiphany seems like a bolt from the blue.Cornwell's main pieces of evidence raise many interesting questions about Sickert. He had a deformity due to botched surgery that made him impotent, his artwork is largely misogynistic, many of the Ripper letters were written with artists' tools. All of these things indicate that he may have been a repressed and violent man, but not that he was Jack the Ripper. But Cornwell's case with these points makes fascinating reading. Her more tangible, physical proof is less fascinating. The only point in the book where my eyes began to cross was her descriptions of different watermarks in different 19th century stationary that Sickert and others used. More interestingly, several investigators are trying to get DNA evidence from the envelopes and stamps on the Ripper letters, but again, the most this could prove would be that Sickert (and many other pranksters) liked to bait the police.Still, Cornwell presents a richly detailed portrayal of a unique and disturbing individual. I had never heard of Sickert before reading Portrait, and I can see how he and his artwork would capture the imagination. Sickert, from Cornwell's research, seems to have been a dark and complicated man. And the London of his time was undeniably a dark and complicated place. It was an intriguing read, and I enjoyed hearing Cornwell's argument although I remain unconvinced."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"After spending millions of dollars of her own money, Cornwell claims to have solve the case (and bring some justice?). I'm not sure about the justice part. I have read Cornwell before and I'm not the biggest fan. This book is an interesting mess: it has both good points and bad points.First, I'll cover the good points. The book does a great job of depicting the lives of the \\"unfortunates,\\" the prostitutes of the East End of London. She describes the milieu, the hopelessness, the rampant disease, and the unsanitary conditions. She also explains how Jack the Ripper gets away with it. The police force did not have the resources to track him down. She also describes how current techniques could have caught him. She gives a multitude of arguments for Sickert being the murderer. She also addresses, at least partially, most of the objections to Sickert being the Ripper.The bad points are legion. One is that the book really drags in certain sections. She also lists other possible murders that could have been done by Jack the Ripper. This drags. She also seems to be pressing. She seems to pick Sickert at a Scotland Yard detective's recommendation and then seems to twist the circumstantial evidence to fit. Since this case is very old, there is no way we can disprove her suppositions. She also makes several insinuations and then writes, we cannot know for sure because of the lack of evidence. Why bring it up? She pretty much thinks every anonymous crank letter is from Jack the Ripper. I agree it seems like Sickert did write some of them, but it really doesn't prove anything. He appears to have been a very strange fellow. She also makes a big point that his paintings seem to depict some of the murdered women. However, interpreting paintings is a very subjective skill and I don't give it much weight.I've read a few of the reviews and they misunderstand how Cornwell used the DNA evidence. She does not use it to prove Sickert is the Ripper, she uses it to disprove some of the other suspects. The DNA evidence does not disprove Sickert.I think Sickert could be a suspect. I agree with her that the evidence for him being in France for some of the murders doesn't seem convincing. Sickert seems to be very strange, very morbid and scary man. However, Cornwell does not prove her case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell does a good job amassing what evidence there is linking London artist Walter Sickert to the Jack-the-Ripper murders. Especially intriguing are watermarks on three of the murderer's letters to the police that are ingrained on the same stationery used by Sickert, though this was a stationery commonly used by professionals at the time. Cornwell is very good at portraying Sickert as a misanthrope whose physical sexual problems may have given him a motive.While it is convincing that Sickert was an ugly human being who was fascinated by the Jack the Ripper crimes, this is hardly proof positive that he was the murderer. There is, understandably, very little hard evidence to support guilt. As a consequence, Cornwell overargues her case, substituting hatred for Sickert and rhetoric for any real evidence.One also gets the sense that Cornwell is a bit like the drunk looking for her keys by the lamp-post because that's where the light is. Because Sickert became a famous painter, we have a record of him and so Cornwell takes everything known about him and tries to make it fit a scenario of guilt. There may be many more likely suspects about whom far less a record survives. Thus Sickert emerges as if by default as the prime suspect.The biggest problem for her thesis is why the murders stopped. Cornwell argues that they did not -- that Sickert kept killing, but that the police attempted to defuse the public furor by not attributing the killings to the Ripper. Even if we accept that, how is it that Sickert had the self control to change the way he did the murders and, at some point, to stop them altogether? On balance, I don't think Sickert was Jack the Ripper, so in that sense the book fails its stated purpose.Cornwell does a good job of discussing the sociology of the characters on London's East End victimized by Jack the Ripper. She also argues, convincingly, that Jack the Ripper was a man before his time -- the prototype for the modern serial killer.Read this book only if the subject matter really intrigues you. I admire Cornwell's effort, but in the end the book is disappointing."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was all set to dismiss and dislike this book after all the negativity in the reviews. At this point NO ONE knows who Jack The Ripper was. Not Scotland Yard, not the many armchair detectives who peruse the volumes of writing on this gruesome killer. Certainly the case against Walter Sickert is no more or less full of holes than any other theory. Cornwell's Portrait is still a good read. She doesn't posture any more than any previous writer on the subject ( and a lot less in some cases, than her critics reviews) for her conclusions.I learned a lot on Sickert and see this more along the lines of an \\"Unauthorized Biography\\" of the man. Maybe this is a conspiracy between the Royal Family and Cornwell to distract attention from the REAL killer... hmmmI, too, am still PO'd at Cornwell for wasting my money on \\"Isle of Dogs\\", but not enough to forget the entertainment from the Scarpetta books before it.I too am a Ripperologist. Probably on a more casual basis than some. I found a lot of information on the era, political and social problems in London in the late 1880's to still hold my interest. This book also included more pictures of more obscure Ripper letters than I had seen before in one book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love unsolved murder mysteries like those of the Black Dahlia, Lizzie Borden, and, of course, Jack the Ripper. After watching the new Jack the Ripper special on National Geographic with Ms Cornwell as a featured investigator, I knew I had to read this book. It has been a disappointment to say the least. There is absolutely no hard evidence to prove Ms Cornwell's theory that links Walter Siskert to the Ripper, there is too much emphasis on letter and cartoon samples, and her arguments are weak. She can't place Siskert at specific places. Any other recently written book on Ripper history will suffice for any avid unsolved murder reader. When Ms Cornwell suggests that Siskert MAY have cannibalized people, I wondered where the descendents of Siskert were and if they had read this outrage. Ms Cornwell has no proof that Siskert was deformed in any way other that he had surgeries as a child, or, that he witnessed any of the Ripper's victims. This book would have been better had it been turned into a mystery novel instead. This is a slow read; this books' only redeeming value are intriguing insights into Victorian England's society and culture."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell, noted novelist, takes a crack at solving just who Jack the Ripper was. Her pick is Walter Sickert, an artist/actor that had an alleged penile deformity. By page six, Cornwell is saying Sickert is the Ripper, by page ten she full out states he is. Good for her but after reading the book, I'm not in the slightest convinced it was Sickert. It seems that her interest was raised when she was in London and was on a tour when D.A.C. John Grieve tells her to check out an interesting chap named Walter Sickert. In the paragraphs prior to this (pg 10) she admits having never read anything on the Ripper, known about his crimes & victims, or anything about him yet she can state she is 100% certain Sickert is Jack the Ripper now. Had Mr. Grieve not mentioned Sickert, would she have ever have heard of him?It looks as though Ms Cornwell was given a suspect and then at her own expense made the suspect fit the crime. She does this by forcing herself to read more into his dreary paintings and drawings than is really there. The samples she uses for comparison of Sickert's doodles and alleged Ripper doodles bear little resemblance to each other. Her mtDNA tests are weak to the point of being useless and that's not counting the viable contaminants of over a 100 years. Cornwell won't accept that any of the alleged Ripper letters sent to Scotland Yard or London Police were faked by others. Then there's a repeated argument of hers is that while someone couldn't prove Sickert was there/doing this, no one can prove he wasn't there/doing that. Pretty shoddy \\"evidence\\" if you ask me. She does a nice job on descriptions on 1880s life but she got sidetracked an awful lot with seemingly unimportant items/people. She does virtually nothing to eliminate other prime suspects (not even touching on a few of the more serious contenders) as she convinced herself Sickert was the man. Rather than look at the evidence and suspects and slowly eliminating them, she seems to do her research backwards, starting at the end and making the evidence come to that conclusion. She then tries to attribute murders after the Ripper 'disappeared' to the Ripper/Sickert saying that he decided to up his ante and began mutilating and now dismembering the victims even more than before, but he just quit sending letters to the police.This is a point of history where there is a 99.9% chance that we will never know who Jack the Ripper was. Cornwell's synopsis and jumpy timelines do little to 'close the case' by pointing at Sickert. I'd sooner believe that it may have been the William Stewart proposed \\"Jill the Ripper\\" before I would put my wager on Sickert.All in all, it's worth the read to anyone interested in studying Jack the Ripper, but Cornwell's evidence is so forced and stretched beyond reasoning. Again, she seemed to be given a suspect and using a literary prybar, tried to make him fit into the conformity of Jack the Ripper. But then if I had spent an alleged $6 million dollars of my own money, I'd be pretty conviced too."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I would love to see the evidence and Ms. Cornwell's theory written by a better non-fiction writer. Unfortunately, a good theory is destroyed by overstating it's certainty, &quot;backing it up&quot; with innuendo and conjecture, and presenting it in a haphazardly written structure that is neither chronological nor logical. I think that there is a very good chance she has the solution to the mystery. She also brings a fresh modern criminally educated perspective on the case and makes numerous excellent observations - such as the content and tone of the Ripper letters is more important than the handwriting. But this book is so poorly organized that by the middle you really feel that she &quot;has it in for this guy&quot; and has gone way outside the bounds of solid detective work; that she would be capable of manufacturing additional evidence, as required. A better and more logical outline would have presented her findings in a way that would have made them more relevant and convincing. I confess that I have never read one of her novels, but am confident that she has a lot to learn about writing non-fiction."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Who'd have thought it was possible to write a boring book about Jack the Ripper?Tedium aside, none of Cornwell's &quot;evidence&quot; comes close to establishing that Sickert was the killer. She writes that the fact that one letter attributed to Jack the Ripper appear similar to Sickert's handwriting is proof they were written the same man. Of course, the fact that even more of the letters show no resemblence is also proof; she claims Sickert probably used his artist's training to disguise his handwriting. Logically, the most this establishes is that Sickert *might* have been one of the dozens of cranks who sent in letters. Even a spurious Ripper letter found in a bottle is laid at Sickert's doorstep, since he was fond of visiting France and he could have tossed the bottle into the ocean. (Cornwell doesn't let herself be bothered by the fact that Sickert was out of the country for at least two of the murders: she argues that there's no way to prove that he couldn't have slipped back into London without being missed in France.)The most laughable bit of proof is her contention that since Sickert and the Ripper both enjoyed sending telegrams - while, of course, being unable to prove the Ripper did, in fact, enjoy sending telegrams. Conan Doyle and Mark Twain (along with half the population at that time - it was the 19th century version of making a phone call, for crying out loud) also sent a great number of telegrams. Has Cornwell bothered to exclude them as well?The bottom line is this: Cornwell decided that she disliked Sickert so he must have been the killer. That's it. She twisted and stretched every scanty shred of evidence that might point to Sickert, and blithely dismissed everything pointing away from him. I doubt there was a single page without a &quot;possibly,&quot; or a &quot;could have&quot; or a &quot;some experts believe.&quot; It's full of shoddy research, and shoddy science, and shoddy writing. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I think her presentation of the facts was fair. She always let the reader know when she was theorizing, and the evidence presented was compelling. She consults with experts when needed to support her conclusions.The information was fascinating to me, although she does seem to wander a bit in her presentation, especially in the last few chapters.Her evidence wouldn't prove his guilt in a court of law, but Cornwell wasn't attempting to do that. All the witnesses are dead, and much of the evidence has disappeared. She does however, build a strong circumstantial case against Sickert, and the facts do point strongly to him. People ARE convicted on circumstantial evidence if the overall weight of the evidence is overwhelming. Do I think Walter Sickert is the Ripper? Probably...but &quot;case closed&quot; is a little too optimistic. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Read this as pulp fiction and maybe it will work for you.

Less risky than contemporay cases. No lawsuits.This book has been savaged by every knowledgeable reviewer, in particular those with knowledge of the REAL world of forensics and the history of the case.

Wrong, although there's no evidence that he is the Ripper. She boasts of ignoring evidence and creates her own speculative material.Cornwell boasts of the work by the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine. Which tends to support her writing and that has blurbs on its website about the woman who solved the Ripper crimes. Except ... while the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine exists, it's Patricia Cornwell's money, deductible from her taxes of course that paid for it. Her money buys criminal science to the extent there is any in this book.Ms. Cornwell likes to talk about her days in the Medical Examiner's office in Richmond and \\"hundreds of autopsies\\" but does not talk about what she did. She was apparently clerical staff. NO one wants to talk about that now. She's given forensics some cache and helped build false expectations.Solved the Ripper case?

I have never come across so many examples of \\"may have\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"could have\\", \\"no reason why not\\" in a single book and, on this showing, I would hate to be on the receiving end of Patricia Cornwell's notion of \\"conclusive evidence\\"! However, more than the fact that the book is entirely unconvincing, it's extremely badly written and put together. In places it seems almost thrown together at random. In short, it's one of the worst books I've ever read: a complete waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This dismal tome is the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of reading. So disenchanted have I become with Ms. Cornwell through reading her disputatious novel regarding the dismasting of some disordered artist that I will likely never again read her disposable crime fiction. Most reviewers have noted the disorganized and repetitive nature of the book as well as the arrogant voice of the author. But as difficult as these significant barriers to crafting a readable book may be, worse is her overuse of disturbing violent, sexual and medical imagery which Cornwell evidently thinks can substitute for a compelling argument. A discerning reader will pass on this disagreeable little work."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is an absolutely infuriating book. I am not quite through reading it, and am not sure I'm going to be able to hang in there until the end. The only reason I've read as much as I have is that so much research has gone into it, and the results of that research is often fascinating. But the conclusions Cornwell draws are something else again. Any halfway competent historian would die of shame before writing such a book, and no decent member of the police would think it presents sufficient evidence for an arrest, much less a conviction.For example: A woman dies in Durham. There is a racecourse in Durham. Sickert loved racing. There is no proof that Sickert was not in Durham on the day in question. From all this, we are supposed to infer that Sickert, aka Jack the Ripper, murdered a woman in Durham. Give me a break! There is no reason to suppose the Sickert was in Durham and no reason to suppose that the presence of a racecourse had anything to do with the murder. The connection between all these little facts is only Cornwell's head.The entire book is like this, with isolated pieces of information put together in a way that suggests there is a connection when, in fact, there is no reason to suppose so. And much of what she writes assumes that the reader accepts (1) that Sickert had a genital deformity that rendered him impotent and (2) that many, and perhaps even most, of the so-called Ripper letters were written by the Ripper himself. The evidence is against her on both counts. For whatever reason, Cornwell made up her mind that Sickert was the Ripper, and when she couldn't find conclusive DNA evidence to support her view, organized all her other information in such a way as to convict him by innuendo."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The Whitechapel murders committed by Jack the Ripper in the autumn of 1888 have fascinated and repelled ever since. To the point now where it ranks with the Marie Celeste and The Bermuda triangle as one of the worlds most perplexing mysteries.According to the blurb, \\"Patricia Cornwell has applied the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation to the extant material\\". \\"An excellent idea\\" you might think, and you'd be right. But there are so many things wrong with this book that I hardly know where to start. Ms Cornwell takes as her hypothesis that the Impressionist artist Walter Richard Sickert was in fact the notorious serial killer who has become the stuff of modern nightmares and goes all out to prove it. As part of her evidence she presents Sickert's \\"Camden Town Murders\\" series of paintings, not as the artist exploring his obsession with the murder of a prostitute in Camden, around the corner from where Sickert was living at the time, but with the artist recalling (or perhaps gloating?) about the Ripper murders some twenty years earlier and maybe his part in them. She compares facial mutilation inflicted on Jack the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddows with the play of the light on the face of the woman in one of Sickert's paintings and uses this to claim that Sickert was drawing from memory.Well, I'm sorry Ms Cornwell, that horse just won't run! You're hypothesis falls down in several crucial areas,The Psycho-Sexual Serial Killers is indeed \\"Mr Nobody\\", excessively so! Killing is their only expressive outlet. Aesthetic young artists don't tend to turn to butchery in order to satisfy their needs in this regard, their art more than fulfills this.Sickert's use of prostitutes as models is also held up to scrutiny, but this was normal for artists of the impressionist school. Degas, Renoir, Manet and many of Sickert's contempories used prostitutes as models and not only them. Raphael painted his Madonna's from the prostitutes of Rome and the faces of Botticelli's angels are those of the rent boys of Quattro cento Florence.Ms Cornwell claims to have found DNA from one of the Ripper letters that can be matched to Sickert. But this sample was taken from a \\"Possible\\" Ripper letter, (opinion on its authenticity is divided) and not from the genuine articles in the black museum, which have been heat sealed, thus destroying any possibility (with current technology anyway) of obtaining a sample. Considering Sickert's prolific letter writing and collection of pseudonyms the possibility of him having written a hoax letter at the time can not be ruled outThe artist's alleged hatred of women is shown up in a letter he wrote to Jacques-Emile Blanche when he was painting nudes in Venice at the beginning of the twentieth century \\"From 9 to 4, it is an uninterrupted joy, caused by these pretty, little, obliging models who laugh and un-embarrassedly be themselves while posing like angels. They are glad to be there, and are not in a hurry.\\" This doesn't sound like a serial killer describing the objects of his desires, but rather like a normal man having fun.Ms Cornwell's assertion that Sickert was infertile is all but destroyed by the fact that Sickert almost certainly fathered a child by Mme. Augustine Villain a fishmonger he lived with during his time in Neuville.MS Cornwell states in this book that Sickert's paintings are clearly of the Ripper murders, but as with everything else, people see what they want to see. \\"Wolf Vanderlinden\\" in his excellent essay put this very well. \\"In The Camden Town Murder, also titled What Shall We Do For the Rent? (circa 1908). The painting is of a man sitting on the edge of a bed, eyes downcast. Behind him lies a naked woman. With the title The Camden Town Murder, the woman is obviously dead and the man is either her killer, filled with remorse, or her lover who has found the body and who sits in stunned mourning. Change to the alternate title - What Shall We Do For the Rent? - and now the picture is totally different. The man sits on the bed feeling the weight of his financial problems while his wife or girlfriend lies next to him, her hand gently resting on his knee, offering him some small, tender support\\"Ms Cornwell states that Walter Sickert always drew from life, things he'd seen and in that she'd absolutely right. Walter Sickert only painted subjects that he had seen or had seen photographs of, a subtle but significant difference. Photographs of Jack the Ripper's last two victims were published in France as far back as 1899 in a book about the crimes of Joseph Vacher, the so-called French Ripper. At that time Sickert was living in France and was fluent in the French language. Is it unreasonable to assume that Sickert, a true crime buff from his boyhood could have owned or seen a copy of that book in the 6 years between it's publication and the painting of the first of the \\"Camden Town Murders\\" series that Ms Cornwell bases so much of her theory on?I suppose that the central problem with this book is that the author has made up her mind before she boots up her word processor and spends the book trying to convince the reader that she's right rather than weighing up the evidence and exploring any possible alternatives."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What an almost complete waste of time! I say &quot;almost&quot; because I try to always find something good in everything. There was some interesting research about the history of policing in England and tidbits about paper manufacturing and handwriting analysis. However, if Ms. Cornwell had chosen to write this book as historic fiction and used one of her own characters as the investigator on the case then she might have been able to create something entertaining and worthwile. She then could have taken poetic license and beefed up some of her so-called evidence. Perhaps she could have had her protagonist find evidence in Inspector Abberline's &quot;diary&quot; or the Ripper's scrapbook. Instead she has served up nothing but sheer speculation and far-fetched hypotheses. All of her theories hinge on so many other possibilities that the case against her suspect tumbles like a house of cards. I have read many Jack the Ripper theories and I must say that most of them, although easily disproven, have been more interesting and plausible than Cornwell's unsubstantiated accusations. She backs up none of her &quot;facts&quot; with anything concrete, but has the hubris to claim that she has come up with the definitive solution. I'm especially irked by comments in which she says things like, &quot;I wouldn't dare claim that these letters were written by Sickert or even Jack the Ripper,&quot; and then in subsequent paragraphs she states, &quot;Clearly, the Ripper had a mixture of A Pirie batches (of paper) when he wrote these November 22nd letters...&quot; That sounds to me like she's certain that those particular letters were indeed written by the Ripper. Throughout the entire loathesome book she does things like this and I found it more and more frustrating with every page that I turned. And yet I'd kept on reading because I kept hoping that she'd actually present some facts that would knock my socks off, but it didn't happen. Stick with fiction, Pat. Your story has more holes in it than a middle-aged, alcoholic unfortunate's worn out cotton knickers."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I agree with most critics that the case Cornwell presents is less definitive than she wants us to believe. But I still find it convincing. The fact that Sickert's letter's mitochondrial DNA matches that on the Ripper's letter is a stunning piece of evidence. Even if the match still leaves .01-10% of the population that can't be excluded, it narrows the field of suspects dramatically. The Ripper used expensive paper and artists' supplies for some of his writings. Sickert titled a painting of his own bedroom \\"Jack the Ripper's bedroom\\". (Yes, I know the story that his landlady supposedly told him that a previous tenant was the Ripper, but that explanation can't be verified and seems like a very suspicious coincidence). He painted scenes of violence against women. He was appallingly insensitive and selfish to those closest to him. His sketches look very similar to many Ripper sketches. These are just a FEW of the many \\"coincidences\\" Cornwell cites. Yes, none of these are convincing in isolation, but when you put them all together the case against Sickert becomes very strong. As for the many reasons that have been cited to \\"prove\\" Sickert could not have been the Ripper, most of them are pure opinion (such as saying that certain Ripper letters that had Sickert-type DNA are hoaxes). If the Ripper had the artistic talent Cornwell asserts, it would've been easy enough for him to fake his handwriting and use many different styles of writing to confuse. One reason the Ripper was never caught was that no one of that class-conscious era could fathom an upper class, attractive, charming man committing such heinous crimes. Perhaps some of Cornwell's critics are letting their own snobbery get in the way of their common sense.However, I do take issue with Cornwell's style. She jumps around chronologically in a confusing way, intersperses her biographical data with opinions and asides on forensics, cites facts and opinions without having laid the groundwork to help the reader understand them, and just generally does not organize the book very well. It seems hastily thrown together. I was particularly disappointed that she did not explain how or why she eliminated other suspects, and how she became so convinced that Sickert was the murderer that she subtitled the book \\"case closed\\"."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'll make this short and to the point.

The book was a chore to read through - it seemed to jump from one thing to another - it didn't have a good flow to it. And so much of her &quot;evidence&quot; was extremely speculative. She even states over and over in the book that either she has &quot;no way of knowing&quot; or &quot;can't prove&quot; various things, but justifies her view point that she can't prove otherwise either. If she proved anything, she may have found that Sickert wrote some of the letters, letters which many experts dismiss as hoaxes. It seems from this she tries to take various items from Jack the Ripper and create a link to Sickert, links that could be drawn to probably almost anyone. If Cornwell was a prosecutor in this case, Sickert would certainly be found &quot;not guilty&quot;.

It is obvious from her book and the numerous specials that I have seen. However, the known facts of the Ripper murders still do not bear out Walter Sickert, her choice for the killer.

Precise removal of internal organs dictates that Jack the Ripper must have had some medical knowledge.While DNA and other modern forensic tests were used, they were largely inconclusive (due to the destruction of proteins etc over time and the over handling or restoration/preservation treatment of evidence), which does not keep the publisher from mentioning them on the blurb, as if they formed the \\"smoking gun,\\" as it were.I believe that Ms. Cornwell saw Sickert's paintings and was so horrified by them that she pre-concluded his guilt. (An understandable bias to be sure, but still a bias.) Considering the fact that the paintings in question all used the same perspective as the evidence photographs which they so closely resemble, Occam's razor states that Sickert must have seen them. Otherwise, it is simply too far-fetched for me to believe that the killer and the police photographer chose the same angles of aspect. If the paintings were indeed done by the killer, they should have had a more intimate appearance--something that only the killer could have done.She did prove that Sickert had an avid interest in the Ripper murders, however, interest in the Ripper murders does not a killer make. (I, after all, am interested and I have never killed anything bigger than a mosquito. It was self defense, as well, and I promise that it brought me no joy.) Is it possible that Sickert committed later murders after the Ripper style, as Ms Cornwell suggests? Absolutely. Copy cat serial killings go on all the time.For a better, less biased approach to Jack the Ripper, I direct the reader to _The Complete History of Jack the Ripper_ by Phillip Sudgen.If anything, Ms Cornwell is only capable of building a circumstantial case against Walter Sickert. While this may have caused his conviction and death via the laws and mores of the time, I believe that the wrong man would have been hanged. I also believe that she owes the surviving relatives of Mr. Sickert a sincere and heart-felt apology.Ms. Cornwell (or anyone else, for that matter) is free to email me if she wishes to discuss these or any other matters.

There is no organization to this work and Cornwell takes off on tangents that I believe she thought were pertinent to the case of the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders. Those tangents offered very little to this opinionated and arrogant work.The first 1/4 of the book could be called \\"The Life and Times of Walter Sickert\\". She goes into every little detail about his life and spends an incredible amount of time on his genital problems. Granted, serial killers often have some sort of problem. Often the problem is sexual in nature, but later between pages 80 to 90, she tells the reader that she \\"can't say for sure\\" or \\"I can't state as a fact...\\" of what type of genital deformity he had, although she does list two possibilities. Cornwell couldn't say what type of surgery he received or whether anesthesia was used.In Chapter 11, pages 147 and 148, Cornwell goes so far to try to connect two of Sickerts paintings: \\"Two Studies of a Venetian Woman's Head\\" and \\"Nuit d' Ete'\\", to the Mary Ann Nichols murder because Nichols was murdered on a Summer night. \\"Nuit d' Ete'\\" means \\"summer night\\".How can I take this book seriously when Cornwell makes such rediculous assertions? How can I take this book seriously when she tells her literary agent, Esther Newberg, that she doesn't want to finish the book and the following dialogue is recorded?\\"'Well, you know,' she said very calmly as she resumed her pace. 'you don't have to do it. I can get you out of it.'She could have gotten me out of it, but I could never have gotten myself out of it. I knew the identity of a murderer and I couldn't possibly avert my gaze. 'I am suddenly in position of judgment,' I told Ester. 'It doesn't matter if he's dead. Every now and then this small voice asks me, what if you're wrong? I would never forgive myself for saying such a thing about somebody, and then finding out I'm wrong.''But you don't believe you're wrong...''No. Because I'm not.' I said.\\" (Chapter 2, pages 10 and 11)The above dialogue made me want to gag.Cornwell has made it clear who she believes is \\"Jack\\". On pages 15 and 16, she discusses the \\"stamp\\" DNA evidence. I may be wrong, but if the sample is still useful, why can't they take the DNA and match it to Sickert's mother through mitochondrial DNA? Cornwell asserts that; \\"The best result came from a 'Ripper' letter that yielded a single-donor mitochrondrial DNA sequence, specific enough to eliminate 99% of the population as the person who licked and touched the adhesive backing of that stamp.\\"Cornwell asserts that the Sickert Trust has no authority over the bodies of Sickert's family and the authorities know where Sickert's mother and sister are buried. That would clear or convict one of the suspects.I have one other problem with the book and that is Cornwell's insistance that the police of that period were incompetent or ignorant. That is insulting to the police who, if Cornwell would check her history, had just developed several procedures that are common place in today's forensic research. Those procedures were not widely known or used. If Cornwell wishes to reopen the investigation, great, but not to throw rocks in glass houses. She might begin by reorganizing her book into a readable format, because this book reads like the 1st draft of an English paper that was turned in as the final draft."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The tendency, of course, when trying to prove any theory is to talk endlessly about the circumstances that prove your case -- ignoring the ones that don't.Although there are exceptions, the majority of the time it does not appear to me that Cornwell is doing this.Instead, it seems that she tries to cover all bases by comparing and constrasting evidence and theories.Conwell appears truly passionate about discovering the Ripper secrets as well as sustaining her reputation.I believe that she would have insisted the project be abandoned -- rather than slyly salvaged -- had she found evidence that caused her case to fall.Theories others have proposed regarding the Ripper are discussed and, many times, shown to be false by constrasting evidence she has found.Other theories seem validly disproven based on her personal conclusions.In my opinion she does not so much drive a &quot;look I solved it&quot; idea down your throat -- but instead passionately supports her theories with bits of fact, new evidence and well-thought out theories.It seems clear that if this evidence had been presented to London Police in the Ripper's time -- Sickert would have been arrested and tried for many, if not all, of the murders.In addition to all the Ripper evidence and theories provided, Conwell paints a thorough and precise picture of London during the Ripper era. Through this information she puts the reader at at the scene of the crimes, and examines how people lived, the political structure, and medical conditions that affected the entire scheme of the Ripper investigation.Her theories, forensic knowledge, and storytelling techique all fuse together wonderfully to make a compelling read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you are looking for a typical Patricia Cornwell thriller....this is NOT it. The book is a little dry at times and hard to stick with. However, in the end, I was glad that I stuck with it and read the entire book. I have to give her credit for doing what I would call a thorough biography of Walter Sickert which includes much British history. Also, if you are interested in reading detailed descriptions and forensic theories of the Ripper murders then you've found a good book. For those who enjoy forensic analysis....this book delivers. Bottom line is that I didn't feel convinced that the murders where solved. I totally agree that the circumstantial evidence is compelling and I really wanted to believe that Sickert was the murderer. I know that Cornwell is convinced that he's the killer. I just don't see enough hard evidence to convince me. I believe that there was not sufficient detective work done back then and a lot of their work was down right shoddy. Obviously the technology and procedures were not developed yet...so some of the mistakes were not their fault. In addition, many of the reports that were done do not exist now making it very difficult to do a thorough review of the case. I just don't agree that the &quot;case is closed&quot; as the book suggests. I don't think the case will ever be closed....unless we could go back in time knowing what we know now and reinvestigate the case from scratch as it happened. It does bother me that someone (possibly Sickert?) got away with such sickness...I just don't think that this book proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels and can't wait for the next. I just wish Patricia Cornwell had used her considerable talent writing a new Scarpetta instead of this book. I have just started reading Case Closed and already have noticed some glaring errors. In the first chapter she mentions the Duke of Edinburgh birthday. I think she means the Prince of Wales as the title &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; was created for Prince Phillip. Also she claims the first victim of Jack The Ripper to be Martha Tabran. Every other Ripper book lists this woman as Tabram. These are just two examples of sloppy research and I've only read three chapters. All the money spent on the research for this book and she couldn't hire a fact checker?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I just finished an advance of this book and, despite the circumstancial case Cornwell makes for Sickert being the Ripper, she doesn't address one key issue that keeps nagging at me. Throughout the study, Cornwell points to Walter Sickert's true guilt manifesting itself through the graphic depictions within his art, particularly the physical similarities between the prostitutes' mutilated bodies and his disfigured portraits of women. There are other interesting points to her thesis, such as a watermark on stationary (no distribution figures are offered nor is there any indication of the stationary's popularity) and a partial mitochondrial DNA match taken from a stamp (the researchers admit to the latter being potentially coincidental given the number of DNA combinations present). First off, I'm no Cornwell debunker or Sickert scholar so I could really care less who's right or wrong over this one, although I admit the book's subtitle \\"Case Closed\\" is misleading to say the least. But I DO know my rare books. And I know that a book by Alexandre Lacassagne entitled \\"Vacher l'&eacute;ventreur et les crimes sadiques\\" was published in Paris in 1899, just one year after Sickert moved there to live and about six years before his \\"Ripper\\" paintings began to appear. Anyway, Lacassagne's work was a somewhat sensationalist book detailing the case of Joseph Vacher, a frenchman convicted and put to death in 1898 for the rape and murder of at least eleven women near Tournon. In one of the text's appendices, there is a chapter dealing with similar sadistic crimes, one of which is the Whitechapel/ Jack the Ripper killings. The crucial point is this: Lacassagne's book contains the first published photographs of two of the Ripper's victims: the gruesome bedroom photo of Mary Kelly and the morgue photo of Catherine Eddowes. Cornwell reiterates the point made by several prior researchers, that the photos did not appear in print until 1972 but this is not true. And this book is published in Paris exactly one year after Sickert arrives, a man who is profiled--by Cornwell and others--as being fascinated by criminality and sensationalism. Given the horrible impact of these photos, that can turn your stomach 100 years later, isn't it conceivable that these would have been distributed and possibly reprinted in various sources, especially Parisian newspapers and periodicals? How could they not be? Even more striking is the fact that these are the EXACT two killings that Cornwell points to again and again as evidence of his guilt in his art. Does she not find it odd that the Sickert paintings often contain the same angle and viewpoint of the victim as the crime-scene photos, i.e. the slanted right profile of Eddowes and the left side of the bed for Mary Kelly? Added to this is the fact, admitted in the book, that Sickert often worked from photographs or recollections of photographs. Sorry, but the fact that they failed to even acknowledge that photos of the crime scenes were published and circulated seventy years before the date quoted (1972) makes me wonder what else they overlooked and/or suppressed. One has to wonder.What's more, it's downright embarrassing how ignorant Cornwell appears to be with regard to the trends and common practices of 19th century art and artists. If you're going to form your central thesis around the notion of \\"violent art = violent artist\\", then surely Goya MUST be guilty of dismemberment (\\"This Is Worse\\") and eating his own children (\\"Saturn\\") and likewise, even Cornwell herself MUST be guilty of murdering the real-life equivalents of those in her novels. Sickert, an arrogant misogynist? Yes. Jack the Ripper? Perhaps . . . but just perhaps.Still, an entertaining read. Just read it critically."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have never read any other Patricia Cornwell book and doubt if I will do so. Even if Walter Sickert really was Jack the Ripper, I'd have to acquit him if Patricia Cornwell was the prosecuting attorney in his trial; she does not prove her case so much as hammer her preconceived notions into your head with a truncheon. Ms. Cornwell has intense dislike for Walter Sickert. This is not surprising, since Sickert does not seem to have been a good man; he was a bad husband and an eccentric who did not paint pretty models.Cornwall's statement that Sickert was the Ripper is stated at least once in every chapter. She rules out all other suspects and vows to 'clear their names'. The theory that Sickert painted his victims is intruiging but Cornwell has very little actual evidence tying Sickert to the murders. He liked to walk around the East End and go to music halls. Therefore he 'could have' met the Ripper's victims. And every murder committed in the British Isles at that time was the work of the Ripper, or Sickert. No one else in the country appears to have been a psychopath, despite Cornwell's assertion that 4% of the population is psychopathic.All extant 'Ripper letters' are accepted as genuine by Ms. Cornwell. I can't believe that none of them were written by cranks and wannabees who claimed then, as they do now, to be the perpetrators of the latest atrocity. The handwriting in the letters varies? Cornwell's answer: Sickert disguised his handwriting. No evidence of Sickert having a talent for this art is ever offered. It is all conjecture. That is the nicer word. The use of artists' materials to write some of the letters is her one solid piece of evidence. How about a chemical analysis of the 'etching ground' found on a Ripper letter with one of Sickert's etchings?Cornwell pads the length of the book by wandering off on tangents to give the reader histories of the Bertillon system, or a digression on papermaking and watermarks. Some of the paper in the Ripper letters matches some paper Sickert used. Are we to believe that the papermakers only sold materials to one person in the city of London? We are told that Sickert was so good at disguising himself that he went unrecognized by his own family when a child. This is mentioned once then never referred to again, though it would seem to be a matter that is worth investigating. But we only have Cornwell's assertion that this is the case; there are no footnotes.The most specious associations are important to Ms. Cornwell. Is it really significant that a painted sun in one of Sickert's paintings from 1932 \\"is almost identical to the one etched in glass over the front door\\" of a pub where a murdered woman 'usually' could be found in 1907? This is twisting the arm of coincidence until it dislocates. Or bending facts to suit your theories.Sickert kept 'bolt holes' to which he would remove at a moment's notice, telling no one where he was going, and was excellent at disguising himself. This description would apply eually well to the fictional character Sherlock Holmes. I wonder why Ms. Cornwell hasn't investigated any ties between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Walter Sickert? This would be about as significant as some of the other associations in this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If the system allowed, I would give this book zero stars, but I guess I could consider the mandatory one star for spelling, the only redeeming factor in this book. And what makes this book even worse is that the author, Patricia Cornwell, has proven many times over that she can do better. After all, she is a respected, very popular mystery writer. However, there is no mystery in this book. On page two she names her suspected Jack the Ripper to be Walter Richard Sickert, a fairly famous English impressionist/modernist artist who died in 1942. Today his works hang in many museums, galleries, and private collections. Sickert has long been suspected by many to be involved in the Ripper crimes. In fact, it was a Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard who suggested Sickert to Cornwell during a tour of the Yard. In 1976, Stephen Knight's \\"Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution\\" says Sickert was an accomplice in the Ripper murders. In 1990, Jean Overton Fuller states in \\"Sickert and the Ripper Crimes\\" that Sickert was the Ripper not just an accomplice. So, Cornwell is rehashing old theories, theories that have been debunked by criminologists who have made a career of studying Ripper. And she does it badly. There is no organization to this book. It is as if her publisher said the book is due next week, so she typed up her notes as she had compiled them haphazardly and submitted that as her manuscript. There is no beginning, middle, or end, just a hodgepodge of unconnected material. It would have been much better if she had described her search for the killer (without predetermining who the killer was and setting out to make the facts fit the crime) and then taken us with her as her case developed. When you boil it down, her proof lies in similar handwritings from Sickert and Ripper letters (although she admits she doesn't know which of the latter are real or bogus), watermarks on some known Sickert stationary that matches the Ripper letters (yet she admits the watermarks were common), and the fact that Sickert may have had a deformed (...) which would have prohibited sexual relations. (But she can't prove that this deformity actually existed. In fact, she once says he may have fathered a child.) Constantly she backs her case with statements such as \\"I can't prove Sickert was there...but I can't prove he wasn't, either \\" or \\"I can't prove Sickert did this...but I can't prove he didn't.\\" She talks about similarities in handwriting, yet there is a point criteria that is a legal requirement and she never uses it to back her accusations. I suspect it is because the documents wouldn't pass the test. Often she goes on a several page diatribe about the lack of scientific analysis at the time of the Ripper murders. That's the way it was, get over it already. If Ms. Cornwell had taken her so-called proof to any district attorney, he would refuse to take it to a grand jury. It doesn't stand up. Don't waste your money on this book. Buy one of her fine Dr. Kay Scarpetta books instead."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell's sad hypothesis, is based on her opinion of CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, that is poorly written and in no apparent chronological order. While the 110-years of contaminated DNA samples on Ripper letters may match Sickert's DNA, Thousands of PRANKSTERS whote Ripper letters back then. That doesn't make Sickert a killer. There are way too many references to \\"maybe he did\\" then again \\"maybe he didn't\\". But the worst part is it just dragged on and on and then ended quite abruptly. This author, Patricia Cornwell needs to stick to fiction novels. If you're a Cornwell fan and this review offends you, sorry 'bout your luck; I simply refuse to give a good review to this book based on it's lack of facts and sloppy investigative practices. There are no FACTS in this book... just garbage.If you simply must have this book, save yourself some money and buy it from the used section for one penny. The \\"resale\\" value of this book says it all. ONE PENNY! Ha ha!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm amazed at the number of negative reviews that readers have posted. The most common criticisms are that all the evidence Cornwell presents to connect the Ripper to Sickert is &quot;circumstantial,&quot; and that the book is disorganized, and that it ends abruptly. Each of these criticisms is inaccurate.To begin with, the Ripper murders occurred over a century ago. Without a time machine and a video camera, all evidence discovered will be by its very nature circumstantial. Most criminals nowadays are convicted on circumstantial evidence. This being the case, Cornwell does an excellent job in presenting the common characteristics of serial killers in general and the Ripper in particular, and showing how Sickert's history and life-patterns overlap.As for being 'disorganized,' the book follows chronologically from the first to the last murders. The narrative often goes on tangents to flesh out the details of 19th Century London, but these are some of the chief pleasures of the book. Cornwell's research was exhaustive, and the fruits of that research are remarkably detailed and clearly presented.Lastly, the book does have an abrupt end, but this is merely because the conclusion -- the final summarization of evidence and what it all means -- is put at the beginning of the book. It is the first chapter, and provides a 'road map' for all that follows. This may strike some readers as unusual, but it is a device used for clarity in all legal writing, and is completely appropriate for a non-fiction work.In short, my wife and I truly enjoyed this book, and encourage all who are interested to read it. I would like to add that whether you agree with Cornwell's conclusions or not, she has done something that no one else has: switched the focus from the Ripper -- a cypher if ever there was one -- to his victims. Her sympathetic portrayal of the women who died so terribly is an admirable tribute to the victims, and a condemnation of the (often glorified) Victorian Age."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Can anyone say &quot;redundant?&quot; Do publishers no longer employ editors? This book is a excellent 25-page paper crammed into a 300-page book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When I heard that the author spent a bit of a personal fortune researching this novel using modern forensic science, which included DNA testing, and investigative techniques I thought that after a 114 years the case might actually be solved. Boy, was I wrong. The problems that relate to this author's investigation are: the case files are 114 years old and after all these years so many have critical documents [like original autopsy reports] are missing, there isn't any physical crime scene evidence or physical evidence from bodies (like blood samples, hair fibers) to prove anything conclusively, and while it is true that an envelope does have the ripper's fingerprints there aren't any prints from the author's suspect, the german artist Walter Sickert, to compare against for a positive match. The DNA testing does provide the possibility that the ripper could have been Sickert, but fails to prove anything else otherwise conclusively. All the author really has to go on is handed down second hand accounts of Sickert (friends and relatives memoirs) and the ripper letters. The problem with the accounts is people's memories can be fallable; a group of people can all experience the same scenario and write down their thoughts afterwards and there's a good chance that all of them will remember something differently. People will add details, leave details out, or modify details when writing memoirs. The author does prove somewhat that Sickert could have been the author of the ripper letters, but she even fails to do this conclusively. I only have a 65-70% conviction that Sickert wrote those letters and in the end the argument &quot;just because he wrote the letters doesn't make him the murderer&quot; prevails. Some people believe that in fact the ripper didn't write any of the letters and all were hoaxes. It is possible that people who were witnesses to the crime scenes and gawking at the bodies could have pranked the police with the letters trying to take credit for the killer's work. It sounds absurd, but if you take it into consideration then the author doesn't have anything at all to argue her case. With a lack of any physical evidence (aside from the ripper letters and the memoirs) the author doesn't have any backing of empirical evidence to prove her case. In the end you have a book constrewd of nothing but inconclusive and purely speculative theorizing. Don't bother reading this book because the case is not solved (it probably never will be) and the mystery lives on..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and have read all her fiction books, but this book was a disappointment. While the title promised that the Jack the Ripper is now &quot;case closed&quot; the &quot;evidence&quot; presented in this book is hardly convincing. Perhaps worth reading if you are interested in a description of the Ripper murders or to get a sense of what life was like for the poorer classes in London in the 1880's."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have been interested in the Jack the Ripper case for some time, so I was anxious to read this book. It just wasn't as good as I had hoped. I had never heard of Sickert before I read this book, so I had no preconceived notions. I have no trouble believing that he wrote many of the Ripper letters and that he was mentally unstable. Patricia Cornwell almost had me believing that he might be Jack the Ripper. I was startled and confused by the abrupt end of the book. I was expecting her to tie up all the evidence in a nice neat package and she just stopped at the funeral of Sickert's second wife. I needed more to convince me. I was disappointed, as the other readers, at the way Cornwell skipped around. At one point I had to turn back several chapters to see if I was confused about a date. I still am not sure!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I think the main problem with this book is the title doesn't work for the content. There isn't enough &quot;proof&quot; to say this case is closed - just my opinion. I admire the author's tenacity and research - and some of Sickert's paintings do illustrate a certain &quot;chill.&quot; Creatives often can't help weaving current events into their works - whether consciously or not. This could very well be the case with Sickert - these murders may have been resting in his subconscious, and finding there way into his paintings. Who knows? The handwriting analysis may be the most convincing piece of evidence but it's acknowledged that many letters and decoys were sent to officials. Great read, stirring and peaked my curiousity, but I don't know this case can be &quot;officially&quot; closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The first half of this book was difficult to get through. It was like reading a college textbook. But, once the scene was set, and the characters were introduced, the pace picked up to the point where it read like fiction. I'm sure some people would say it IS fiction. As I read this book, I thought the author was really making leaps of faith to prove her point. But, as the book moved on, I couldn't help but agree with her conclusion. There is just too much evidence (circumstantial or not) to disagree with Cornwell. All right, maybe it wouldn't fly in court, as OJ learned, but I think Sickert did it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell presents a well researched book, attempting to solve murders that occured over 120 years ago. Given the time that has passed, her evidence is pretty shaky, and she makes some conclusions that are reaching, to say the least. However, because she offers evidence exonerating other popular suspects, in the end, I don't see any more plausible conclusion."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have been a fan of Cornwell's for a long time, although I have dispaired of late how far the quality of the Scarpetta novels has fallen from the earlier books. Still I respect her forensic knowledge and was looking forward to this book.It doesn't quite live up to its promise. While Cornwell makes a very interesting case against her suspect, in a modern court she could maybe get an arrest warrant but would by no means be assured a conviction. I concede that given the gap of time and the lack of DNA evidence from her long-since cremated suspect, perhaps no one could do better - but where in the beginning of the book she seems to acknowledge those shortcomings, by the end of the book she is speaking to the reader as though the case is closed, when all she has done is given you (however compelling) circumstantial evidence. She also blatantly refuses to address the cases against several other suspects that have persisted through time, but with a case as lacking in &quot;the smoking gun&quot; as hers is, she would have been more persuasive if she'd spent more time examining how she ruled out these other men.Be forewarned that there are a lot of gruesome and graphic details which - while facinating and certainly not gratuitous - are tough to read. Not more gory than one of her Scarpetta novels, just perhaps more difficult to stomach because they aren't fictional.Still, despite these reservations, I would say that anyone who has a deep interest in Jack the Ripper shouldn't neglect this book - some of the theories and factual details presented are very persuasive, and coupled with other sources of information I'd think this book would have a useful place in any study of that subject."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for a long time. Kay Scarpetta is a really a great character for her novels.This book was really different for her. It was hard to get into this novel. Unlike her others you knew it wasn't true but you read it anyway. I expected this novel to be somewhat in the same format as her others, knowing this was supposed to be somewhat factual.Although Cornwell had many facts on this Sickert person alot of the evidence against him were circumstancial. This seems to be more of her theories than actual proof.I somewhat liked this novel because the history was interesting, but disappointed because there's still doubt on whether he was the true &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. I think there needs to be more investigating to be done. Maybe some day we'll find out, very doubtful though.Thank you Patricia for a facinating theory. You are still one of my number one fan."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I remember studying Jack The Ripper in high school, and I never took much of an interest in the case. To be frank, the only reason the case endured for so long is because of the brutality of the killings, and the fact that the killer was never caught. It seems that when less is known, the more people are interested. This book is perhaps the most detailed account I have read so far, and definitely the one with the most opinionated narrative.Patricia Cromwell has dedicated much of her time to researching the Jack The Ripper killings, and has drawn her conclusions in this book. She makes some interesting points, like the DNA sample from an envelope, as well as attempting to debunk popular beliefs (like the copycat ripper letters). But being a natural skeptic, I am not wholly convinced of her findings. She presents a lot of theories, a few conincidences, and a big conspiracy reaching to top levels of government. I won't spoil it, but it makes for some interesting brain candy. However, much of her research reveals nothing that has not been said before. A BBC documentary made in the early 80's drew similar conclusions. Don't expect any revelations while reading \\"Portrait of a Killer\\".Patricia Cromwell is a good author, and I have enjoyed her other writings. \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is well written, easy to follow, and engaging. But it didn't set my mind on fire like I hoped it would. While it is Cromwell's opinion and research that is the basis for the book, and it has sold well based on hype alone, she has not really \\"solved\\" the case. Good mainly for a casual read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's recently released Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper Case Closed claims to have brought closure to the century old Jack the Ripper murders. She stakes her claim on the innumerable number of \\"coincidences\\" tying Jack the Ripper to Walter Sickert, a famous British painter. She applies modern forensics, psychological profiling, and DNA sampling to once and for all resolve the identity of Whitechapel's infamous butcher.Throughout the book, Cornwell's talents as a best-selling fiction writer are evident. Her descriptions of 19th century culture and forensic technology are extraordinarily vivid, with a rich, story-like detail throughout. Biographical sketches, the biting taunts of the Ripper letters, and eye-witness accounts are impressively presented and bring to life the circumstances surrounding the crimes. But little is offered that will supplant a host of other theories on the actual identity of Ripper. Cornwell's logic is faulty and at times self-contradicting. Oversights are common and alternative scenarios that point away from Sickert are either unmentioned or ignored. Contrary evidence is manipulated until it somehow points back to Sickert, and the validity of every point hinges on a profane number of conjectures and speculations, few of which are supported by a single scrap of evidence.A fuller analysis of the books problems can be found at my web site: ..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Every few years, theories pop up that are supposed to explain the identity of Jack The Ripper. I have little doubt that with modern criminal investigation methods, the identity could be discovered if the crimes were committed today. However, it seems Patricia Cornwell has molded the evidence to fit her suspect rather than letting the evidence lead to the suspect. Let's not be fooled by reviews, no DNA is available for comparisons since her primary suspect was cremated. The glue that holds the theory together seems to be, that if we believe that Jack the Ripper was a psychopath and we think Walter Sickert is Jack the Ripper THEN Walter Sickert must be a psychopath and capable of committing the atrocities and all behaviour that led to the acts. (Some of his) IMPRESSIONIST art portrays peripheral violence and suspicious characters in dark, dismal surroundings(Hmmm, I wonder what diabolical deeds Charles Addams can be accused of). Being constantly reminded that the suspect's whereabouts cannot be determined at many key periods; just leaves me to either accept the author's interpretation, or to scoff. I'm sorry to say that I scoff.BUT, what do I really know anyway. I guess it's possible that her theory could be DEAD ON TARGET (pardon the pun).The two stars that I give are for her vivid descriptions of not-so merry ol' England's dark underside and her numerous factual observations not her conclusions."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I loved this book. As someone with an avid interest in the &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; cases, I have seen and read many things on the topic and I am thouroughly convinced of Sickert's guilt. This was the first book I have read of Cornwell's and I thought it was great. The amount of information included - though graphic and sickening, was unbelievable. Cheers! Great read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ms. Cornwell's enthusiasm for detail, whether fictional or non fictional, is readable and almost poetic. The descriptions from which she attempts to sidestep are gruesome...but so thorough, one forgets she wasn't the coroner.Her case against Sickert is certainly one which should be continuously researched and considered. She convinced me!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There is no reasonable doubt that Cornwell has not reached an accurate conclusion. There is no smoking gun, no arrow pointing to someone wearing a shirt with \\"KILLER\\" written on it. This is a factual presentation of the evidence, including DNA evidence that is astonishing when one considers the age of this case.Mitochondrial DNA is not as conclusive as nuclear DNA. It will only eliminate 90-99% of the population. In a case that is 115 years old that, along with an amazing amount of physical evidence including handwriting samples, is good enough for me.This is reality, not Hollywood. There is no romaticized Ripper in a top hat and trenchcoat. There is no great conspiracy. Jack the Ripper was a serial killer. Serial Killers keep killing until they are caught. Sickert's crimes went on long after the initial five victims. Anyone who disagrees has seen way too many movies."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"To start with, this book is very good. It tells you who, when, and where the whole time. Cornwell always let you know what she was thinking and wrote her side of the story and never left anything out. If she was unsure, she would say she was. She never led me down the wrong track. I'm a big fan of her and so is my mother.This book had it all. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars is because she sometimes started talking in so much detail about something that I felt like I was in school again. It was a good read. I would suggest this book to adults, not children."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It is weird that I'm a fan of Ms Cornwell, yet I can't hardly stand to read her fiction novels now because she uses first person present tense. However, I've always wanted to read this book and since it is non-fiction, I didn't have to slog through an uncomfortable point of view.I've had a fascination with the Ripper for years and in 90, I was in London and visited Mitre Square, where Catherine Eddows body was found. I must say Whitechapel is a perfect place to find ghosts and Patricia paints a very colorful dreary and depressing image of what life was like there during the Ripper times. Excellent job there.The one thing that bugged me about the writing was that most of the paragraphs were about the same length. I don't know why I noticed that but it sure seemed like you could almost match word count from paragraph to paragraph, except in a few places. However, that was a minor problem.She did a good job of describing each murder and included some other similar murders that may or may not be connected to the \\"classic\\" Ripper murders. However, when she droned on and on about the various letters I had to really work to get through those chapters.She presents Sickert as a real piece of work, and though that may be true, she still doesn't really prove he did anything. Yes, he could be the ripper, and she makes some good arguments, but Sickert is no more likely to be Jack than a handful of other suspects.My conclusion? Who knows who the Ripper was?I enjoyed the read and it once again piqued my curiosity on the subject. I tried to contact her to ask if there were any more updates since she wrote it. However, I am on dial up and when I found her web site, it took 45 minutes to download the page and even then, none of the buttons had labels on them so I could not find a contact page, if there was one.With all that aside, I enjoyed Portrait of a Killer and highly recommend it to anyone curious about the Ripper. Just one thing, take it with as much of a grain of salt as all the other books out there on the subject!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell did such a first rate job at uncovering evidence and crime scene reports that were virtually lost and destroyed through the advent of two World Wars, and she even spent thousands of dollars out of her own pocket investigating this for us. It really miffs me when people degrade this novel, because she put so much into it. I believe she deserves credit, because she has delved deeper than anyone before her. And while I feel that we will never truly know the identity of Jack the Ripper beyond a shadow of a doubt, the theories posited by Patricia Cornwell are undoubtedly a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I nearly slit my throat trying to read this poorly written, disorganized, and disappointing book! It appears as if not one word was edited out of this ridiculous, plodding tome that could have been one third its current size. The book reads as if Cornwell took all of her voluminous research notes, taped them all together, and just typed it up using some kind of stream-of-consciousness technique known only to her. The fake sepia-tone illustrations have lost a great deal of important detail seemingly for the sake of a better uniformly \\"artsy-fartsy\\" look. Many of the important primary documents would have been more convincing and much easier to see if they had been carefully and professionally photographed. Cornwell jumps around, not necessarily discussing events in chronological order, with many irrelevant asides thrown in between the important points she is trying to make. She discusses probable additional victims, yet doesn't bother to provide any kind of comprehensive, dated timeline or chronology for the reader to refer to. The same kind of timeline or chronology should have been provided for the most important of the hundreds of letters the Ripper allegedly wrote. All of that said, I believe that Sickert did the awful deeds, but I don't think Cornwell even came close to making a case. It may be in there somewhere, but someone else will have to find it, and rewrite the book. I hope someone from Scotland Yard takes up the ball. Because I'm a librarian, I know this is classified as a non-fiction book; but then, mythology is non-fiction too."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was amazing. It details life in Victorian England like no other story written. The evidence all adds up and points to this man Sickert. The story will repulse and intrique you at the same time. Her research is thorough and the case is closed! Jack the Ripper is at rest. A great story. It jumps around a little, but is easy to keep up."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a university professor who teaches required classes for history majors on methods of inquiry and analysis, I am constantly on the lookout for books that utilize specific methodologies and present original theses. Since many of my students will never teach or go to graduate school, I like to suggest the kinds of careers that they might seek with a history degree--investigative reporting is one of them. I have a particular interest in Victorian Society because my great-great-grandmother may have been stalked in Whitechapel by the Ripper on her way home from work as a domestic servant. Although I am not a &quot;Ripperologist,&quot; I have spent time in my classes dealing with themes of poverty, prostitution and violence against women in 19th century England, subjects that Corwell discusses with sensitive accuracy.My assessment of this book is that it represents an outstanding and reasoned attempt to prove what a number of historians have suspected for some time but have lacked the scientific evidence to prove: that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. To do this, Cornwell, a forensic scientist as well as a mystery writer, utilizes her own expertise and that of others to analyse medical information, DNA evidence, handwriting, police reports, diaries, letters, railroad schedules, ink, paint, stationary production and distribution, finger prints and art. At every point, she anticipated objections to her arguments and her conclusions and met them head on. I found the latter to be very nearly convincing and her sources to be impeccable and I challenge anyone to do a better job or to produce a compelling counter thesis."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Well, I noticed that so many people here criticise Cornwell's book. Though there are certainly many issues that should be investigated more thoroughly, the theory that she is suggesting makes sense in lot of ways. Even if Walter Sickert wasn't Jack the Ripper at all, I found this book highly interesting and hard to put it down."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I read the book and thought it was quite convincing... until I later listened to the book on tape. She does take a methodical and forensic approach to the subject, as I have read in no other.For those who read the book and were convinced, do us a favor listen to it unabridged in tape/CD. Listen to it as if you were a juror in a modern day courtroom. It was then that I started noticing the leaps she takes from forensic theory to actual application to the man Sickert.I give it 2 stars because it is a theory as other investigations of it are theory and entertaining at the time. However ALL other theories, such as the one proposed in the &quot;From Hell&quot; graphic novel and movie (which is based on someone else's theory, i forget who) should not be viewed as superior because they are just that, theories.One is just as plausible and/or implausible as the other."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Portrait of a Killer, Jack the Ripper Case Closed. It sounds like a Victorian Thriller, and coming from well known mystery author Patricia Cornwell, one might expect it to be one. What it is, however, is an extremely well researched study of an artist, Walter Sickert, whom the author believes to have been the Whitechapel serial killer, Jack the Ripper. It comes close to the \\"more than I wanted to know\\" category at times, but the detailed discussion of what is known of the victims' lives and last activities is a poignant social description. The manner of their deaths seems to add insult to injury, and probably seemed as much to the socially conscious of the time. The author herself suggests that the miserable conditions of the slums of London came into the limelight in a way that they never had before, bringing them to the attention of the public and perhaps paving the way for social change that gathered momentum in the early twentieth century.The story is a chilling review of the evidence from the police, public document, newspaper, and family files of the period and an application of modern forensics techniques to them. As the author states, there is no statute of limitations on murder, and although all of the characters involved in the drama are long dead-most over a hundred years dead-there is still a fascination with the macabre behavior of the killer. Modern audiences are familiar with the subject of serial killers, which seem to have cropped up from time to time throughout the past century to fill our newspapers with the senseless violence that seems almost the hallmark of our age. When one reads this book, one will discover that barbarity to ones fellow human being is by no means confined to our own disturbed culture. The Ripper was never brought to trial, and Cornwell believes that many of his crimes were not even credited to him, including some of the more vicious crimes perpetrated against children and others in outlying areas of England.At the beginning of the book, Cornwell admits to a feeling of discomfort with the evil of both the Ripper and unbalanced mental state of the artist. It's obvious that she herself is convinced of his guilt. The chapters start out organized, the discussion of the artist's early life and family providing structure. The deaths of the victims also provide a framework. By the middle of the book, however, the author seems to wander a bit. She jumps from date to date, describing a variety of events that interweave with the Ripper murders, and by the end of the book, the story just stops. It ends with the artist's strange behavior at the funeral of his second wife in the 1920's, this despite the fact that Sickert himself lived until 1942 and married a third time. It's almost as if the villainy of the Sickert character in his purposed guise of Jack the Ripper has freaked out the author, and she can barely tolerate dealing with either of them. It bespeaks of an unpleasant experience and certainly gives credence to the idea that there really is a devil and some people can in fact be evil in a deep and spiritual sense. It also suggests that Cornwell herself is an incredibly creative and imaginative person for whom writing is more than just a vocation.While I think that Cornwell makes a good case for the guilt of the disdurbed artist Sickert, I'm not certain but that that fact arises at least as much from her ability to weave a good story and to create an ambiance of mystery around her characters as it does from the facts in her case. That the man was deeply disturbed, possibly due to childhood traumas and to a highly disfunctional family, seems quite likely. It's not impossible that the man was either autistic or even schizophrenic. That he was Jack the Ripper, I'm not so sure. Probably the most damning physical evidence is the stationary used by both the artist and Jack the Ripper in their correspondence, but as Ms Cornwell herself points out, even if the artist had written the letters to the police, it demonstrates more his rather bent sense of humor than his guilt. I also find it interesting that there appear to be no descendants to be offended by a book damning their ancestor as one of the nineteenth century's most vicious killers! There is an element of legal safety in that.A fascinating book, but be prepared for the gruesome."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I attended University in London, and a friend and I used to walk the East End at night. I've been on the Jack the Ripper walk with my students many times. The last time was this past summer and I noticed that they were careful to pay lip service to Patricia's theory. I agree with Shelley Lyon's review: it's obvious that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I know that many people make their livelihood from this mystery. But after reading this book with its meandering, always interesting content, I'm convinced. Jack the Ripper joins the Dauphin, Anastatia and Salley Hemmings as another history mystery that's solved. Great work Patricia!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Let's face it there are more Ripper suspects then there were probable Ripper victims. This is just going to have to be one of those cases that will never be solved with a true degree of certainty at this late date.With that said I suppose Ms Cornwell's suspect could have as easily been Jack the Ripper as any of the others. I would not recommend this book if you are going to be overly critical of it. Although I must admit that I am not sold on Sickert being Jack, it was still interesting to read the case that Ms. Cornwell put together. Her case is based on circumstancial evidence, but lets face it, at this point in time that is about all that is left.Don't expect to come away with the case solved. This is just one take on a very interesting and much talked about case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I'm an avid reader and typically read 1-2 books per week. I've read many of Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta novels so I was thrilled when I saw this book available at a new library in my area and snatched up a copy. My thrill quickly faded to disappointment and my eagerness for the knowledge the normally brilliant Cornwell imparts in her writing quickly turned to boredom and tedium as I tried to slog through her far-too-detailed, gory descriptions and minutae.It seemed that Cornwell was being overly verbose as a way to justify the million or so dollars I heard she spent trying (and I feel she succeeded, I just couldn't finish this beast) to prove her theory that Walter Sickert, a well-known painter of the Victorian era, was none other than Jack the Ripper.I made it through a little over 200 pages before I caved, ready to scream, &quot;OKAY, ALREADY, I GET IT -- YOU NAILED YOUR MAN!&quot; The book jumps around from victim to victim going into WAY too much detail about their injuries and supposition upon supposition as to why the hapless British police couldn't determine what Cornwell used millions of dollars, modern-day technology, 20th-century forensic science and psychology to prove. Hey, they did the best they could. They didn't have much to work with.The history lessons early in the book about the sociological fabric and descriptions of Victorian-era England was, to me, more interesting than her tedious description of why she felt Sickert was the killer. I agree with her, he probably was, but at this point in time -- who really cares? She could have made her point just as well and made it a lot more readable and more quickly in about half the number of pages. For those who enjoy her usual fast-paced, gripping style, this book will be a disappointment. Save yourself a lot of time and twenty-five bucks."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"\\"Case Closed\\". Really, you just can't throw phrases like that out there and expect to be taken seriously. Similarly, Gerald Posner claimed to have closed the JFK case, by \\"proving\\" that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Nonsense.With the Ripper case, the sheer age of the case and the questionable quality of the evidence, such as it is, makes it totally impossible to do more than make a series of educated guesses.Pat Cornwell has put forward some interesting ideas, although her non-definitive DNA \\"evidence\\" is somewhat misleading and as for handwriting \\"experts\\"... well, yeah.The most fascinating thing about the Jack The Ripper case is why it has been so compelling for so many people. If the case really did only consist of five murders, in a city in which all human life was cheap, especially among the poor, why should it have taken on such an enduring mystique?Apart from the favoured-by-some Royal Conspiracy theories, one of the most unique elements in the JTR murders was the incremental level of violence that the killer used. By the final murder, in which the greatest level of mutilation was employed, Jack had played himself out in terms of his ability to layer more horror on the police and townsfolk of Whitechapel.Sickert could have easily been the Ripper. Yet, any one of a dozen suspects could have done it, either singly or with an accomplice. While reading Cornwell's book, the most chilling thought that occured to me was that virtually ANYBODY could have been the killer.We will never know why the Ripper killed those apparently innocent women, or why he used a mind-boggling level of mutilation on the fifth victim. What we can be sure of is that given sufficient cause, most people could unleash similar violence on a \\"deserving\\" party. I have only experienced this unparalleled hatred for an enemy once in my life, when I was being hounded by a sadistic Collection Agency (they are ALL sadistic). At the peak of the harassment, I know completely that I would definitely have used a Ripper-level of violence and brutality against certain individuals, had they appeared in front of me, instead of hiding behind a false Desk Name, at the other end of a telephone. In dehumanizing me, they dehumanized themselves. This then, is perhaps the key to understanding our fascination with this unfettered use of violence.Whether the Ripper was a misogynist, a contract killer employed by the Royals, a deranged psychopath or whatever, he carried out a short series of violent acts that seemed to wound the fabric of Time itself. More than anything, he showed us the Dark Side that lurks in too many people. Perhaps all people. Just waiting to be triggered. Just waiting to bring Him back, from Hell.No, the case is not closed, and it never will be."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"You don't have to believe Sickert was the killer to enjoy this book. You willlearn a lot of Ripper info on the times and the crimes. \\"Earth closets\\"? \\"Punchand Judy?\\" \\"Kukris?\\"After going through the usual suspect list, I \\"poo-poo'd\\" the notion of the artist-Walter Sickert being the Ripper--until I looked through his paintings and thought, \\"this is one sick pup!\\" and then read the book.The more I learned from the book about this tormented genius: (Fluent in 5 languages, Acting-Including Shakespeare-, Painting, and his obsession with Jack the Ripper) the more convinced I became that Sickert was indeed the consumate serial killer who delighted in outwitting the police and world.I have great respect for the research that Patricia put into this work and pages of her sources are listed in the back, as well as an index to all topics in the book. I am hoping Ms. Cornwell will follow with a sequel that provides more samples of Sickert's writing for graphocological purposes of comparison with Ripper notes. I hope that the \\"vandalized\\" registry that was purchased from the \\"Hill's Hotel\\"(an alleged rest stop for Sickert) will be published with the \\"vandal's\\" sketches, notes and comments done \\"only by Jack the Ripper\\" in the registry, with the same \\"vandal's\\" poems reflecting a Shakespearean ease-- particular to writers and actors that could be a connection between artist and killer.Jack's promise to kill children and then the children who were ripped were a surprise to me as I hadn't been aware before this reading.Sickert bragged of his ability to disguise himself and the book made me aware thatFrance was only a few hours away so the aliby of \\"Being in France\\" is meaningless to someone who could pass easily without detection back and forth daily or weekly as he pleased.There are many-many insights to Sickerts odd behaviors that far exceed a \\"normal\\" person. They are facinating reading in this book.Sickert did indeed hide clues in his paintings. If Patricia hasn't seen them, I will say that they not a \\"where\\" in the pictures, butrather it's a \\"how\\" needed to find them.\\"A study in Scarlet\\" came out in 1887 then-\\"A sign of 4\\") I think there are Sickertconnections from the Sherlock stories-(Ennui, Serpentine the miner) and lots more.

There are some gory photos and such details that you would nearly puke!Having castigated the author, I would say that she has been able to recreate a picture (in my mind) of those bygone times.

How morbidly quaint!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell does a good job presenting the evidence against Sickert, the man she believes is Jack the Ripper. However, it was very hard to get through this book. She builds a convincing case, but the text itself is very dry. I felt at times like I was reading a textbook. It will pick up at certain parts and before you know it, you have read 2 or 3 chapters. Then it will take a week to get through the next chapter. I felt myself reading lines over and over again because it completely lost my interest. I was stuck on page 170 for days. I think she could have summarized more in areas such as the chapter on the letters and the types of paper used. Overall, I think she does a great job in portraying the evidence in many different aspects of a criminal case, (motif, opportunity, letter/writing profiles, personality traits, the inner workings of the psychopathic mind, etc.) although I think it would have been much more interesting and enjoyable to read had she wrote it in the form of a crime novel from the perspective of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, as was her original intention. The book does however, leave you knowing more than ever about the life and times of Jack the Ripper and how it was to live in London during that depressing time in the history of England."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This must rank as the most disappointing Jack the Ripper books written to date, and is closer to the realms of fiction than fact. Cornwell's prime suspect, painter Walter Richard Sickert, while indeed a very dark horse, displays no 'killer qualities' whatever. He was certainly a very strange, perhaps even a loathsome individual, but nothing to propel him into the stratosphere of a serial killer. For one thing, he is entirely lacking in motive, for another, no explanation is offered for the start of the killing spree, nor any reason given why the murders ended so abruptly. The proof offered up by Cornwell amount to little more than the ravings of a disturbed, rather than a criminally insane mind. Sickert's drawings of what might be the murder scenes are, it must be remembered, post, and not pre event demonstrating the effect the murders might have had upon this eminent painter's mind, but they do not mark him out as the murderer. Not convincing and the case is far from closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am not an expert on all things Ripper; however, I have read a bit and read enough to realize that all of Cornwell's \\"evidence\\" could have been presented in less than 100 pages and that even that could have been honed down substantially if one removed her obscene conjecture and assumptions. It is poorly written jumping around from one inane subject to the next; Cornwell focuses on obscure and inapplicable details and then glosses over what most would consider extremely valid evidence. She vainly discredits any opposing views or expert evidence and plods through heaping circumstantial evidence on even weaker circumstantial evidence. I disagree thoroughly with her findings not because I am predisposed to any particular theory but because her theory is shamefully incomplete and her arrogance in presenting it is embarrassing. Along with this the book is simply unreadable, poorly edited, and frustrating. The only positive thing I can find about the book is it has sparked an interest in Walter Sickert's work and life. If one is looking for a Ripper book worth reading that is wonderfully written, researched, and truly objective: The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Sugden is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I cannot claim to be a Ripperologist, but I have read a fair number of books about the Ripper murders and none so arrogant and uninformative as this. Before I say any more, let me just say that I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's novels, she's a good writer, so I am simply unable to decide what on earth made her write this. In the beginning of this book, the author states that she became interested in the Ripper murders on a visit to London and was soon convinced that the artist Walter Sickert was responsible. Having decided on this, she then claims to have solved the murders and sets about, rather unconvincingly, attempting to convince us that this is the case.Alarm bells began to ring when Cornwell states with utter conviction that the Ripper's first victim was Martha Tabram - a fact hotly disputed amongst those who have investigated the Ripper murders. Her total and utter conviction that she is right in everything is rather concerning. She has a rather naive view of Victorian London, is quite insulting about the people who lived there (they may have been poverty stricken, drunk, uneducated, illiterate etc, but no person deserves to be described as \\"rubbish\\") and discusses in great depth the way postmortems would currently be carried out now, which is interesting but ultimately irrelevant, as the murders happened so long ago. Bodies found in dark alleyways in the middle of the night and carted off to the nearest poorhouse or shed to be examined are obviously not going to be subject to the same scrutiny or scientific testing they would be now.Now we come on the subject of Sickert - the man Cornwell says categorically was the Ripper. Her evidence is very flimsy. Many of the Ripper letters were written on paper that can be traced to him - if we accept this it says he may have written some letters to the press or police, but the writer of those particular letters was not necessarily the murderer. Again and again she makes assumptions - about his health, his childhood, his marriage, his whereabouts, his love of disguises and rented rooms where he could work in private, the fact he may or may not have defaced a visitors book at a guest house... Sickert may have been a very odd man - he certainly had an obsession with Jack the Ripper, he claimed to stay in a room the Ripper lived in, he was compulsive, a news addict, a prolific writer, he liked his models to be extremely unnattractive and was certainly attracted to the underlife of the city. Does this make him a murderer? I would have preferred to have read a balanced account - this was not it and I remain unconvinced of Cornwell's arguments."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a much better author than \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would lead one to believe.It's hard to imagine that anyone without pure discipline could finish this book in the first place, much less get through the first 500 pages.Think what you will about mass literary writers. Many put their brilliance to good use in an attempt to do exactly what they do -- tell an entertaining story. Some choose to fill pages with drivel in an effort to prove a point. And, that's what it appears Cornwell is up to with this offering.Anyone with an average IQ will be well aware that Cornwell believes Sickert is Jack the Ripper about 200 pages into the work. And, she should have cut off her argument at about the 300-page mark.Facts, insinuations and outright grasping at thin air to make a connection drag out ad nauseum what would otherwise be an intriguing, detailed and convincing account.After a point, it almost feels like Cornwell is trying to convince herself.Bottom line: Overstated. But a must read for anyone utterly fascinated by the Jack the Ripper mythos."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"\\"Portrait of a Killer\\" purports to have finally uncovered the identity of the enigmatic Jack the Ripper. Sure enough, Patricia Cornwell had me convinced that Walter Sickert, a contemporary painter, was indeed the Ripper. . . . at least while I was reading the book. Cornwell's book reads more like a thriller than a legitimate investigate. For being a page turner, I give this book 4 stars. Cornwell is very compelling in her argument, & I truly did believe that Sickert was the Ripper while I was reading this book.The problem is that all of her evidence if circumstantial. Taken together, the evidence (if fact) does make Sickert look like an ideal candidate for the Ripper. Unfortunately, there are several other candidates for the Ripper who are just as compelling. Cornwell does not mention these, so Sickert seems like a foregone conclusion. I've done a fair bit of reading on Jack the Ripper, & I just don't believe that Cornwell has finally unearthed his identity. I don't think anyone ever will."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell fills this book with could have and should have statements. Police could have..... or investigators should have..... While she does critique the investigative power and the assumptions made by local law enforcement many of her critiques are based on what could be done with todays technology and not what was available. However, even with todays technology she presents an unconvincing case. Her contempt for 'her suspect' is aparent and she tries to bestow this feeling upon her readers. She succeeds in convincing readers that he was not of good character and possibly was fascinated with the case of Jack the Ripper. She may have even given good evidence to suggest that he wrote many of the Jack the Ripper letters. However, police at the time did not believe that the author of the letters and killer were the same person. And She does not convicingly link the author to the killer and would be far from proving beyond reasonable doubt in a court room. Also, it is aparent her investigation was so tainted by her personal disdain for her suspect that she did not broaded the investigation to include other suspects. Her theories are tied together very loosely and she constantly dismisses all evidence that clearly contradicts her theories. I believe this book is damaging to Cornwell's reputation as she tries to convey an image of objective science in her characters."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cromwell should stick to writing novels. When she plies her trade in constructing a work of non-fiction she fails rather miserably! There is far too much of the novelist that seeps into her &quot;analyses&quot; and sifting of the evidence. The legal arguments developed to support her charge that Walter Sikert was Jack the Ripper are based on speculation and circumstantial evidence at best and would be thrown out in a court of law. She posits many interesting coincidences, but even taken as a whole, they do not provide &quot;case closed&quot; proof that Sickert was the Ripper. She cites also gobs of forensic science methodologies to suggest that were Sickert alive to day, he would no doubt be convicted. She then uses these modern applications to try (vainly) to reach back in time and wonder what the outcome would be if they were applied! How intersting that she rarely mentions the science of comparative hand-writing analyses which could have been easily applied to Sickert's letters an those of the Ripper - Why not Patricia, because they don't substantiate the argument?This is a utility-grade piece of work with too many eye-rolling and &quot;C'mon&quot; frustrations. Lurid details and disconnected theories never construct a body of evidence. But hey, when sensationalism can replace fact and sell books at the same time, she, like Martha Stewart, would only have to worry about her stock broker."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Patricia Cornwell, especially the Kay Scarpetta series. Also a big fan of any real crime writing or program, I was THRILLED to see that Cornwell was tackling Jack the Ripper (I had read a couple of things about the case before, including the hoax diary). Unfortunately, this book has done nothing but long for better Scarpetta days. The evidence she provides, while sometimes interesting, is somewhat absurd at times. There are awkward and forced connections made throughout. I had to force myself to complete the entire book. Even the writing style and organization of the book was lacking. If you are looking for a book measuring up to Cornwell's normal standards, or a great and conclusive book about Jack the Ripper, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. Keep on searching."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"To accept that the case of Jack the Ripper has been closed by this book and the evidence it presents is presumptuous. But I think that a valid argument has been made for Walter Richard Sickert as the killer. Most of the primary source material for the claims are from the 1800s rather than referencing material written and interpreted by intermediary sources.I would have liked to have seen more samples of the Jack the Ripper letters and Walter Sickert's handwriting until I would have been allowed to draw my own conclusions. The other murders mentioned, but not originally attributed to the Ripper, could have been the work of the Ripper or a copycat - I will not comment further on that.What I truly found fascinating was the examination of the evidence with the comparison of how modern forensic science would handle the same evidence interesting in the extreme. It is amazing to see how far science and criminal justice has come in just over a hundred years.This book is not written to transport the reader to the dark, damp streets of London in 1888. This book is written in a way as to allow a 21st century reader interested in the Ripper case a chance to look at the evidence, procedures, and police work of that time. A resident of that era would not realize that the bull's-eye lantern carried by the police and shown in the papers as \\"beacons of light shining on the victims\\" were little better by our standards than a flashlight with dead batteries.In truth, I find myself more aware of how dark and squalid the world of Jack the Ripper would have been. We see movies, but they must be lit until we can see what is happening -- when in actually most of the Ripper's victims could probably see no more than a few feet in front of them at the time of their deaths. I suspect to get a true taste of the nights would require one to close a room until it is completely dark then light a single candle, not one with a well trimmed wick, but one that gutters and spits in the melting wax and slightest drafts.Whether or not a case is made does not matter to me. I found this book a fresh look at both a series of old murders and the time in which the occurred. In many ways, the Ripper case is no longer about who did it but the society that spawned the killer and the succeeding generations' interpretations of the evidence and society.It was an excellent read, though it did jar at times in the beginning when the voice of the modern forensic scientist stepped in. But I quickly became accustomed to the intrusion and welcomed the insights it brought.Was Walter Richard Sickert Jack the Ripper? Perhaps. I know that were I on the jury I would be looking very carefully at the evidence present and how it was processed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I had never read a Patricia Cornwall book before and never will again. This was one of the most poorly written books I have ever come across.I bought this book after having seen Ms. Cornwall on a television special and I found her theory very intriguing. While I still find the theory intriguing, the book was anything but.There is no logical structure to the book. She wanders aimlessly through the murders, sometimes chronologically, sometimes not. She includes only three Sickert paintings, although she discusses many, and those three paintings are printed in a muddied sepia tone and barely discernable. She writes, over and over again, about the lack of forensic science available to the police at the time and then goes into excruiting detail about what they MIGHT have done if they had the proper tools.She is constantly equivocating and making random generalizations. She does not cite any sources.She states that she is staking her reputation on this theory. I believe it is her writing style that should ruin whatever reputation she may have.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was an somewhat enjoyable tumble through the dark side of these horrible crimes. I've never had an opportunity to learn much about them, but it's always fun to place yourself in the seamy side of Victorian London once in a while. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say on the positive side.&quot;Case Closed&quot;? How can someone who purports to be something of an expert in forensic science make such a claim based on what she presents? I kept expecting Cornwell to drop some bombshell pointing to Sickert as the Ripper, but it never came. The so-called &quot;evidence&quot; was interesting, but far from dispositive. This is especially dramatic in the matter of DNA. If there is one thing that can blow the lid off an old case like this one, it is this use of this extraordinary new technology. But once again, no bombshell. Far from it. Nuclear DNA (the most decisive) was unrecoverable, and MT DNA was inconclusive. I was especially angry that Cornwell seemed to mislead the reader by inferring some significance into the fact that a couple of genetic markers were found in both the Ripper's and Sickert's MT DNA. She of all people should know that this is essentially meaningless. It's not unlikely that my DNA would have a correlation of that magnitude. But I assure you, I have an solid alibi. The book read far more like an &quot;In Search Of...&quot; episode on UFOs than a hard hitting piece of criminal journalism.Cornwell often admits to the speculative nature of her conclusions, but there it just too much of it to merit the book's subtitle. This left me feeling a little &quot;had&quot;. Frankly, I'm a little embarrassed for her. I am not a reader of her fiction, but I had understood her to have a reasonably good reputation for &quot;getting it right&quot;. I feel she has damaged that reputation with this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've read many of the reviews already posted here, and there isn't much more I can add. This is the first Cornwell book I have read, and it will likely be the last. As a former police officer, I was always told to be careful \\"not to make the evidence fit the suspect\\". Cornwell seems to draw as much from her imagination as from the facts. Did she research other suspects as thoroughly as Sickert or did she mold her evidence to suit her literary needs? I found the book poorly written and badly edited.I'm glad I waited to borrow it from the library and did not spend money on it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Unless you are a big fan of Patricia Cornwell's fiction, or a Ripper buff, I wouldn't recommend this book. Cornwell's scattered prose makes what might be an interesting theory come across as weak and wandering. Her claim that Sickert is the Ripper are based on anecdotal evidence that he was a psychopath, that his paintings depicted Ripper-like violence towards women, that he suffered from a vague penile malady that prevented him from having penetrative intercourse, and that while there is no evidence that he was in London when the murders occurred, there isn't any evidence that he wasn't, either.I will concede that from her description he was not the nicest sounding guy in the world, but again, her evidence for this is largely anecdotal and circumstantial. Actually, her evidence for everything she claims is anecdotal. She shamelessly fills in gaps when hard evidence is lacking, making claims that certain conclusions are so obvious there is no need to rely on facts. I'm most irritated by her claims that Sickert's paintings prove him to be Jack the Ripper. Cornwell manages to see murder in every smudge and line, applying uneducated interpretations to Sickert's frantic sketching style, ignoring greater art evidence to the contrary to narrow her focus to only the paintings, or in some cases, details of paintings, that give weight to her theory.None these shortcomings are helped by the basic fact that Patricia Cornwell couldn't write her way out of a wet paper bag. Her fiction is marginally more challenging than Danielle Steel's treacly fluff, and she has no kind of talent for writing arguments. Again and again she makes the claim that certain passages from books or letters prove her allegations, but again and again she stops just short of actually quoting her sources. A book such as this should have footnotes, at least.I am open to the fact that Walter Sickert could have been Jack the Ripper, but I need to hear the argument presented by some one who can write coherently and cite sources, and not by the reigning hack of predictable true crime bestsellers."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Firstly the case is not closed, she merely provides a hole filled theory. I lost all respect for her when she was interviewed regarding people refuting her claims. She repiled that people did not aggree with her because &quot;I am a woman and an American&quot;. Grow up, how embarrasingly sad. Just write, don't talk."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's attempt to link Walter Sickert to the 1888 Jack the Ripper murders in London, has taken the field of Ripperology to a new low. It is typical for an author to select a candidate for Jack the Ripper and then bend the facts to fit, conveniently discarding those that can't be contorted. As example in Cornwell's case, whereas most serious students of the case believe that ALL the letters written to newspapers and the metropolitan police were from a variety of kooks and pranksters, Cornwell concludes that MOST are from Sickert. How does she reconcile the disparate handwritings? By concluding that Sickert was a master of forgery. And what does she base this conclusion upon? The variety of handwritings that the many Ripper letters demonstrate. The circularity of reasoning doesn't bother her a bit. How could it be that two or three Ripper letters were sent from differing locations in Britain with the same postmarked date? Sickert must have had people mail letters for him. And on it goes. The book is disjointed, illogical, and should convince no one actually familiar with the minutia of the Ripper case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell makes some interesting observations and has definately convinced me that Walter Sickert was a strange and morbid man who most probably had a fascination with Jack the Ripper (JTR). From the evidence in the book it even seems likely that he may have written some of the Ripper letters (most/many of which are presumed hoaxes). However, in no way did she convince me that she has solid proof that he actually was JTR.While the book will likely hold your interest, it will ultimitely make you feel you've been duped if you expect to find any REAL and COMPELLING evidence of Cornwell's claim that Walter Sickert was the famed serial killer. In her zeal to prove her case, she employs many flawed arguments and leaps of logic. Since many of these have been documented here by other posters, I won't add my own recitation of them, but I am confident discerning readers won't get far without spotting them. While the lack of a consistent chronological order cited by some didn't bother me too much, the book's ending seems rather strange and abrupt. As best I can tell, it serves no other purpose than to leave a final taste in the reader's mouth that Walter Sickert was a liar and not a particularly good human being. From this, (I can only suppose) the reader is expected to draw the \\"obvious\\" conclusion that he was JTR.I really can't recommend this book to purchase nor even heartily recommend it as something worth the time and effort to read. However, if you wish to do so anyway I recommend you save the money and check it out at the library."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. I found it entertaining. I did not see all the connections between Sickert and Jack the Ripper, but there are many. I do not know all the facts, but she certainly did alot of research. This case will never be fully closed until DNA testing gets better and by then any samples will likely be too degraded."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've had an interest in Jack the Ripper for the last couple of years, and when I found out that Ms. Cornwell was going to be investing such a massive amount of money and \\"scientific study\\" into determining who the killer was, I was ecstatic. What a great idea for a fiction writer to do right? Unfortunately, I was caught up in the tremendous amount of hype that surrounded this book and failed to see the glaringly obvious flaw: this was a FICTION writer. This fact becomes painfully clear on the first page of the book.\\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would make for a somewhat decent work of fiction. It would make for a mediocre \\"historical\\" fiction novel based on a real event. As a \\"non-fiction novel, it is absolutely horrible, and definitely the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I've never read a Cornwell novel before, but it seems that she is trying to use real people to create fictitious characters. Walter Sickert is the man she is convinced held the secret identity of Jack the Ripper. Cornwell's entire premise for this book is that she would be using the scientific method, and more interestingly, DNA analysis, something that has never been done on the Ripper case. When her DNA analysis and scientific studies fail, she STILL uses the unconvincing results to try to draw definitive conclusions that Sickert was the killer.The DNA \\"evidence\\" that is Cornwell's main link to Sickert and the Ripper, is actually mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA. This type of DNA is actually very common, and is shared by anywhere from 1-10% of the population. Furthermore, Cornwell cannot even state with certainty that the DNA she tested was even Sickert's. How does she explain away all of the eyewitness alibis Sickert had for 4 or the 5 murders, placing Sickert in Paris at the time? She doesn't, she simply ignores them. Her ENTIRE book is based on a wide amount of circumstantial evidence that doesn't even come close to being \\"scientific.\\" Most of the letters she attributes to the Ripper have been widely recognized as hoaxes by the Ripper community.From reading her book, one would think that Cornwell had some sort of personal vendetta against Sickert, as she attempts to portray him as an insane psychopath. What does she use to support this claim? Mainly Sickert's sickening tendencies to take walks at night or paint!Cornwell failed miserable with \\"Portrait of a Killer.\\" She attempted to spend 1 year stepping into a completely unknown field. A field that has been explored by people studying the Ripper and the evidence for decades. Her only advantage over other authors on Ripper books was her budget and access to Ripper documents and testing laboratories. However, when this fails to turn up a single bit of conclusive evidence that Sickert could even possibly be the killer, Cornwell loses her ground and proceeds to recede back to what she does best: writing fiction. Even if her evidence proved without a doubt that Sickert was the killer, the book is so horribly written and jumps around so much, there is no way I would ever recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While the Walter Sickert theory presented in this book does seem quite sound, Patricia Cornwell seems not to have known where she was going with the story. Halfway between a crime novel and an expos&eacute;, she presents some valid facts to support the theory, but returns much to often to pure speculation. Maybe he was at the funeral, maybe not. Maybe he spoke to her, maybe not. In a book like this, the point is not to speculate and imagine, but to give concrete answers. Why call it &quot;case closed&quot; if there's still so much that's unclear?"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"You have to hand it to Ms. Cornwell. She has tackled a thorny problem that many writers have speculated about, and she has drawn her own conclusions. One of the most spectacular things about this book is that her conclusions are in no way tentative: she believes her theory about Jack the Ripper being Walter Sickert to be true, and doesn't stint to say so from page one.But her proof is based on suppositions and half-possible occurences that simply aren't facts. I wanted very much for this to be the solution - and maybe it is! but ultimately her ratiocinations about the whys and wherefores don't hold water.Sickert painted dreary whores and gloomy scenes with bedsteads and ambiguously placed nudes (dead/alive?) from about 1902-1905. From those dates Cornwell projects back to 1888, and forward to 1940, and expects us all to ride along with her.She selects facts that fit her theory, and rejects those that don't. Eventually the reader feels rather manipulated.I wanted to believe in the Maybrick theory of JtR; it truly felt right, and I am sorry to see that they've discounted it altogether.But to dive into this mystery and deem it solved just because so many millions of dollars were spent to follow this theory seems a waste. The whole idea of watermarks is intriguing - but it isn't taken far enough. Compare one of the half-sheets to one of Sickert's full sheets (she doesn't) to see if they fit, and how they fit.Cornwell believes she's found Sickert's doodlings in a guest book in Cornwall (no relation), that are revealing. She embroiders a whole chapter based on the findings - but there is simply no proof at all that it is he who's doodled in the book. And further, the idea that the book was written before the 1888 murders, and she posits that Sickert went there post 8/1888 and did the doodling fits real nicely - but there isn't an ounce of fact in it. Readers are not quite *that* gullible.There simply are too many loose threads to make it satisfying, and the insistence on the author that it's all tidy and done make things very uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am new to the subject, merely indulging a writerly fancy at this point, so I found the chronology of events to be fascinating. A more responsible account of the Ripper crimes would have sufficed. Sadly, this effort is disturbing not so much by the crimes it details ( which are horrific in themselves) but that it adds one more victim to the Ripper massacres some 120 years later-- that of the brilliantly complex Victorian painter Walter Sickert. The underlying nausea one feels in reading this polemic, is that one is complicit in the wholesale libel of an historical figure by an ambitious, naive and astonishingly self righteous amateur with no compunction or shame about her misdeeds. The underlying notion that such a hatchet job can done by anyone at anytime to anyone does not sit well in this writer's psyche. In the end one cannot feel but violated and deeply mortifed for the Sickert family legacy."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What Ms. Cornwell achieves in this book is a thorough overview of these horrid killings, and while at it does an admirable job of de-mythologizing any macabre \\"glamour\\" that has ever been erroneously attached to these atrocities. What she doesn't achieve is the conclusive \\"case closed\\" claims made either by her or on her behalf by this book's supporters. I don't know if a Victorian artist named Walter Sickert was the fiendish murderer responsible for the slayings of a handful of life's unfortunates in 1888, but I suspect he was not. (And if not has Cornwell then published one of the most brutal character assassinations in history?) As for the serial killer at the heart of this work, theories of this demented individual's identity have ranged from a Liverpool cotton importer (in a now-discredited 1990's book) to the Duke of Clarence, to a cabal of Freemasons, to an anti-Jewish conspirator. The fact is we'll probably never know who the self-dubbed \\"Ripper\\" was. After 118 years, does it matter? As an exercise in sated curiosity, it would be nice to finally close this case, but beyond that, it's merely an exercise in indulgence. Cornwell is a good writer and she can intentionally darken anyone's soul with her plots and revelations. This is, as I mentioned, a sound delving into the time and setting of the 1888 Whitechapel murders, and of the act of homicide itself. Beyond that, I think others have already gone a long way toward refuting Cornwell's idealistic claims of insight into Jack the Ripper's identity. Read this for the facts, not the speculation."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When this book was first published it got a strangly cold reception from the critics. Patricia Cornwell has a theory. I think she's wrong (my money is on Montague Druit as the killer) but she backs up her theory with a very good argument. Unless someone finds a confession with the Rippers real name on it we will never know who he really was but Cornwell's book is FAR superior to idiocy like Prince Jack or any of the silly books that attempt to pin the killings on elderly Dr. Gull. While I think she's mistaken I do respect the research, the mighty effort and the entertaining prose. Never mind what the critics said, this book is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I would love to see the evidence and Ms. Cornwell's theory written by a better non-fiction writer. Unfortunately, a good theory is destroyed by overstating it's certainty, &quot;backing it up&quot; with innuendo and conjecture, and presenting it in a haphazardly written structure that is neither chronological nor logical. I think that there is a very good chance she has the solution to the mystery. She also brings a fresh modern criminally educated perspective on the case and makes numerous excellent observations - such as the content and tone of the Ripper letters is more important than the handwriting. But this book is so poorly organized that by the middle you really feel that she &quot;has it in for this guy&quot; and has gone way outside the bounds of solid detective work; that she would be capable of manufacturing additional evidence, as required. A better and more logical outline would have presented her findings in a way that would have made them more relevant and convincing. I confess that I have never read one of her novels, but am confident that she has a lot to learn about writing non-fiction."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is a classic instance of someone wanting the evidence to fit a predetermined \\"proof\\". Still, the book is an interesting read. I would recommend that readers interested in Jack the Ripper read Philip Carraher's \\"The Adventure of the New York Ripper. In that book Jack has gone from London to New York City to kill again. While it's a work of fiction, the underlying \\"Ripper\\" facts are accurate and the analysis of the Ripper's London crimes quite good. Also the conclusion seems at least supportable under the facts and circumstances surrounding Jack the Ripper's crimes. It might be that Carraher comes closer to \\"solving\\" the Ripper crimes than does Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Let me start by saying I love Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta novels are among my favorites and I've read every one.When I saw this book I was totally intrigued, I'm also fascinated by true crime. Figuring Jack the Ripper is long gone, not so much of the nightmares to coincide with the read.However, the book was a disapointment. The research is commendable, but the book is not a smooth read. She jumps around so much from the killer to the era to modern day. If it was a smooth, consistent story it would have been great! I'm ashamed to say I couldn't even finish and I rarely stop a book half way through.Again, good plot, but could have been written in a much clearer manner."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having never read Ms. Cornwell's fiction, I was completely unbiased in reading this first work of seeming non-fiction, and do not feel any loyalty to whatever her works of fiction may be. As an historic account, this book's central tenet--that Jack the Ripper was a discreetly malformed but highly successful impressionist artist--might have some credibility with some sturdy, linear conveyance of evidence. The book teams with this evidence, but it is described in such a hapharzard, circuitous manner that I found the author contradicting herself on numerous occasions. To claim that the vast majority of Ripper letters were authentic in the early pages, only to blatently ascribe their fraudulence nary a hundred pages later--sloppy indeed! If she had only taken the seeming evidence of violent paintings and drawings, the various Ripper and Sickert correspondences, the murders and subsequent investigations, and addressed them all in a more coherent manner, her theory would be much more tenable. As it is, the book itself is barely readable--appealing only to one's sense of morbidity and much less to one's sense of proof or justifiable accusation. Patricia takes a moment in her acknowledgements to thank her editor--I would thank the editor to completely overhaul the information in this book and regurgitate in a linear fashion--for both the readers' and the author's benefit."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Where's the hard evidence? What little &quot;evidence&quot; Cornwell offered was circumstantial, coincidental, twisted, and misinterpreted. She never once had me convinced that Sickert and Jack the Ripper were one and the same. She only convinced me that Sickert was mentally unstable, and that the Ripper committed more crimes than he is credited for. Sometimes I started thinking of Sickert and the Ripper as interchangeable, but only because Cornwell authored her book in such a way. Sometimes she wrote about the Ripper being a famous artist, or Sickert being a psychopathic killer. It was very difficult to follow the story the way she wrote it. Kind of like my review, it was very disjointed. When she did happen to mention some of her &quot;evidence&quot; she wouldn't go into detail about what she found. She only said something like &quot;this evidence provides compelling proof that Sickert was the killer!&quot; But she never explains why or how. I did enjoy the book, as many other reviewers have said, as a tale of London's East End during the late 19th century, and as a bit of trivia about Walter Sickert and Jack the Ripper. I learned new things about the old case, such as the hundreds of Ripper letters that were written to the police. This aspect of the book was very interesting and well done. My final verdict: It has its good points, but each scene becomes more dramatic until the reader becomes annoyed and wishes the publisher had kaboshed the whole thing."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Given that she is a successful novelist, one might think that Patricia Cornwell would have a clue as to how to organize her arguments into a cohesive whole. However, &quot;truth&quot; must be harder than fiction, as this book rambles about without any rhyme or reason. It's hard to see why she even divided it into chapters, as each one contains a multitude of thoughts, facts, and surmises on a number of Ripper-related subjects, without ever making a specific point or building on previously made points to bolster her current argument. Does she prove her case? Well, she presents some interesting information, but never proves anything other than she is a better novelist than a writer of non-fiction. Was Walter Sickert the Ripper?Let's just say that the case is still open."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's fiction books...and that's where I think her strength is...in fiction. Portrait of a Killer is an interesting account of her discoveries while investigating the 114 year old Jack the Ripper case. Cornwell asserts that the identity of Jack the Ripper is Walter Richard Sickert, case closed. I find this a bold pronouncement considering that Cornwell did not provide the reader with one definite shred of evidence that clearly and unequivocably pointed to Sickert as the Ripper. What she did do, was provide alot of circumstantial evidence that when put together does make an interesting but unproven case against Sickert. Cornwell boldly inserts her opinions as if they were facts when recreating the Victorian era and what might have happened on the streets. She makes conjectures about interactions between the victims and the Ripper, conjectures about what might have occured between Sickert and the people he interacted with and conjectures about what the police did and didn't do. The fact of the matter is, Cornwell has forgotton that a man is seldom convicted on circumstantial evidence and it is only conjecture and coincidence that Cornwell presents. Yes, Walter Sickert painted pictures of violence, yes he has stationary similiar to the one the Ripper notes were written on, yes he had operations in his childhood that may have rendered him impotent, and yes he was odd..but this all amounts to an educated guess. Is it fair to write a book based on an educated guess? In my opinion it's Jack the Ripper, case still unsolved."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be the ultimate read but unfortunately been unable to finish it becuase I keep falling asleep. I had never purchased a book from this author but was familiar with her reputation as a good writer. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The book reads like an instruction manual and the author skips from the present to the past without giving the reader any transition information. The vocabulary can get a bit tricky at times (u might need to get a dictionary at times if you are not a lawyer or in the criminal justice field) and it just reads poorly. I found it to be boring, not what you would expect from Patricia or a book about Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Portrait of a Killer is addressing one of the greatest (or rather, most infamous) murder stories or just STORY of our time. It was left completely unsolved, even by the famous Scotland Yard. This is the first of Patricia Cornwell's works i have read and enjoy her writing style, her matter-of-fact manner and the periphery she brings to the table that helps you understand more than just one single event, but more about legal process in that day and the deficiencies in investigation, as well as the developments since then.WIth a case that has lay dormant for over a century survived bombings and all of WWII, tampered evidence, phonies, innacuracies, and an altogether lack of evidence pile masses of paperwork and theories into this case, one that you'd have to sit on to cram down and close fully. For those that want to discredit Ms. Cornwell entirely, go for it: any great movie or book or story can be disected beyond typical natural occurences, but if you have any inkling or interest in the Ripper case or Sickert himself, this book is very enlightening. The only reason it did not recieve five stars is that it isn't the type of book i would carry around and preach about. The nature of the book is the macabre, morgue-ish account of murders in the East End of London, and if you're not a pessimist or a deadbeat, you'll enjoy Ms. Cornwell's efforts here."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I found Cornwell's book to be an interesting read. She isolated the subject Sickert as a possibility for the Jack the Ripper killer. However, I think she was a little too zealous in her view of Jack the Ripper. To say that the case is totally closed is rather presumptive. Sickert was not tied to the case through solid means like DNA or fingerprints. There existed many other ways to suggest that Sickert was the killer, like paint specks, his compulsion to writing, ect. Yet, I found Cornwell following one train of thought through out the book: She (or anyone else) couldn't NOT prove that Sickert wasn't near some town or city or street, so he MAY have been the killer. Her process pushed my imagination to a bit of a stretch believing that Sickert was in fact Jack the Ripper. While she suggested a decent theory on who the killer might be, she did not win me over into her camp in fingering Sickert as the notorious madman."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is best known for her series of books focused on Kay Scarpetta, a tough lady medical examiner who solves crimes. For a while now, I've been feeling that these books were becoming a bit dull and extremely formulaic, so when her non-fiction book, Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed came out, I jumped at the chance to read something that wasn't Scarpetta-focused. It turned out to be an intriguing look at the author as well as a thorough description of London and the Ripper murders. Cornwell turned a spur-of-the-moment invitation to Scotland Yard one day into an obsession over who Jack the Ripper was-even spending much of her own money on forensic tests in order to further her theories, and buying some letters and other Ripper memorabilia, including around thirty paintings done by the man she thinks was Jack the Ripper.When reading the book, I got an overwhelming tone of superiority from Cornwell. It's almost as if she's smugly telling the reader that there is no room for doubt in her opinion of who committed the murders, even though her evidence is mainly circumstantial and based upon conjecture as to the character of William Sickert, her suspect. It is Cornwell's theory that Sickert, a semi-famous painter and actor of the time, was so upset over the marriage of his mentor James Whistler to a woman that Sickert himself was entranced with that he went on to kill five prostitutes over a few months in 1888, and coined himself \\"Jack the Ripper\\" in letters to the police.There is nothing wrong with Cornwell's theory, but the evidence she presents is hardly conclusive that the man was, in fact, the killer. She does manage to prove, to me anyway, that Sickert was probably the author of several of the Ripper letters to the police that included sketches, but it doesn't necessarily follow that he killed the women-- only that he liked to mess with Scotland Yard along with other citizens that wrote similar letters. Sickert also painted quite a few disturbing paintings of women being killed, as well as painting a picture entitled Jack the Ripper's Bedroom, all of which Cornwell uses to profile him as a highly disturbed man.What I found just as interesting as the subject of the book was the descriptions of London's East End and it's people at the time of the murders. None of the information would probably be new to an avid Anglophile, but to an amateur like me it was a detailed glimpse into the poverty and social issues of the time, giving glimpses at everything from the creation of Scotland Yard to the rampant alcoholism present in the lower classes.One thing that didn't change from Cornwell's Scarpetta novels to this book was her reliance on detailed descriptions of forensic science. I did skim through several pages on types of DNA testing, but found the descriptions of arterial blood spatter patterns less boring, as well the detailing of what type of person can be considered a psychopath, and the different ways to preserve human organs. At the very least, this book will save me having to watch countless episodes of CSI for the same forensic voyeuristic feeling.There is also something to say for not wanting to know the identity of the killer. Somehow, knowing all the gruesome crimes have not been solved or explained makes the story even more thrilling. The true stories of Jack the Ripper have achieved an almost mythic status, prompting movies, comics and stories around the campfire. Some part of me thinks that approaching something akin to a legend with science and facts takes away from it's cultural impact and leaves the world a bit less interesting."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation. As I began reading it though I could tell I was in for a great disappointment.Ms. Cornwell makes some great connections and in fact I would love to see her focus more on the hard evidence. Perhaps she wanted to reach a wider audience so she didn't want to indepth of forensics. She makes way too many major leaps of logic. Her theories are often began or concluded with &quot;I don't know for sure&quot; or &quot;I have no way of knowing if&quot;. There is alot of compelling evidence presented by her that Walter Sickert is the man, but its just as plausable that Walter Sickert knew the real Ripper like he claimed and helped write the letters to take part in the fame.Ms. Cornwell often leaves out alternative explanations and quickly jumps over alot of the shaky evidence. She also seems to only loosely connect some crimes that make no sense to connect either. It seems like this book was more a vehicle for Ms. Cornwell can't resist throwing in a few feminist cliches, blaming these crimes and the prositution on society, and relying on psychobabble to make conclusions she couldn't possible know for a fact. If she took out her personal agenda and relied simply on the facts this book would have been more enjoyable. I'm disappointed, but its worth the read just for curiosity and entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What a huge disappointment. Even after reading this book, I don't know how Cornwell can say, with confidence that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I've never read a Jack The Ripper book but I have seen a few documentaries on TV and I'm not convinced at all with Cornwell's conclusion. I think that when she wrote this book, she did so with blinders on. It seems that she was so focused on Sickert that there could be no other possibilities. I don't know that the Ripper identity will ever be solved, and it surely hasn't been with this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have listened to a lot of Patricia Cornwells books.I could not believed she wrote this one. I have theunabridged version and I was never so disappointed ina book. There have been other books that I didn't carefor but this one drags out to much and is borning.I know a lot about watermarks on paper or handwriting thatI don't think I need to know. Everytime I changed thecassett, I kept thinking it had to get better, but itdidn't. She jumped around so much it was hard to keepup with who she was talking about. I belive the painter is probably the killer. I have read several books on Jackthe Ripper and most of them at least kept my interest,not this one."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"All this book did was convince me that Walter Sickert was a creepy guy. There is no evidence that concretely links Sickert to the Ripper murders. It's a pretty heavy blame to lay on someone without anything more than circumstantial evidence."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"In this book, America's bestselling crime writer solves the case on Jack the Ripper that has baffled experts for more than a century. Although Patricia Cornwell is an amazing writer, you must have some interest in forensic science and/or crime to read and thoroughly enjoy this book. It's a bit slow-paced at times but the author is just giving you plenty of background information for you to better understand the investigation of Jack the Ripper. She gives you so many details on everything that are conducive to you feeling like you are in the East End of London back in the 19th century. Patricia uses her extensive knowledge of forensic science to present the hard evidence on who the psychopathic killer was, who remained unknown for over a hundred years. With her skills of criminal investigation and as a number-one-bestselling author, Patricia produces an amazing book which is compelling as well as authentic."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, and had hoped to find more conclusive &quot;evidence&quot; as well as a smooth read. I found neither. I found that while some interesting correlations were drawn and Sickert was certainly introduced as a possible suspect with good reason, I found myself needing something more definitive... perhaps a chronology that showed a definite link. While Sickert's art is certainly suggestive, and mtDNA on some of the dismissed &quot;Ripper&quot; letters is somewhat supportive... I did not find the substantive information I was looking for. So, certain art experts believe that the writing in many Ripper letters is consistent with Sickert's writing --- show me how, graphically. I also found the organisation of the book a little haphazard, which perhaps added to my alienation from Cornwell's strongly held conviction.She presented a good case of suspicion, but fell far short of &quot;convicting&quot; Sickert in this reader's eyes. She did convince me though that he was a truly strange and mysterious individual."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I just finished reading this book, and while there were some interesting points, it was difficult to read. The author is all over the place in this book. She jumps around in time and the events are hard to follow. Many things described in the book seem to have no relevance to the story. I can't say that she convinced me or didn't convince me. All I can say is that it's possible that she is correct in her enormous claim to have finally cracked the case, but she also may be way off base.I have to add that I think the size of her name on the cover of the book is a little much. Tone down the arrogance, Ms Cornwell."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's non-fiction offering, \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed\\" is filled with meticulous detail about Jack the Ripper's murders. Cornwell brings modern forensic techniques into the investigation of this 122 year-old case in an effort to prove that Jack the Ripper was Walter Sickert, an artist and actor. Although the detail made the theory interesting, the book was quite slow-moving in parts. While the use of mitochondrial DNA and handwriting analysis may seem to implicate Sickert, I didn't find it convincing enough to merit the descriptor \\"Case Closed\\"."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The major mistake of this book is the arrogance in thinking that century old circumstancial (and controversial) evidence can close any case.

Alas, this book was so boring I couldn't even finish it - and I usually finish anything I read. The writing drags and I didn't find the theory very compelling either. Whether you're a fan of Cornwell or interested in The Ripper, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"First off, I think it was very presumptive and arrogant of Cornwell to have added \\"Case Closed\\" to the title of this book. Given her background as a true crime reporter and technical writer for the Office of the Medical Examiner of Virginia, Cornwell already knows that you don't refer to a case as \\"closed\\" until it has been properly adjudicated.Nevertheless, this book proved a fascinating read and I think Cornwell made a good, though not great, case for her theory regarding Jack the Ripper's real identity. Or she didn't make a good enough case to convince me that Sickart was \\"guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" And I would be curious to know how Sickart's descendants reacted to this book?Who was \\"Jack the Ripper?\\" is a question that has tantalized criminologists and non-professionals for nearly 140 years. Many other still-unsolved murder cases, British and American, have long-since passed into obscurity. Or what is it about this case that caused it to develop a mystique which persists to this day? Cornwall's book would have frankly been better had she instead analyzed the persistence of intrigue with this case.By contemporary standards, the 19th century Ripper was unimpressive as serial killers go. Think, Green River Killer, who literally murdered dozens more prostitutes than were ever attributed to the Ripper, before he was caught. Or would Gary Ridgway's real identity still be the subject of heated speculation and unholy fascination, 100 years hence, had he not been caught?I do want to take strong exception to customer review claims - along with those of Cornwell-bashing bloggers on other websites - that question the validity of Cornwell's DNA research for this book. Analyses of antiquated DNA are neither \\"unprecedented,\\" nor are scientists incapable of obtaining good DNA and conclusive evidence from 100-year-old-plus samples. Case in point: a 100-year-old plus bloodstained scarf, containing the blood of late Russian czar, Nicholas II, was used to conclusively establish the identity of remains thought to be those of the late czar. Furthermore, DNA tests on extremely antiquated evidence are being routinely conducted by labs. on behalf of archaeologists and museums all over the world.Also, while it is true that many letters claiming to be from the Ripper (or Whitechapel Killer) were received in the wake of the murders, it is reasonable to presume that forensic experts of the time were adept at distinguishing hoax letters from those likely to have been written by the actual culprit.My educated guess is: Scotland Yard still has \\"Ripper\\" letters on file -- containing unique crime details, known only to the killer and investigators of the time -- that have never been released to the general public. However, someone like Cornwell or one of her expert consultants could have obtained such access.Therefore, I am confident that despite of any presumptive tendencies, Cornwell was careful to have only had handwriting analysis of letters credibly attributed to the real Ripper.Nevertheless, Cornwell may be well advised to stick to doing what she does best: writing about fictional crime via her angst-driven but likable alter-ego, Kay Scarpetta -- who so deliciously intersperses performing autopsies with the preparation of Italian comfort food."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"\\"Overall \\"Portrait if a Killer\\" was a very interesting and rather compelling. It did however, have parts in it that were rambling, unnecessary and confusing. Personally I would give it a seven out of ten, due to the simple fact that it raised some very well articulated points.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I truly admire Patricia Cornwell's amazing feat of making a case against Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper. Going back to a notorious series of murders committed over a century ago is difficult subject matter to tackle--especially when she accuses a celebrated artist with fans still to this day. But she tackles these complications early. I especially admire her admitting that she is staking her reputation on this. Her conviction and devotion is admirable.But I cannot admire her end result. Walter Sickert happens to have been a well known artist, who was more than strange. A psychopath, I cannot say for sure, but Patricia seems to believe it to the bone. She instantly calls him a killer and a psychopath, which makes it difficult to read with an unbiased eye. In fact, I instantly became critical over her dramatic damnation of someone I was unfamiliar with. Her words made me suspicious of her ability to argue her case. She starts to damn him immediately with little evidence. After a while, she does provide evidence, but she tends to overwhelm with odd evidence. Detail after detail about paper and watermarks. It was a strain to get through. The actual murders themselves are tentatively recreated, with much speculation thanks to her understanding of modern forensics. But the recreations and affirmed details are scant. Poor Mary Kelly's murder takes a mere dozen pages or so to explain, and it feels like an afterthought. Vicious language and doodles mean more to her case than anything else. For me, it is not good enough.She states what evidence she has and what she cannot prove. Yet, she insists it had to be Sickert. It seems as though, to me at least, that she has more insinuation than actual facts. Facts are what she needs. Sickert was/is famous; he has fans that will protect him. To attack a man no longer alive with so little evidence seems in poor taste. Weirdoes are just that, weirdoes, not necessarily psychopaths. To assume such is dangerous. A misogynistic artist who might have been neglectful or abusive to his wives is not exactly atypical to the nineteenth century.I also think Sickert is an easy target because he was famous. There are things about him we know. And she takes this evidence and \\"proves\\" guilt. Our courtrooms believe innocent until proven guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt. I doubt anyone who reads this book could convict this man in good conscience. Her strongest evidence is the paper samples and water marks, but even these are circumstantial at best.Patricia Cornwell took on quite a task, for which I commend her. Although I am not convinced, I think it was interesting to read and a fun experiment with history. I cannot take the work seriously, and would hope for better execution of her research, better structure and evidence (devote more time to what you know, not what you hope you could prove or what you believe should be linked without a thorough explanation of why). She brings up new, fascinating details, but I would hope for better overall. Recommended."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Have read about four books on the enigma of Jack the Ripper and I thinkthis one is it! It gives you identity of Jack the Ripper - great writingbravo for the writer and the great research she did."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell claims she has the definite answer. The question? Who was Jack the Ripper?According to Cornwell, the serial killer who terrorized late nineteenth century England was the artist Walter Sickert (I haven't spoiled the ending for readers; even the book flap reveals this information). Her unwavering solution is entirely reassuring. Although it is refreshing to see her vehemently stand by her accusation, it can also be terribly misleading. She occasionally throws in a paragraph or two on psychopathic tendencies that do not convey coherent messages of Jack the Ripper's motives, or lack thereof. Her generalizations of psychopaths are just that---generalizations. And I am not entirely convinced that she has an expertise in this psychological field. I am convinced, however, that she has done her research and knows the Jack the Ripper era and story as best as anyone possibly could. Some of her conclusions do appear to be somewhat farfetched.However, this is an entertaining read that does offer an extremely plausible suspect. I'm not 100% convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, but because of this account, he does seem to be the most likely suspect. If you are interested in this unsolved mystery, read this. But beware: even after reading this account, it will remain an unsolved mystery."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell, using almost entirely circumstantial evidence, did convince me of Sickert's guilt as the Ripper. Eventually she brought in letters, pictures drawn by him, and DNA evidence to give more credence to her theories.What I did not like was the way she dumped me into the story with so little lead-in. It's as though the first chapter were missing. There was very little about other suspects of the time, and little to show how she latched onto Sickert as the obvious candidate. But we were suddenly there, discussing his (supposed) physical deformities and his seemingly depraved outlook on women, without so much as a thank you.All in all, an amazing effort on her part. I just thought her theories took precendence over her literary abilities."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"In PORTRAIT OF A KILLER: JACK THE RIPPER - CASE CLOSED, crime novelist Patricia Cornwell tackles the true crime genre with mixed results. With the help of modern-day forensics, she attempts to prove that Walter Sickert (1860-1942), an English Impressionist painter, was in fact Jack the Ripper. She lays out an intriguing, albeit largely circumstantial, case. However, one could hardly say that she's managed to do what so many before her have not - that is, close the case.To her credit, Cornwell presents the reader with a volume of evidence that points to Sickert as a viable suspect in the Ripper crimes. She draws on paper, watermark, handwriting, and mitochondrial DNA analysis, and also delves deep into Sickert's personality, expounding upon his childhood traumas and adult eccentricities in great detail.Of particular interest is a childhood condition that may have caused damage to Sickert's penis, perhaps to the point that he was impotent as an adult. Clearly, Sickert endured lengthy hospital stays and several surgeries as a young boy. Unfortunately, hospital records kept during this time were spotty, so it's impossible to tell whether Sickert did in fact suffer from a fistula on his penis - or if the fistula was instead located on his anus (as the more commonly accepted theory goes).Certainly, it's possible that the results of a penile fistula suffered in the days before modern medicine - i.e., the inability to have sex \`normally,' and/or the grotesque appearance of one's genitalia - could cause a man to hate that which he cannot have, that is, women. Although Cornwell assumes that Sickert did in fact have a fistula on his penis as a boy, and was disfigured by the resulting surgery, she has no concrete evidence to support her claim. Since this is a significant part of her argument - after all, she presents it as Sickert's primary motive for the killings - it tends to weaken the rest of her case, which she presents in pieces as she describes the Whitechapel murders.The \\"penile or anal fistula mystery\\" is illustrative of what follows. Cornwell has certainly done her research; yet, when all her digging fails to turn up any conclusive evidence, she shows herself more than willing to take huge leaps of faith. What results is a case built almost entirely on circumstantial evidence. It makes for an interesting read, but to call the case closed is preemptive at best (and, quite frankly, Cornwell comes off much worse, what with the smug, know-it-all tone she takes, particularly throughout the first third of the book).Another major point of contention is that Cornwell explicitly refuses to consider any suspects other than Sickert. She briefly dismisses John Druitt, who committed suicide shortly after Mary Kelly was murdered, but Druitt is literally the only other suspect that Cornwell mentions by name. In fact, she explicitly states that it's not her place to clear other suspects in PORTRAIT OF A KILLER, which strikes me as rather disingenuous (especially when her case against Sickert is so flimsy!). Throughout the book, Cornwell seems so eager (\\"overeager\\" is putting it mildly) to implicate Sickert - continually referring to him as \\"Jack the Ripper,\\" a \\"killer\\" and \\"psychopath,\\" etc. - that one has to wonder whether her inexplicable hatred of Sickert clouded her judgment. Or perhaps mere stubbornness is to blame? It seems that, once Cornwell had her sights set on Sickert, on went the blinders, rendering the author incapable of registering any information that contradicted her theory that \\"Sickert did it!\\"Other reviewers have complained that the book is disjointed. While Cornwell does jump back and forth in time, it didn't bother me. Rather, I thought it was a nice narrative technique. I do agree, though, that the book ended abruptly. One moment, Cornwell is describing how Sickert mistreated his second wife; the next, the poor woman is dead and buried, and so is the book. I'm still puzzled why the discussion ended with the wife's death, and not Sickert's, particularly when Sickert's murderous tendencies (allegedly) continued.Finally, a note on the various formats. I first listened to PORTRAIT OF A KILLER as an audiobook on CD. Kate Burton did an excellent job of narrating, assuming both elite and Cockney English accents with ease. The play-like quality of the book also helps to offset the abrupt switches in place and time. The unabridged version, which I borrowed from my local library, ran eleven discs (the current version available on Amazon, which is listed at five discs, seems awfully short - even for an abridged book).Not long after finishing the audio book, I ran across the hardcover edition at a used book sale and snatched it up. It has a number of pictures, including a few autopsy photos, Sickert family portraits, and snapshots of Sickert's artwork and handwriting, side-by-side with that contained in some of the Ripper letters. After listening to Cornwell's comparisons of Sickert's and the Ripper's (or the Ripper imposter's) handwriting and scribbles, it was interesting to compare them for myself, firsthand. Suffice it to say, I was less impressed with the similarities between the two men's handiwork than was Cornwell.In summary: Serious Ripperologists will most likely hate this book. Very little of Cornwell's evidence is bulletproof, and her arrogance can be off-putting (doubly so to those who have been studying Jack the Ripper for years). Even so, I found the book entertaining and thought-provoking. Cornwell's description of 1800s England and early police work, along with comparisons of modern and centuries-old forensic techniques, makes PORTRAIT OF A KILLER worth a read alone. We'll probably never know who killed Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, and possibly others - or if they were even murdered by the same person - but it's \\"fun\\" to wonder. Cornwell's theory, at the very least, makes for an engaging exercise in \\"what if?\\"One star for the thorough research, another for the author's captivating writing style, and a third for sheer entertainment value."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As a Molecular Geneticist myself, I was very interested in reading this book when I heard about the DNA evidence that was included. What an incredible disappointment! I have never seen such an example of science done badly. What little evidence that is presented (very disjointedly I might add) is drowned by the plethora of assumption and stretching of the data. There were many times I wanted to bring out my red pen to correct the atrocities in this book. I honestly do not know Patricia Cornwall's credentials beyond that she worked for a coroner (but in what capacity? It seems she must done secretarial or janitorial work to have this little knowledge of the topic). Her reasoning is extremely hard to follow, maybe because she is holding it together with such tenuous threads. I guess I would sum up this book in one word -- &quot;aggravating.&quot; Please don't present yourself and your work as &quot;Case Closed&quot; when your case is not based enough on true scientific evidence and method to even bring the case to court."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I will limit myself to the issues with the book as a text and not even delve into the whole believability of Walter Sickert being Jack the Ripper since that is covered in so many other places.Ms. Cornwell needs to acquire an editor ASAP. Seriously this book needs help with everything from the introduction, to the conclusion. Cornwell's first few chapters jump from a graphic \\"imagine if you will\\" type recreation of one of the murders to Cornwell's whining about how she just doesn't want to write this book, even though she, sigh, feels compelled, to a discussion about Sickert's life. How about we try a first chapter that introduces the idea that Ms. Cornwall believes the artist is Jack the Ripper and then move chronologically through time, either from the first murder or Sickert's childhood or Ms. Cornwell's discovery that the artist was the murder through the events to the present day? This book would be so much improved if the author had followed a time line, any time line, from start to finish without her little jaunts off into this or that random subject. Her jumbled ride through the Ripper letters and their comparisons to Sickert's stationary at the end of the work are another example of her inability or unwillingness to follow a time line. The whole thing gave me a headache and I ended up just skipping pages to get on with it. A shame since it might have been interesting.Next, Cornwell really needs to nix the little recreations of the murders and the player's lives. This is not fiction, we do not want you to tell us \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\", it cheapens the rest of the facts and research. All of the constant speculating about Sickert's life, the lives of the women he was involved with, and the murder victims, while entertaining, just gets old. All the \\"I think\\", and \\"it might have been\\" really makes a case that the whole case is too far gone to know anything concrete about anyone involved and does not help the authors case. Every time she said that Sickert could have been somewhere because there was no proof he was anywhere else just got old and silly in a hurry.Finally, I would love to know why there are so few images in this book. Ms. Cornwall is trying to pin some of the most famous crimes in history on an artist, based in part on his paintings. So do we have large color photos of these works for comparison? No. Do we have a nice selection of the pieces she discusses as evidence? No. We do get a few 3 or 4 small black and white photos of a few of his works, and a lot of Cornwell's descriptions. Oh goodie, that should be convincing. I know that full color plates are expensive, but if Ms. Cornwall truly thought she had solved the Jack the Ripper murders wouldn't it be worth her, and her publishers, efforts to present all the evidence possible in living color for the world to see? This was just the final straw for me, regardless the reason financial or just laziness it was a huge mistake to not show as much of Sickert's work for comparison as possible. I don't pretend to know who Jack the Ripper was, nor am I willing to rule out Sickert, or anyone else for that matter, but I do believe that producing a clear, readable book would be half the battle to making an argument. I don't think Ms. Cornwall managed to do that here."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The problems with this book are too many to name. What this author did was zero in on a suspect and try to link him to a crime, rather than zero in on the crime and come up with a suspect. What did she miss? A motive, placement of the suspect at ANY of the crime scenes, any proof whatsoever that the actual killer was the actual writer of ANY of the letters received by Scotland Yard, any link of the suspect to the victims, any indication that the psychological make up of the suspect necessarily means that the suspect is a killer at all, let alone THIS killer. Corwall found a straw and grasped with all her might.But I am going to dismiss all her ridiculous character profiling, and her actually MAKING UP a medical problem (not one substantiated account of this man being unable to perform sexually). I will simply state the \\"if it doesn't fit, you must acquit\\" obviousness here: if the DNA does not place a particular suspect at the scene of the crime then you simply don't have a case. Period. Nothing further needs to be said.Case wide open."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Author Patricia Cornwell is best known for her Kay Scarpetta crime novels. In PORTRAIT OF A KILLER: JACK THE RIPPER CASE CLOSED, Cornwell tries her hand at a True Crime deconstruction of the infamous Jack the Ripper case of 1888. As is well known, the unknown Ripper brutally slaughtered and mutilated at least five prostitutes in the Whitechapel section of London in that year, vanishing into the night and fog of Vanity Fair never to be discovered.PORTRAIT OF A KILLER is rambling and tangential. The last chapters are disorganized and repetitive. This book relies completely on Cornwell's own brand of inductive reasoning. It is thorough in detail (worth a star). Cornwell's talents as a novelist provide a fine sense of place and time. Hence the second star in the scale.Cornwell is neither convincing nor conclusive that Jack the Ripper was in reality the British Impressionist painter Walter Sickert (1860-1942), despite spending six million dollars on forensic analysis of some very slender evidence. It is said she purchased (and destroyed) several Sickert paintings in order to find trace mitochondrial DNA (she denies the destruction). At best, Cornwell proves that Sickert MIGHT have been the Ripper; that's nothing new. He has been a suspect of devoted Ripperologists for years. Sickert was fairly well-known in his day, and associated with, among others, Henry Irving, the London stage impresario. Why Cornwell never mentions Sickert's affiliation with Bram Stoker, Irving's assistant, is puzzling. The coincidental Dracula connection is just the type of factoid Cornwell relishes in this book.From the outset, Cornwell errs in trying too hard to convince the reader that Sickert is the Ripper. No one else is even considered. She is utterly unobjective. In fact, it's not too mild to say she hates Sickert. There seems to be no explanation for her authorial rage. In her overzealousness to convict Sickert she disdains hypothesis, presents all her evidence as if it were undisputed fact and builds her case by piling inference upon inference, always a weak way to structure an argument. Inconsistencies are explained away. Her arguments for Sickert as the Ripper become more fantastical on every page, finally reaching their apex of ridiculousness when she observes that Sickert liked to cook, and that the Ripper might have used a kitchen knife as a weapon. What seems the true physical description of the Ripper as a brunette man is dismissed with, \\"Sickert probably wore makeup and dyed his hair.\\" In line with the same vague reasoning, she chooses to believe that the 'Ripper letters' are all authentic, though virtually every other Ripperologist questions their provenance.From page one Sickert is damned as \\"Mr. Nobody,\\" and presumed to be Jack the Ripper. Cornwell presents Walter Sickert as an egocentric and unpleasant human being with a sexual dysfunction that, she posits, caused him to despise women. This, she says, made him a psychopath (her definition of psychopathy is only loosely clinical). Although Cornwell spends a fair amount of time on this issue, she finally admits that she does not precisely know what Sickert's problem was. Nor does she explain why Sickert's three wives chose to stay married to him if he was in fact so severely dysfunctional in his intimate life.Cornwell also shows extreme antimale prejudice in her stupid endorsement of the absurd opinion that \\"a woman should be able to walk around naked in public and not be raped.\\" So personal responsibility is once again discarded in the Politically Correct universe, and it becomes only the male's task to manage the dynamics of intergender behavior. Not a very Feminist perspective, is it?Be that as it may, none of Cornwell's palaver proves that Sickert was the Ripper. He may have had an awful upbringing; he may have been sexually inadequate; he may have been a compleat misogynist; he may have been egocentric (a tagline that could be applied to many artists, and authors too); but none of that necessarily makes him a psychopath. Even if Sickert was a clinical psychopath, it requires a vast logical jump to arrive at the conclusion that he was a serial killer, and an even grander jump to conclude that he was the most nefarious of that breed.At first blush, Cornwell's presentation of the DNA evidence linking Sickert to the Ripper seems firm, though it quickly falls apart after a second look. To believe the DNA evidence is to trust Cornwell's (admittedly tentative) opinion that the letters are genuine. Even so granting, both the letters and the comparative Sickert evidence have passed through so many hands since 1888 that both chains of custody are long since broken. Cornwell asserts that 99% of the population is excluded by the DNA findings. However, that still leaves 60,000 potential suspects in the London of that era, not a small number. And it also assumes that the DNA in question is Sickert's, not his wife's or the artist James Whistler's, both of whom had ample opportunity to handle Sickert's belongings (or it could be some other unknown third party's entirely). At best, there's proof that the letter writer (who was not necessarily either Sickert or the Ripper) used some of the same run of the same brand of writing paper as Sickert at the same period of time and in the same general geographic area, all hardly unlikely.Cornwell's supposed \\"original\\" discovery of what she claims are Sickert's coded initials on some letters seems to bolster her claims against Sickert. She expresses surprise that no one else ever seemed to notice these inscriptions or connect them to Sickert. It seems such an overobvious clue that the reader has to wonder if Cornwell is seeing something that is not there. Of course, it's also possible that Sickert was one of those weird cranks who enjoyed writing phony Ripper letters. There are hundreds of Ripper letters, the mass of which amount to the usual tangle of false leads the police receive in the course of major investigations. It doesn't \\"prove\\" he was Jack the Ripper. Perhaps if Cornwell were less strident overall, this would seem more convincing.Cornwell argues that Sickert liked to take midnight rambles through London's mazelike streets. So did many other well-known (and unknown) people. Anyone who has been in London knows that it is virtually impossible to go straight from point A to point Zed in that city. Even nowadays, London night walks have their own charm. Such a habit does not infer evil intentions. Neither does the fact that Sickert occasionally shaved his head, though a photograph of Sickert is presented as some kind of visual evidence of soul corruption. The sepia-tinted picture shows a grimly smiling Sickert holding a cane. By furnishing a subtly inflammatory caption, Cornwell clearly wants the reader to have a gut reaction, mentally associating Sickert with such shaven-headed figures as Szandor LaVey, Aleister Crowley, and modern-day skinheads. It's discreditable, it's the worst sort of manipulation, and Cornwell should be ashamed of it.To further buttress her argument against Sickert, Cornwell points to Sickert's paintings, some of which appear to concern Jack the Ripper. Some early sketches \\"show\\" women being stalked (the images are questionable, unclear, and perhaps his father's artwork). A painting of a man sitting in a bed next to a recumbent woman becomes \\"proof\\" that Sickert murdered Mary Kelly. Cornwell invites us to look at the bedframe, which was identical to Mary Kelly's (and thirty thousand other cheap bedsteads in Victorian London). A woman's facial features are obscured---Ripper victims' faces were mutilated---ergo, Sickert was the killer. All this ignores the fact that Sickert was an Impressionist, often using odd, frightening, or even bizarre elements to create mood in his works. Cornwell may be a knowledgeable exponent of forensic science, but she is no art critic.Yes, there is a painting, one alternative title of which is \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom.\\" It is in actuality Sickert's place. The fact that Sickert believed (or wanted others to believe) that he was renting the Ripper's rooms is hardly proof of anything more than artistic eccentricity. Sickert knew he was one of the usual suspects. He, like many artists, had unusual proclivities. For oddity's sake he may have wanted people to wonder if he was the Ripper, even if he wasn't. It's no secret that he found the Ripper fascinating. So do millions of other people. And they're not suspects.In the end, this reader found himself sympathetic to Sickert, hoping (1) that he was really not the Ripper, and (2) if he was, he'd find a way to visit Cornwell's house just to shut her up. She attacked Sickert so viciously that this reader began to wonder if SHE was Jack the Ripper. Cornwell succeeded in doing little here but putting this reviewer off reading any other of her books.Patricia Cornwell spends extensive time involving herself with the affairs of corpses. She's a mystery writer. It would be the height of irresponsibility to assume from her behavior that she was also a necrophiliac. But that is exactly how she treats Walter Sickert. In the proper light her arguments against Sickert all add up to a very uncertain \\"maybe.\\" It would be hateful to convict Sickert of being Jack the Ripper without far more evidence than Cornwell gives us.The inquest continues. The Grand Jury can't indict. The case remains open."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've been a fan of Patricia Cornwell's for a number of years, and once I heard she had not only written a book about Jack the Ripper, but claimed to have definitively solved the case, I couldn't wait for it to be published.Apparently, I wasn't the only one. She must have been in a hurry as well.Overall this is an average Ripper-Lore book. And while Cornwell offers a lot of new insight into Walter Sickert, the man she claims was Jack the Ripper, she didn't completely convince me that Sickert was the Whitechapel Murderer. She did convince me that the possibility exists that he was Jack the Ripper, but only the possibility. She also convinced me that Walter Sickert may have written some of the hundreds of Ripper letters mailed to the police and newspaper, but she fell way short of placing Sickert anywhere near the murders (or Whitechapel for that matter) when the Ripper struck.Let me begin with what I liked about this book:Cornwell gives a good summary of what London, and specifically the East End, was like during the Ripper murders. The plight of the Unfortunates (as the prostitutes were called by the Victorians), especially their daily struggle for food, lodging, and alcohol. She also describes the history of the police force handling the cases quite well.When discussing the hundreds of Ripper letters that were mailed over the years, Cornwell offers more insight into the mind(s) that may have written them than any other author I'm aware of, and it is in this portion where her most compelling evidence is discussed. She herself admits, though, that this wouldn't hold up in a modern court if Sickert was brought to trial today.Where Cornwell fell short:She offers up DNA evidence, from personal letters known to be mailed by Sickert and Ripper letters, but then is forced to quickly dismiss them because the only type of DNA evidence that could be gathered after such a long time only excludes \\"99% of the population\\". Hardly a solid match.Using his artwork, Cornwell claims that certain paintings and sketches Sickert drew over the years were directly inspired by scenes only Jack the Ripper could have seen, but falls short of describing why only Jack the Ripper could have seen them. She also makes the classic mistake of believing that an artist can only create what he has seen. As a writer she should know better, but she continually pounds this point home with description of painting after sketch after painting claiming that he had to have seen it before he could have created it, with no exceptions. This whole assumption is based on one comment Sickert made early in his art career that he could only draw what he had seen. And while this may have remained true throughout his life, there is no such evidence that it did remain true (since he never uttered the remark again), and is hardly worthy of building a murder case on. Cornwell, though, uses this to build nearly half of her argument.It is well known that the first four Ripper murders were not handled well by the newly established Scotland Yard. But the murder of Mary Kelly presented the police with a nearly sealed crime scene and the conservation of evidence that didn't exist up to that point. But Cornwell spends only a small handful of pages describing this fifth murder attributed to Jack the Ripper, in comparison to whole chapters dedicated to the other murders. Why? I can only think that maybe evidence was found that counters her claim that Sickert was the murderer.Before the discussion of Mary Kelly (which was saved until nearly the end of the book), Cornwell spends nearly three times as many pages discussing a murder she herself says did not fit the MO of Jack the Ripper and in all likely-hood was not committed by Sickert. The only connection is a painting by Sickert named after the general location where the murder took place. Again, a weak argument, and not the least pertinent to the Ripper case.Cornwell failed one of the earliest lessons writers are supposed to learn: patience. But I believe she failed it intentionally. There are multiple times in the book where she says that certain results of scientific tests had not returned at the time of publication. These are tests she had commissioned and the results would have shed more light on the case. But Cornwell chose to move forward with publication anyway. Once again, why? If these results could have helped her arguments, why did she proceed without them? If a commitment date had been made by the publisher, this publisher would have pushed off the date in light of new evidence (this happens all the time).Overall, her biggest mistakes were repeated throughout the book. She takes well known criminological or psychoanalytical theory, constructs a theory about the Ripper's motivation, claims that Sickert felt these same feelings based on no evidence or small amounts of circumstantial evidence, offers that as fact, builds another theory on top of it, then claims it as proof positive Sickert committed the murder. She commits the same \\"atrocities\\" she chides others Ripper authors for - makes the facts fit her theory instead building a theory on the facts.If you're a Cornwell fan, you'll want this venture into non-fiction. If you're a Ripper-lorist, you'll want this latest book for your collection. But if this case was presented to a modern jury with Sickert as the defendant, the verdict would be obvious, because there is plenty of reasonable doubt with Cornwell's case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I liked the early Kay Scarpetta novels for the forensic science, but the real \\"victim\\" in every novel is Kay Scarpetta (Cornwell's alter ego) herself. Her career is in jeopardy, her credibility, her niece's life, her own life...The poor ripped-up murder victims are as nothing to Scarpetta's problems.Typically, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" begins with the angst of its author. \\"It has always been easier for me to get angry than to show fear or loss, and I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert.\\" A simple invitation to visit Scotland Yard is fraught with moral ramifications: \\"It would have been a betrayal of what I am and an insult to Scotland Yard and every law enforcer in Christendom for me to be 'tired' the day Linda Fairstein said she could arrange a tour.\\" Her self-absorption is almost comical.Cornwell makes no argument that comes close to justifying her conviction that Sickert was the Ripper. She seems to have formed her opinion of Sickert's guilt based on his art (\\"I saw evil\\"), then examined his life for facts to justify that opinion. Her presentation is poor: Facts about the murders, cultural history of the Victorian era, art criticism, and descriptions of modern forensic science are presented in a random jumble. Her own assumptions contradict themselves; after telling us that Sickert preferred his victims ugly and deformed, she offers no word of explanation as to why the Ripper's most grisly murder was of the young attractive Mary Kelly.I have no theory as to who the Ripper was; he may even have been Walter Sickert, but certainly not based on this compilation of \\"evidence\\"!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've had an interest in Jack the Ripper for the last couple of years, and when I found out that Ms. Cornwell was going to be investing such a massive amount of money and \\"scientific study\\" into determining who the killer was, I was ecstatic. What a great idea for a fiction writer to do right? Unfortunately, I was caught up in the tremendous amount of hype that surrounded this book and failed to see the glaringly obvious flaw: this was a FICTION writer. This fact becomes painfully clear on the first page of the book.\\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would make for a somewhat decent work of fiction. It would make for a mediocre \\"historical\\" fiction novel based on a real event. As a \\"non-fiction novel, it is absolutely horrible, and definitely the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I've never read a Cornwell novel before, but it seems that she is trying to use real people to create fictitious characters. Walter Sickert is the man she is convinced held the secret identity of Jack the Ripper. Cornwell's entire premise for this book is that she would be using the scientific method, and more interestingly, DNA analysis, something that has never been done on the Ripper case. When her DNA analysis and scientific studies fail, she STILL uses the unconvincing results to try to draw definitive conclusions that Sickert was the killer.The DNA \\"evidence\\" that is Cornwell's main link to Sickert and the Ripper, is actually mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA. This type of DNA is actually very common, and is shared by anywhere from 1-10% of the population. Furthermore, Cornwell cannot even state with certainty that the DNA she tested was even Sickert's. How does she explain away all of the eyewitness alibis Sickert had for 4 or the 5 murders, placing Sickert in Paris at the time? She doesn't, she simply ignores them. Her ENTIRE book is based on a wide amount of circumstantial evidence that doesn't even come close to being \\"scientific.\\" Most of the letters she attributes to the Ripper have been widely recognized as hoaxes by the Ripper community.From reading her book, one would think that Cornwell had some sort of personal vendetta against Sickert, as she attempts to portray him as an insane psychopath. What does she use to support this claim? Mainly Sickert's sickening tendencies to take walks at night or paint!Cornwell failed miserably with \\"Portrait of a Killer.\\" She attempted to spend 1 year stepping into a completely unknown field. A field that has been explored by people studying the Ripper and the evidence for decades. Her only advantage over other authors on Ripper books was her budget and access to Ripper documents and testing laboratories. However, when this fails to turn up a single bit of conclusive evidence that Sickert could even possibly be the killer, Cornwell loses her ground and proceeds to recede back to what she does best: writing fiction. Even if her evidence proved without a doubt that Sickert was the killer, the book is so horribly written and jumps around so much, there is no way I would ever recommend it to anyone else.Update: 1 Jan 2012 - This is still in my top three of worst books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"When this book was first released, Cornwell was plugging it on 20/20. I happened to catch the show, and watched the interview. And I must say...I laughed quite heartily at what I heard. Watching her talk as if she were the first person to build a case against Walter Sickert was hysterical. Theories that Sickert was Jack the Ripper have been floating around for over a century...how very innovative of her to jump on the bandwagon.Her claim that the evidence she's collected would be enough to make the Victorians cry \\"Hang him!\\" may be true. But consider that when a man named Squibby, who was wanted for nothing more than a petty assault charge, was seen running from a policeman in 1888 Whitechapel, one man cried \\"Jack the Ripper!\\" and before you can say \\"Bob's your uncle,\\" there was a lynch mob, foaming and screaming for Squibby's blood. Despite police efforts to calm the mob and inform them of their mistake, they still howled \\"Lynch him! String him up!\\" So you see, getting those Victorians to cry \\"Hang him!\\" would be a very easy thing to do. Now, convincing ME...that's not so easy. Why? Because I know too much about the Ripper case to be taken in by this claptrap.The Ripper letters that she based the whole of her research on were BOGUS. Though they were signed Jack the Ripper, they were not written by the killer. In fact, the ONE letter that was most likely real WASN'T signed Jack the Ripper at all. Why didn't she test that one, instead of testing letters that every Ripperologist in the world regards as frauds? Maybe because if she had, she would have come up with no \\"evidence\\" to link Sickert to the murders, and this preposterous best-seller of hers would have never seen the light of day.All in all, the unoriginality of Cornwell's theory, coupled with the overwhelming lack of evidence to support her overblown, self-agrandizing claim that she's solved a case which has remained open for nearly 115 years, make for a wholly uninvolving and repugnantly arrogant reading experience.Don't believe the hype. Cornwell essentially knew nothing about Jack the Ripper before she undertook this project. And so, even setting inaccuracies and outright deceit aside, this just isn't a good or competent Ripper book on ANY LEVEL. Pick up Donald Rumbelow's \\"The Complete Jack the Ripper\\" (AKA \\"Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook\\") instead. At least he knows his facts."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I can't think of another character assassination that is as unfounded as this, based as it is on pure conjecture and highly selective and inconclusive 'evidence'.And just think of the irony of a writer who has based her entire written output on lingering over the sordid details of murder and mutilation claiming that Sickert was a violent psychopath because of the subject-matter of his paintings. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!This book reveals more about the neuroses and obsessions of Cornwell's own sick mind than it does about Sickert. Rather than 'case closed' on Sickert, it is 'case closed' on Cornwell.Cornwell's reputation as a writer of FICTION remains intact."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As Ms. Cornwell herself admitted in the opening pages, she was hesitant to finish this work - she should have acted on that impulse.In brief, this is almost certainly among the least impressive on what has become a cottage industry: books claiming to &quot;solve&quot; the Jack the Ripper Case. Ms. Cornwell does take a novel approach (sort of) in that she first identifies a suspect and then starts building an extraordinarily weak circumstantial case against him. Hardly the way we normally do things in proper law enforcement (or in forensic investigations, for that matter). Though she does not acknowledge this in the text, the idea of Walter Sichert as a suspect was not even original - that tenuous argument was advanced in a 1990 book by Jean Fuller.While Ms. Cornwell has worked professionally as a computer programmer in a medical examiner's office and no doubt added to her knowledge of forensics since, her approach - largely consisting of her subjective analysis of Sichert's drawings and paintings with less-than-keen insight, and with some unproven and overly-generalized psychological theory thrown into the mix - ultimately fails on both an investigative and literary level. With the &quot;evidence&quot; she has revealed, no sane prosecutor would even begin to consider filing an indictment based on such a patently silly collection of &quot;proof.&quot;As regards the supposedly ground-breaking DNA results, they demonstrate that Walter Sichert just MIGHT have, maybe, licked a stamp on letters which she quickly concludes are from the actual killer - again, it would be more effective to conclude that Queen Victoria was the Ripper than to proceed on the premise that Ms. Cornwell has finally &quot;solved&quot; this intriguing murder mystery.Not hardly."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Despite what evidence is presented in &quot;Portrait of a Killer&quot;, any jury would be forced to return the above verdict if artist Walter Sickert were tried for the Jack the Ripper crimes.Does this attempt by Patricia Cornwell close arguably the most famous series of crimes in history? No it doesn't.Does &quot;Portrait&quot; satisfy beyond a reasonable doubt that Sickert killed any of the prostitutes who fell victim to the Ripper? Again, no.So, what does &quot;Portrait&quot; succeed in doing?To begin with, it serves as a thorough background to many topics. The Ripper's victims appear in pen portraits, and it is particularly interesting to read their stories (no matter how truncated) than simply have them as de facto &quot;plot devices&quot;.Cornwell also provides a similar service to the policemen who were involved in the hunt. While her pen may not flatter these men, it does inform the reader that the efficient police force of today has not always been the way.London of the late 1800s is also well described and in more than the bare academic terms found in works of history. As a history student, I have often been frustrated at attempts to explain the squalor and deprivation of the &quot;Unfortunates&quot; - Cornwell's attempts at putting human faces on them is not perfect, but certainly works quite well.Insight is given into modern forensic techniques by a woman who, of all contemporary authors, is probably most qualified to do so. There is also an interesting diversion on the history of the role of the coroner.An attempt is made at explaining the mental condition of psychopathy.Finally, the lives of Walter Sickert (about whom I had never heard before reading this book) and some of his associates are described.Cornwell's &quot;proof that Sickert was the Ripper&quot; falls into the very old trap of selecting evidence to match one's hypothesis, rather than the other way around.We are told, for example, that there are a great many letters purporting to be from Jack the Ripper. Experts have historically dismissed these letters as irrelevant to the case. Cornwell, on the other hand, works not only from the hypothesis that the letters are relevant but that they were all written by the same hand. How can this be when the writing styles are so different? Sickert was an artist and could thus disguise his handwriting. How can we be certain that Sickert could disguise his handwriting? Look at the Ripper letters, they have such different handwriting styles.Another theory deals with the apparent differences in literacy levels from letter to letter. Why do some letters feature bad spelling and poor grammar while others are immaculately written? Sickert wanted to fool the police. Why do the misspellings vary within letters (&quot;will&quot; being spelled both correctly and as &quot;wil&quot; in a single sentence)? Sickert wasn't very good at maintaining this illusion of illiteracy. This comes after Sickert's acting past has been revealed as a means of fooling the police - as the actor could disguise himself.Did Sickert write one or more of the Ripper letters? Maybe. Cornwell tries very hard to prove that he did. Watermarks are analysed and words which appear frequently are written down. In the end, all this proves is that some Ripper letters were written on paper from the same source as Sickert's writing paper and that Sickert shared a fondness for some words with a few of the letters. Sickert's &quot;mania for writing letters&quot;, as it has been described, was nothing out of the ordinary at the time. London in 1888 was without so many of the communication devices we take for granted. Thus it is not surprising that Sickert wrote to friends almost constantly.The centrepiece of Cornwell's investigation appears to be the DNA testing of parts of some of the Ripper letters with Sickert's own letters. What emerges is that Sickert could well have written some of those tested. Cornwell herself admits that the results are inconclusive, thus those who trumpet the &quot;DNA Proof&quot; that Sickert and the Ripper are one and the same are sadly mistaken.Even if Sickert, who Cornwell points out on many occasions had a rather eccentric manner, did write one or more letters, he is still not placed at the scene of the crime. Writing these letters may have caused some nuisance, but there is the world of difference between that and disemboweling prostitutes.When it all comes down to it, the evidence against Walter Sickert is circumstantial at best. Some of his pictures appear to have clues in them as to his &quot;secret identity&quot; or the manner in which he killed his victims. None of this is readily apparent when the reader looks at the pictures in question - much of the case hinges on a shadowy form in one picture which just seems to be a blob, not &quot;the face of a man coming up behind the woman&quot; as it is suggested to be.Indeed, one section of evidence is described in such detail as to be farcical. Cornwell somehow theorises that Sickert would have stayed at a certain guesthouse. When she examines the guestbook for 1888, she discovers drawings and poetry which bear striking resemblances to the Ripper letters. Her suggestion that this proves anything is unconvincing in the extreme: doubts persist as to the authenticity of these drawings and as to the reason that these drawings did not see the light of day earlier.Walter Sickert could well have been Jack the Ripper, although this effort in proving it has quite possibly torpedoed any further attempts at doing so for some time.Those whose interest in the Ripper has been piqued are heartily recommended to make the trip to London and go on the &quot;Ripper Walks&quot; on offer. Of particular note is the &quot;London Dungeon&quot;, featuring an evocative walk through Newgate Prison and then into the streets of &quot;Victorian London&quot; where the guest is to try to catch the Ripper. Perhaps that is the closest anyone will ever come to being able to write &quot;case closed&quot; on this infamous series of events and actually mean it."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book isn't really about Sickert - it's about Patricia Cornwell's relentless obsession. She has committed the worst error any murder investigator can commit; to develop a purely gut-level hunch about a suspect, and continue to believe in it regardless of the actual facts. Besides that, her hunch is illogical and doesn't make sense - she hasn't thought it through.She says she became convinced of Sickert's guilt because of his paintings, in particular a painting which bears an uncanny resemblance to Eddowes' mortuary photo (NOT a crime scene photo, a MORTUARY photo - there's an obviously major difference).Cornwell says Sickert painted it to re-live and fantasize about his crime. If so, why would he paint the mortuary photo and not the actual scene itself? Eddowes' appearence at the crime scene would've looked quite different from the mortuary photo, after her remains had been sewn up, washed and laid out for the moruary photographer.The obvious answer was Sickert didn't commit the murders, instead, it was well known Sickert was obsessed with sleaze and crime, as well as tabloid journalism, and he probably saw the mortuary photo somewhere and painted from the photo - not the actual crime scene. Sickert wasn't necessarily interested in violence per se, instead he was interested in the way violence was being portrayed in the media at the time.Cornwell's assumes Sickert was the Ripper because his art was so strongly suggestive of the Ripper murders (and of violence toward women generally, says Cornwell), but if this psychological notion of hers were true, then ALL artists who portray violence, from painters to filmakers like Hitchcock (does \\"Psycho\\" prove to Cornwell that Alfred Hichcock was a serial murderer?), and even crime writers like Patricia Cornwell all should be suspected of murder. After all, Cornwell herself is known for graphic descriptions of violence in her novels - maybe she is a killer, too?Her relentless obsession over Sickert is deeply bizarre; I watched a BBC documentary about this, (from the series \\"Omnibus\\") and the program made a subtle but clear point: Walter Sickert was not nearly as crazy as Patricia Cornwell.Besides, it's almost 100% certain Sickert was in France during the period the Ripper crimes took place. He clearly wasn't the murderer, yet she continues her crusade against an long-dead innocent man.She'll never admit she's wrong. She would look even more foolish than she already does."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was familiar with Patricia Cornwell before reading this book; I had read several of her &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels before finally giving them up for good as her plots were repetitive, characters miserable, bitter and unlikeable, and themes too depressing to continue reading voluntarily. That said, I thought maybe her nonfiction writing might be an improvement, but it turned out to be just the opposite, unfortunately.This book started out with promise and Cornwell does a good job painting the conditions in London's East End during the infamous Jack the Ripper murders. She held my interest for the first half quite well and discussed some interesting facts involving the Ripper murders, although she had some trouble sticking to those facts at times. For instance, she discusses the &quot;bullseye lantern&quot; used by London police circa 1888, claiming it could only illuminate objects from a distance of six inches, but in a future scene she depicts a constable freely using said lantern to light an area larger than six inches. I thought this was supposed to be impossible.This type of sloppiness aside, the coverage of the Ripper investigation is compelling so long as she sticks to the documented truth. I found that I breezed through this section. However, when it came time for her to wield conjecture that's where she lost me and my respect for the book waned. I didn't find her theories or speculation regarding the identity of Jack the Ripper - that of artist Walter Sickert - to be believable. All she really goes on is conjecture and the blatant attempt to link a lot of &quot;could have&quot; and &quot;perhaps he...&quot; statements together in an effort to paint him as the killer. Cornwell's ace of spades is the DNA evidence which she feels links Sickert to the infamous &quot;Ripper letters&quot; which were sent to the police during the murders. However, the evidence doesn't prove this beyond reasonable doubt as she never establishes that the DNA actually tested belonged to Sickert, nor can she demonstrate that the author of this letter - or any other Ripper letter - actually committed the murders. In Cornwell's view, not only are most of the Ripper letters genuine (i.e. they were actually written by the killer) but they were sent by Sickert. She also ties him to a lot of random murders around England, which makes me find it unlikely Sickert could have accomplished any legitimate work during this time frame, due to this nationwide crime spree and furious letter-writing campaign. Most absurd were Cornwell's admissions that she could not prove such-and-such element to support her story but that nobody could DISPROVE it, which is a classic sign of a weak argument. And she includes a rather acerbic diatribe at one point against those who would criticize her conclusions, attempting to dismiss them as people who just don't get it (I'm paraphrasing her from memory), which I find juvenile.Most of the second half of this book depicts not the Ripper case but the life of Sickert and while Cornwell obviously feels it necessary in order to establish him as the murderer I found these parts tiresome and irritating after a while. She covers the first five Ripper murders and then segues into a seemingly interminable discussion of the aforementioned &quot;random murders around England,&quot; followed up with a painfully long examination of the family of Walter Sickert's first wife, his marriage to his second wife and the aftermath of her demise. It was a blessing when the rambling, swerving vehicle that is this book finally lost its wheels and drifted to a stop on the final page.Ultimately I don't believe anyone will ever prove the identity of Jack the Ripper. Too much time has passed, too much evidence has been lost, and all that is left is hypothesis and personal opinion. Speculation is fine so long as its presented as such, but what sets me off is theory disguised - or even angrily argued - as fact. Cornwell spends an awful lot of time shooting down alternate views and yet expecting the reader to subscribe to hers. For me, the worst part of this book was her melodramatic outburst near the beginning of how tired she was of Walter Sickert and examining his life. Well, nobody really asked you to, lady."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Apologies to all you Patricia Cornwell fans, but I find this to be the worst book to have been written on Jack the Ripper - and the book's subject aside, from a structural point of view, it is a badly written book by any standards. Bearing in mind her background and vast forensic experience, I do not know how Ms Cornwell can justify claiming to have solved a hitherto unsolved case when she puts forward absolutely no evidence beyond her own suppostions, which are based on considerable experience admittedly but which remain shakily founded suppositions, none the less. Add to this that Ms Cornwell is, anyway, not the first person to have connected Sickert to the Ripper killings. I am not, at the best of times, a Patricia Cornwell fan but I bought and read this book with an open mind, believing that she might, indeed, have finally solved the Ripper murders. The book was an enormous disappointment and has certainly not persuaded me to reconsider her offerings in crime fiction."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It is laughable that, on Page 147 of her book, Miss Cornwell speaks of people \\"who weren't even born at the time of the crimes\\" who offer \\"baseless\\" Jack the Ripper theories without ever realizing that she herself is THE prime example of such people.What Ms. Cornwell offers in this mediocre work can be summed up in one sentence: \\"Walter Sickert was 'Jack the Ripper' because I say so!\\" (You can now save your money and the time it would require to read this pitiful book!)At best, she \\"proves\\" (and I use the term very loosely here) that Walter Sickert may have written one or more of the infamous Jack the Ripper letters. However, Ms. Cornwell points out early on that Mr. Sickert had a habit of ingratiating himself into a variety of things, including frequently submitting under pseudonyms letters to the editor of the newspapers which he read. (For what it's worth, there is much debate as to whether any of the letters were written by the actual murderer anyway.) A crank who writes letters does not necessarily a serial killer make!Ms. Cornwell, who insists that there is violence in Mr. Sickert's art even in the paintings where there is none, is now in the company of Richard Wallace who, in his book \\"Jack the Ripper: Light-Hearted Friend,\\" offered - based upon confessional statements derived from CREATING anagrams of Lewis Carroll's writings - that none other than the creator of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Caveat emptor! This book does not, once and for all, solve the mystery of the Ripper's identity. In fact, the arguments made in support of the guilt of Cornwell's suspect do not even make out a convincing case that she is on the right track.There can be few more damning allegations than to accuse someone of being one of the most notorious, sadistic and misogynistic serial killers of all time. When such claims were made during the accused's lifetime, he (or she) was at least able in theory to offer a defense. But long after the Ripper's death, dozens and dozens of suspects have been offered up by authors with varying degrees of objectivity, integrity, honesty and fairness. In all those cases, the counter-arguments had to be made by others who had studied the reports of the crimes, and who often succeeded in discrediting the new theory. But permanent damage to the reputations of many perfectly peaceful and respectable members of England's citizenry was done, as they would forever be linked in the minds of some with ghastly brutal mutilation murders because of irresponsible speculations.Thus, anyone approaching the case after almost a century of mostly armchair sleuthing and conjecture, should be on notice that pointing a finger unswervingly at a contemporary of the crimes is not an endeavor to be undertaken lightly. Rather, humility, intellectual honesty, and an openness to evidence that may contradict a working hypothesis are vital. None of those qualities are in abundance in this book.Despite a long-standing fascination with serial killers, Cornwell apparently was completely unfamiliar with the Ripper case until a chance encounter with a senior Scotland Yard official who directed her attention to Walter Sickert, a well-known painter, as someone worth further study (even though he had previously been named as one of a trio of Rippers as part of the Royal/Masonic conspiracy theory most recently featured in the movie From Hell, and, over a decade ago, by Jean Overton Fuller, as the lone butcher in her book, Sickert and the Ripper Crimes.) That suggestion prompted Cornwell to spend a year and a half, and, according to press reports, $6 million of her own money, to study Sickert and establish his guilt.Her proof consists, in essence, of: 1) some inconclusive DNA evidence that cannot be linked to Sickert or the actual killer; 2) evidence that Sickert used stationery that was also used by some of the cranks who wrote to the police claiming to be the killer; 3) her interpretation of Sickert's paintings as proof that he was obsessed with the Ripper. She only weakens these already tenuous contentions by spending time arguing points such as that Sickert was probably the killler because his friend Whistler used the phrase \\"ha ha,\\" and so did some of the letters ostensibly from the Ripper. (She also finds significance in the fact that Sickert liked the word \\"fools\\", a term that also appears in some of the Ripper letters.) None of this is actual proof of anything that implicates Sickert. Whether he was a moral paragon or not, he does not deserve to have his memory tarnished by unsupported charges. Despite its author's celebrity, this is not a serious work of true crime, and adds nothing of merit to the ongoing debate about the Whitechapel murderer."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The book changed from an interesting exercise to junk-mail when she pulled her \\"case closed\\" scam. That was nothing but an invalid sales \\"hook\\" to attract attention and aid sales. She knew nothing of the Ripper and only investigated one suspect, puppet-like, in response to direction given by John Grieve of New Scotland Yard. Then everything was manipulated to try to support this prior decision as to Sicket's guilt. A major manipulation was to conclude that the majority of Ripper letters (between 250 to 600 is the range identified by researchers) were authentic and written by the Ripper. This enabled her to take any words, any drawing from any of theses letters and state: Yes! These are from the Ripper's pen. But note her statement before she realized the absolute need for this skullduggery:\\"...When I first began to go through the Ripper letters, I concurred with what the police and MOST PEOPLE believe: almost all of the letters are hoaxes or the communications of mentally unbalanced people...\\" (The \\"most people\\" refers to thousands of researchers over a period of 110 years.Her absolute bias is revealed in her statement when she heard that just one of her theories (the water marks) may have been reputed\\"... I immediately returned to London and discovered to my HORROR that the A Pine & Sons watermarks were not on Ripper letters but on the stationery the Metropolitan Police were using at the time. I was SHOCKED. For a moment, I was completely UNNERVED and THOUGHT MY LIFE MIGHT DISINTEGRATE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES...\\"Her attempts to make out Sickert as having murderous instincts from his art are boloney. She has to apply convenient \\"translations\\"; like a pearl necklace on a portrait is really a \\"slashed throat.\\" Cornwall claims that a portrait of a seated clothed model shows the type of facial mutilation (actually just shadows on the face) that he inflicted on Catherine Eddows and thus he must have seen the mutilations to have painted them 15 years later. But elsewhere she notes that the Eddows murder was conducted in a 5 minute slashing frenzy in an unlit place \\"too dark\\" to see. She claims that Sickert is tied to some pencil sketches that were found in the collection of Sickert's artist father. How? Simple; she claims \\"some believe\\" that they were done by Sickert. Incidentally the sketches are mundane; do not show violence.Cornwall admits that she has no evidence that places Sickert in London at the time of the murders, but just falls back on a pathetic ploy that she uses hundreds of times: \\"Well he COULD have been!\\" There is, in fact, very good reason to believe that Sickert was in France for the entire period of the murders. Cornwell acknowledges one letter from France but scorns it triumphantly as \\"No postmark. No proof of date\\" She ignores 3 or 4 other letters from various people that place him in France at the time.This is a novel by an imaginative novelist and not a research report by a competent researcher."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have just managed to get through this book, though it wasn't a noteworthy experience. Cornwell's tone throughout the book suggests grand arrogance and her deductions are based more on supposition than fact. The use of &quot;may be,&quot; &quot;could have been,&quot; &quot;quite possibly,&quot; and a host of other statements of supposition are rampant in the book. To repeatedly refer to Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper in her unabashed tone--without more concrete evidence--could be potentially liablous. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sickerts family or estate took legal action against Cornwell.Cornwell is obviously out of her league when writing a book of this nature, and she should stick to what she appears to know best: fiction.Bottom line: From the literary point of view, the book drones on in a rambling manner. And, as stated, the facts don't match her conclusions. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patracia Cornwell sets up an intruiging arguement for Walter Sickert being Jack the Ripper. She also paints a vivid and moving portrait of each victim, allowing her hands to get dirty in late 19th Century London. Her research and her investment in this case is undeniable. One has to admire her for the strength of her convictions. However, I suspect none of it would hold up in a court of law.What appears to be presented here is a meticulously researched circumstantial case. For instance, there is no concrete evidence that Sickert's genitalia was hideously deformed by a series of operations as a child. Cornwell provides no accurate medical record of his condition or diagnosis. While, the question of a penile fistula is an informed one, it is by no means as conclusive as Cornwell would lead one to believe.At the very least, one can be convinced of the possibility that Sickert wrote his fair share of the infamous Ripper Letters. The results of her DNA testing seems to rule out a large number of the Victorian populace. While this may prove that her subject had sociopathic tendencies and a disturbingly sick sense of humor, it by no means convicts him of the crimes of which he is accused.While certainly a compulsively entertaining read, the are two elements that consistantly distract from the proceedings. One is the overwhelming arrogance of Cornwell's tone. A little humility would have lent more credibility to her arguement. The other, is her tendency to jump around chronologically. One gets the sense this was written in a state of obsessive fury. Perhaps if Cornwell had taken a more speculative stance, her theory would appear less biased. The result is an atmosphere of sensationalism rather than hard fact. Despite all this, her opinion demands respect. The lasting impression is not one of a &quot;case closed&quot; but of an ongoing investigation."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am no fan of Ms. Cornwall's; in fact, I dislike her work and her persona. I am, however, fascinated by Jack the Ripper, so, grudgingly, I gave this book a cursory glance, and was not surprised in the least, given the arrogance displayed in the title, that it fell far short of the statement: Case Closed. The world has waited all these years for P. Cornwall to come along and solve the case, (or so we are supposed to believe...)single-handed, well, not quite, in fact, not even close. It takes skills far beyond her grasp to ever have a resolution to this famous case, and buying the paintings of an artist connected to the actual killer (no, big surprise, it was NOT Mr. Sickert)does not a solution make, especially one worthy of the statement &quot;case closed.&quot;She takes the loosest of circumstances, many, if not most, completely unsubstantiated, and cobbles them all together into her own personal vilification of Walter Sickert, who has NEVER been considered a viable suspect, and now certainly will not be for anyone who reads this venomous and wholly inaccurate fabrication. It is a glaring example of an author's popularity going to her head and force-feeding her own opinions based on evidence as substantial as wet Kleenex, to her &quot;public&quot;, bestowing her largesse on the populace. The one even remotely viable discovery was a DNA test of envelope glue used by the Ripper and some DNA found in Sickert's overalls...of course, if you read &quot;The Final Solution&quot; by Stephen Knight, that will be explained, for Stephen Knight's book actually puts many pieces together, in a far more coherent way, than does this mendacious and fallacious work of fiction. Happy and content with her own delusions, Ms. Cornwall can laugh all the way to the bank with her personal, vitriolic diatribe of Mr. Sickert published; one can only thank God she was not around in the 1880s, for she would have started a witch hunt to rival those of Salem in her blind zeal to punish her own victim, Walter Sickert; fortunate too, that he is not around to see her destruction of his works, which were more original and far more impressive than anything she will ever produce in her lifetime. One matching watermark, on a Ripper letter, and that of Sickert's stationer father, do not a conviction make...nor does the shredding on canvases convince anyone that she has in fact come even remotely close to being able to state: case closed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ok, I admit I'm not totally convinced Sickert was Jack the Ripper, although Cornwell does make a very convincing case for him. What I will say is that the book is extremely interesting and I had a hard time putting it down. I think many of the poor reviews here spring from the fact that a lot of the fascination with \\"Jack the Ripper\\" is that his identity is a mystery - do we really want to know who he was? That said, what we do get with this book is a very well written account of a 19th-century man who could have been JTR. The author also does a great job of immersing the reader in the Victorian era - her research into her subject matter is suberb."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend who is a fan of Patricia Cornwell. Realizing that I am a fan of true crime, she thought I would enjoy this book. While I finish every book I read, I could not bring myself to finish this book. I thought it was terrible.First off, Cornwell uses the word maybe so liberally that its usage in itself challenges her credibilty. At times, she seems to be throwing theories around as if she is throwing spaghetti against the wall to see if it will stick. Cornwell spends nearly 15 pages describing the potential abnormailities of her suspect's penis. She spends pages throwing around these possibilties. This is not the type of reading I want to unwind to in the evening. All of her theories are based on circumstancial evidence. Realistically, a mildly compelling case can be made for almost anybody living in London during this time. The identity of Jack the Ripper will probably never be known. In this book, Patricia Cornwell has written some amateur caliber fiction, but she certainly has not brought us any closer to knowing Jack the Ripper's identity."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I don't understand why people are so hot under the collar about this book. It does present an interesting (albeit circumstantial) case against Sickert. However, every Jack the Ripper theory that I've ever read has been highly circumstantial. I concede that putting \\"Case Closed\\" in the title is over the top. When you make a claim like that, your facts should be airtight."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Patricia Cornwell's highly publicized and rather controversial look at the infamous Jack the Ripper killings is an interesting book into which the author has obviously poured countless hours of hard, painstaking research and leg work, and that, combined with the writer's evident sense of justice, is to be much praised and admired. As a thoughtful examination of one possible angle on the Ripper murders the book largely succeeds; as the airtight posthumous indictment it is supposed to be, however, it comes up short.Cornwell makes several highly questionable decisions in making her case. She relies heavily on some rather tenuous DNA from the time of the killings, evidence which in this scenario is far too thin for the emphasis the author attempts to hang on it. Her analysis of the suspect's psychological makeup and actions during the period in question are composed largely of speculation and guesswork, devoid of the kind of hard evidence I had hoped to discover. Cornwell's confidence in the numerous \\"Ripper Letters\\" the police received at the time is hard to swallow, and requires some highly unlikely--though admittedly not impossible--legerdemain on the part of her suspect. Most disturbing is that Cornwell seems to have chosen this suspect very quickly after looking at the Ripper case file, and one has the feeling she has then simply rearranged much of the available information to suit her own presupposition. That her suspect was at least eccentric and may have had some glaring personal deficiencies is hardly debatable, but that does not automatically make him a serial killer.As a literary work Cornwell's book suffers from a pair of serious drawbacks. First, the arrogance with which she approaches the case is nearly embarrassing. She shows no respect whatsoever for others who have published theories on the infamous Whitechapel slayings, and very little for the police who actually worked on the case at the time. Cornwell's apparent disdain for those who have gone before her is annoying and frequently distracting. Second, the book is badly organized and heavily padded, as the author jumps from one train of thought to the next in no recognizable pattern so as to frequently leave the reader backpedaling to try to catch up, a problem exacerbated by the fact that the book is about a hundred pages too long. Many of Cornwell's personal commentaries and historical notes are repeated over and over to no obvious purpose. A tighter, more pointed text would have benefitted the author's case immensely.Despite its glaring weaknesses, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is a commendable book in many respects. I would certainly recommend it to Ripper buffs, students of Victorian England, or mystery fans in general. If the author's evidence is not irrefutable, it is at least thought-provoking, and evidently Ms. Cornwell continues to follow up on some of the evidence as we speak, so perhaps an updated edition will tie up some of the loose ends. Maybe she's even right. Time will perhaps tell. But as of right now \\"Portrait of a Killer,\\" though admirable, hardly lives up to its subtitle. A thoughtful, well-researched re-examination of the most infamous serial killer of all time? Certainly. But case closed? *No.*"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is garbage. Cornwell labels Strickert,who is obviously dead and not able to defend himself, a serial killer. She ought to be ashamed of herself. Cornwell's book is called \\"case closed.\\" What a joke. You could never get a conviction in court on the evidence she presents. Furthermore, she's a boring writer. ..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although at times entertaining, this book was a real chore to plow through. In fact, I found myself skimming the last few chapters just so that it would end quicker. I agree with earlier reviews that call the book disjointed and disorganized. Cornwell makes no effort to put anything in chronological order, which is not necessary if there is another type of organization to take its place. But there isn't. Within each chapter, the information is haphazardly put together; many times a few different topics would occupy the same chapter. I wondered aloud if the editor ever even read the book.All of this really takes away from any that might be interesting. Cornwell's argument is so confusing and has no direction. She never builds up a case. The writing itself is poor and simplistic.That being said, her research has some merit, and I did learn a lot about law enforcement in London in the 1880s. However, I was VERY VERY disappointed."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although I enjoy her fiction very much, this book is extremely difficult to read. Her thoughts appear jumbled and disjointed. Very difficult to follow. I seriously considered not finishing the book.In addition, although she does provide some interesting information, it is clear the she is overreaching to &quot;prove&quot; the identity of Jack the Ripper. Too much speculation to be of any real worth.However, the photos she provides are intriguing."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This book is, in my opinion, nothing more than a glorified comic book. While mildly entertaining, especially in the first few chapters, it quickly begins to bore me with the endless graphic and horrific descriptive terminology. While the nature of the subject matter certainly entitles the author to use descriptions of the crimes that are sickening, she loses no opportunity in her attempts to shock the reader. With every reference to the victim of one of these murders, even innocuous ones, she feels compelled to include descriptive words such as gutted, eviscerated, split open, etc.This predilection towards the use of repulsive terms is not the worst this book has to offer, however. This author seems to be torn between writing a factual book in which she purports to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper, and writing another piece of fiction. There is actually very little in the way of concrete evidence presented in this book. The vast majority of what she uses to \\"convict\\" Sickert is total and complete fabrication on her part. She uses her \\"what-if's\\" and \\"might-be's\\" to concoct elaborate scenarios that quickly are transformed into her evidence. She sometimes states that she has no actual evidence to a certain bit of information being true, and then has the gall to state that she also has no evidence that this information *isn't* true. That methodology will certainly allow one to draw upon anything in the realm of possibility and turn it into \\"evidence\\". What little actual evidence that she is able to relate, and this is only if we are to believe what she states is true, all falls into the weakest form of circumstantial evidence. If you eliminate everything in this book that is conjecture on the authors part, then you would have very little left with which to convict anybody, let alone write a book on the matter.Yes, I was mildly titillated by various sections of this book. However my actual interest in continuing to read page after page of this nonsense ceased well before I reached the mid-point. I had to force myself to continue to the end. I knew that there would be little else revealed of any real consequence and that one can only be enthralled with shocking descriptions a limited number of times before they simply become tiresome.I confess that I have never read one of this author's novels. I only read this \\"novel\\" because of her claim to have solved the mystery of Jack the Ripper. Hopefully her other books are more interesting and believable than this \\"factual\\" account of a real serial killer. This account of Jack the Ripper is no more the truth than would be a Superman comic book, and far less enjoyable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was very anxious to read this book, but the hype outdid the reality. I have loved all of Cornwell's fiction and believed this would be in the same style, even though it is non-fiction. Wrong! I have 2 major complaints about this book.First, as other reviewers have said, she seems to have made her decision as to who the Ripper was and then pulls together evidence that supports her claim. She talks repeatedly about how little evidence there was and how hard it was to find much of it. Since it was so hard to find what she does have, how much evidence did she not find - evidence that could clear Stickart's name? When writing fiction, the author needs to first determine the solution and work backwards, building evidence for that ending. Real life doesn't work that way.Second, the writing does not flow well. She bounces from subject to subject with little or no break. Many times I found myself flipping back through the pages, trying to find when she changed thoughts and to what.All in all, this is an interesting study into the Jack the Ripper case. However, I feel Cornwell has gone too far in saying she has, hands down, solved the mystery"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell's theories about Walter Sickert, where based on evidence, are reasonable and worth a look if you're a Ripperologist open to considering all theories. If your interest in Jack the Ripper is more passing, you'd do well to pass on this book. Cornwell undermines her case at the start, when she describes her feelings while walking on a city street at night. Her statements that she knew who Jack the Ripper was and that she wasn't wrong, especially as described in such an emotional context as urban fear, outweigh any sense of objectivity in the rest of the book.In the end, Cornwell offers more insistence than evidence that her theory hits the mark, let alone that it closes the case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Ripperologists have a passion that rivals that of Talmudic scholars and an ability to savage any position that runs counter to their own. Therefore, it is not surprising that Patricia Cornwell's attempt to close the case of Jack the Ripper would be met with disdain, hostility, and outright invective.Of course Cornwell claim that the artist William Sickert was Jack the Ripper is open to debate. We need to remember that EVERYTHING involving this case is open to debate. One of the initial decisions you have to make in trying to reason out the real identity of the Ripper is to determine who his victims were. Even the acceptance of the canonical five (Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) is a basic assumption that is easily called into question. Stride and Eddows were both killed the same night; Strides body was not mutilated, the assumption being the killer was interrupted. The horrible mutilation to Eddows' face is assumed to be because the Ripper was enraged that he had been interrupted in his first killing. But what if Eddows had not been killed? Would we still assume Stride was a victim of the Ripper? If Eddows had been the sole victim that night what motivation would we have ascribed to her mutilation? Any and all assumptions made to deduce the Ripper's identity are debatable.For most people familiar with this case the most astounding part of Cornwell's case against Sickert is the argument that he wrote MOST of the Ripper letters. The assumption has always been that only one or two of the letters might have been real, so Cornwell is making a radical argument in this regard. Ultimately this is the strongest part of Cornwell's case, especially given her repeated observation that these letters are confessions as far as the law is concerned. Given the prolific number of letters Sickert wrote to newspapers in his life, it would not be farfetched that he would do the same thing as the Ripper.The other key part of Cornwell's argument is the psychological profile of Sickert. The problem is that this is more of a premise in the book than a cogently laid out argument, with bits and pieces scattered throughout the book. I think the problem is more organizational than argumentation and I would have appreciated a more clinical presentation of the profile.The weakest part of Cornwell's case is also her strongest. Cornwell dredges up everything from Sickert's life and work that she can use to pin these crimes on the artist (e.g., suggesting an unopened letter by his first wife given to her sister contained suspicions Sickert was the Ripper) and there will be times when you think she is pushing it. But the sheer volume of accusations is such that you have to be open to the possibility that some of them are valid. From an argumentative standpoint, she does not have to be right on ALL of these accusations to prove her point; she only needs to be right on some of them.One of the things that makes me think Cornwell might be right are the argument raised against her thesis. Cornwell repeatedly points out that she does not have \\"hard\\" proof of Sickert's guilt, so pointing out the inconclusiveness of her DNA matches is irrelevant. Yes, there is evidence that Sickert was in France during some of the killings, but Cornwell deals specifically with the problems of that evidence (Sickert claimed to be in France with friends who were no longer there, etc.). To be fair, it is hard to make substantial arguments against Cornwell's case in the context of a review limited to 1000 words, but you still have to deal with the specific points she raises. In the end Cornwell rests her case on an accumulation of coincidences sufficient enough to have Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve and an expert on the Jack the Ripper crimes to endorse her conclusion by saying he would be happy to put the case before the crown prosecutor.One of the other things that works against \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is that Cornwell uses more of a disjointed narrative structure than an argumentative one. The six murders that Cornwell ascribes to Jack the Ripper serve as a basic chronology for the book, but interwoven are chapters devoted to various parts of Walter Sickert's life that are unstuck in time. At one point I was convinced that maybe an editor had decided to rearrange these chapters and that I might be able to put all of them in a more traditional chronological order. With each of the murders Cornwell provides the main details and then talks about the limitations of forensic medicine at that time in contrast to what could be done today. \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would work better if it were divided into a section that looks at the murders and then another making the case against Sickert.The book is illustrated with tinted autopsy pictures of the Ripper's five canonical victims, including one of the horrible human wreckage of Mary Kelly. Cornwell uses these images, not only as a way of remembering the victims, but usually with the additional goal of showing how they are reflected in Sickert's artwork. Certainly the book would have been enhanced by more reproductions of the various works by Sickert that Cornwell alludes to in making her case. As it is, the key examples here have to do with the Ripper letters, the Lizard House guest book, and sketches known to be by Sickert.Despite the presentational problems, \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is going to be required reading for Ripperologists, all of whom will make of it what they will. Just be sure to read it before you dismiss it (or diss it). This is not something akin to the creative fantasy of Alan Moore's \\"From Hell.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"While exhaustively researched, this book makes only a midly compelling case that Sickert is Jack the Ripper. It is extremely long on speculation and forensic detail, and extremely short on deduction or evidence. A great deal of time is spent discussing the Ripper letters and postcards and their watermarks, but there has long been questions about the veracity of most of these documents. At best, Ms. Cornwell paints Sickert as an unlikable individual who may have indeed taunted police for his own perverse pleasure without having anything to do with the actual crimes. After all the hype, I was more or less disappointed in what this book actually delivered."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I agree with all those who said Cornwell picked her man and then looked for any evidence she could find that supported her case. I hate to be cynical, but this is no different than what Prosecutors and police do in the United States on a regular basis. The suspect is identified and then the evidence is gathered to convict.Cornwell's website contains a recent update in which her expert on papers and his company have concluded that two Ripper letters and two Sickert letters are conclusively from the same 24-count package of paper (the cut ends match up with one another microscopically). So I think we can conclude Sickert wrote many Ripper letters. The question is whether there is enough in these letters that suggests they could only have been written by the killer.On that score, I'm not entirely convinced. Did Sickert have a penile anomaly? He was married three times and fathered no children. He is not known to have fathered any children (Joseph Sickert's claims are a joke). He did not contest Ellen's adultery claim in her divorce papers, but back then \\"irreconcilable differences\\" was not a valid option for a woman to seek a divorce. He told someone later he was happy to be free of Ellen. Why contest it, then? He had nothing to lose.Someone earlier claimed there are several sources \\"proving\\" Sickert was in France when the murders took place. This is not true. While there are no other \\"London\\" sketches dated after August 4, there is nothing until September 6 to indicate he was in France. That is a letter by his mother. He could easily have arrived on September 1 (one day after one of the murders) and left after his alibi was established (September 6 or 7) in time for the Sept. 8 murder. There is another letter by his friend Blanche that says Sickert visited Blanche's father on September 16, but no murders were committed between September 9 and September 29. While his wife Ellen claimed he was in France, he frequently disappeared on her for weeks at a time without stating where he was going. It would be odd for him to go to France at that time, according to Cornwell, when all his friends would have left. It's true he titled a painting of a Dieppe butcher shop \\"The October Sun\\", but that's pretty meaningless if he is the killer, since he titled it himself. There's nothing inherent in the painting that proves it was painted in October.I think many of those dismissing this book are doing what Cornwell did--they decided to dismiss it even before reading it and are looking for 'evidence' to support their viewpoint.I think this book, taken in conjunction with Fellows' book on the same topic, is compelling although not 100 percent conclusive. I think the amount of time and expert analysis spent on the case by Cornwell goes further than any other treatise on the subject.DO we discount the initial police work done in the 1800's? I think you have to, given the tremendous advances in psychology, criminal science, and medical science. There was simply so much that wasn't known. These people still believed masturbation would make you go blind and that you could tell by someone's physical characteristics what kind of 'criminal' they were. They did the best they could under the circumstances, but they lacked the education, training, and science available today. (And let's face it, even today's police/prosecutors make mistakes--look at the Central Park jogger case.)My main compliants about the book are that it's too expository. There's a lot of fanciful imaginings of what Sickert might or might not have done (like going to see John Merrick at a freak show) that are not relevant to the case. A book like this should be presented like a scholarly legal argument, and it is not. There is no timeline (I can't believe there's no timeline!) and all the material about Cornwell's personal interest or issues with doing this book would be better contained in a preface.I think if the book were more concise and the facts presented in a more compact fashion, the book would have had more success in making her case.One of the problems with using Sickerts' paintings against him is that in those times, inquests were open and the media reported on the bodies. He would have had easy access to the bodies, and indeed not everyone who attended those inquests or followed the case was Jack the Ripper. Look at how many people watched the OJ trial. A fascination with the morbid (which some of us have or wouldn't have bought this book) does not prove a psychopath.I would have liked to see a more fair-minded presentation that included exculpatory evidence as well and credited the reader with the intelligence to reach a conclusion."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"All Patricia Cornwall's novel convinced me of was that Walter Sickert was a man quite obsessed with Jack the Ripper. Does that mean he was The Ripper himself? Hardly. His obsession does appear reflected in his art and he may have written a few of The Ripper letters. Again, this does not make him the actual murderer - especially seeing that many of these letters were considered hoaxes. Sickert's seeming obsession with The Ripper isn't all that difficult to understand, given the sensationalism of the crimes and the furor they undoubetly created. The Sickert therory is an interesting one. But that's all it is, a theory based on circumstantial (albeit intriguing) evidence.I also didn't find the book particularly well organized. The chronology of events is choppy and difficult to follow at times. Her concluding chapters are oddly anti-climatic and, in my opinion, unconvincing."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was highly disappointed with this book. I expected much more from Cornwall as a writer.The subject of Jack the Ripper is immensely interesting but the tale told in \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is dull and drags on with no end in sight.I was so excited to finish this book even though the next book I had to read was for my PhD class.From now on I will definitely stick to Cornwall's fiction, if I even read anything written by her again."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was very disappointed. Patricia Cornwell is a gifted writer and her research was extensive, but she really missed the mark on Jack the Ripper. Most of her points to proove Sickert was the Ripper was reaching at best, sometimes laughable. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There's one key problem to Patricia Cornwell's JACK THE RIPPER: CASE CLOSED book...she forgot that people just don't want the mystery and legend to be definitively solved. In a day and age where we still cannot convince 100% of the population that humans have been to the moon, for her to think that DNA, hand-writing samples, crime scene evidence, and detailed research, forensic, and historical work would lead to a solution that the populace would except...haha...not going to happen.So, Patricia Cornwell believes that artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She backs this theory up with fact (many supported by picture evidence) and attention to detail. Furthermore, as much as she's been attacked for her theory, let's not forget that she wasn't even the first author to broach this idea but author Donald McCormick had a similar idea in his novel The Identity of Jack the Ripper.Certainly Sickert shows signs of a troubled psyche and an odd happenstance of being physically near all of the canon-5 and future murders (both in and out of Whitechapel). Heck, the man even painted a picture titled JACK THE RIPPER'S BEDROOM. But for my money the key selling point is the similarity in the Ripper Letters and correspondence and a hotel ledger that show Sickert's writing and doodling matching exactly with each other.Now, this all said. ME - I agree with Patricia Cornwell. I understand that other Ripperologists are terrified of the crime being solved or, GASP, of a woman solving the crime. And, in fairness Cornwell's prose and overall structure of the novel seem quite amateurish. It certainly was a mistake to not write the novel in a more chronological order.Still, as a fan of true crime novels and history, I enjoyed the avenues that I was taken along in this book and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn more about Jack the Ripper and the evidence that still remains."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I decided to purchase Patricia Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer after reading about it in an article. I found it to be a rather difficult read. Her narration jumps from past to present to past again in a flash with no rhyme or reason. I expected her to start out with a certain outline of describing the crimes, then moving on to her theory of who committed those awful hideous murders, then on to explain her evidence for Jack the Ripper's true identity. Unfortunately, she completely lost my interest with her constant need to insert information not pertinent to a particular chapter. She would talk briefly about one crime, then get into detailed evidence about Jack the Ripper and his true identity, then start describing a scientific process to identify mitochondrial DNA, then go into great detail about letters \\"Jack\\" supposedly wrote from 1888-1937. She then briefly moved on to another victim. And that's all in just the first 3 chapters. I felt that the victims were virtually ignored in this book, surprising considering it's a book about the crimes that claimed their lives. Most of the information in the book is completely unsequential and doesn't provide for the good chronology I was looking for. I would find myself getting completely absorbed in certain personal parts of the story, then that section would abruptly end. I also found it bizarre for the author to include her imagined versions of possible conversations the Ripper or his victims may have had in the course of their lives. It didn't really fit with the overall tone of the book. If I were to base my review on structure, I would give it one star. The structure of the book aside, I do believe Ms. Cornwell did her homework and did a remarkable job researching conditions of the time and also amazed me with the sheer amount of evidence she unearthed to support her theory. I, for one, completely agree with her as to the identity of Jack the Ripper. It is simply irrefutable. However, I must say I expected a smoother read from such a well-known author. The content of the research is what saved this book from a dismal review. The book is worth the money I paid just to learn more about the cases and the man himself, but I doubt that I will pick it up again."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have only been reading Patricia Cornwell in the last 5 years. While in a bookstore a chap came up to me and said...her newest books aren't very good, she seems to be more interested in putting out books quicker and quicker, and hasn't done her homework on forensics. In every book I've read, Scarpetta seems to get more neurotic, than do her job. Ms. Cornwell, keep up on the forensics...your books are becoming very boring for us who like to follow the evidence. You may have to take a fresher course in order to write your books...but...that takes time, and you can't push the books out as fast. Did you not have another novel come out at approx. the same time as Portrait of a Killer? Maybe you didn't spend as much time as you should have on this book. If Helen, Sickert's sister was so famous, could you not get DNA off of something she wrote?? Mitochondiral DNA comes from the Mother...maybe a relative?? Maybe you were afraid after spending all that money to find out the truth. Sorry, theories were intersting, but a DA wouldn't even take it to court."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This is easily the worst Jack the Ripper volume in existance. Patricia Cornhole has written an unscientific, inaccurate and historically inadaquate book of no importance or redeeming value. After reading this awful blight of a book, we are no closer to solving the identity of Jack the Ripper. In fact we are further away from that elusive goal."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"This was all hot air and hype and not worth the good money I paid for it. Borrow this book from a library if you really want to read it but don't waste any cash on it because you will probably be disappointed.PC's smugness is now repugnant, her condescending attitude has simply worn me down and bored me to tears. Coupled with her inflated ego of her own \\"greatness\\" she has become someone so far removed from her readers that she may as well live on Jupiter.She is out of touch and clearly burnt out."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It seems that Jack the Ripper must necessarily have been-on his free-time-a Victorian celebrity and not a horse slaughterer or one involved in one of the more common occupations of the population of Whitechapel. There is Lewis Carroll, Prince Edward and half the Royal Court of England, businessmen of note--and so forth. Sickert joins this lot as a famous person and the 'argument' that he is JTR is as tenuous, or worse, than the aforementioned Ripper candidates. We could add Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who had published A Study In Scarlet in 1887 and had showcased a doctor back from the brutal Afghan war--now there is a grand suspect. Wonder where Doyle was on those key dates? And then there is William Morris...or perhaps Ruskin hired someone to.... No real evidence against Doyle, Morris, or Ruskin either.This work by Cornwell is nothing more than another one of her novels, only here there is pretension to truth and a slur upon a long-dead artist. Those interested in the case will find much more scholarly fare in The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Philip Sugden or the Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion edited by Stewart Evans and Keith Skinner. Neither of those works claims to solve anything, though they may point a careful reader to a real solution; at the very least those works will relegate the Sickert-solution to the same bin as the Royal Conspiracy, the Masonic Conspiracy, and the host of other famous candidates."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Over all I feel that this book, though presenting a very interesting and AT TIMES, compelling theory of the case of Jack the Ripper, was not as well organized as I would have expected. The author often repeats herself and the various sections/chapters frequently begin talking about one thing and then switch topics right in the middle with little or no transition. Furthermore, there was alot of teasing in the book with the author beginning a section by opening a particular thread without ever elaborating. I was left several times feeling very disappointed.The theory of the book was interesting and I feel might have been more persuasive it the book had been organized better."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If there is one theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper there are probably a hundred. Thanks to Patricia Cornwell there are now a hundred and one. Unfortunately, the case does not appear to me to be quite as closed, as the title would suggest. Cornwell simply makes too many assumptions and there is no real proof of her theory. Much too often there are lines such as there is no proof that her \\"killer\\" was in London at the time of a murder, but there is no proof that he wasn't.The \\"killer\\" the author names is the artist Walter Sickert. She offers as her first piece of evidence that Sickert was born with a genital defect and that the three operations to fix the problem may have left him deformed and unable to have sex. That of course led him to hate women. Freud would have been proud of Cornwell. She alleges that it is possible that he never consummated his marriages. However, since he was married three times it seems impossible that such a thing would not have come out. He was also accused of adultery in his divorce from his first wife and was said to have fathered a child by a mistress in France. Cornwell's theory is possible, but it seems a little farfetched.Cornwell's evidence concerning some of the Ripper letters is far more convincing. The same DNA shows up on stamps from one of Sickert's as is found on two Ripper letters. The Ripper letters being notes someone sent to the authorities and the press claiming to be the Ripper. She does a good job of showing that Sickert was probably the author of some of these letters. However, the police at the time didn't consider these letters to be genuine and they can't have been as dense as the author would have us believe. Given Sickert's personality, which Cornwell deals with extensively, it seems obvious that Sickert would have thought it great fun to make up these letters so he could be a part of the story. As for the details he knew he seems to have been fascinated by these murders and could likely have found out most all of his information from the police.Finally, Cornwell argues that Sickert's art gives him away. It is true that some of his art is disturbing but given his fixation on the Ripper case it is not at all unreasonable to expect to find some similarities to the Whitechapel murder scenes in his art. He was also fixated on World War I and hung around hospitals drawing the dead and dying though I doubt he was responsible for the war. The author also makes much of a painting Sickert did of his own bedroom which he called, \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom\\". The problem is that Sickert probably rented the room in the first place because the landlady was convinced that Jack the Ripper had once lived there.Cornwell may have indeed named the real killer, but I doubt it. There are just too many unanswered questions. She has however, added another name to the list of possible suspects and has done an enormous amount of research. Research which may end up helping name the real killer, if he is indeed ever found out. One will most assuredly find information here that will not be found in other books on the subject. Being a novelist, Cornwell has also turned out a very readable book and I enjoyed it very much. I just don't think she has solved the crime."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"No previous author has applied such powerful forensic knowledge and imagination to these murders. Her case is compelling but inconclusive: &quot;case closed&quot; should not be in the title. She leaves no doubt that Sickert would be pulled in today for interrogation and forensic tests which would clinch the matter. As it is, a sick temperament and artistic imagination, opportunity, and a possible fascination with these murders are not enough. Even if he did write some/most of the Ripper letters, for which she presents a strong but unprovable case, even this cannot alone convict him. Ironically, the moment when I felt most convinced was when I looked into his eyes in one particularly chilling photograph of Sickert. A riveting read, full of information about the history of crime, forensic technqiques, and much else. But case not yet proven; possibly, at this distance, unprovable."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have read several books on the Jack the Ripper and although I don't fully agree with Patricia Cornwall's theory, anyone who insults her writing style and evidence did not read the book very carefully. She brings new light to the case with use of forensic science, as well as an incredibly researched history of Sickert. She presents him as a wounded, and psychologically damaged man, and her evidence was quite compelling."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I went into this thinking I wouldn't buy any of it, having heard Cornwell's theories debunked by several &quot;Ripperologists.&quot; It seemed like a stretch to base the idea of Sickert's guilt on some similarities in his doodling &amp; sketches on the letters the Ripper sent to police. But after having read the book, I'll admit she paints a pretty convincing argument. Sure, she definetly jumps to some very big conclusions at times, as if she didn't have quite enough evidence to support her theory, but there are also enough interesting details to leave me mostly convinced. I'm sure no one will ever conclusively solve the Jack the Ripper case, but it's interesting to read people's theories."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Although I enjoyed reading the book, I simply did not find the definitive proof that Cornwell promises. One should not subtitle a book &quot;Case Closed&quot; unless one can provide far more proof than what Cornwell has provided. She makes a great circumstancial case, but that is not enough. The things that Cornwell says she sees in Sickert's works were a stretch for me to see. I saw her Diane Sawyer interview before the book came out. In it, she linked Sickert to crimes in Paris. Apparently, Cornwell couldn't cough up enough evidence to support that theory because no French murders were mentioned in the book. An entertaining story, but not the stuff that closes the book on a notorious case."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If you like the Cold Case show on the A&amp;E channel, you will thoroughly enjoy Patricia Cornwell's evidence on the cold case of Jack the Ripper. But--though she presents very hard circumstantial facts to persuade the reader that artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, Ms. Cornwell also presents rather lax circumstantial facts relating to other murders that may or may have not been the work of Sickert. This could leave the reader scratching his or her head as to &quot;why?&quot;All in all, it was a very enjoyable book even though it was on the technical side, but you wouldn't expect anything else from Ms. Cornwell. The circumstantial evidence she discloses is well documented and well versed. It is a shame she was not at the O.J.

Here is a stunningly terrifying description of what he went through and how it rendered him impotent and with a lifelong need to murder women. By the way there is no actual proof for anything described (though none of his wives or mistresses specifically denied it). Now that we have these facts let us draw some further conclusions to prove his guilt....For example, Jack the Ripper was in a certain borough on a given date and although correspondence indicates that Sickert was out of the country who's to say he wasn't lying?Are you convinced by these arguments? Good. Neither was I. The case is most definitely not closed.Having said that I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's fiction including this book."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"ARGHHHHHH.... It's so incredibly frustrating when someone who is known to be a good writer turns out such a tortuous and disconnected book as this one turned out to be. Cornwell obviously did the research, but the blasted book reads like a notebook of oddball notes she wrote to herself while doing the research, rather than in organized chapters presented in such a way as to make her case. She really should have known better than this.That is not to say that the information is not interesting, or that she could have made the case after this many years that this guy (if you can call him that) actually was the Ripper. The information seems to be there...what was the problem? A chapter on this guy's background and family, a chapter on his possible medical problems and the agony that must have accompanied it. A chapter on his wife and her family, a chapter on his presence in London during those times. A chapter on the massive amount of writing he did, and the comparisons between his writing and the Ripper's writings. A chapter on the possible victims elsewhere in England, and speculation of grisly finds on the Continent. This type of order would have made this book so much better.As it was, Cornwell seem to be writing in disassociated thought, which may be great for poetry, but is not a good methodology for history. Even if she was in a rush to get this book out before someone else, the publisher didn't bother to bring up the collosal disorganization of this book?A mortifying disappointment...this book goes to the library.Karen Sadler,Science education"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"There are many good books about Saucy Jack; this is not one of them. Cornwell's book is so error-strewn that I felt I was reading one of her works of fiction, rather than a \\"factual\\" treatise on the Ripper. If you have the gross egotism to put \\"Case Closed\\" on the jacket, you'd better have more to offer than some of the flimsiest \\"evidence\\" I have ever seen for convicting one of history's most notorious killers. (By the way, I personally do not subscribe to the notion that \\"Jack\\" was one person; at least two of the deaths attributed to him are sufficiently different that they were almost certainly not his handiwork. But back to Cornwell.) It's hard to know where to begin with the catalogue of mistaken information in this tome. Cornwell does a good, if transpontine job describing Victorian London, and she has obviously done her homework on the decidedly unpleasant Walter Sickert. But the praise ends there. She repeats so many myths, inaccurately reports so many facts, conjectures so many events and conversations, that when she does try to present scientific evidence (DNA, watermarks, etc.) one is already too suspicious to lend credence to her theory. She can't even spell the name of of one of the victims correctly; she gullibly repeats the error on Catherine Eddowes' grave marker and omits the \\"e\\" (thus, Eddows) from her last name. (Every other document, including her death certificate and contemporary police and newspaper reports, spells it with an \\"e\\".) Other errors in simple fact abound, too many to list, but so easily identifiable that one senses that her \\"researchers\\" were laughing all the way to the bank. So, too, were her editors and proofreaders; this book is replete with spelling mistakes, syntactical and grammatical errors, and an overall sloppiness in construction that destroys any credibility the author was hoping to establish. ..."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Having never read a Ripper book before this one I was not sure what to expect. What I didn't expect was a biased conclusion on who the the Ripper was from almost page one, based on flimsy and circumstantial evidence from the start of the book. The author tried to convince and convict from an early point in her book that Walter Sickert was the murderer of the East End London women who had the musfortune to cross his path in late Victorian London. Evidence is circuital at best and far reaching at the worst; there is not a shred of direct evidence linking Sickert to the crimes he is accused of. If one eliminated the &quot;could haves&quot;, &quot;might haves&quot;,&quot;possiblys&quot; and &quot;maybes&quot; this would have cut the book in half; having never read this author before I sincerely hope this is not her best effort."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The majority of the content in this book is uninteresting digressions about life in London at the time of the Ripper murders and about modern forensic techniques which had no relevance to the Ripper case since they didn't exist then. The \\"Case\\" that Ms. Cornwallis considers closed is built on flimsy innuendo. Notably, she feels qualified to diagnose her target, the painter Walter Sickert, as having a psychopathic personality based on scanty evidence largely consisting of examples of his not being nice to people or determines that he must be the killer since some aspects of some of his paintings \\"resemble\\" some aspects of some of the murder scenes.Still, I might could forgive some of that if the book weren't so incredibly dull.

In my view, Cornwell MAY have proven that Sickert wrote one or more of the Ripper letters, but does that make him the killer? Otherwise, she seems to read a lot into his &quot;dark, violent&quot; art work- so much so that it almost becomes laughable. Does every drawing or painting of a woman really look dead? I don't think so. What Cornwell proves is that Sickert was probably a sicko, but she really stretches and uses a lot of supposition to link him to the kiilings.Aside from all that, the book is just plain poorly written- jumping from subject to subject with a few paragraphs thrown in that have nothing to do with the surrounding text.This comes off as an unworthy vanity work by a successful novelist."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"What could have been a fascinating topic and analysis of evidence turned out to be a poorly organized and awkwardly written account of the author's attempt to &quot;expose&quot; Jack the Ripper.

Walter Sickert would be metaphorically \\"rolling in his grave\\" with laughter at all the amateurish outrage expressed on his behalf here at Amazon.com.Patricia Cornwell has done a good job of digging up and sifting through very old and inconsistent evidence. She (unlike this site's reviewers) took a lot of time to conduct a thorough investigation, make careful consideration of events, and consult with a number of ACTUAL EXPERTS in fields related to her investigation of the Ripper crimes. These experts would not have gone out on a limb to participate in, and be quoted in association with, this investigation if it were as shoddy as many of this site's critics contend.It's true that a lot of Patricia Cornwell's arguments are conjecture based on events and activities that occurred a long tim ago. She herself says so. But the preponderance of facts leads to a singular conclusion: If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, guess what?The crimes are more than 100 years old. It's impossible to trot out eyewitnesses and bring forth the murder weapons and bloody clothing. Patricia Cornwell makes a good case with all of the facts and expertise available from the past 100+ years. If you don't like her conclusions or how she arrives at them, so be it. Certainly no amount of evidence that exists could satisfy your standards. A lot of people are much happier holding to the Ripper mystique... unsolved! unsolvable! forever!For those of us who do believe that old crimes can be revisited and perhaps solved, this is a valuable contribution to available writings on the subject."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I was looking forward to this book, having seen Ms. Cornwell interviewed on TV about it. However, I came away deeply disappointed.Ms. Cornwell fills the book with speculation, rather than evidence. And some of the specualtion is shockingly weak. For instance, during the period of some of the killings, Ms. Cornwell was unable to find any evidence that Walter Sickert was NOT in London; which she takes as evidence that Sickert was the killer. If Ms. Cornwell doesn't know that he wasn't in London, then she doesn't know that he wasn't in Moscow. Should we blame him for murders in Moscow during that period? Some to think of it, she doesn't know that he wasn't in Paris; Berlin; Rome; Oslo; Dublin. The list is long...We are also treated to pages of speculation about the nature of some medical treatments that Sickert received as a child, based on a single remark a Sickert nephew made to the author. We don't know whether the nephew's remark is fact or family lore. In any event, it sends Ms. Cornwell off on a lengthy and elaborate set of speculations about whether Sickert was capable of having children... or even urinating normally!

Her books instantly cap bestseller lists and intrigue readers throughout the world.This time out Cornwell tackles one of the most puzzling cases in criminal history - Jack the Ripper. Utilizing her considerable forensic and investigative skills the author proposes the identity of this mad killer who terrified Victorian England.No one is better suited to bring this story to life than the acclaimed Broadway and film actress Kate Burton who reads the abridged cassette and CD editions. Her stage trained voice brings depth and resonance to this absorbing tale.Kate Reading, the gifted member of a prominent London theatrical family who has read novels from the Kay Scarpetta series, renders a flawless performance in the unabridged edition.As crime and history buffs well know at least seven women were brutally murdered in London's Whitechapel area during the year 1888. The gruesome nature of these slayings brought forth a nickname for the feared killer - Jack The Ripper.For well over 100 years Jack the Ripper has stood paramount among the world's most troubling unsolved crimes, and the unknown killer grew to be a demonic figure remembered in literature and lore.Using all the state-of-the-art tools at her disposal as well as access to Jack the Ripper files, Cornwell reveals that Walter Richard Sickert, an illustrious Victorian Era painter, is, indeed, the dreaded murderer. According to the author Sickert was an evil serial killer who penned the letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the news media. She further shows in detailed analyses of his paintings that his art reflected the mutilation inflicted upon his victims. As Cornwell unearths the artist's birth defects and his upbringing she is able to present the history of a classic psychopath.Cornwell is unique in presenting the netherworld of the depraved, while at the same time introducing the miraculous investigative methods now at our disposal. Combine those traits with the tongue of a born storyteller, and you have quintesSential Cornwell at the top of her game.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am looking forward to reading this book.

I give it 2 thumbs-up!!"},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"As far as I am concerned, she...nailed it. Walter Richard Sickert *WAS* Jack the Ripper. It seems like everyone else who read this book has never, EVER read anything else about the Ripper murders-they simply relied on stories told over and over and over again, and were, of course, disappointed that real life does not read like fiction.&lt;aside>Don't you people know that things that happen in the real world do not mirror things that happen in fiction or on the television?The real world *is* much drier to read. If you could read autopsy reports (real ones-not fiction) and *real* police reports and what they *really* do, you wouldn't be nearly as interested as you are now in shows like CSI:Miami and Boomtown. They make it more interesting so that you will tune in each week. You see, most of us realize that the REAL WORLD doesn't work like that.&lt;back>Cornwell successfully shoots down every other 'suspect' in the Ripper murders and follows Walter Sickert throughout his life, even with the very little information (directly from him) that she had to workwith.No one here has yet brought up the fact that Walter Sickert's genitalia (if you could even call it that) was less than perfect and had undergone three horrific and vicious surgeries (keep in mind that this was the 1800's and they didn't have things like general anesthesia)to attempt to 'correct' his defect.Am I the only one who sees just how important that one piece of information is???In case some of you other people have never read anything remotely *TRUE* about serial murderers, you would know that this is an incredibly interesting situation that young Sickert was in and how his genitalia (or lack thereof) would greatly impact the rest of his life.I think that everyone else who read the book was really hoping that the Ripper *was* part of the Royal family or that he really *was* Queen Elizabeth's doctor (who, as Corwell points out, was in his 70's when the Ripper murders began in 1888). I think everyone else who read the book was disappointed that there wasn't enough evidence to point the finger at Sickert.I humbly argue that there was more than enough evidence against Sickert-using our forensic techniques, of course. In 1888, I doubt the police would never have even looked upon Sickert as any kind of threat. Cornwell proves this by supposing (and it is an excellent supposition, given the attention to detail Sickert used in this painting) that Sickert had convinced the police that he was an artist and would like the chance to sketch the body before they brought the wagon to carry the body to the morgue. The police LET him into the crime scene. Needless to say, at that point, the police obviously didn't know that the perpetrator often revisits his crime scene.The police just had no idea that the Ripper would look so 'normal' on the outside.I also have an encyclopedic book that chronicles all of the police reports, all of the sketches, pictures, etc. from the Ripper murders. I do wonder why Cornwell didn't use this book (maybe there were copyright issues) to help prove her point. Reading the encyclopedia is DRY and just goes to show that the police were *way* out of their league with the Ripper. I can't tell you how many different reports (about the same murder) that I have read and how dry they were and how, at the end of the report, they would admit that they had not gotten anywhere closer to solving the crimes. The police, used every diagnostic (and misleading) tool they had at the time to help catch the Ripper and they were unable to.Cornwell has used MODERN FORENSIC SCIENCE to prove that Walter Richard Sickert WAS/IS/AND WILL ALWAYS BE JACK THE RIPPER.So, if you don't want to read a fantasy book about Jack the Ripper , I would suggest you pick up something from the 1970's (I can't remember the name of the book) that will enable you to continue your ridiculous belief that Jack the Ripper is someone he is not.Now, if you want to read a book by a well-respected female author who took the time (and had complete access), used whatever forensic tools were available to her in the 21st century and proved that Jack the Ripper was Walter Richard Sickert (and NO ONE else!), then you should pick up Corwell's book.I, for one, was completely enthralled by the book, but then, I live in the real world and not in a fantasy land where others believe that Jack the Ripper was a doctor or a policeman or something MUCH more exciting than a fledgling painter.She figured out who it was and the only reason she is getting such bad reviews from everyone else is because they expected the Ripper to be so much more than a pathetic painter who enjoyed ripping up Unfortunates.He's not a Royal. He's not a policeman. He's not a doctor.He is Walter Richard Sickert. And he is Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"It is evident the Ms Cornwell really did her homework in researching this book, and the results are excellent. Not only does the author make a compelling and convincing case for her nomination for Jack the Ripper, her book goes into the details of the period; the characters who voluntarily or otherwise became involved in the case of the ripper, and without doubt one of the most graphic descriptions of what passed for living in the East End in the 19th century - so far removed from the mansions of Mayfair and Belgravia.Ms Cornwell's hard work has paid off royally."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"If one is expecting a story about Jack the Ripper this is not the book to read. It's a very hard read but a most informative documentary type non-fiction book. The athor did her usual excellent job of writing and her research and investigation was outstanding. If the author is a student or intern, this should have been her thesis. A really inquisitive Jack the Ripper enthusist would be amazed at the detailed investigation and painstaking effort to decipher the information contained in the many, many documents and art work the author and her assistants reviewed. I am convinced that Walter Sicker was Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"JACK THE RIPPERREVIEW BY SALLY RAMAGEOF\\"PORTRAIT OF A KILLER:JACK THE RIPPER CASE CLOSED\\"by Patricia Cornwell, Sphere Books, Little, Brown Book Group, London, 2003. ISBN 978-0-7515-3359-0Patricia Cornwell is the Director of Applied Science at the National Forensic Academy. Her book is so gripping that I read it from first page to last page without putting it down.It is obvious that the writer is a criminologist. She wrote this structured book with a beginning, middle and an end.She tells the reader at the beginning that she concludes that Jack the Ripper was no other than Walter Sickert the artist. She then takes the reader through all the evidence and there is little doubt that her findings are sound. Cornell's writing is objective, scientific, methodical, and intelligent.She reminds the reader that the \`Jack the Ripper' killings were British and I can see reflections of the Jack the Ripper scenarios in the \`Yorkshire Ripper' murders. It is clear that Cornell had examined a vast amount of evidence, primary and secondary and these are listed in the back pages. She was assisted over many years of research by a whole team of forensic investigators and in the book, she acknowledged their contributions.Her \`terms of reference' were to consider the extent of Jack the Ripper's unlawful activities. She then considered the motives for these murders. Obviously, she could not interview the killer, so she relied mainly on primary and secondary evidence about Sickert the artist.I can see her use of Karl Popper's scientific methods. Popper suggested that one should look for instances that confirm or verify one's theories and Patricia Cornwell demonstrated this. She explored unsuccessful avenues as well as those which uphold her theory. She writes (pg 133), \\"computerised image enhancement detects hundreds of grey shades that the human eye cannot see and makes it possible for a fuzzy photograph or erased writing to become visible or discernible. Whilst forensic image enhancement might work with bank security videos or bad photographs, it does not work on paintings. All our efforts accomplished with Ennui (one of Sickert's paintings) was to separate Sickert's brush strokes until we ended up with the reverse of what he was doing when he put the strokes together.\\"One is reminded repeatedly in this \`Jack the Ripper' case, that forensic science does not and will not ever take the place of human detection, deduction, experience, common sense and very hard work.Patricia Cornwell's book concentrated on the number of women who were murdered by \`Jack the Ripper'. Cornwell also concentrated her book on the conduct of the police investigation, the conduct of the coroners and on the death certificates issued after eachprostitute was murdered. Cornwell concentrated on the fact that social explanations often pinpoint which social group is more vulnerable to a phenomenon than others while psychological explanations identify the social group more likely to be vulnerable than others.There is much concern and theorising about serial killers nowadays (see Simpson (1980); Leyton (1986); Seltzer, (1998);Grover and Soothill (1999); Soothill ( 2001); Smith, (2002) and Peters (2005).I could see leanings in the book to Leyton's central thesis of homicidal protest. Leyton's thesis is that that the criminal offence of murder is a form of homicidal protest. Leyton concludes that homicidal killings are committed by frustrated members of the middle classes usually. Leyton said that, occasionally , serial killings contain a metaphor from the earlier era and that serial killers interrupt the lives of prostitutes and runaways because, in the killer's distorted mind, he assumes that these women deserve to be killed as punishment.. Criminologists Kelly and Radford also hypothesised that violence against women is a reflection of a patriarchal society Criminologists Grover and Soothill theorised that when women such as prostitutes are murdered, it is because they are increasingly seen as a socio-economic burden on society. Grover and Soothill's theory concluded that British serial killings reveal that Britain is inadequate in its provision of social and economic protection of the poor and vulnerable. Serial killers prey on the vulnerable and in Britain, the vulnerable are those who cannot compete within the structural conditions of patriarchal capitalism- those who, for various reasons, are unable to retort against those whom this patriarchal capitalism adorn with power.Finally Patricia Cornwell brings the reader to conclusion that the artist Sickert was the murderer \`Jack the Ripper'.She revealed that DNA results from an anonymous letter to the police from the killer compares well with a letter to someone from Sickert's mother. DNA testing has become an established part of criminal justice procedures, and the admissibility of DNA in court today is routine. This technology is highly sensitive and can generate a reliable DNA profile from a crime scene stain that is as small as the size of a pin head. Both Sickert's written letter, the anonymous letter to the police and Sickert's mother's written letter contain part of the same DNA sequence. DNA evidence is biological evidence. Biological is a type of physical evidence. Biological evidence is not always visible to the naked eye.DNA analysis is similar to fingerprint analysis in how matches are determined. Evidence collected from a crime scene is compared to a known sample. If each feature is not identical, the DNA evidence is determined NOT to be a match and therefore did NOT come from the suspect. When a crime scene profile does not match any stored profiles, it is possible to undertake further testing to see if it partially matches that of a genetic relative. Familial searches in the UK today can only be conducted with the specific authority of the Custodian of the NDNAD(National DNA Database) and there are legal parameters for use of the NDNAD, these being the prevention and detection of crime; the investigation of an offence; the conduct of a prosecution or the identification of a deceased person. The aim of familial searching is to provide legitimately useful intelligence in solving crime and there are instances in which its use is able to be justified, such as tracing the relatives of an unidentified serial killer.The weak point of Cornwell's argument of DNA match, though, is this - the chain of custody of evidence is a record of individuals who have had physical possession of the evidence. Documentation is critical to maintaining the integrity of the chain of custody. Maintaining the chain of custody is vital for any type of evidence. In addition, if laboratory analysis reveals that DNA evidence was contaminated, it may be necessary to identify persons who have handled that evidence.In processing the evidence, the fewer people handling the evidence, the better. There is less chance of contamination and a shorter chain of custody for court admissibility hearings. The Jack the Ripper case is very old and who knows how many people have previously handled the evidence?Because extremely small samples of DNA can be used as evidence, greater attention to contamination issues is necessary when identifying, collecting and preserving DNA evidence. DNA evidence can be contaminated when DNA from another source gets mixed with DNA relevant to the case. Saliva on the envelopes or the letters was probably tested. Saliva is the fluid that moistens the mouth. It is secreted from three sets of glands. Screening for saliva is based on detection of high levels of amylase in the sample. It is not a confirmatory test as amylase is found in other body fluids.Saliva contains ABH substances, especially in secretors. Saliva samples (spit or buccal swabs) are often taken as reference materials for determination of secretor status.. Stains can be typed using absorption-elution or absorption-inhibition.If Cornwell's team had confirmed the DNA match by testing for body fluids on both letters, they would know that DNA typing has become such an effective tool in forensic biology that almost all of the traditional techniques have fallen into disuse but they may have used some old techniques which are still used in the examination of body fluids. Cornwell may have used the technique of serology, the detection, identification, and typing of body tissues, either in native form or as stains or residues left at a crime scene. Most often, the tissue of interest is a body fluid such as blood or semen; however, other tissues such as hair or bone are encountered. The detection and identification process begins with a physical examination, followed by a screening test, and may include confirmatory identification and sample typing.All in all, Patricia Cornwell's book is a very convincing read. What is interesting is the renewed interest in the artist Walter Sickert. There is to be a London painting exhibition, on 25 October to 20 January, of Walter Sickert's paintings of the Camden Town Nudes. Against contemporary conventions of the idealised nude, Sickert depicted his naked models in the shabby interiors of Camden Town bedsits, investing the images with the disquieting themes of prostitution and poverty associated with this working class area of North London where he lived and worked.The exhibition in London will bring together around fifteen of the principal canvases from private and public collections and will assemble Sickert's four so-called Camden Town Murder paintings.. Sickert's characteristic method of painting was in the reduced, almost grisaille quality of his tones. Many of his paintings depict the interiors of music- halls & theatres. Previous exhibitions of Sickert's paintings have been held at the Tate in the year 2006, and in the year 2000 at the Fine Arts Society, London. The exhibition in the year 2000 marked the publication of a book titled, Walter Sickert: Prints by Ruth Bromberg. The exhibition showed some of Sickert's finest paintings, drawings, prints & some letters & telegrams from Sickert. The fevered interest in Sickert and his paintings has even inspired an essay competition at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.Patricia Cornwell, as well as her scientific and biological analysis, has, as a criminologist, read all the literature on Sickert, including these texts:* Whistler, \\"Cross-examination in the Trial of Ruskin for libel-1878;* Sickert, \\"Mr Whistler and His Art\\" The Artists and Journal of Home Culture, 1st Jan. 1884;* Sickert \\"Is the Camera the Friend or the Foe of Art\\", Spectator Magazine, July 1893;* Sickert, \\"All the greater draughtsmen tell a story- A critical calendar\\", English Review.

Cornwell knows there is a lot of information, and she succeeds at making it palpable. There are great descriptions of the crimes and of the people involved. Some might say that it is repitious, but it's not. So many of the crimes are similar, being that they were all done by a serial killer.I am a lover of pretty much all that is Jack the Ripper, and this book shows the murders from a new angle. This book is a ton of information, but it is amazingly detailed. I was never taught this stuff in school and it was never even mentioned. It is so undeniably interesting to know all this information.I know a considerable amount is Cornwell connecting the dots for us, but make up your mind for yourself. Answer for yourself whether or not something is over the top, so to speak. It is a great, strange portrait of Walter Sickert. It is a book that one could see as the author trying to convince you that she is correct. I see it as book that knows we will never know the true Ripper and that this is a very likely suspect. In the end, the book is well thought out and endlessly interesting."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I have never read the author's fiction books, and the people who have seem to think that fiction is all she is supposed to write (&quot;Self-righteous&quot; and &quot;unsympathetic&quot;? Because her protagonist, Kay Scarpeta, is female and females aren't supposed to be hard-nosed and dedicated to doing their jobs? Please!).That said, the majority of these reviewers must have been reading a different book that I read. It held my interest from start to finish. She makes a solid case for Walter Sickert being Jack the Ripper.Case solved, as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"The butchery of Jack the Ripper caused widespread panic and solidified the concept of serial killing. Reading horrific details of how the 'unfortunates' (prostitutes and other victims) were murdered made me lose sleep. As a woman, I was outraged; I'm sure this fueled Cornwell's zeal, too.I agree with many reviewers that Cornwell's chronological order can be confusing -- she does 'jump' or fast-forward a few years, then, the reader is prepped for the gruesome Mary Kelly slaying. Say what you will about Cornwell's writing style, but I find it compelling and vivid. It's far from tedious. Comparatively, many books from the true-crime genre are difficult to follow, certainly, more dry and clinical in style. True, we don't want a sensationalized, overwrought account of Ripper crimes -- the horror of the acts is plenty sensational enough.Cornwell's use of 'probable' rather than certainty in her narrative contributes to a sense of a scientific investigation. The title is therefore misleading, \\"Case Closed.\\" Yes, she does present a convincing presentation, mainly via circumstantial evidence, that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. But she does use \\"could have,\\" rather than \\"did,\\" much as does a journalist relies on words like \\"alleged.\\" Thus, the subtitle is confusing.Her strong personality comes through, yes, in describing how modern forensics and police methodologies wouldn't have bumbled as 'coppers' in the Ripper's time did. But, Good Lord, that was in 1888. Fingerprinting was just really emerging as a forensics tool. Given her background, I could see how frustrated she might be if she was investigating or a colleague was -- all the way, the Ripper is taunting, ridiculing the police for their ineptitude.What I know about serial killers, (and I'm no expert), is that they revisit or fantasize about their murders. They relive the experience. Bundy allegedly crawled back to his murdered victims and applied garish makeup to their dead flesh. Here is Sickert, then, reliving the murders via his \\"art\\" -- sketches, paintings, etc. Plus, being a prolific writer, as well as skilled in disguising his handwriting, he deluges police administrators with written 'rants' and taunts. You can almost hear the 'n'yah, n'yah' behind every note.Perhaps one of the most compelling parts for me, was the discovery of the \\"Guest Book\\" from an inn. Experts linked thosedrawings to Sickert's doodles and comments, as well as to Ripper notes. Gave me a shudder.The Sickert aficionadoes decry Cornwell's assertions as madness; Sickert was an influential English artist. Why can't a celebrity also be capable of murder or a crime? Interestingly, I discovered that Caravaggio, another famous artist, was also connected to a murder (or murders).Sickert, like other serial sexual psychopaths, relived his fantasies via his artwork; his egotism and narcissism is reflected in his interpersonal relationships and how he constantly wrote -- whether articles or Ripper notes -- this is a man who demanded to be heard.Many may disagree with me, but Cornwell convinced me. Sickert was Jack the Ripper."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell has succeeded where too many other Ripper writers have failed -- she has revived mass interest in one of the most notorious murderers in history. Her case is carefully examined and thoughtfully presented in her famous concise style. There is little reason to question her research or the validity of her findings, even if one disagrees with her final conclusions. Perhaps the subtitle, \\"Case Closed,\\" has engendered a backlash among Ripper experts, but it would be foolish to judge an entire book on one unfortunate term. This is probably the best overall Ripper book penned for sheer writing style alone, and an excellent introduction to the London that produced the monster. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\""},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I've always been interested in the Jack the ripper mystery, and was very impressed by this book. Because Cornwell's research was detailed and comprehensive, she makes an extremely convincing argument. Over the years many people have claimed to have solved this case, but Cornwell's use of modern forensic tools to identify the ripper had never been attempted before. The fact that her suspect was a very popular artist in England, and never considered a prime suspect before, makes her book all that more interesting. She convinced me."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Not only was this a well researched and written book,I belive it to be the most convicing book on who Jack the Ripper was.I spent most of my life in Law Enforcement. In an Crimnal Investigator capacity. I have read almost all of the books on this Subject. The evidence is really quite convencing, for this old of a crime.I belive that the author,has her man. When there is this much evidence,you just cannot walk away with a reasonable doubt. At any rate, a person who have to read almost all the books on the Ripper's case. To see what I mean.Mrs. Cornwell done a supreme job! I too would take it into court. I belive a Judge would convict. I never try to guess a Jury."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Case closed? Hardly.Cornwell's \\"book\\" is all conjecture and supposition. It is a completely ridiculous book with no factual basis for anything that she believes to be true. At least she has stuck to what she does best: fiction.If you are going to read anything about Jack the Ripper, then read any other book on the subject. There are tons of horrid books about Jack, but they are still better than this load of dung. For people who really want to learn about and read some excellent books on the subject, pick up anything by the following authors: Philip Sugden, Donald Rumbelow, Keith Skinner, or Stewart Evans.This book is horrid for true students of the case because Cornwell, with this pathetic stinker of a book, has put in the minds of casual readers that the Ripper case is solved when it is so obviously not. Ugh...she and this book make me want to vomit."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"Cornwell proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Walter Sickert was obsessed with the Ripper case and wrote numerous letters claiming to BE Jack the Ripper. Letters written by Sickert and the self-described Ripper did not merely share watermarks - they came from the same batch of 24 sheets, and their stamps and flaps share DNA! If this letter-writer was a prankster, how did he manage to predict far-off locations and details of near-future crimes? Cornwell had no desire to frame Sickert; a couple of years ago she knew virtually nothing about either Sickert or the Ripper. Cornwell has won over the world's foremost Sickert expert. The head of Scotland Yard says that he would arrest Sickert on Cornwell's evidence. But no, all these amateurs know better! The hysterical reaction to Cornwell's well-proven case reminds me of the reaction to Fawn Brodie's assertion that Thomas Jefferson had children by Sally Hemings. Everyone attacked her. It's just sexism and a refusal to let go of preconceived notions. Eventually, Cornwell's will be the received opinion. The truth is the daughter of time. The book, by the way, is riveting."},{"Title":"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed","review":"I am a regular fan of Patricia Cornwell and, in general, I liked all her work, some more and some less. She is a good writer and a great detective. But what is really amaizing that I was able to understand all the professional information packed so tightly in to her books. Patricia made it simple to understand and to follow.Now this book is something different. We are talking about one of the classic cases which was never solved and which happend so long ago. Patricia was able to take it a part and to come up with a result. We can argue whether her conclutions are right or wrong but what difference does it make for a book? She convinced me and even that is not important. She presented a case where everything was lost and nothing is solid.

Ms. Cornwell appears to have utilized as many tools possible in order to prove her point that Walter Sickert was in fact, &quot;Jack the Ripper.&quot; As in any investigation, there are of course, innuendo's, speculations, coincidence, and circumstantial evidence. However, I feel that Ms. Cornwell's investigation and insight finally leads the reader beyond that &quot;gnawing shadow of a doubt.&quot; Without further forensic proof, or a confession from Sickert's ghost, the 100% proff positive that everyone is expecting... simply won't occur. This case, like the &quot;Black Dahlia,&quot; will always remain controversial.

Back in the 1980s-90s, no self-respecting conspiracy theorist, exoticist, fetishist, or political extremist (or those who swore their allegiance to a whole host of other \\"isms,\\" for that matter) would be without this catalog on their shelves.Grouped by chapters entitled Control, Exotica, Mayhem, Natas, Neuropolitics, Orgone, R&D;, Parallax, Pulps and so on, the Amok Dispatch highlighted a plethora of books and topics one could only find here and there, if at all. Everything from fin-de-siecle literary decadence to cyberpunk, Wilhelm Reich and Tesla, volumes on Freemasonry, Satanism, and all things occult, pornography and alternative sexuality, titles about/for/by fascists, nazis and all sorts of anarcho-whatevers, etc. (Get the picture?)

Over 500 pages (definitely the size of a metropolitan phone book) and printed as a quality paperback (a definite improvement over the newsprint-ish Fourth Dispatch), the Amok catalog features reviews and listings for literature (and sometimes videos and CD-roms) way outside the mainstream. The Amok Fifth Dispatch is truly a &quot;sourcebook of the extremes of information in print.&quot;However, despite the quality (and quantity) of the work which went into this thing, I can't help but feel a little less frightened of this edition as I did the previous one. Maybe it's because in the past 9 years, with the advent of such cultural phenomena as the internet, Jerry Springer, Marilyn Manson, and serial-killer/mass-murder fetish, the &quot;extremes&quot; don't seem so extreme anymore.Nonetheless, this Amok Fifth Dispatch is an amazing resource and is well-worth picking up.A word of caution: DO NOT THROW OUT THE PREVIOUS FOURTH DISPATCH IF YOU STILL HAVE IT!!! While there is some overlap between the previous Amok catalog and this one, the Fifth Dispatch is almost an entirely new book.

The text is repetitive at times, for example. And the dietary program he recommends is sound, but sketchy; you'll probably find yourself hunting for additional materials -- low salt cook books, for example -- to round it out.Despite that, I give this book 5 stars because it may just be one of the most important books of its kind ever written, a book that could conceivably save millions of lives if recognized and adopted worldwide. And there's every good reason why it should be: the science behind it is absolutely solid. Moore is not only a medical doctor, but ALSO a biophysicist, and this book well reflects that dual background.A little of my own history may be instructive here. I first developed Stage I / II hypertension in the late 1990s, and did little about it. In April of 2002, I was sent to the ER with hypokalemia (low potassium). From that time until now (July, 2007), I obtained effectively NO help from any of the six doctors I consulted. My current provider is terrific in most ways, but even her help on this has been marginal. My complaint with all these people: though they proudly display their medical degrees, NONE had the slightest clue why I had developed high blood pressure. Not one could explain the hypokalemia, or how it related to my hypertension. Only one ever so much as mentioned diet, saying \\"You've cut back on salt, right? Good.\\" None had any better idea on treatment but to ply me with expensive drugs that inflicted unending and often brutal side effects. Only my current -- and very caring -- provider took the time to discuss exercise and the critical role it can play.I finally concluded that the word \\"essential\\" in the term \\"essential hypertension\\" really means, \\"We don't have a stinkin' clue.\\"And as Dr. Moore has now shown me, they were all wrong. A few medical researchers figured out long ago what causes most hypertension; an even larger number of researchers have known, for DECADES, the best course of treatment. Hint: it isn't drugs, and it doesn't require a super-human change in diet or lifestyle for most people. It does make demands, but as I've found they are not nearly so onerous as one might imagine.Moore, who as a biophysicist spent his career investigating cellular level functions, explains in simple terms the role of sodium and potassium -- the two critical electrolytes -- in the life of every cell in your body. This is really just high school level science. Most people can grasp it, but it is technical. If that's not your thing, Dr. Moore provides chapter summaries and an invitation to skip the hard science parts. I ate it up, however, because for the first time I could see what has been going wrong with my body.And knowledge is power. In just one week, adopting only a rough outline of his recommendations, I pulled my average BP down into a very safe zone ... something I'd not seen once in the previous 7 years despite all those medications. Those gains have continued, and I anticipate that in coming months I will bring it down further. The key to this is what Moore calls the K-Factor: the ratio of sodium to potassium that you consume. Americans frequently take in less potassium than sodium. Moore builds a case for aiming to reach a K-Factor of 4 (four times as much potassium as sodium each day). He also touches on other critical health issues, such as Type II diabetes ... conditions that may also benefit by adopting a high K-Factor diet.Note that the author does not claim to have discovered any much of this. The work he and his colleagues did helped elucidate fine points in the knowledge of cell biology (he worked on the pH levels inside cells, for example). But what he HAS done is masterfully synthesize diverse findings drawn from the thousands upon thousands of scientific journal articles published over the decades. He weaves this into a coherent narrative, something no one else that I know of ever accomplished prior to Moore's work.Before I read this book, I simply had no idea why I was suffering from hypertension. The vast majority of books, articles, and patient information pamphlets I'd read had simply said, \\"No one knows what causes most hypertension.\\" Some books advance what I believe are half-baked arguments. Many are decent books, advocating fundamentally sound high-potassium, low-sodium diets, but usually based only on empirical observations ... a useful start, but not nearly as good as true science, which requires operative theories tested and ultimately winnowed down to one best theory that explains all observable data. THAT is what Moore's book is really about.This is not just an academic distinction: by really understanding the mechanism, you can recognize that high blood pressure is merely one of a number of nasty symptoms of hypertension, and maybe not the most dangerous one. You can then set meaningful goals. So, for example, you won't end up just robotically eating a diet dictated to you; you can instead adopt one that aims to meet specific goals while giving you more options and flexibility ... keys to any kind of \\"lifestyle change\\" that you might actually hope to adopt for an entire lifetime.Finally, I notice that several other reviewers had some unkind things to say about this book. Having plowed through MOST of the recent books on this topic that you'll find here at Amazon, I can tell you that Moore's book truly stands alone in the quality and exhaustiveness of his citations, and the fundamental logic he brings to the topic. One reviewer seemed almost enraged because his book is not the book she wanted to buy (rather like someone rating Harry Potter with one star only because it isn't about flying saucers). But her criticisms are largely unfair and inaccurate, in most cases suggesting she'd done no more than skim the actual book. Another reviewer claims Moore is flogging vegetarianism. But he most decidedly does NOT do that; he specifically notes that he lumps together vegans, vegetarians, and even folks who eat fish and lean meats sparingly. He makes it clear that ANY diet that gets you to a K-Factor of about 4 will mostly do the job, vegetarian or not.Another reviewer praised this book, and marveled that it hadn't sold millions of copies. I concur. \\"The High Blood Pressure Solution\\" is a terrific and profoundly important book that can help you avoid hypertension, or defeat it if you already suffer from the malady."},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"This whole book can be summarized as: &quot;Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables; Stay away from processed foods; exercise and lose weight&quot; But isn't this what your mom and grandmother has been telling you? Isn't this what folk wisdom from many cultures have been saying?The book backs up the above admonishment with lots of scientific background. The book references many articles in medical journals. I am not qualified to judge the quality of all this information. But alot of the data in the book seems consistent and makes sense. I do have one question about all the information. The book highlights two key factors contributing to high blood pressure, low potassium/sodium ratio in body fluids,and insulin resistance. The books says there is some a relationship between the two because the potassium/sodium pump has an effect on glucose transport through cell membranes. Does a high K-factor diet lower insulin resistance? The book alludes to this but doesn't come right out and say it.No matter what, even if you have doubts about the science....the advice in this book seem like very healthy advice. Basically dieticians have been giving the same advice for decades. So you can't lose by following it.I am borderline high blood pressure (130-140/80-90). Since following this advice for about two months, my blood pressure has dropped to about (110-125/70-80). But by far for me,exercise has the largest effect. After a good 6 mile run, blood pressure will stay at 110/70 for hours! and below 120/80 for the rest of the day.If you start eating a high K-factor diet and exercising, be patient. It takes a few weeks for the effects to kick in."},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"I was 36 when I was diagnosed with hypertension and for the past 3.5 years I have struggled to keep my blood pressure under control. I've taken several different medications, many in combination but nothing really seemed to drop my readings below 140/95. A couple of months ago my doctor suggested Lotrel so once again I made a trip to the pharmacy and started taking the new drug---no change. Frustrated, I started a search for alternative medicines/etc. and in my research I came across this book and the K-factor diet. I followed the advice to the letter and within 1 week my readings started to plummet. 3 weeks in, my readings are anywhere from 111/69 to 127/74 and mostly on the lower end. I'll be honest, I did not read the book cover to cover, some of the really detailed sections were a little bit much for me. But I read enough to understand the concepts and apply them to my lifestyle. I now have an appointment with my doctor to start reducing my Lotrel and see if I can get off it altogether. He believes in medications so it will be interesting to see his reaction to there changes.

You have everything to gain and nothing to lose!"},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"Why I have put this book on my Ten most important list. It is not often that one finds a book that clearly explains, with documentation, an important health problem and the solutions that the average citizen and the professional can both use ( several doctor friends have modified their practices because of this book).Thankfully, a friend introduced me to Dr. Moore's book several years ago. Many of us today are very fearful of becoming just another statistic even after having spent a small fortune on medications that may or may not help prevent the consequences ofhypertension. By following his clear, yet detailed explanations and solutions I have been able to maintain a 125 over 75 reading for over two years. His detailed 8 pages of food charts on how to select the best foods for maintaining the proper salt balance is the core of a program I was able to adapt to very easilyover the first year. As a retired professional addicted to his computer it turned out that the exercise aspect proved to be the greatest challenge. The fun part is in getting creative with blending the wide choice of foods from the detailed charts and even mixing the table salt mix from off the shelf products.Some would say this is a weight reduction book. It is not. It is a book that dispels myths about hypertension. Namely, that blood pressure is not the main problem but an indication of an underlying cellular imbalance between potassium and sodium, and that hypertension is not inevitable. What I have discovered is that by maintaining balanced systems I have greatly improved my overall health and that weight control becomes a side benefit. Never thought I would be shopping for a bicycle at 61.My only questions now are why this book is not selling in the millions per year and where can I get Dr Moore's K Factor salt mix off the shelf?"},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"The author is a research physican who has years of experience in this field of medicine.

The author spends a good amount of time showing how several minerals work with your body's cells to keep your body functioning well. He has various studies to back his claims, and has a reasonable basis for his elemental potassium to sodium ratio. A few flaws in his studies...he mentions primitive people diets in terms of hunter/gatherer, but uses farming communities as proof. He also chooses to ignore that the majority of hunter/gather societies relied far more on proteins and fats than carbohydrates (mentions Eskimos as proof, but fails to acknowledge that they didn't get any carbs in their diet; also seems unaware of Pemmican which was a staple diet of the healthy, long-lived Plains Indians - 50/50 fat/meat). Fortunately, it doesn't deter from the end solution.However, the action plan would only garner 2 stars. While he is anti-establishment in terms of treating blood pressure, he falls right in line with the establishment in terms of dietary recommendations (either vegetarian or near vegetarian and an extreme phobia of fats) despite the fact that many other scientists have proven that fat is perfectly fine for you (check out Dr. Ellis's Ultimate Diet Secrets for a good summary of the various studies that prove low-carb diets are perfectly healthy)...even going so far to recommend an extreme reduction in fat so you won't gain weight (extremely funny to me since I've lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months on a low carb / high fat diet). The most important thing that could be included in his book are tables showing the potassium levels in foods, but it is rather sparse. Further, he cooks his book a bit by purposefully highlighting vegetables and fruits, despite the fact that all unprocessed meats meet his criteria to lower blood pressure. For some people, I think it would have also been appropriate to at least examine supplements.Overall, there is enough information in this book to solve your blood pressure problems (I've reduced my blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and diastolic - and still on a low-carb diet). Too bad he chooses to push his vegetarian agenda instead of providing solid alternatives."},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"I am a kidney donor who became increasingly concerned about my remaining kidney when my blood pressure became elevated and my physician put me on medication.

Worth following."},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"After a few introductory chapters, which are basically a preview of what you will learn in detail in the book, Moore gets into the biochemical aspects of what causes high blood pressure. He talks about the various different \\"pumps\\" related to cellular function such as sodium/potassium pump, the calcium pump, and the sodium/hydrogen exchange pump. It is the action of these pumps that he connects to the development of high blood pressure. As Moore sees it, blood pressure is just a symptom that is usually treated with drugs. He contents, however, that just treating the pressure does not get at the root cause of the problem.The crux of the matter is what Moore calls the K-factor. This is simply the ratio of potassium to sodium in your diet. He recommends a K-factor of at least four, that is, you should be taking in four times as much potassium as sodium. Note that the total amounts of each, in addition to the ratio, are also important. This has a beneficial effect on cellular function and produces a blood pressure lowering effect. In the chapter called The Workbook, he provides a table of the potassium, sodium, and K-factor for many commonly eaten foods. I found chapter seventeen interesting where we learn how the kidneys, hormones, and the nervous system work together to control blood pressure.Advice is also given about other things that can help lower blood pressure such as exercise, weight loss, and diet. In fact, he devotes a chapter to each subject. Moore is not a fan of using medications to treat blood pressure. He believes that by following the recommendations in the book, most people will find their need for drugs greatly diminished or eliminated.So, will it work for you? Good question. I can give you my opinion based on reading this book and previous knowledge of the subject. I definitely think following the dietary advice in this book will be helpful. I think that it is a good idea to increase potassium intake via foods and reduce sodium intake. As Moore points out, studies have shown that doing this results in lower stroke-related deaths even if blood pressure isn't lowered. One also needs the required amount of magnesium and calcium in the diet. All these can help with blood pressure. I don't think everyone will get their pressure low enough to eliminate drugs or other interventions, however."},{"Title":"The High Blood Pressure Solution: A Scientifically Proven Program for Preventing Strokes and Heart Disease","review":"I hope most readers are young enough to change their salt consumption habits to allow it to make a difference before they have damaged their bodies beyond repair. This well supported expose of the role of the sodium pump within our body's cells and what happens when it goes wrong due to excessive consumption of salt, is a monumental eye opener. The cascade of events that occur with all the imbalances in every associated mineral and the biochemical, thus physiological consequences throughout our bodies via the cells, is clearly explained, step by step. It leaves no doubt that it is necessary to limit sodium chrolide in ours diets to the 500mg that the body actually needs to replace each day. Since the kidneys recycle all but that 500mg, even 2000 mg a day is excessive, it reveals, and most people consume way more than that on a daily basis. This has an affect of slowly \\"poisoning\\"* us. (*my word)It also goes on to demonstrate that is we consume enough potassium to counter balance some of the excess sodium, we can flavor our food without denying ourselves the pleasue of adding extra taste to our food. The foods to eat and the amounts (such as bananas, and other fruits and vegetables) plus the amounts to consume with the corresponding sodium intake to maintain a healty sodium balance is conveniently provided. Plus education about reading labels on processed foods to assess sodium and potassium content(where provided)is also given. It makes the case that not only high blood pressure is directly caused by excess salt in our diet but also that insulin resistence, ostroporosis, diabet4es mellitus, coronary artery disease and other diseases that occur as we get older could be prevented if we follow the advice provided in the book. If not too late, some of them can be reversed if steps are taken to correct our diet as well.

This is a school of thought that an inbalance in the sodium-potassium exchange process occurs in the various cells in the body, including those lining the blood vessels, and causes them to constrict. His solution, based on his many years of researching this process, is that a very low-sodium, quite high potassium diet can help right the problem. He supports this by discussing the many cultures around the globe where HBP is virtually unknown because they follow such a diet. All good info. My problem with it is there are no carefully crafted studies he can come up with that proves the point definitively, other than that his associate researcher dropped his elevated blood pressure way down over a couple of years using the dietary approach. He also says, halfway through the book, that you may not experience any benefit from it at all. So I am calling this a &#34;show me&#34; review. I'm game and will try it to prove it one way or the other to myself as the idea of being &#34;friended&#34; by Big Pharma for a lifetime is not where I want to be. Once you get past some of the technical scientific info, the book is very readable and thought-provoking and this researcher has spent 40 years in the study of the sodium-potassium exchange process in the body so he knows something about the subject.

However, upon reading Greg Pak's story, what I had hoped for and had expected to read was simply not to be.The Story's Premise:The Shi'ar Empire has developed a weapon somehow capable of destroying the Phoenix Force, which has just returned to this galaxy. With the Shi'ar starship in menacing pursuit, the Phoenix returns to Earth seeking to renew its life bond with Jean Grey, only to discover that Jean is now deceased, and that her beloved Cyclops has become romantically involved with the chilly Emma Frost.Meanwhile, the X-Men are soon alerted to the return of Phoenix when it steals Jean's body from her grave at Professor Xavier's estate. It creates the looming question for the remainder of the story: has Jean been truly resurrected (against her will)? What transpires from there are the X-Men's battle preparations for what will supposedly be their final confrontation with Phoenix to ultimately determine Jean's fate.Rating: 4/5. One major plot and two potentially intriguing sub-plots were probably too ambitious for only five issues.Story Assessment:Initially, there is plenty of promise in the story's first chapter to suggest a satisfying finale for the Phoenix saga will be coming. For example, Wolverine is mostly bewildered in his first solo encounter with the Phoenix, but he clearly knows that something sinister is brewing.However, in the subsequent chapters, the story quality becomes much more uneven, as Greg Pak evidently had a hard time coming up with newly inspired sequences to help keep the reader's interest engaged. Is the X-Men's bickering over Cyclops' inexplicable relationship with Emma Frost really anything new? Or that Wolverine is genuinely heartbroken over Jean's death? Or that Kitty Pryde despises Emma Frost? Or that the X-Men will inevitably be dependent upon Jean to finally vanquish Phoenix? This question kept coming to me: why is \\"Endsong\\" important or even a story necessary to tell if it is so heavily dependent upon recycled material?Additionally, in part due to the short length of the chapters, little, if any, logical explanation is given for various plot gaps such as:1. Why wouldn't the Phoenix know of Jean's demise from the \\"Planet X\\" storyline if Jean already became part of the omnipotent Phoenix Force just before her death?2. How did the Shi'ar develop a weapon capable of destroying Phoenix?3. Why isn't Scott & Jean's daughter, Rachel Grey (a Phoenix herself), actually involved in the plot?4. How could the Beast on such short notice implausibly manage to invent an effective trap to contain Phoenix?Finally and worst of all, the story's conclusion (especially the awful last page) was simply a cheat, and made me wonder why did I bother finish reading \\"Endsong\\" in the first place? In comparison, Jean's fate at the end of Grant Morrison's \\"Planet X\\" and \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\" stories both now seem much more poignant and original.I had sincerely hoped this would be Marvel's worthy answer to \\"Green Lantern: Rebirth\\" or even \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,\\" where in both instances, you know the beloved (albeit deceased) character's return is imminent, but that is what you paid the price of admission for.\\"Phoenix: Endsong\\" fails to accomplish this task. Instead, Jean Grey's future is left again deliberately ambiguous, which, when you think about it, that's what it was before \\"Endsong\\" began. Further, yes, the final page clearly suggests a possible sequel, which hopefully won't see the light of day unless it becomes a vast improvement over this unnecessary retread.Rating: 2/5. Mediocre and disappointing.The Artwork:Artist Greg Land's work is simply exquisite throughout the entire story. The best way I can describe his work is that Land goes for an unique style that resembles lush painting far more than it does comic book drawing. If \\"Phoenix: Endsong\\" has a redeeming feature, this is definitely it.Rating: 5/5. A major plus!Overall Summary:Salvaged mostly by Greg Land's truly impressive artwork, \\"Phoenix: Endsong\\" is not by any means a complete disaster. However, the story's main thrust of resurrecting Jean Grey as Phoenix left much to be desired in terms of giving readers a satisfying resolution. In my assessment, if you pay good money and are patient for the ending you expect and want to receive, then why shouldn't you receive it? I guess only Marvel Comics knows the answer.Overall Rating: 3/5. I really wished it would have been a 5/5."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"I tried to like this story. It was lacking.The artwork was beautiful; the only way that it suffered was that the action sequences were not as elaborate as they usually are, because it looks like they used real people as the models for the faces and bodies, but then couldn't bend them into \\"heroic\\" poses that you expect to see in a comic book.This book featured several characters created during Grant Morrison's run on New X-Men, such as the Stepford Cuckoos and Quentin Quire. I never enjoyed the \\"Riot at Xavier's\\" story, so that probably contributed to my dissatisfaction with this one. I also can't stand the relationship between Cyclops and Emma Frost. So sue me.The main thread of the story is that the Shi'ar want to eradicate the Phoenix, and that she takes refuge in Jean Grey's dead body, in effect resurrecting her. All of the sudden, Phoenix realizes that she no longer has a husband to come back to because Cyclops has moved on. Someone on this site made the observation that if Jean Grey died in \\"Planet X\\" and accepted that Scott had chosen Emma over her, why wouldn't Phoenix already know this? I agree. Wholeheartedly.The frames where Logan repeatedly stabs the Phoenix with his claws are heart-rending, particularly when you remember back to the scene from \\"Planet X\\" where he mercy-kills her before they burn up in the sun. Or in the \\"Dark Phoenix\\" story where he hesitates and can't kill her while she is partially controlled by Hank's neutralizer.This story has a recycled feel. In the fourth installment, when Emma temporarily becomes the host for the Phoenix force, I felt like this was a plot device that would have been more interesting in previous stories, it feels like too little, too late here. Especially the history that Phoenix and Emma have together, when the Phoenix made Emma catatonic during their \\"Hellfire\\" days. The scene where Emma turns into her diamond form so Scott can look at her without his visor was also contrived, although it was prettily drawn. I have a hard time swallowing these two in love, since Cyclops has already cheated on not one, but two ex-wives, and Emma is shallow and hates his daughter. Hello? Not rooting for these two, not at all...Rachel Grey should have had a bigger part in this story, and really should have been one of the team members to confront her resurrected mother. Shadowcat was excellent in this one; I love the frame when she promises Colossus that she will return, with her still grasping his hand and releasing it as she phases out of the Blackbird. Very poignant. Kitty's character and her hatred of Emma rival the current style of her character in Astonishing X-Men, which is Shadowcat at her best. Wisecracking abounds. (she also reminds me of Fred in \\"Angel.\\")If you are an X-Men completist, then go ahead and buy this one used. I kept seeing shrink-wrapped copies of this book in my local Waldenbooks, but I noticed two unwrapped copies on the shelf that someone obviously returned. That tells you something, doesn't it?"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"In this series, the Phoenix force is brutally jarred from slumber by Shi'ar determined to destroy it. Because of the brutal attack, the Phoenix is confused, scared, and lonely. Returning to the Xavier Institute in search of Scott, she finds that his heart now belongs to Emma Frost, the White Queen. Hurt by the rejection, both the Phoenix and Jean struggle for control of Jean's mind, body, and soul. Since the Phoenix can end all of creation, or easily destroy the Earth, the X-Men must battle their former teammate.One of the great strengths of this story is the wonderful characterization. Wolverine's quiet declaration of \\" I may look tough, Jeannie, but I'm getting tired of killing you\\" or Cyclops' face covered in tears as he remembers the love he had for his former wife are small examples of the touching, yet powerful moments sprinkled generously throughout this story. It is also not without fast paced, bloody battles.Another strength is the art! Greg Land's art is breathtaking. The painted, photo-realistic panels are a marvel. I found myself reading this through for the story, then going back to gaze at the art.There are only two downsides. One- you can only reawaken the Phoenix so many times without it loosing a little meaning and Two- I thought the overall product would have been vastly improved had the last page not been included.Overall, a very spectacular book which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Today I pick up the large graphic novels as opposed to issues off the newstand. I'm much busier today as an adult than when I was 15 years ago as a teenager. Back then I was infatuated with the X-Men and especially the Phoenix story arcs. Back then I could afford the time and energy it took to keep up with that world. So in effect, this particular book was perfect for me. Its story may bob up and then sink back down as if it never happened at all, but that to me is just fine since I am only an infrequent visitor to the Marvel Universe."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"This miniseries should have been stale and unexciting, but somehow its one of the best X-men miniseries in years. The story is well written, the characters are very believable and well-portrayed, Emma and Cyclops's rather unconvincing relationship is explored and made convincing in only 3 pages of dialogue, and the general quality of the writing is very high.The story suffers from a few defects, some of which might actually be seen as admirable qualities; most of these come from the remit the publishers asked for, and not any deficiencies on the part of Greg Pak. The biggest defect, which can also be seen as part of the story and an intriguing theme (given the subject matter, the Phoenix), is its cyclical nature. This will leave some fans annoyed, others will not care, and still others might actually like it as a thematic decision.The art is generally truly outstanding. Greg Land has an almost photo-realistic look which, most of the time, does not look artificial or fake but is usually breathtaking. Particularly nice are the full page of Angel, wings outstretched in the mansion; the double page with the X-men; and a really lovely sequence in the arctic made up of minipanels between Wolverine and Jean.Any fan of Grant Morrisson's New X-men should pick this up- it is in some ways the epilogue that should have, but wasn't, written- as well as fans of Phoenix, Jean Grey, and I dare say most fans of the Astonishing X-men in general."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"I'll keep this short: Loved Pak's writting, he made me feel like I was reading one of the classic original team stories, and although I missed Iceman (to complete the original lineup) the presence of Kitty, Nightcrawler and Storm compensated his absence. But what I think really stands out is the way Cyclops' character is handled, perfectly portrayed as the X-Men's cornerstone, the ultimate leader, a man who has earned the respect of his teammates by taking the right decisions and boy does he have to make some tuff calls to win the day. The relationship between Cyke and Emma keeps developing and it is made clear that they are truly in love and not just fooling around. Land's art style is beautiful (the women he draws are hot, specially Ms. Frost) and neatly complements Pak's words making this an outstanding book."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Me being a huge Jean Grey fan, I was excited to see her being resurrected for a mini series. Though, resurrection is a very touchy subject, it was pulled off nicely. Even though the storyline was a bit off, the artwork was amazing. I could go on forever about it. Each page was drawn with equisite detail, every character had so much attitude. I was almost suprised they didn't pop off the pages. All in all, this is an excellent buy for any Jean fans."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Yes- another Phoenix story- the premise of this one being that it has been forced back into existence too early during its 'cycle' by some kind of Shi'ar plot device. While some elements of the story may seem forced, the delivery comes through Jean's interaction with her beloved- Scott, the X-Men, and even Emma. As a dedicated X-Men enthusiast, I can absolutely recommend this to anyone who as been through the Pheonix stories since the original, through Maddie, and Grant Morrison. Absolutely epic."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"How many times has Jean Grey been back from the dead? The last time Jean bit the dust was towards the conclusion of Grant Morrison's monolithic run on New X-Men, and as any comic reader knows, it's only inevitable that she'll be back. That's why it helps not to think as Phoenix-Endsong as being \\"the return of Jean Grey\\" really, though the ultra powerful Phoenix force makes it's return in Jean's guise, with the Shi'ar in hot pursuit and the X-Men left with no choice but to put an end to to her once and for all. Things are different this time around because Cyclops is with Emma Frost, which complicates things for his formerly deceased wife. Besides a few juicy nods to Morrison's take on the X-Men (including the return of Emma'c Cuckoos and the misguided but powerful Quentin Quire), there really isn't a whole lot to Greg Pak's (Planet Hulk, World War Hulk) story that hasn't been done to death already, as well as the fact that the climax is quite anti-climactic to boot. What really makes Phoenix-Endsong worth picking up however is the beautiful art by Greg Land. Yes, his renditions of the female form are definitely cheesecake to be sure, but his art as a whole is simply gorgeous beyond belief. All in all, Phoenix-Endsong isn't bad one bit (there is no way that this is the \\"end\\", as you'll discover on the final page), and despite the \\"beating of a dead horse\\" that many may feel towards the book, Greg Land's art alone makes this TPB worth picking up for X-Men fans new and old alike."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Super drawings and graphics, the missing star is for the lack of a little more depth in some dialogs (I would have like more focused \\"pathos\\" in some scenes).

The book by Greg Pack and Greg Land does not deliver the same feel you felt when reading X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga. Chris Claremont and John Bryne understood the Jean/Grey Phoenix storyline better. The triumph and the tragedy of Jean Grey is beter explored in Chris Claremont's X-Men comics. Greg Pack and Greg land was maybe hired by Marvel comics to make money of the X-Men/Pheonix storyline. How many times did Jean Grey have to die? Please let Jean Grey rest in peace and give her a real conclusion to her story. Between X-Men: Endsong and X-Men:Dark Phoenix Saga, I recommend X-Men:The Dark Phoenix Saga. I will admit Greg Land's art is beautiful but I think his photo-realistic style on the X-Men doesn't have the same feelings as John Byrne's artwork. C-"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Both as a stand-alone story and an addition to the X-Men canon, this book fails. Greg Pak's X-Men fall so short of the marks set by Grant Morrison and Joss Whedon they appear completely devoid of character and life. Their unique personalities, quirks, and even motivations are all so watered down, I wonder if Pak has ever read any of Claremont's seminal works.This isn't helped one bit by Greg Land's overly photo-referenced art, which makes all of the characters appear wooden and stiff. Bryan Hitch is a good example of how to pull off some photo referencing but still have the characters feel real. Land can't improvise dramatic expressions for anyone, much less give Emma Frost her trademark glare. Sure, it looks flashy and glossed, but if you want your comic art to move you as much as the writing, don't expect satisfaction here.Not to mention the story is a wholly unneeded one. Grant Morrison gave both Jean Grey and the Phoenix a fitting and proper send-off with vol. 7 of New X-Men, Here Comes Tomorrow. To have these characters dug up (literally) for the sake of what appears to be a final cash grab is insulting to their legacy.

Beautiful characters, astonishingly human expressions and wonderful semi-realism the likes of which haven't been seen since John Bolton was drawing the Classic X-Men addendums.The characterization is mostly spot-on. With a new writer like Pak, there's always the worry that the characters won't come out right. But these folks act exactly like they would...with some exceptions, that I'll get into later.OK, now that I've buttered it up enough, it's time for the saut&eacute;eing.The story feels shallow and rushed. Phoenix comes back from the dead again, making the X-Men's lives hell in the process. Cyclops and Emma Frost question their relationship, and Quentin Quire seeks out a way to resurrect his dead crush.All of these could have been fantastic stories, if only given the proper attention to detail.Scott and Emma's relationship is doomed to failure as soon as Jean comes back to stay, and they both know it. Personally, I can't wait; I hate the relationship, and feel it cheapens both characters.Quentin Quire's subplot was probably the best-handled out of all three stories. It's a complete story in-and-of itself, but it's tied pretty well into the Phoenix storyline. And yet, does a good Quentin Quire story really make up for a lackluster Jean Grey one?The main story itself isn't bad, but there's a lot to go through. The Phoenix as a broken, confused entity is a scary concept...it's only a fraction of its former strength, but as the Shi'Ar ask, \\"what's a fraction of infinity?\\" It's mildly insane in this one, rather than outright hostile, but anyone who read the original Dark Phoenix Saga knows that Phoenix was never a truly evil being, just overwhelmed by a mix of its own power and Jean's finite consciousness. It's the victim here, as much as the threat, and I would have liked to see someone understand that.And the ending I both loved and hated. There is one magnificent (story- and art-wise) splash page at the end of the battle that almost makes up for all the confusion at the beginning, but at the end, Jean's ultimate fate is just as uncertain as when Phoenix first pulled her out of the grave.Final opinion? An engaging read with wonderful art, but still not what it should have been.I would love to see Jean back for good, but this really should be the last Phoenix story."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Title: X-Men: Phoenix: EndsongPublisher: MarvelWriter: Greg PakArtist: Greg LandInker: Greg LandCollects: X-Men: Phoenix: Endsong #1-5Price: $19.99Is there anyone out there who doesn't like Greg Land's art? Wow. This guy can make just about any character look fabulous. Prior to reading this book, I had only seen his work gracing the covers of select Marvel comics. The way he draws (or paints) the Marvel heroines make you stop and take notice when you pass by them. The girls don't any prettier than when Greg Land draws them! Anyway, I read this entire book one night at Borders, simply because it did catch my eye and I wanted to catch up a bit on my X-Men circumstances. Since the art was the best thing about this book, I'll continue in that vein, first. As usual, Greg Land's work is visually stunning. Every panel is a work of art and if I was a guy that purchased comics strictly for the love of the artwork, this would be a must-buy. Sadly, though, I can't say I enjoyed the story much.Having not read the X-Men comics for several years, I had far too many questions during and after my reading on this book. This is not a reader-friendly book if you're not thoroughly versed in the current affairs of the X-Men. This book was far too inaccessible for any new readers to want to pick it up. Among the many questions going through my head during and after the reading of this book were:* Who's Quentin Quire, what happened to him, what are the levels of his power, and why does he want to bring this dead girl back to life?* Jean Grey's dead again? When and how did it happen THIS time?* What happened to the Shi-Ar Empire that makes them so cold towards the X-Men? Do they really have the power to destroy the Phoenix?* Does Scott Summers really love Emma Frost? Does she really love him as much as it appears? Why is she attracted to this stiff?* Who are the Stepford Cuckoos? How many are there? Is just one of them dead?* What the heck is going on in this book?Like I said, far too inaccessible for me to enjoy. Even now, having caught up quite a bit on the current situations and event of the X-Men, I still don't think I really would have enjoyed this story. It jumps around quite a bit, most of the action taking place seems far too implausible for even standard comic book fare, and the emotional attachment that the writer seeks to show through his characters just seems hollow.In the end, while this book is a great showpiece for the beautiful artwork of Greg Land, it serves as little else. I would have enjoyed this story about as much is there had been no printed text in it, and that's a very bad thing. I hope to see more of Greg Land's work on future Marvel projects, but I hope that they give him an assignment that can truly be something worthy of his talents, rather than a pointless project like this which seemed to be nothing more that a chance for Marvel to use the fine artwork to milk the consumers for more of their hard-earned money. There is just no way anyone can justify spending the kind of money necessary to pick up this hardcover edition or even the softcover TPB. Browse it if you must, but spend your money elsewhere.Writing: 3/10Artwork: 9/10Overall: 6/10"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"and forget that Phoenix dies a lot lolBuy this, very poetic and artistic, gorgeousPhoenix Warsong picks up some direction, if you need itcaptures the Phoenix well"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"This is yet another Jean Grey and the Phoenix Bang-boom yeah we've heard it before. It was good when they first tried it in Dark Phoenix Saga (scratch that, it was GREAT!) but after New X-Men's Phoenix it's beginning to get old. But my main gripe is...SCOTT AND EMMA. I HATE these two's love. HATE IT. Basically, Marvel is destroying the foundation of the X-Men by having Scott and Emma have MULTIPLE AFFAIRS without even getting married. Also I completely despise Emma Frost. The way she dissed Jean in Astonishing X-Men and in here just makes me wanna turn her pretty little face inside out. And they make her so hot she's UGLY. Hopefully, Emma's little \\"betrayal\\" in Astonishing X-Men will DESTROY their relashionship and soon Scott will find Jean again.Which brings me to another thing-the ending. It seems like all writers are trying to do is bring Jean back and then take her away again. No, she isn't dead, but being off the planet basically qualifies as out of the X-Men's lives. Her and the Phoenix's little \\"merging\\" was totally overrated and now Jean Grey is going to be much more different.Good elements:Kitty Pryde and Colossus. I loved their moment. Angel is also pretty cool, and the Stepford Cuckoos and Quinten Quire were the PERFECT side-story. Like other reviewers, I believe Rachel Summers' ivolvement would have made this much more interesting, but she's nowhere to be seen, except for the last pages.Finally, the last double-page spread. I LOVE IT!! It basically shows all the X-Men and a few blue memories of Jean (although some of them are of Phoenix, like Storm's) and seeing everybody there was awesome. I love the look on Scott's face and the tiny blue memory above his head--you can see he's clearly being tortured between Jean and Emma.All in all, a nice story, which makes me wish all the worst to Emma Frost, all the best to Jean Grey, and whatever to Scott Summers."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"There has to be something else to write about for the X-Men, right? Even the characters are commenting about how they're tired of fighting the Phoenix. Along with this comes a series of storylines (Shiar, Quentine Quire, Jean/Scott/Emma) that seems to never come together until they are mashed at the end.The art is beautiful to be sure, but the character rendering isn't the best. I can't seem to recognize the characters faces."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"This story is a continuation of the plot threads and characters introduced during Grant Morrison's \\"New X-Men\\" run, and feels like a nice epilogue to that series. Thankfully, Greg Pak manages to squeeze some life out of Scott Summers' ex-wife, whose corpse is re-animated by the Phoenix force. It's nothing that we haven't seen before, of course, but rarely have the X-ladies have never looked so beautiful--Greg Land hits a homer out of the park, especially with Emma Frost."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"In one way, I'm not qualified to write a fair review of this graphic novel, because I'm an \\"old school\\" X-Men fan, reading some recent X-Men materiels almost at random, with very little knowledge of what has been going on, overall, in merry Marvel mutant continuity. I knew nothing about Quentin Quire, the Stepford Cuckoos, or even previous returns of the Phoenix, who had died in X-Men #137 way back when.But I do know that it is risky bringing certain comic-book book characters back from the dead, while others return after their seeming demise without anyone feeling something profane has occurred. Bump off the Rhino and then re-introduce him with a couple of panels explaining how he survived that fall, that explosion, that radiation surge, that flood, that vacuum of space, that brain haemorage, that disintegration, that nuclear missile...and it's business as usual. Bring back Elektra, or Superman, or Green Arrow, or Captain America, and you better have a good explanation, and especially a good reason.So I've gone off and done my homework (gone websurfing) when it comes to Quentin Quire (he was Kid Omega, did you know that?) and the Stepford Cuckoos (they're the Three-in-One now, just so you know), and I still think that Phoenix: Endsong is one of those supposed epic stories that makes a lot of noise and accomplishes nothing. Phoenix/Jean Grey returns, wreaking havoc, prompting Quentin Quire to return and wreak havoc as well, and by the end, almost everything in the story has been put back the way it was. I remember something like this happening ages ago, when Marvel and DC did a Teen Titans/X-Men team-up, and the Phoenix returned as the major foe, thus trivializing to some degree the emotions generated during her previous death scene. And here we are again, except that apparently I've missed a few times where this happened before. Of course, her name IS Phoenix, so I suppose if ever a character were meant to rise again and again and again.Here, Phoenix is back, though she isn't quite herself, and instantly a bizarre love rhombus exists: Phoenix/Jean Grey plus Wolverine plus Emma Frost plus Cyclops. The story dredges up all the old relationships between Phoenix and her men, and apparently her solution to Emma now possessing Cyclops's heart is to possess Emma. But what everyone really has to worry about, we're told, is the Phoenix Force migrating over to Quenton Quire--so say the captain and crew of a Shi'ar warship, who have tracked the Phoenix to Earth, and who end up getting hassled by Storm and Nightcrawler so they can't meddle with the drama unfolding below on a frozen winter landscape. Quire intrudes on Phoenix's battles with the X-Men for the purpose of having the deceased object of his former affections--Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos--brought back to life.The story has a morbid feel to it; we see the physical remains of both Jean Grey and Sophie spring up from their graves, and we see both Wolverine and Cyclops wrestling with their emotions over a woman long dead. Other than that, this story contains all the familiar elements of comic-book \\"epics\\" that resurrect characters who were supposedly gone forever: the returning character isn't quite the same as he/she was before death (\\"this isn't the person you knew; this is a shadow, an incomplete version of so-and-so, etc.\\"--there's always a bit of that involved, so that we don't feel that the character has been totally defiled upon return); the character, if particularly powerful, doesn't just destroy the galaxy, but gets bogged down in small affairs (\\"why did you come back?\\"--\\"I had to see you one last time before I fly off and obliterate the totality of all existence.\\"); the character is usually stopped in his/her tracks, not by force or any special traps designed to contain the character, but by some variation on, well, a big hug (\\"remember who you WERE, darling!\\", \\"I know in your heart that you can't do this\\", or just \\"I love you...c'mere you crazy nut, gimme a squeeze and stop makin' all this trouble.\\"). And finally, we get the inevitable hint, right at the end, that maybe, it's not quite over, thus cheapening the whole effect.The art saves the day here, more than any of these X-Men. The story is entertaining, but suffers from meaninglessness once most of its effects have been reversed. However, the pictures iz jest great. The colours are most unshy--the whole thing looks like a rainbow catching fire as it collides with the Aurora Borealis. Pencils on stun. Inks inkredible.The Phoenix returns and makes everyone a bit hysterical for a while, and then she goes away again. Back to your regularly-scheduled villains, most of whom can't destroy the galaxy but ironically are not stuck in neutral. (\\"I'm the Kangaroo--and believe me, if they kill me off, I probably stay dead. Whats the matter--doesn't anyone love me?........... Fine! Y'know, it's not fair...\\")"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"Okay so Marvel has gone back to the well once again to try and make money off of the whole Phoenix saga thing. I'm guessing that they were confident that fans would buy into all the hype surrounding this story and snap it up no matter how lame it might be. But Greg Pak's story just felt like he was trying to cash in on what went before and that is just plain lazy.The plot is sluggish, what there is of it, and adds nothing to the Phoenix character or the X-men as a whole. The characters do little more than react to the events around them and their pain and anguish over having to fight Jean carries no weight since this has all been done before. The relationship between Scott and Emma feels forced and just doesn't seem to ring true given the histories of the two characters.Artist Greg Land is well known for the way he draws female characters and has several chances to show that off in this book, but his art just didn't seem to help out the story much unlike his previous work for DC's Nightwing and Birds of Prey and CrossGen's Sojourn."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"The Shi'ar prematurely resurrect the Phoenix entity - responsible for killing billions of people in Chris Claremont's classic Dark Phoenix Saga - hoping to destroy it forever. But their attempt to destroy it fails and the Phoenix entity comes to earth, looking for its former host, the X-Man Jean Grey, hoping to possess this vessel once again and to experience the love that its host Jean Grey shared with her former husband Scott Summers, the leader of the X-Men known as Cyclops. But unbeknownst to the Phoenix, Jean Grey is dead and buried. However the Phoenix is a cosmic entity - some might even say a god - and possesses the power to even resurrect the dead. So when the Phoenix resurrects Jean Grey and once again possesses her as a host, the X-Men know that the Phoenix entity is back and must be stopped at all costs. Last time the Phoenix destroyed an entire planet and billions died. Now the Phoenix entity is on earth and might obliterate not just the earth but the entire galaxy. Can the X-Men save the day, especially when foolish young omega-level mutant Quentin Quire has become aware of the Phoenix's power to resurrect the dead and wants the Phoenix to bring back to life the girl that he loves, even if this means fighting against the X-Men with his formidable telepathic powers on the side of the cosmic force of death and destruction that is the Phoenix? This graphic novel was a thrilling ride bringing back Chris Claremont's infamous Phoenix entity after several decades of absence. The artwork by Greg Land is stellar and the story by Greg Pak was largely well told in this collection of the five issues of the \`X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong' mini series. Unfortunately an overly sentimental ending prevents this graphic novel from receiving five stars, but still, a very good read."},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","review":"So, there's yet another Phoenix story. This one is incredibly bland, with lame dialog, whiney new characters I don't recognize (Quentin), and a cliche ending. The only saving grace is Wolverine's interactions with Jean, and the art. From what I've gathered, the artist is known for drawing attractive women characters. I'd have to agree, but it's not enough to save this tpb. Easily skippable."},{"Title":"Writing Short Films: Structure and Content for Screenwriters","review":"I have used Linda Cowgill's book, Writing Short Films, for a three-hundred level course, which I have taught at the University of Arizona, for over four years. It continues to be an excellent basic text for my students even though I have read many of the other books on the market. Linda defines all the important tools of a writer and their uses within the craft. She uses many short films in the book to exemplify her points directly and easily. The short films are excellent references and are accessible for showing--which is a perfect visual teaching tool. Even though the title is for short scriptwriting, she talks about full length films in comparison and, of course, all of these elements and tools are equally important for the full length form. It remains my favorite reference book for my own writing of screenplays and recommend it as the best of the screenwriting books on the market."},{"Title":"Writing Short Films: Structure and Content for Screenwriters","review":"While the subtitle of this book is accurate (\\"structure and content for screenwriters\\"), the main title is incredibly misleading. While many short films are used as examples, I can sum up what the book says about writing the short screenplay with: They must be focused, because they are short.The information in the book about writing a story for film is informative and worthwhile, and could be applied to any form of storytelling. But, as I was looking for specific information about working in a short screenplay format, I found that this book has very little to offer on the subject.4 stars as a book on story structure0 stars as a book about writing short films"},{"Title":"Writing Short Films: Structure and Content for Screenwriters","review":"As Head of Film and Media Production at a British college I had been on the look-out for a long time for a book that would really excite aspiring screenwriters - and now I've found it. Anyone hoping to make their breakthrough short film should read this book cover to cover and see how successful filmmaking is dependent on strong scriptwriting. Linda Cowgill has a tremendous ability to illustrate the need for both structure and originality when writing for what is, in truth, a very difficult format to get right.The book covers the entire writers journey from 'starting out' to producing a lean, focused, innovative screenplay. Through observing the impact it has had on new writers I would say that this book is in a league of its own."},{"Title":"Writing Short Films: Structure and Content for Screenwriters","review":"A short film runs less than 45 minutes. Short films may be transformed into Hollywood success. This book tells how to have a completed script to initiate the venture into short film. The reader is given an idea of the labor involved to produce this art form. The book uses \\"Life Lessons\\" written by Richard Price and directed by Martin Scorsese, part of THE NEW YORK TRILOGY, to illustrate points she wants to make about writing a script. She also makes reference to other short films readily available to a reader.The steps involved are that a hero, with desires, acts, encounters conflicts, and moves to the climax and resolution in the course of the film. Film is visual. Film has fluidity of movement. Show don't tell is a maxim of film-making. Significant films have universality. Most short films are character pieces. The audience must willingly suspend disbelief. It may be necessary to do research.Basically there are five types of genre, comedy, farce, drama, tragedy, and melodrama. In the best films plot is character. A character biography is a description. This includes physical appearance, sociology, and psychology. The backstory is not the same thing. A story tells a sequential action. Plot emphasizes causal relationships. Story and plot usually comprise part of a total narrative. Drama is structured action. A good plot evolves naturally. The writer should not be afraid to change the plan as he moves ahead with the project. It is useful to think of the film's story in broad blocks.The opening should be visual, convey important information, and be interesting. Voice over narration is more common in short film than in features. It is a means of exposition. Other means are dialogue and written presentation through signs or cards. The main expostion has a direct relationship to the climax and an indirect relationship to the theme. Screen stories open near a point of decision or crisis. Many films introduce the protagonist immediately.The problem with the middle is to keep the story alive. The worst enemy of suspense is predictability. One of the strongest surprises occurring in film is the reversal. Reversals work best when there is a connection to emotion. In film, fiction, and theater story revelation is most often character revelation. The point of greatest intensity is called the climax.Writing a scene is the fun part of screen writing. Writing a great scene takes a lot of practice. Scenes have to perform functions of advancing the flow of events, advancing the audience's understanding of the main characters, and providing expository information of the overall story. Film characters move through space and time. Every good scene has one main point. Where a scene takes place affects the mood. Before writing clarify who, where, what characters want, need, and what are their attitudes in the scenes.What characters need is relevant to the subtext. Physical action is considered the best revelation of character in film, but sometimes only dialogue can expose real motivation. Effective dialogue has simplicity and economy. Dialogue too clear and direct may ring false. Always read dialogue aloud. The screenwriter walks a fine line between telling too much and telling too little."},{"Title":"Writing Short Films: Structure and Content for Screenwriters","review":"This is a terrific how-to. It's a great guide for going from a concept to a story and script, a well-developed story. It goes into the importance of content for the short, with excellent strategies for structuring a good story around your idea. It details not only the difference in structure of shorts vs. features, but examines the structure of scenes as well. It is not a formula book. It doesn't lock you in with the only types of stories that work. It's a book with strategies for approaching and developing your idea. It gives you the tools to take your notion and run with it.

Yeah, there's a wealth of information about progression in story telling and the importance of theme/subtext/meaning. However, this book lacks insight on how to write and structure a SHORT film; something it's title more or less promises. To top it off, the chapters are poorly organized and many sections consistently introduce \\"new\\" subjects which are nothing more than recycled ideas from previous pages. I'm surprised it's staple in so many classrooms.In lieu of this book I'd recommend \\"Writing Short Scripts\\" by William H.

She gives you information you can work with. She clearly explains the differences in structure between shorts and features; and she gives specific story/plot strategies particular to making a great film. Even better, she used short film examples you can find on tape at most video stores. THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK THAT DOES THIS. I can't stress enough how helpful I found this part of the book.

The guide along with the workbook, actually replaced my textbook. The textbook was simply put, confusing, and unrelatable. The guide, and workbook were lifesavers for me. The clear, precise and easy to understand examples clarified much of what confused me. And associating all of the properties and laws to analogies worked liked a charm. In fact, I soon learned I knew th properties and laws better than my classmates and began using the analogies to explain them so they to could remember all the little tricks this guide taught me. My teenage son, who has struggled with Algebra, now has his own copies and wonders why his teachers have never thought to make it so easy to learn."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"I purchased the Algebra Survival guide and the workbook for my sons who would be taking Algebra in 8th grade.

It begins with the basic to the complex and should clear some confusing content normally associated with learning algebra. I recommend you buy the workbook to help practice what you learn."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"I'll bet a lot of mothers have hugged this author.I'm a homeschooler with one boy in college and another in public high school. I'm also math challenged so teaching algebra was a nightmare and I felt that my very bright older boys suffered because of it (though they are now both near the top of their classes). I was fine with teaching basic math skills as I know exactly where math falls apart for most kids who learn to hate it. Algebra was an entirely different story. I simply didn't get it, and consequently, neither did my boys. What they did get was that algebra was a horrible subject that should be hated. This feeling was not on the list of things I wanted my sons to inherit from me.I was determined that it would be better for my younger two and I went in search of a user friendly book that would break it down to manageable steps so that I could teach it effectively and they could master it comfortably.Enter Algebra Survival Handbook and Workbook. Combined, these two are an unbeatable teaching tool. My third born (who dislikes math intensely) has grown confident enough to teach himself with only occasional help from me. When I do have to step in, I'm able to quickly scan the previous pages and explain what he's missing without feeling like I'm all thumbs. I am learning as much as he is.Each lesson carefully builds on the concepts you learned previously, just a few problems at a time, with only one or two steps added. His \\"ohh this is so easy--watch this--\\" approach builds concepts in the student. He also admits when something is confusing and then goes on to make sure that the student doesn't stay that way.If you are a homeschooler, you should add this tool to your arsenal."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"So far, I like this workbook and the guidebook together. We bought the Survival Guide Handbook and the Workbook after my 7th grader got a C on his report card. We thought he could use the review and extra practice over the summer. As the adult step parent tutor, I was worried I forgot all my algebra but the Guide Handbook helped refresh my memory. I like that it's a different format from a textbook. Textbooks (from what I remember) tell you and explains. The Guidebook offers the information and lessons in a question and then answering format. The guidebook also shows possible misinterpretations such as, \\"Is -2^2 the same as -(2^2)?\\"So far, we are on page 18, and I haven't found that many mistakes in the answer key like a previous reviewer suggested. Just one. (Page 14, #20). I got 10.5 but the answer key shows the answer is 15. Did I make a mistake?For us, this book suits our purpose well. It is simple, to the point, addresses possible misinterpretations, and has a predictable question and answer format. A more advanced student may need further explanation, more word problem connections. The world problems are all in the back on the last 4 pages."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"It made algebra easy to understand and funny.

It makes all the steps easy, taking them one at a time instead of going through a bunch of things at once. You need to get this workbook as well in order to have very much practice, as each step in the text book only has five to ten problems, and the answers are right on the same page as the problems. This workbook has many more problems, follows the guide for each step taught, and has the answers in the back.My granddaughter, who is in 9th grade, is able to go through it and understand pretty much on her own. This book, along with the &#34;Survival Guide,&#34; is good for someone not very motivated to learn algebra, as the others I tried go into it too fast, which discouraged my granddaughter because she doesn't like math and doesn't try to understand it.

It combines lessons with example problems included with the lessons. It also includes extra problems as work sheets for each lesson. He was able to pace himself. He would do the problem worksheet and I would check his work. If we found that there were issues to resolve, he could go back to the lesson itself, review the work and examples before continuing to the next work sheet.He finished up the book before summer ended and had a good start on 8th grade math.

My daughter was homeschooled and did well in everything but math. She loved science and was considering a branch of it for a career. Math of all things, is not something that can be deficient for any college student majoring in a science. It is not a subject for anyone to fall behind in , especially girls who tend to suffer from \\"math anxiety\\" more frequently than boys, as did I.I found an awesome tutor who used \\"The Algebra Survival Guide\\" and workbook. Not only did the program make algebra plain and simple enough for my homeschooler who hated math to understand, but she ended up LOVING MATH! It would of been enough for her to understand, but the bonus was that she loved it.Because the \\"Algebra Survival Guide\\" was so effective, my daughter completed pre-algebra and algebra in 9 months and did extremely well! She is in a private school in algebra 2 as a freshman and as of the first quarter grading has received an A !I believe that this program laid an excellent foundation for the future. It also gave her confidence in her ability to succeed at higher levels. To summarize, using this program accomplished several very positive things: It made the subject of struggle into one of accomplishment, therefore it became a subject she loved, and enjoyed . It made her confident in her ability to understand any level of math, as she is free of the anxiety she once faced. All this, not to mention the fact that she finally just plain understood algebra!"},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"My son hadnt done his algebra in his first year and needed to brush up on his skills for his placement test in his second year....awesome, the stuff didnt seem like Greek!...great tool."},{"Title":"Algebra Survival Guide Workbook: Thousands of Problems To Sharpen Skills and Enhance Understanding","review":"Received this textbook earlier than expected and in excellent condition.

However, as a collector of fire memorabilia, this guide is an invaluable reference, providing so much information I had never seen before. Paul, like many who write these types of books, started out with a keen interest in this area. Over the years, he evidently has amassed a wealth of intricate data and information on the history of getting the firefighters to the fire, in terms of mechanical alert and alarm systems. What I liked most about the book is the many photos, which can help novice collectors like myself, identify different boxes from different periods. If you collect anything fire related, or have a firefighter in the house, (I hate to use this next phrase, but) this is a must-have. The only downside is the price. I certainly was surprized at that, given the many other historical photo books on the market. Since this is such a \\"nichy\\" subject, I'm sure not too many of us will be purchasing it, hence the high cost of publication.

Through an exquisite array of photographs of the real objects, Paul takes us through the history of the ways in which fire and police were notified of emergencies long before the telephone.

Ultimately, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris, his books were condemned by the Vatican, and he was excommunicated. (But of course, that simply whets our appetite even MORE to read what he wrote, eh?) He then taught the history of religion at the College de France until his retirement in 1931.Loisy wrote this book in 1902, and it contains his most famous statement, \\"Jesus foretold the kingdom, and it was the church that came; she came, enlarging the form of the gospel, which it was impossible to preserve as it was, as soon as the Passion closed the ministry of Jesus.\\"Loisy's disputes with the Catholic Church don't mean that he had Protestant sympathies, however; he wrote, \\"Jesus was the first to give his disciples a formula of prayer; He observed the practices of Jewish worship; He never recommended to His followers a worship without external forms, and never intended to establish such a worship.\\" He also concludes, \\"every advance is explained by a necessity of fact ... so that the historian cannot say that the total extent of the movement is outside of the gospel. The fact is, it proceeds from it and continues it.\\"This historically-significant book remains of interest to those interested in the life of Jesus, the Catholic Church, Catholic theology, and Modernism."},{"Title":"The veteran and his pipe,","review":"Albion Tourgee did a great job discussing shared views of two old soldiers reflecting on life at the time of President US Grant's funeral."},{"Title":"The Winner's Circle","review":"This is a great book for improving the learning climate in your middle school classroom.

This is a wonderful book to add to your collection of this author's work."},{"Title":"GIRL FROM THE SOUTH","review":"I was a big fan of Joanna Trollope's earlier books, especially The Choir, but this is not one of her better efforts. The characters are uninteresting and unengaging and there's not much of a plot. Everyone just sort of flops around feeling inadequate. My pet peeve is British authors who write American characters who sound British. This book is riddled with expressions that no American would use. We're all used to that in British books, and it's fine when the character is British, but when the character is supposed to be a born and raised American it is SOOOO annoying! It immediately destroys the book's credibility, just as an obvious historical anachronism or modern turn of phrase can ruin a period novel. If a British author does insist on writing American characters, she should at least have a good American editor for the American edition. I had the feeling that the editor hadn't even read through the manuscript, as there were also a number of sloppy spelling errors (the kind that should have been caught by a spell checker).

Ball discusses many of the major trends and theorists, and how their works fit into the new directions postcolonial theory is taking.The remainder of the book is a carefully detailed examination of the position of London--actual or symbolic--in postcolonial literature, and the implications of London in a transnational framework.Any student of recent trends in postcolonial theory should check this book out.

Reed graduated from the Union Theological Seminary of Virginia and served several pastorates before being appointed in 1898 to the position of Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Church Polity at Columbia Theological Seminary, South Carolina. He died a revered figure within the Christian community in 1925. A part of his legacy was \\"The Gospel As Taught By Calvin\\", a book that he wrote to provide a clearer understanding of, and an enhanced appreciation for, the theological contributions of John Calvin. Now brought back into print for a new generation of appreciative readers, \\"The Gospel As Taught By Calvin\\" covers such issues as the origins of Calvinism and Arminianism; the effects of Adam's fall upon human nature; God's grace with respect to a sinner's conversion; the nature of atonement; the meaning of 'grace'; the biblical roots of Calvinism; and so much more.

I've read a several books on Calvinism and a few short ones as well. Among the shorter treatments wit a narrative style this is my favorite.

It covers most of the basic concepts and provides careful proofs for most of the major theorems. It would be nice to add chapters on modal logic and program verification. Computer science students can benefit from such discussions."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Mathematical Logic","review":"INTRODUCTIONThe previous reviews of this book are quite old with 10 years old being the newest. They also date back to the professor-notes-copy or expensive hardcover days. News now is that this textbook in February 2013 has been reprinted as a Dover paperback. For this theory of computation, mathematical logic and ZFC set theory junky, this looks like a very good and unique general-purpose textbook on logic, which I plan to read yet in 2013. Contents of this book have substantial overlap with the 900 page and exhaustiveFundamentals of Mathematical Logic, which I also own and have reviewed in Amazon.CONTENTSSince this book, unlike two other new Feb13 Dovers doesn't have an Amazon 'Look Inside' utility, here are the CHAPTER TITLES AND PAGES THEY START ON for the Hodel: Preface-xi / 1. Background-1 / 2. Language and Semantics of Propositional Logic-48 / 3. Propositional Logic-77 / 4. First-Order Languages-129 / 5. First-Order Logic-167 / 6. Mathematics and Logic-219 / 7. Incompleteness, Undecidability, and Indefinability-269 / 8. Recursive Functions-312 / 9. Computability Theory-366 / 10. Hilbert's Tenth Problem-435 / Appendix: Number Theory-473 / References and Recommended Reading-477 / Index-482REFERENCE FOR CHAPTERS 8 AND 9One thing I notice about chapter 9 on computability is that Hodel uses the Unlimited Register Machine (URM) as his computing 'machine'. This is very positive. The great 1980 book by Nigel Cutland, read in summer 2011 contains an excellent intro to the URM in its early chapters for anyone interested, also a rather accessible treatment of recursion theory:Computability: An Introduction to Recursive Function Theory. Again a book reviewed by this reader.REFERENCE FOR CHAPTER 10A 1993 textbook on Hilbert's Tenth Problem, by the Russian who finally, with 3 Americans, found Hilbert's tenth to be unsolvable:Hilbert's 10th Problem (Foundations of Computing). Also own this one, and may eventually read it. It's an interesting mix of logic, theory of computation and number theory.A FEW GENERAL OBSERVATIONSThere are many exercises after each section of the chapters. Unfortunately author Hodel is one of the more severe practitioners of shifting most of the theorem proving work in particular to the student via the exercises. This book's use of graphics to set off certain types of writing is both helpful and attractive.STARTING TO READ / SIMULTANEOUS READDecided on Mon 11Feb13 to stop early reading of a good Springer book on group theory to start reading this one. Still well involved in also reading very long SICP:Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)a fascinating but difficult book on the deep theory of computer programming. Also known as the 'Wizard Book'. Book uses Scheme programming language, which I have in a free MIT/GNU Mac version, as pseudocode thoughout. Scheme and Common Lisp are the two main modern and stable versions of the 55 year old Lisp language.READING THIS BOOKPREFACEGood summaries of what is in the chapters and advice to instructors for using the book. Rules for the logical operations and an index of symbols follow the preface before chapter 1, so good to leave a second bookmark there. Never have seen such items in that location before, but why not? Mon 11Feb13.CHAPTER 1Also started background chapter 1 on Mon 11Feb evening. Quite interesting, and the first several 'examples' look like the way this author does them should not be a problem. They are just a little more detail well within the flow of the general textbook writing. Had some concerns that maybe the writing designated as examples was excessive. Actually the 'examples' tend to nicely enhance the book's content like they should. Chap 1 goes rather far into well introducing a number of subjects that will be featured later in this book. A good idea.One bit of archaic terminology the author uses is regarding simple mapping functions like X goes to Y which he classifies as 'one-to-one' or 'onto', or 'one-to-one and onto', which for decades have been known as 'injection', 'surjection' and 'bijection' respectively. His clumsy archaic terminology about functions does not serve students well. Face it, writing 'one-to-one and onto' is way longer and more clumsy than just saying the function is a bijection. For this reader, the best introduction to the newer terminology is on p. 98 or SF-18 ofA Short Course in Discrete Mathematics (Dover Books on Computer Science). These obsolete names for types of functions are my only complaint early in this great book. I just pencil in the new words every time the author used the old words. Chapter 1 finished Sun 17Feb13 afternoon. Back to 140-page SICP chapter 3 for a few days now.CHAPTER 2Started on Wed 20Feb13 afternoon. It is on language and truth functions of propositional logic. An interestingly unique approach continues. Actually, after so much reading in logic, this reader prefers to jump right into first-order logic, as propositional logic no longer holds much interest, but I generally do resist doing that, as for this uniquely organized book as well. Section 2.3 on minimal connectives (to just NOT and OR) was pretty interesting. Colin Howson also had a good such discussion in section 3.7 of hisLogic with Trees: An Introduction to Symbolic Logic, the first full textbook I read back in spring 2004. Joel Robbin inMathematical Logic: A First Course (Dover Books on Mathematics)operated almost completely with just implication and NOT, but with the NOT becoming a falsity sign 'f' used as consequent of implications. There is yet another review by this reader of that excellent little book. Finished chapter 2 of the Hodel on Fri 22Feb13 afternoon.CHAPTER 3Started chapter 3 on big theorems and proof methods for propositional logic on Fri 22Feb after finishing chapter 2. Interspersing my reading of Hodel and of SICP. Section 3.1 of the present book does a great job of making the formation rules for propositional logic, and also defining connectives other than NOT and OR in terms of those two main connectives. Further, the author derives a nice set of additional inference rules like modus ponens and modus tollens and disjunctive syllogism. A great fundamental logic read! Section 3.2 gets into subjects like the soundness theorem and subjects of completeness, consistency and decidability of propositional logic: P is sound/consistent/incomplete/decidable, so there! Section 3.3 derives several more complicated new versions of some of the inference rules and then proves the deduction theorem by strong induction. Section 3.4 is a worthless purely definition/theorem/proof shuffle, the worst kind of mathematical writing for students. Read some segments of long section 3.5 on proof methods, mostly not the proofs. Gentzen-style proofs of final section 3.6 seem to be best, and I did read all of that. Semantic Gentzen trees seem to work quite well. I'm now a fan of them. Finished 52 page chapter 3 on Sun 3Mar13 afternoon.In section 3.6, the author writes even more intensely obsolete and completely nonstandard terminology than in chapter 1! What he calls 'decomposition rules' are more widely known as 'elimination rules', and his hyper wordy term of 'decomposition rules turned upside down' are more widely known simply as 'introduction rules'. What is wrong with just calling these logical objects 'elimination rules' and 'introduction rules'? This textbook was originally published in 1995. How can the author, working that late, be so glaringly backward and verbose in his terminology on this occasional basis? Please just be aware of this as you read late chapter 3. / Some references using terminology of intro-elim rules: Prawitz 1965 / Manna 1974 / Troelstra, et.al. 2000 / Hedman 2004. This reader also has reviews of the Prawitz and of the Manna Dover books of the present references among his Amazon reviews."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Mathematical Logic","review":"Dr. Hodel does an excellent job of providing undergraduate students an introduction to logical thinking.

Katy King introduces the world to the City of Portland through the eyes of her primary character, P.I. Jane Lanier in City of Suspects. The story follows Lanier through her trials and tribulations as a female Private Detective in the small city of Portland, Oregon. Within the first 30 pages you are griped by a car explosion, a murder, and a sex scene. Unlike many fictional characters that have superhuman confidence, amazing intellect and a can do no wrong attitude; Lanier appears to be truly human. We learn about her insecurities, fears, and emotional back-story in a quick and to the point manner that interweaves very nicely with the plot line. Though it is unfortunate that the ending comes a little too quickly and everything wraps very conveniently in one easy to swallow package, King accomplishes what it seems she wanted, in less than 250 pages. At the novels conclusion it also appears that Lanier will be having more adventures in the very near future.For a first time novelist, King shows a remarkable grasp of not only her subject and surroundings but of writing style and fictional prose. Though the novel could hardly be considered high literature, it is entertaining none the less. Those who live in Portland, Oregon or have recently visited will enjoy King's takes on the cities sites, sounds and people. The opening pages on the book provide a good example, \\"Rain fell over Portland, Oregon...It swelled the Willamette River, stripped the trees of their leaves, and sent tears streaming down the copper face of Portlandia, the six and a half ton statue that guards the city from her perch...\\" It will be interesting to watch as King's writing style grows as her characters have more adventures.Overall, I would highly recommend this novel. The quick prose and fast plot line make City of Suspects an easy and enjoyable read (good for long road trips or flights). It is perfect for those long, rainy winters in Portland, Oregon or anywhere else in the world. I look forward to the next installment of the Adventures of Jane Lanier."},{"Title":"City of Suspects","review":"Although it starts raining bullets one fall night in Portland, Oregon, first-time author Katy King tells a tale of murder and betrayal that reads like a rose-strewn love letter to the City of Suspects.Jane Lanier, a smart and smart-alecky private investigator with a murky past, goes to her office late one Friday night only to find the dead body of the local bad guy slumped over her desk. From there, things get complicated.With wit and a sharp eye for detail, Katy King chronicles Lanier's exploits in a way that packs a punch and never lets up.

He reminds me of Joseph Mitchell (\\"Up in the Old Hotel and Other Stories\\"), who wrote of similar experiences in and around New York City for the New Yorker magazine in the 1930's, 40's and 50's.This book chronicles a solitary road trip that Morton took around England in the late 1920's. It tells the story of his experiences with local people and gives fascinating historical commentary about some of the sights. As such, it's got human interest, glimpses of life in rural England nearly 80 years ago as well as snippets of life in England over the centuries. Morton's writing style is simple, sincere and insightful. He makes you believe he loves what he's writing about.He sets off from London and heads west/southwest along the coast of the English Channel to Land's End. From there he goes northeast along the Bristol Channel and then straight north to Gretna Green just over the border into Scotland (\\"This story has no right in this book and I apologize for writing it\\" he writes), along Hadrian's Wall and finally zig zags southward back to London.In Cornwall (\\"There is a strangeness in Cornwall. You feel it as soon as you cross Tor Ferry.\\") he spent the night in a tiny bedroom of a cottage in St. Anthony-in-Roseland. \\"...I came here because I like the name.\\" Prepared for the worst, he finally came across \\"a rosy middle-aged woman, wearing a print apron...standing at the door of a pink cottage looking at my car as though it were an unnatural phenomenon.\\" Asking her where he might stay the night, she replied \\" \`I've got nothing for dinner, sir, but eggs and cream, because we have no shops, and everything is brought us from Gerrans in motor car-or else I'd gladly give you my spare room.' I told her that eggs and cream were the only things I would dream of eating in St. Anthony-in-Roseland.\\" He goes on to recreate the evening he shared with this woman, her husband and some neighbors, talking and listening to music from the ballroom in London's Savoy Hotel on the wireless.In another adventure, Morton arrived at Wells Cathedral just before noon and saw \\"a crowd whispering, standing about, sitting on stone seats, leaning against pillars and tombs,...There were charabanc (sight seeing motor coach) parties, American families, market women, farmers and their wives... \`What are they doing?' I asked a verger. \`Waiting to see the clock strike twelve!' he replied. Then I remembered that in Wells Cathedral is one of the most exciting clocks in England; in fact, with the exception of the clock in Strasburg Cathedral, probably one of the most exciting clocks in the world. It is 600 years old, and it was invented by a monk of Glastonbury called Peter Lightfoot.\\" He goes on to vividly describe the clock and what happened as it struck twelve.I love discovering great writers, and I put HV Morton in this category. In addition to \\"In Search of England\\" he wrote about London, Spain, Italy, Rome, St. Paul (the person), and more. I look forward to reading all his books and am grateful for DaCapo Press (and my husband who bought this book) for making this discovery possible."},{"Title":"In search of England","review":"\\"... there rose up in my mind the picture of a village street at dusk with a smell of wood smoke lying in the still air and, here and there, little red blinds shining in the dusk under the thatch. I remembered how the church bells ring at home, and how, at that time of year, the sun leaves a dull red bar low down in the west, and against it the elms grow blacker minute by minute. Then the bats start to flicker like little bits of burnt paper and you hear the slow jingle of a team coming home from the fields ... When you think like this, sitting alone in a foreign country, you know all there is to learn about heartache.\\"- H.V. Morton, homesick for EnglandFirst published in 1927, IN SEARCH OF ENGLAND bears testimony to Henry Morton's love affair with his homeland. For those of us that are citizens of elsewhere who are otherwise lovers of England and everything English, the volume joins Bill Bryson'sNotes from a Small Islandand the trilogy by Susan Allen Toth (My Love Affair with England,England as You Like It, andEngland for All Seasons) as absolutely required reading. All five books are declarations of love.Having traveled all over England myself, as well as Wales and Scotland, during multiple visits, I could immediately relate to Morton's experiences at a number of unforgettable places: Salisbury, Winchester, St. Just-in-Roseland, Tintagel, Clovelly, Glastonbury, the Lake District, Hadrian's Wall, Durham, York, Lincoln, and Norwich. (I'm only perplexed that he apparently failed to visit so many others that I could name!)The fact that Morton made his clockwise circuit of the kingdom eighty-three years ago is only evident by his reference to charabancs, the addition of water to his car's radiator, and an evening's entertainment with some isolated locals in the far reaches of Cornwall - listening to a broadcast from London's Savoy on the wireless. Otherwise, his experiences might just as well be contemporary.At times, the author's prose approaches the sublime, as this entry from Shrewsbury:\\"When I drew back the (hotel) bedroom's curtains, the moonlight printed itself green on the floor. It ran over the bed and lay slantwise upon a grim wardrobe that stood in the shadow of the ancient oak-beamed room. A proper Puckish night, with the green wash over hill and field, a night for elfin horns and mushroom rings and strange scurryings in thicket and copse. Somewhere near, a dog, unable to sleep and not knowing why - poor little lost wolf - whimpered restlessly.\\"California has been my home state for 58 years. Yet, even during my two lengthy residencies away - 12 months in Illinois and 15 months in Mississippi, I wouldn't have been able to write such an affectionate tribute to the Golden State as Morton delivers for his birthplace. The fact that I myself could perhaps pen one about Great Britain, and England in particular, is indicative of my devotion to the place. On my occasional returns to the island, my feeling on the aircraft's final approach to Heathrow or Gatwick is one of returning home. IN SEARCH OF ENGLAND is a reminder why my affection runs so deep. Sitting here at my computer in Glendale, CA, I miss that green and pleasant land so very, very much."},{"Title":"In search of England","review":"In the Lion's Mouth: Gisi Fleischmann & the Jewish Fight for SurvivalIsn't This Glorious!: The 15th, 19th, And 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiments at Gettysburg's Copse of TreesHere is how travel writer H.V. Morton decribes an English market town, in the years between the two great world wars of the 20th century:\\"Romsey, in the magic county of Hampshire, is the ideal small market town. Lord Palmerston, with hair turned green by years of rain, stands importantly on a plinth in the market place; a policeman in an easier attitude stands near him; there is a full cake shop opposite;...now and then a man and a cow cross the square...\\"This small but vivid description from the book \\"In Search Of England\\" gives us just a \\"smatch\\" of Morton's colorful and evocative prose. Copyrighted in the 1930s and a best seller in its time, \\"In Search Of England\\" gives us something more: a look at an England that can no longer be visited, except through Morton's magical prose. What intervened was, of course, the Second World War, greater and more tragic than its predecessor. And its predecessor was so great that this book and his \\"In Search Of Scotland\\" are full of images and tales of people still trying to recover and rebuild.So you can't read \\"In Search Of England\\" without wondering how much of what Morton wrote about here has been lost forever. He experienced that loss personally, and perhaps it explains why, late in life, he moved his family to South Africa. There, he seems to have built a close replica of the English home he had known.But in a sense, in writing about lost England, he has helped immortalized it. I urge you to read this book, not only for the castles and cathedrals, many of which are still standing; but also for the lost ways of life and the people who led them: the craftsmen, the nobility, and even the pensioners of St. Cross. These aged gentlemen were supported in their old age--food, drink, shelter, clothing--through the benevolence of a churchman who had lived many centuries before, the medieval Bishop Henry of Blois. I hope their descendants are still there, but I dread checking out the present state of affairs.If you love travel, history, the human heritage, you should read this book."},{"Title":"In search of England","review":"A website devoted to H.V. Morton and his works describes \\"In Search of England\\" as \\"the best-loved travel book of the 20th century.\\" I'm not sure on what they base that judgment, but I for one am inclined to go along with it. I've read and reviewed a number of Morton's books, written both before and after this one, and while I enjoyed them all none of them were quite as entertaining, enlightening, and enthralling (a word I don't think I've ever used in an Amazon.com review before) as this one.Following an almost crushing bout of homesickness in the Holy Land, Morton (who was 34 when he wrote this, incidentally) asked himself why, when Englishmen abroad think of England they -- even city-dwellers like himself -- picture green villages, hedge-lined roads, and other icons of rural life. Returning home, Morton sets out on a light-hearted and impulsive driving tour of villages, countryside, and cathedral and market towns. While the \\"In Search Of...\\" title might later become a conceit or even a clich&eacute;, in this, the first of his books to employ that phrase, he is literally in search this semi-mythical \\"England,\\" if it still exists.Morton's tour is a remarkable one, and along the way he meets practitioners of dying arts like bowl-turners and flint-chippers, all sorts of interesting people from nobility to tramps and \\"wayfarers,\\" and a surprising number of American tourists (whose habits and slangy lingo I hope Morton is exaggerating, to save us a good deal of embarrassment). Morton's descriptions of architecture and landscape are excellent, but it's his ability to capture personalities and draw word-portraits that really shines. It's this aspect, as well as his clear love for his subject, that really drew me in. I read \\"In Search of England\\" cover to cover during the long Presidents' Day weekend, and got so into it I admit to actually being a little surprised to raise my head after the last page and discover (to paraphrase a famous movie line) \\"Seattle ... [expletive], I'm still only in Seattle.\\"I happened to read a third-printing of this book published in 1930, but I've also seen the contemporary Da Capo Press edition, and I have to say that if there's one thing \\"In Search of England\\" could use these days, it's an annotated version. Morton makes many references, comments, and asides that while understandable to readers in 1927 are largely lost to those in 2008. And then, of course, there's the question that kept haunting me as I read this, \\"How much of this survived the war and the subsequent half-century?\\" I read this book with an open Internet connection by my side for just such impulsive searches, and plan on someday going back through my copy and adding some notations of that sort myself, to the extent I can.That issue aside, \\"In Search of England\\" is a remarkable book about a remarkable journey. You don't need to be a nostalgia-ridden Anglophile to get a lot out of it or appreciate the author's observant eye and skilled pen. But in my case, it helped."},{"Title":"In search of England","review":"H.V. Morton was a great travel writer. The first books I read by this author were about Italy, because I read everything I can about Italy. Morton wrote during the early 20th century, so there is a definite feeling of not just travelling, but travelling to another time. This is even more noticeable in the books about England and London. \\"In Search of England\\" takes the reader back to England of a few generations past. Morton is fascinated by the England of HIS past, and he speaks with English country folk who were old-fashioned even to his generation. There was a man who chipped flint into tools, for example. For readers like me who were fascinated by books like Rudyard Kipling's \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" and \\"Rewards and Fairies\\", Patricia Wright's \\"I am England\\", and the more recent \\"Sarum\\", this book will be a great source on England as it was in the last century.

Like tea with shortbread cookies, this compilation of travel thoughts and experiences is timeless, even though it is technically out-of-date. This is the point of Morton's work, though, that there are many things about the \\"Old England\\" which the traveler, or the British citizen, can not find today, except through searching over an interesting hill, down a mysterious lane, or in conversation with a stranger. Today's reader can appreciate how many things about England have passed out of fashion, but are still loved.

Therefore, it was my pleasure to purchase local author Dorie LaRue's new novel, Resurrecting Virgil. I bought the book because I am a former student of LaRue's (at Louisiana State University in Shreveport) and a current good friend. However, I read and decided to review the book by merit alone. It was incredibly good.Resurrecting Virgil centers around Virgil Matthews, a quiet, nerdy fellow who works in a funeral home and is obsessed with golden-girl Lorna Jean Gibson, who, despite their small town, barely knows he exists. Lorna Jean dates Speed Maxwell a handsome, yet crafty post-highschooler who drives a red Bronco...and who can compete with that? Therefore, Virgil's closest connection to Lorna Jean is through Lorna's cousin, Daisy, a spitfire with a sarcastic tongue, who is, nevertheless, nice to Virgil. While the girls were initially creeped-out over the nature of Virgil's occupation, the three of them become serendipitously involved in a situation that is half-funny and half-horrific. I mean, taxidermy is involved. The deceased are referred to as \\"Beloved Ones\\" and the mourners are \\"Bereaved Ones.\\" All of LaRue's characters are comic and charming, and she plays their weaknesses lazily and laughingly, like dominos on a Sunday afternoon.There are also plenty of delightful tidbits about Shreveport in the book, although the town is called Harrisonville. There are references to former Shreveporter Van Cliburn, trips to the Duck Pond and Poverty Point, Louisiana, treks down Highland and Stoner avenues, and mention of LSU-S colleague Dr. Tom DuBose, who is named after a Beloved One. Good thing DuBose doesn't scare easily. Especially since his character is switched with another Beloved One, with the funeral employees hoping to bejeezus the Bereaved Ones won't find out.LaRue studied creative writing under University of Southwestern Louisiana professor Ernest Gaines, who is best known for his works A Lesson Before Dying and Miss Jane Pittman. In addition to teaching all over the state, LaRue has written two poetry books, Private Frenzy and Seeking the Monsters.LaRue's poetry background and maxing out of English degrees has lent her some pretty confident writing. The familiar characters and vivid images will have readers nodding in recognition and appreciation over LaRue's talent of capturing the quintessential Southerner and underlying quirks therein.Resurrecting Virgil, published by Backwaters Press, was the recipient of the 2000 Omaha Prize as well as being supported by numerous grants and fellowships."},{"Title":"Resurrecting Virgil","review":"When was the last time you threw back your head and laughed out loud?

I found it used for a very good price on this site, and I purchased it. Get the book; you'll thank me for it."},{"Title":"Passion","review":"I picked up this little red book knowing nothing about DeAnglelis and too little about some of my own confusing emotions and experiences. Perhaps its brevity and simple truths are part of its power and charm. Don't expect an intellectual masterpiece but it's well worth the hour it will take to read. If you are passionate, you will love it and laugh with DeAngelis. If you lack passion, it could open your eyes to a new truth."},{"Title":"Passion","review":"The book is small and short (not that I crave verbose books). Don't know why it cost so much. This book does a terrific job of describing the need for passion in all aspects of our lives, not just personal relationships (although I bought it thinking it only pertained to such). However, do to its brevity, there are very few suggestions and exercises to increase one's passion in any aspect of one's life. I wanted a \\"How to Increase Your Passion\\" book, not a \\"Passion is Important\\" book. As a result, this book left me nothing to go on, rendering it relatively useless."},{"Title":"Passion","review":"Another wonderfully inspiring book by Dr. Barbara De Angelis. Passion is not only about the passion shared by a couple in the bedroom, but rather infusing that passion for LIFE in all area of our lives. In fact, Dr. De Angelis defines the very PASSION she writes about.\\"Passion is much more than the intense physical attraction we feel for another person, or a strong belief in a cause, or even an enthusiastic attitude toward our relationship, our work, and our family. It is not just a quality to possess or an emotion to hope for, Rather passion will infuse... each experience ... with vitality, magic, and meaning.\\"Barbara breaks the book, which definitely one of her shorter books, just 95 pages, quite easily readable, digestible, and then, ergo, implementable, shorter than some of her longer books which her fans like myself (yes, a biased review!) read of hers. Within those 95 pages she breaks it into 3 major sections: Self, In Relationship, and then in Life.Each section is so marvelous and prompted me to contemplate passion as a golden thread woven throughout ALL of my life, not just in those fleeting captured moments in the bedroom of a couple. I really admire that as a theme for LIFE as she approaches it. And indeed within each of us to well up, as she describes it in the closing of chapter 1, section 1. Indeed, in the section on SELF in section 1, she encourages us to become our own source of passion and not create a co-dependent relationship on someone else for our dependence to create and experience real passion. This is a marvelous reminder for all - whether single, single again after divorce of being widowed, or for coupled up people and married folk. When we are responsible for our passion as she espouses, then we can create healthier love relationships, more so than ever before.Strongly recommend this gem. You will want to return to it like a meditation book at least quarterly for additional reflection and refreshment."},{"Title":"Passion","review":"OK, it's short. It won't take long to read.

However, the likelihood of a piece made of wood or other perishable material surviving the wet, tropical climate of the Maya lowlands is slim; moreover, that this sculpture is of such high quality is all the more remarkable. This short but detailed monograph details the provenance as well as the aesthetic qualities and representations of this piece, comparing it to similar Maya and Olmec designs in other media. Crisp black-and-white photographs show all sides of this remarkable sculpture, enabling the reader to examine the piece as if he or she were viewing it in a museum show case."},{"Title":"Barney Goes To The Zoo","review":"In this board book, Barney takes children on a trip to the zoo to visit several animals who hide behind large flaps.

It is a title which trades on what Yadin alludes to in his concluding Chapter. I am referring Yadin's choice to relate his otherwise outstandingly careful and well argued theses concerning the midrashim of Ishmael ben Elisha to a recently fashionable trend in Rabbinic study involving a concatenation of terms and theses inclusive of real or alleged \\"binitarianism\\" and real or alleged \\"Logos Theology\\" in and amongst the tannaim in the first decades after the destruction of the Temple. There is nothing in Yadin's own carefully argued contentions which justifies the association of what he finds in the Ishmaelic midrashim and this recently fashionable trend.I understand Yadin to be making the point that the phrase \\"the writings\\" in the Ismaelic midrashim is: a). to be understood as quite, quite separable from the Ishmaelic usage of \\"Torah\\"; and b). constitutes a figure in these Ishmaelic midrashim which designates a feature of the \\"Torah\\" (writ large, so to speak) whereby Torah itself elicits from itself this \\"self-correcting\\" figure designated as \\"the writings.\\" If this is a correct reading of Yadin, such is revolutionary in its implications. For if such a figure (i.e., \\"the writings\\") does in fact animate the Ishmaelic midrashim then, in effect, it renders this Ishmael ben Elisha as a figure central to the fundamental Rabbinic dilemma: Given that commentary on Scripture shows that SCRIPTURE ITSELF, within its own writing, already corrects itself and comments on itself, then what does this mean for the Oral Law and how, ultimately, the Oral Law is to present itself? To focus in on just one, albeit salient, feature of this dilemma please note the following: Is the Oral Law essentially married or only incidentally related to the procedure which today we, somewhat imprecisely, refer to as \\"prooftexting\\"? Married say the early \\"halakhic\\" (another correct-but-imprecise term) midrashim. Only incidentally related says the Mishna which came to have the stamp of \\"officialdom.\\" EMPHATICALLY MARRIED! the honored talmud on the Mishna insists.Many more things could be said. But let me close with these observations. The recently fashionable cabal which wants to find \\"Logos Theology/binitarianism\\" under every rock when studying the tannaim of the decades immediately following the destruction of the Temple is a defection away from unearthing the true set of dynamics going on during those decades. Yadin's analysis of the figure of \\"the writings\\" in the Ishmaelic midrashim is outstanding and can, taken by itself, lead to a more accurate understnading of those decisive decades. But his choice to relate what he has so carefully unearthed to a deflective and largely irrelevant passing fashion in the study of these things is most unfortunate. Four stars anyway. John W.

Hedgehog plainly states that he won't miss Rabbit because he'll be sleeping. While Rabbit says he'll miss his friend, Hedgehog is bothered by the fact that he doesn't know what winter IS-he sleeps through it!Hedgehog asks Rabbit to &quot;save a bit of winter for me&quot; and writes a note on the bark of a tree to help Rabbit remember. Problems arise when winter hits and Rabbit, who usually eats pink clover and green grass is reduced to eating brown things--including bark off trees with MESSAGES written on them!Well, fortunately, while Rabbit may be scatterbrained, he remembers what Hedgehog wanted him to save, and manages, with a bit of forest ingenuity, to save some winter for his sleeping friend.&quot;A Little Bit of Winter&quot; is a testament to friendship. The precise illustrations and depth of expression make the characters feel so very REAL, to children as well as adults. One can simply FEEL Rabbit's sadness and frustration at having to eat brown stuff, dig through mountains of snow AND be lonely on top of everything else. The joy both Hedgehog and Rabbit feel when spring comes and they get to be together again is infectious and radiant.An excellent book, highly recommended.

With numerous references to James Stuart Russell's excellent book The Parousia, Cook brings even more arguments to the table, and acknowledges in his prefaces to the second and third editions that he adjusted his position on several issues related to eschatology, and emphasizes how important it is for a believer to understand eschatology properly. A proper understanding of covenant eschatology will dictate a christian's decisions regarding politics, society, culture, family...etc. While I do not agree with all his conclusions, this book is an excellent primer for everyone interested in what the Bible actually says about \\"end times\\" and the so-called \\"end of the world.\\""},{"Title":"The Romance Of Certain Old Clothes","review":"Henry James' first ghost story, first published 1868, then included in two story collections during the following 20 years.In pre-revolution times, two New England sisters are divided by their common objective.

Be it Jon looking wide eyed when Garfield will do something odd, or Jon looking smug and Garfield looking, well, looking normal is enough to me make laugh. I think he is at his best with his Chandler Bing comments. He will say nothing for the whole strip and then at the very end will give a little comment, maybe even 5 words and he will have me laughing my head. I think that is when he is at his best.I think it is incredable that after 20 years he is still funny.

Very in depth and covers a whole lot of topics on inorganic and organic textures and how to use them. He also takes you step by step through the modeling process of a gun and a big ugly monster.But instead of spending too much time repeating what everyone else is saying good about the book, I am going to tell you what I think isn't so good about the book because there are a few not-so-good things about the book you should know before spending half-a-hundred dollars on it. Though, I still give the book 4 stars because it has many more good points than bad.The most depressing thing is that you really need full versions of all the software programs used to be able to follow along with the book the way you need to in order to learn what your reading. Sure, you get some experience working with a bunch of programs like 3d studio max 5 (very heavily used in 3d game model production) but you don't even do 3d modeling it. Instead, you follow along with the modeling process in TrueSpace 4 or 6. What you'll find REALLY frustrating about that is, unless you have $595.00 to spend on the full, legal copy of version 6.6, you won't be able to save any of your work using the DEMO version that comes with the book! So, you may spend an hour or more modeling your gun, and then have to close the program down and load the model that the author made on the book's CD in order to continue to the UV mapping, texture painting, optimizing and triangulating which is done in 3ds max 5 (of which the demo version is also included on the book's cd-rom). The modeling process could have been done just as easily in 3ds max 5 which is much more powerful than TrueSpace anyways. Why switch between the two programs when one can do both tasks? 3ds max 5 costs an arm and a leg (around $3,105.00), but can do EVERYTHING that TrueSpace &amp; DeepUV combined can do. The full, retail (useable) version of DeepUV costs $795.00.If you don't believe me about UV mapping for characters in video games using 3ds max, then check out the book &quot;Mastering 3DS MAX 4&quot; which has a section on modeling a character then UV mapping it just like it is done in DeepUV. DeepUV is a complete waist of money if you own a copy of 3ds max 4 or higher.Now when texturing you use two different programs, Deep Paint 3D 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop 6. Both programs are equally good and equally powerful, though Photoshop is much more popular. I do not understand why he spreads tasks out across the two programs when he could have done just about everything in one program or another without using both programs. Deep Paint 3D 2.1 costs $995.00! Adobe Photoshop 7 costs you about $609.00!See what I'm getting at? You gotta have a fortune to spend on graphics production software in order to fully and completely follow along with this book and to be able to do ANYTHING productive with the information you've learned after reading the book, especially if you are a game programmer like me who has to make 3d models, then texture them and plug them into a 3d rendering engine.You can do anything and everything this book covers by having a full version of just two peices of software, Adobe Photoshop 7 and 3ds max 4 or higher. That's it...that's all you need. Buying two 3D modelers, a program for UV mapping, and two texture paint programs is a waist of a whole lotta money. I understand the good it can do because one program can essentially be better at one task than a similar program can, but how many of us hobbiests have over $6099.00 to spend on software to follow in the footsteps of the book author? Not me, certainly.If the book was designed with the hobbiest or budding superstar in mind then it would have focused all it's attention on production software that doesn't require you to be a zillionare. In fact another software program out there, Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8 can also be used for making game quality textures and 2D sprite art very much like Photoshop 7 or Deep Paint 3D 2.1 but it only costs about $100.00 for the full retail version. And then there's 3D modeling software like Milkshape 3D which is also VERY cheap in comparison to 3ds max, Maya, Lightwave, TrueSpace, Cinema 4DL, etc. And the best thing about Milkshape 3D is that it was made specifically for making game-only 3D models (originally made for the game Half-Life).Don't get me wrong, I do like a lot of things about this book. The book does a good job of showing you how to use an array of different programs and how to effectively use them for making game art such as 2D textures and 3D models and how to prepare those models for use in a game engine, and it even includes a demo game engine to plug your models into. But just be warned that owning those programs isn't necessary to make quality 2D and 3D artwork for games, but IS required to follow along with the book completely. You can &quot;work around&quot; with the book using the demos that comes with the CD, but don't get too excited because you can't even save your TrueSpace 3D models anyways, so how are you going to get the models into 3ds max 5 for further manipulation and game prep?"},{"Title":"2D Artwork and 3D Modeling for Game Artists (The Premier Press Game Development Software)","review":"Here, let me give a decent review: I'm a web designer turned game artist, so I've recently been in search of books on modeling, animation, and whatnot. My experience is with Photoshop, GoLive, etc, so texturing comes fairly easy. 2D Artwork/3D Modeling for game artists (despite the long title) enticed me to buy it because it covers so much of what I need to know, and become familiar with for modeling/texturing. There's no animation, which was a bummer, but I saw other books on character animation and they're over 1000 pages, so I suppose the auther couln't fit it all in. The first part of the book introduces the reader to modeling a weapon (which was very cool) in Truespace 6 using what is called boolean and point editing modeling techniques, which I had no idea of and was very quick and easy. Then, the author shows how to model a game character using NURBS, which is modeling with digital clay and VERY cool. The tutorials are stepwise, clear, and concise. Plus, he shows optimizaiton techniques for games, and I never thought these were things I had to do, so that's a plus.Moving on, the reader is introduced to U_V mapping techniques, and I had always wondered how models were textured, using DeepUV and DeepPaint. 3D Studio Max 5 is used for preparing the models for the torque game engine. I think the downside is the price of the software that the author demonstrates, Max is like [alot of money], and I know Photoshop for texturing is [a little bit of money], but truespace is not bad, under [money] or less for prior versions. DeepUV is pricey at around [money], but these programs are top-of-the-line, but if you're a collage kid you might have to get hacked versions if you can't afford it :) I assume if you work for a game company as an artist you'll need these programs anyway, so it's good to read this book. A large portion of the book is basic texturing techniques as well, and I learned some stuff from it too, things you'd never think to do. I was hoping for some level design stuff in there too, but all in all the author covered a lot of critical material, so 4 stars."},{"Title":"2D Artwork and 3D Modeling for Game Artists (The Premier Press Game Development Software)","review":"The main problem with this book is that the author isn't very good at what he does. He details lovingly how to make the artwork but he simply lacks the talent to create 3D art that's very good. The model he creates, Slogre is in the end, a lumbering snow man like mess of a creature poorly set up for animation.The author spends a lot of time talking about concept art and why its important only to ditch it in production of the model, ditching all of its charisma to create an ugly mess that looks like it was created by someone completely inexperienced.Most of the textures he creates end up looking very flat and ugly. The black and white printing causes a lot of his points to be lost. The best examples of this are on pages 225 and 226. He shows a demonstration of poorly tiling textures with noticeable seams. However, due to the cheap printing, the wall is just a solid block of grey making the visual aid wholly useless.If you're completely new to 3D art, there are far worse places you could start. This book has some decent primers initiating readers with certain aspects of various art programs including Photoshop. There's a lot of information here and it's not all useless.However, if you are planning on getting into 3D art, I would recommend you start out with Milkshape 3D and Psionic3D tutorials. (Google those. Amazon doesn't allow linking last time I checked.) For texturing, 3D Game Textures by Luke Ahearn is a much better resource than this.If you have any experience in 3D art though, then you can probably skip this book without a second thought. There is likely nothing you couldn't have figured out on your own. The things that are worthwhile for the experienced here are already available in Internet tutorials.The only thing that would make this book of any value to an experienced artist is the collection of nearly 500 royalty free photos intended for use in your own textures. To some, these are probably worth the price on their own, but they're photos that would be easy for someone to take on their own. Think twice about buying this book."},{"Title":"2D Artwork and 3D Modeling for Game Artists (The Premier Press Game Development Software)","review":"This is the first book I've seen to cover almost everything a 2D/3D beginner game artist would need to get going. The author uses a great stepwise approach for all tutorials: modeling, uv unwrapping, texturing, and setting up models for a game engine. There's a huge section on basic texturing techniques as well that could even be used for web pages. My only wish was to see animation techniques, but the author covers Max biped rigging and adjusting, nodal arrangements, etc, and the game engine handles the rest. Still very inclusive and great read!

However, I was disappointed that to go along with the tutorials, you had to use a TrueSpace demo or lay out the hundreds of dollars for the full program. The demo doesn't let you save anything, so that makes it very difficult when you're a complete newbie.Every time you make a mistake, especially in undoable operations like Boolean operations, you have to start ALL the way over. :(I would've preferred that the author used one of the more prevalent programs like Max or Maya - it made the learning curve even tougher, having to first learn TrueSpace before being able to do the tutorials in this book.As I say - I'm glad I bought it, but it would've been MUCH more helpful to have been able to use a program/demo where I could save what I'm working on."},{"Title":"2D Artwork and 3D Modeling for Game Artists (The Premier Press Game Development Software)","review":"This book covers everything, from character creation, bones rigging, texturing of the character (and hundreds of general textures using Photoshop).

The author covers character creation almost entirely, including export to the Torque game engine. The only down side is he doesn't include animation, but I guess that's a subject for another book.

Well, that trend has finally been bucked and &quot;decent&quot; is hardly the word to use. This book flat out rocks. With my first scan over things alone I learned all sorts of stuff about Photoshop, trueSpace NURBS, and UVW mapping than I could have possibly expected.

The color pull-out is awesome too."},{"Title":"2D Artwork and 3D Modeling for Game Artists (The Premier Press Game Development Software)","review":"I haven't seen a game graphics book on the shelves more loaded with juicy info... most only teach one program or show how to design and implement a single character.

This is an extremely well-written account of the day-to-day activities of a family first torn by the terror of a missing son, then by grief when that son's body is recovered. The author further shares valuable information, having had time to look back and reflect, on those things families can do to help themselves following a violent crime, as well as things to avoid. The greatest help for victims always comes from a voice of experience. I would highly recommend this book not only for victims, but for everyone; we never know who the next victim may be."},{"Title":"The Value of a Smile: Victimization 101","review":"I was a close family friend at the time of Patrick's murder. It is a factual and heart-wrenching story. You will feel the catasrophe of emotions of the event as well as the frustrations that surrounded all that did and did not happen. It is a must-read for anyone but especially victims and familes that have been touched by this kind of horrific event to let them know that they are not alone with their feelings."},{"Title":"The Value of a Smile: Victimization 101","review":"When I read, Dick Cress' book, The Value of a Smile, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it would be very informative about one family's journey through unthinkable tragedy, and it was. I simply had absolutely no idea how far-reaching the effects of a violent crime reach. Each one of us should want to learn what happens to crime victims and how \\"post traumatic stress disorder\\" are inevitable and quite widespread. We should increase our awareness and sensitivity to these very deserving people. Mr. Cress's book helps the reader to understand this often disabling disorder. Moreover, this informative book highlights how victims have very few rights, while criminals are treated all too fairly. Knowing this will change my perspective forever. I appreciated the candid nature of this book, which made it difficult to read, but absolutely imperative for my limited understanding. I admire Mr. Cress and his ability to present the facts and his absolute honesty. Most of all I so appreciate the title, because the author himself has given me hope and the permission to smile. He reminds each of us that we have the choice always to move forward and the incredible privilege to smile...no matter what. I will never view my life the same, nor will I take it for granted. My thanks and admiration to a fine author and human being, Dick Cress."},{"Title":"The Value of a Smile: Victimization 101","review":"This Book Is So Sad but it inspired me since I have a Daughter who was molested, to see that God is really present when Bad things happen and that no matter what the rest of the world thinks, it is in all of Gods plan .Thank You Dick Cress for helping to open my eyes! to Gods plan."},{"Title":"The Value of a Smile: Victimization 101","review":"Not only is this a book about the author and his family's experience with the loss of their teenage son through a violent and unsolved crime, it has alot of helpful information.

Life can take some unusual twists and turns sometimes. Almost like a fatal attraction scenario."},{"Title":"Something to hide (His Signs of the times)","review":"This short novel gripped my attention from first to last. It involves the reader in the lives of two main characters, a solitary man in his forties, and a young girl hitchhiker who knows how to get her way. He feels sorry for her and offers her a ride, but this is not a novel about sex or male dominance. Rather, it's about how people use one another and drag one another down into hopelessness and despair. The girl is pregnant. She manipulates her way into the man's life, takes control of him, and seems about to destroy him. You won't know until the final paragraphs how the book really hangs together and which of the two main characters it's really all about. I highly recommend this book by the author of the much more famous book \\"The Cruel Sea.\\""},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This book was an easy reader. Yet it has a very good story line.

This author has written many childrens' books and my kids have loved every one of them."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are You My Mother? by PD Eastman uses the most simple of words and phrases along with a storyline which on the surface is so minimal and easy. But this book is weighted with gold. The story is a quest parable for the deepest of life questions, relationships, self-identity, safety, and meaning.\\"Are you my Mother?\\" is the simple repeated question to which the youngest of children are able to relate. Silly animals are asked over and over, and even Big Snort the steam shovel is asked with comical whimsy. And yet, each time baby bird asks the question, it is pregnant with meaning! \\"Are you my mother?\\" means: Are you the one who loves me? Are you the one who will take me in and care for me? Are you the one upon whom I can rely, trust, and find this to be a safe world? Because I need to know the one who has brought me into the world and given me life. Read this to your children over and over, parents! They understand the emotional and relational content of this book. And afterwards, ask your children: \\"And who is your mother?\\" Then, give a hug, share the relationship, assure with your presence.As I am writing this, it's Mother's Day tomorrow. At age 52 I can still read this book and my heart is reassured: thank you, mother earth, for giving me birth, life, and a home. And my human mother's face I see on the last page, and I know who I am."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"In this classic children's story we explore the curiosity of a new born baby bird that just hatched from his egg, and goes off on a search to find his mother. The young bird asks everybody and everything he sees if they are his mother. Being new to this world, he knows no better. In the end the bird is reunited with his mother who was off getting him food.The before mentioned sense of curiosity is what truly stands out in this book. The young bird's quest for knowledge is an attribute of childhood that I can definitely relate to and recall.This is a great beginner's book, and also an excellent bed time story. The story and magnificent color illustrations are sure to captivate young minds.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Fantastic book, loved it as a kid, love sharing it with my bonus kids now. but it was so much smaller than I expected."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I can't tell you how many times I read this to my son.

The illustrations are animated and humorous and draw the attention of the children to such a degree that they can sit alone with the book and become engrossed in the pictures!

The illustrations are simple and sweet. While not the best of the Seuss imprinted books (the better ones being many of the ones written by Theodore Geisel - Dr. Seuss - himself)One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (I Can Read It All by Myself)Green Eggs and Ham (I Can Read It All by Myself Beginner Books)- it is still a great book for moms to enjoy with kids at reading time.

I highly reccomend this book for EVERYONE! And of course, I got an A as my final grade!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I know this is a beloved classic for many, but please be aware that it can be quite scary and unpleasant for some children. As a small child, I hated this book -- the idea of being lost and separated from my mother like that was extremely frightening for me, and the ending, where the baby bird is menaced by the construction shovel, actually gave me nightmares. I may have been unusually sensitive, but just a word to the wise parent -- make sure this book isn't too scary for your child before you choose it as a bedtime reading option."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I read this book when I was a young child (I was 4-5, so it'd be 8-9 years ago) and I found myself reading this book daily for months and months!I thought the concept of a little bird looking for his mother and asking everything in sight was a marvelous and humorous idea.Your child will be reading this book several times a day, just as I did. I remember vaguely carrying this book around, asking my mother to read it or reading it to myself multiple times a week. An epic adventure of a bird trying to reunite itself with its mother! Perfect for young ones!(Also... I had no problems with being separated with my mother afterwards. I knew at the time it was ficticious.)"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"The first time I read this book I was skeptical if my kids would like it.

With a lot of care, but with sincerity, I explained to him my thoughts on this.I think this book made him think a lot, and made him be thankful that we are together. I definitely recommend it!

But this book is surprisingly bland. The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns. The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages. If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"First, let me say that I learned to read from this book. When I was a kid I knew all the words and I loved it! But then again, I didn't know any better, and frankly, neither did my mom and dad. I was lucky in that the book applied to me: I looked like my mom and dad and therefore the message of the book, that your mother is the one who looks most like you, was seemingly harmless.Now, however, I have an adopted son and am friends with many other families created through adoption, including lots of families with children of different races. The message of this book is really inappropriate for those families and even though my adopted son happens to be physically similar to me, it's not a message I want him to hear, either. Families don't have to look alike to be family!One of the earlier comments mentions A Mother for Choco by Keiko Kaska and I think this is a MUCH BETTER book than Are You My Mother for ANY child, not just a child in an adoptive or transracial family. The message of that book is that your mother is the one who mothers you...not necessarily the one who looks just like you."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This children's classic blithely written from an adult point of view, makes light of a baby bird's terror when he realizes that his mother is absent from the nest when he hatches. The plot, the baby's quest for a parent and identity in an increasingly technological and impersonal world, climaxes when the baby plaintively asks a machine (the snort) if IT is his mother. Though the bird mother, identified as such by her scarf and handbag, reassuringly reappears at the end of the book, the reader is left shaken and uncertain of the future of the nest which is the Twenty First Century."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Not a good book for kids. The poor little guy is lost, alone, and frightened as he searches everywhere for his mother. Should be a horror story, not a bedtime story. What kid wants to go to bed with thoughts of being separated from his loved ones and the possibility of never seeing his mother again? I wouldn't recommend buying this book."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"While i can understand the usefulness of this book for parents of adopted children, when i was little i thought it was just AWFUL!I always hated that book, and it made me terrified of getting lost and not being able to find my mother (not that i was ever in any danger of being out of her sight for 1 minute...). I remember thinking that the story was cruel and calloused, and i felt so sorry for the poor baby birdie.To this day (25 yrs later), my mother, sister and I, still joke about being traumatised by \\"are you my mother?\\", and refer to it as \\"that awful book\\".If your kids like it, that's fine, but i will never buy this book for my kids."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This story is really not appropriate for young children. The premise is very frightening. A little bird spends the entire book searching for his mother and comes face to face with a pretty scary \\"snort\\". He does end up reunited with his mom in the end, but the main storyline plants the seeds for plenty of nightmares and anxiety. There are many better children's books out there."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"If you are looking for a story to explain the mother-child bond and you live in an artificial society where all parents look like their children, then, perhaps this book is for you. However, if you are an adoptive parent, a step-parent, a foster-parent, or just a mom whose child doesn't mirror you, don't even bother with this book. I won't read it to my students (I am an elementary school teacher) or to my own children--who, incidentally, don't look like me. The book reinforces the notion that in order for a child and his mother to have a bond, they must look alike. Maybe I'm being a little overly sensitive or PC, but I simply loathe this book, which isn't even well written on top of everything else there is to dislike about it. If you're looking for a moving story, that truly shows what it's really like to be a mom, regardless of who you are or what you look like, A Mother For Choco by Keiko Kasza is a far superior choice."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This book is so awful it prompted me to write my first review. I almost wonder whether I read the same book as the folks who gave this book favorable reviews. This shamelessly dull book is poorly written and illustrated. It was a burden to own until I finally threw it out for the extra space on the bookshelf. This is not a Dr. Seuss book and doesn't contain any of the usual catchy Seusslike rhymes or illustrations. Buy 'Is Your Mama a Llama?' instead and look at this book at your library just to see how laughably bad it really is."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This story is amazing and much more complex than the hobbit. Compared to the hobbit, it is an adult novel that ties in a story of perplexion, and a psychological journey. The little goes on a quest for a deeper self-understanding. The hobbit is a rip off of this book. (Dorothy Matthews is stupid)"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I received this book as a gift but refuse to read it to my kids. I absolutely hate it. I echo many of the other negative comments that the premise is simply traumatizing. Yes, I suppose I am taking it a bit personally, but as someone who worked really hard to be a mom, it's terrifying to imagine my children wandering around asking strangers who I am. I'm less concerned about the \\"stranger danger\\" issue and more about the emotional distress of being lost. The whole thing makes me so sad. I don't even want to donate this book since I hate to think about other children reading it. This book belongs back in the 1960s."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I had this book as a child, and my sister gave a small board book version to my daughter when she was born.

My daughter adopted this book as HER book when she was just over one. My husband and I would often read this at family gatherings to our children and whatever nieces and nephews would join in (all ages)and we usually acquired quite a crowd as the various children were attracted to the zany voices that this book inspires.Now my children are grown and I work as a speech and language pathologist in a public school. This usually is the first \\"story\\" book I read to the younger set. Once they are hooked on board books and lift the flap books and have acquired a small amount of ability to sit still for a book, I introduce this book. It is soooo good for vocabulary and sentence skills and so much fun to read aloud to the kids. I incorporate lots of nutty voices and motor movement to act out the plot and I never hear a word of complaint when I pick this book out for another reading.Usually I leave out several books for the kids to chose from and invariably this one is chosen first, no matter how many times I have read it to them!P.S. I now own this as a board book so I could hear my husband read this to our daughter's small son. He defined himself as a book reader to her and her brother and now he is reading it to our grandson, who was one when we introduced it. It one of the first with a distinct plot (albeit, very simple plot) and he always listens all the way through. Time will tell if he will like it as much as his mother did."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Great book. I begged my parents to read this one over and over again and now my little one loves it too. It's such a cute lesson - wait in one spot for your mother if you're lost - but it's also cute in how it shows the new life of the baby bird. When you read it over, and over, and over, you'll find out how easy it is to memorize 72 pages!

We'd giggle with anticipation as Mom drew closer to the \\"You are not my mother, you are a snort!\\" page then burst into fits of laughter (hey, this was before cable). As a published children's author, I can honestly say that \\"Are You My Mother?\\" was one of the core books that inspired me to try my hand at this noble profession. The best part is now I get to read it to my three girls and they love it too.

It tells of a young bird searching for his mom and asking each animal he meets, &quot;Are you my mother?&quot;Kids can easily relate to the young bird's quest for his mom. He meets a kitten, a hen, a dog, a cow and a snort only to find out that his mom just got food for him and came back for him in their nest!

This is an essential book for any child's library.(A big caveat: make sure your child isn't overly sensitive. Also make sure to read this book to the very end or else your child will be very sad!)Also as another reviewer pointed out, this book has deeper themes for adults to ponder as well! It's one of the few books I can read to my kid and actually be interested in analyzing it. :)"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"As a child I loved the regular version of this book so my mother bought the cloth version for my baby girl. I was a little skeptical - thinking that this wasn't a story that a child a soft book age would enjoy (not enough rhythm or rhyme). My little one has loved this since I introduced it to her at approximately 6 months (should have done it sooner). She loves playing with and inspecting the birdie. She loves looking at the bright colors (especially the red which is a color that babies see early). We know that this is one of her favorite things because she takes it with her when she rolls or scoots. I see the complaints about the original story being abbreviated. I understand where the person is coming from because the original story is better but I accept this for what it is - a first book for a baby. In that way it is absolutely perfect. I was not familiar with cloth books before my mother got this for us and I am so glad that she did. I am going to try to post a picture or two (she is holding the book above her head while laying on the floor - absolutely adorable)."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are You My Mother is one of those books you never forget.

Luckily for him he is returned to his nest by a friendly Snort (dump truck) before his mother gets back.The spirit of the little bird who goes looking for his mother is wonderfully expressed through the illustrations.

I am a mother of 4, and this book is in the top 5 books requested by the boys. It may look rather somber compared to the latest releases, but the kids love this one.This book is a wonderful story of a little bird on a serious quest. He shows such determination and perseverence. There is no stopping this little bird.The book is short enough to hold a child's attention at a very young age. Young children love books with a repetitive banter, and this book fulfills that criterion without annoying the adults.It is a great book to snuggle up with, with a great, positive ending. I can bet that you will get years of reading out of this little book."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This is my daughter's absolutely favorite book.

I recommend every mom adding this book to their child's collection!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I like this book because it is humorous how the bird asks such weird things if they are its mom. I thought for a second maybe the bird wouldn't find its mom but it did. Also, the little bird in the book is so cute.

He babbles about the cow and the dog excitedly!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"My son picks this book out a lot to read before bedtime. I always oblige and read it to him. But out of all of his books this one I enjoy the least. It's not because there is some moral objection to the book. It's not due to the fact that the bird is lost and afraid. Most other reviews say something about the book being upsetting for those kids that are adopted.For kids it is a good book. I would just rather read some other book as it's not as \\"fun\\" as other books I suppose. So I usually read this one first and then read something like, \\"Put me in the zoo.\\"Just my observation. I find the writing dull and predictable. It just seems like it would be simple for someone, anyone, to sit down and write a book of similar nature. Put me in the Zoo and Bear in Underwear are easy for me to read to my son every night.

His world is filled with Spider-Man and Transformers, so how could a baby bird hold his attention? It turns out my concerns were unfounded. The story of a baby bird looking for Mama is as timeless as they come. My son's brow furrows with worry as the bird approaches a construction site looking for Mama. When the baby and Mama are reunited, my son is content. This story shows that, as bad as things might seem, everything turns out alright in the end - a very reassuring message for young kids."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"The book Are You My Mother is about a little bird. He falls out of his home, which a tree. He wakes up and finds his mother is gone. He is sad and goes to go look for his mother. He goes on this journey and looks and looks and looks.

I felt like it could've used some more color, but then I realized they probably kept the color pretty dull for the fact of the mood of the book (the bird having lost \\"contact\\" with his mother, it was set as an unhappy setting). It was fun to read with my little cousin because it really got his emotions going, he felt so bad for the little guy! It was fun to connect through him to the book. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are You My Mother? is the perfect beginner reader. The story is easy to follow and keeps the child engaged in reading.

What could be more compelling to a child than losing your own mother and not knowing what she looks like? The ensuing search has small children on the edge of their high chairs. The whimsical mother surrogates, dog, cat, etc., are absurdly funny to even the youngest. The spunky protagonist is brave and persistent and, with a little help from the most outrageous \\"mother\\" of all, the \\"Snort,\\" the baby bird eventually finds his own true mother. The illustrations are comic and endearing. I particularly like this book because the illustrations do not overshadow the TEXT. Kids today are inundated with easily accessible IMAGES,GRAPHICS. They need WORDS, LANGUAGE, early and often! Both of my children came under the spell of Are You My Mother at an early age. Moreover, I give it and the accompanying toy bird character at every baby shower I attend. I think it asks a pertinent question that moms as well as kids could ponder. As a bonus, Are You My Mother will be read by the child later as a beginning reader. I absolutely love this book and so do kids!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This was one of my absolute favorite books as a child. Twenty seven years later I read it to my one year old, and when I picked it up for the first time to read it to him I still had all of the words memorized from that long ago.

It is about a baby bird hatching and then finding its mother in this big world. The mother feeds the baby (brings it a worm).When I read this book to my children, we compare the bird to them (the child) and compare the worm to the mother's milk. When our children are first born, they immediately find their mother and immediately get fed.I just cannot sing enough praise for this book. I like giving this book as a gift at baby showers. If you have a small child, I would definitely recommend it.Awesome!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"We adopted a little girl from abroad. She is still a toddler and too young to discuss adoption. We got her this book to see how she would react. It has become her favorite that she MUST have read to her every night.

I saw another review about this book saying that it was \\"Scarry\\" and I can't help but roll my eyes. I never once thought the book was scarry when I was little nor did my brother.

My Grandmother read this book to my mom when she was a child and my mom read the book to me when I was a little girl and I will read it to my kids when I have them. This book is great for any child because the drawings tell the story and it will help your child learn to read because they will want to read this story again and again.This story is about an adorable baby bird that hatches and can not find his mother. The baby bird is anxious to find his mother and goes on a journey to find her. He asks everyone and everything he sees if they are his mother.This book is guaranteed to make you and your children laugh. This is also a book adults as well as children will enjoy reading. You will have to read the story yourself if you want to know what happens to the baby bird during his journey."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This 1 star review is for the board book edition -- certainly the harcover gets 5+ stars; it is a classic that should be in every child's library. But why does Random House insist on abridging its catalog to get them to fit into board book format? The board book strips down a story that's already quite simple, and takes all the flavor and joy out of it.Bottom line: if you want to enjoy \\"Are You My Mother?\\" go and buy the \\"complete\\" hardcover edition. If you need something sturdy that your child is going to teethe on, buy a Zwiekback biscuit."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are you looking for a good book to introduce a small child to the joys of reading? Then this one is a great one!Long before I realized that babies are little sponges, someone gave me this book for my then first-born one year old (1968! ) Since then, this book has been a staple for all my children, the youngest now 8.I have read to each child, before they were one - only one isn't as fond of reading as the others, but even he enjoys a good book now and again.This book is the perfect book to introduce little ones to the joys of reading. The words are few and small, and the question is one of interest to little ones who are still trying to sort out what is going on in this new-to-them world.The little bird falls from her nest while mother bird is out getting worms. She (or he) goes to every animal she sees and asks, &quot;Are you my mommy?&quot;This simple story keeps the child's interest, because the little ones are concerned about what happens if they separate from a parent or caregiver.In the end, of course (I doubt that this is giving away the story!) the bird finds the mother and all is right.If you want your children or grandchildren to enjoy reading, this book is an excellent start. Expect to have to read it over and over, so well that you both will have it memorized!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"My son is a big, hulking, almost-16-year-old, but to this day, when he sees construction equipment, he says, &quot;Look, Mom!

All through his early toddler years, it was his bedtime favorite, his naptime favorite, a comfort when he was tearful, and his best friend. How many times did he curl up on my lap with his blankie and his thumb while I rocked him and read this book?The &quot;plot&quot; concerns a baby bird who hatches while the mother bird is out of the nest. Baby sets out to find his mother, and asks everything and everyone he sees, &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; The &quot;Snort&quot; reference comes when the baby bird asks a huge piece of digging equipment, and...&quot;The big thing just said SNORT!&quot; This is what my son waited for throughout the book...he laughed every single time. And still does.In the end, the birdie finds his mommy. The perfect, secure ending for a small child who wants reassurance before bed, or any time. This book is a classic. My son still has it, and I know he will read it to his own children some day. I hope I am there to see it."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"My six-month-old son loves this book. It is a wonderful stroller toy because it keeps him occupied for a long time.

He's fine, and he still loves the book, but I certainly wouldn't let him play with it unsupervised again."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Are You My Mother? was one of her picks.This is a wonderful beginning reader because the story is humorous, the drawings lighten the mood further, and the words are simple and well related to the illustrations. For example, on one page a baby bird is pictured on the edge of the nest alone looking straight up expectantly. The text reads, &quot;He looked up. He did not see her.&quot; The next page is the same baby bird still perched on the edge of the nest looking down. the text reads, &quot;He looked down. He did not see her.&quot;The use of repetition is also excellent. The cover question, for example, repeats throughout the book. So your child can learn to read the book with a minimum number of words to learn, and most of the words are illustrated to provide visual clues.Most children learn to read a book like this by first memorizing it, then reading along with the parent as the parent says the words, then reciting the words, then picking out some words and reading more slowly. Are You My Mother? is well designed for this process.The story involves a baby bird whose mother has gone off to get food so he is born alone. He looks around for her, tries to find her and falls out of the nest. Then he asks everyone and everything he meets if they are his mother. The question is very silly to a child. Your child knows that an airplane and a steam shovel cannot be a bird's mother, and your child will want to shout &quot;no&quot; and laugh in answer to the question. Everything ends up just fine with the baby bird reunited by the steam shovel just as the mother bird returns to the nest. The baby bird had walked near the mother earlier and had not seen her.You may be concerned that the story can create insecurity in a child. And that is possible if you do not use the story as an opportunity to discuss when you would be away from your child. Obviously, your child knows who her or his mother is. You can talk about staying with other family members or baby sitters, and how you can be reached by telephone in those circumstances. Most children do worry about such subjects related to separation but often do not raise their concerns with parents. This book provides a natural way to address the subject in an unthreatening way.After you have read this book, also think about what other insecurities your child may have and how you might discuss those to reduce potential anxiety.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"We have a new tradition at our home. Every night I ask my six year old son what he wants me to read him for his bedtime story, and every night he gives me the same answer. And while I make sure to read him something else as well, I'm happy to agree. &quot;Are You My Mother&quot; is sweet, funny, and every other heartwarming cliche I used to dread before I became a parent. He never gets tired of it, and even more suprisingly, neither do I. (His 8 year old brother and 10 year old sister also enjoy it.) Buy it."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This stands alongside Eastman's \\"Go Dog Go\\" as a classic of children's literature. Though bound in the same style as Dr. Seuss's books, Eastman's illustrations are more gentle and humorous than they are fantastic. His books entertain children with their broadness, while captivating adults with the fineness of their expression. Eastman's dialog is simple enough for early readers to pick up words, yet complex enough to keep parents from being bored to tears on the thousandth reading. The story of a baby bird separated from its mother runs through several emotional phases (independence, discovery, loss, panic, fear, rediscovery), including the story arc's overall resolved drama, and invites children to surface and discuss their own separation anxieties. A must-have for every early reader that will turn into a book full of memories as they age."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This is the one of my 19 month's old favorite book. He will point to it and say \\"Mama Book\\" and will sit still listening to me reading this book from the beginning to the end.

This is an excellent book to introduce a toddler to reading."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I love to send books by PD Eastman to my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter because I can always count on the same response: She LOVES his books!

I haven't a clue; they just possess some sort of magic that a 3 1/2 year old thinks is the right stuff. That's good enough for me. I am going to be very sad when we run out of Mr. Eastman's books."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Three of my nephews and my son's favorite book. He wore it out and I had to buy another one."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"I like the book it was funny because the bird was thinking everyone was her mother. I read the book 4 times. I like how the bird finds his mom at the end."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are You My Mother? was one of those books I'd always see as a kid, but never got the chance to check out for one reason or another. I recently bought it as a surprise for my daughter, and have to say that it's a pretty cute book, and I didn't see anything objectionable about it as a few other uppity people have. I think they might have skipped the first couple of pages showing how the baby bird ended up in its situation. This book is a fun, quick read and would make an ideal book for kids who've learned how to read a little since there aren't many lines on each page, and no tough words.A mother bird is sitting on her egg one day, when she realizes that the baby will be hungry when it hatches. She goes off to find food, and shortly after, a baby bird is born. The baby falls out of its nest and begins to search for its mother, which is kind of tough since it doesn't know what she looks like, and doesn't know that it's a bird either. The baby wanders around asking different animals if they're the mother or not, and always gets a 'no'. It eventually sees vehicles like a boat, thinking it could possibly be the mother too. In the end, the baby bird finds a power shovel and asks the construction vehicle 'are you my mother?' too. The power shovel can't answer, but lets out a loud 'SNORT!'. The baby bird finally gets that this isn't its mother, but somehow, the shovel ends up carrying the bird back to its nest, and the mother arrives immediately with food.This is a cute book and within the first couple of pages has something most kids will react to- the baby bird walking past a rock that its mother is behind. This is the kind of thing that would've made me go 'she's right there!', and sure enough, my daughter said it herself. The little bird has a long journey trying to find its mother, and when it does, it realizes what she is after listing everything she's not. My daughter got a kick out of the power shovel being called a Snort, and has been using that word a lot ever since I read this to her. The artwork is minimal but nice. My only nitpick is that the author kept using 'said' instead of 'asked' when the baby bird would ask the different animals and things if they were its mother. That just seemed weird to me, but doesn't matter much.Give this one a shot if you haven't yet, and don't worry about any objectionable content."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"This book is very cute, and my son finds it comical that the bird thinks the wrong animals are his mother."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Great board book.

Cute book, good for reading to them, or having them read to you."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Are You My Mother, a simple, well-loved classic, opens with a mother bird sitting on her egg. When the egg begins to move, she leaves to find some food for her anticipated baby. In her absence, the egg hatches, and the hatchling sets out in search of his mother. He asks a kitten, a hen, a dog, and a cow if they are his mother, and each says \\"no.\\" He sees a car, a boat, and an airplane, is disappointed that none of them are his mother either. Finally, he finds a construction digger, which he calls a Snort. The digger lifts him high in the air, frightening him terribly, then drops him back into his nest where he meets his mother returning home.This is a great read-aloud for preschoolers, who will identify with the baby bird's fear at being separated from his parents. Its pacing is wonderfully predictable, with not-very-scary tension building to an exciting climax with the \\"Snort,\\" and transitioning quickly to a deeply reassuring ending as the baby bird snuggles into the nest with his mother. It's also a good easy reader, although a student who has had the book read aloud in preschool may view it as babyish. I recommend the full paperback or hardback version rather than the abridged board book, which loses much in the abridging."},{"Title":"Are You My Mother?","review":"Got it for my niece who was expecting a baby girl for her shower.

Many children today do not look like their mothers at all!A much better story is A Mother for Choco, about a little bird who wanders around, going up to every animal that bears some sort of resemblance to it. In the end, it decides to live with Mrs. Bear who is also raising an alligator, a hippopotamus and a pig. To me that is a much more beautiful message for children: that a family doesn't have to be people who look alike.

Simkins brings his vast knowledge of the subject to bear and delivers a tight narrative that hits all the highlights of the war on this front; overall, this is an excellent summary. Unfortunately, Simkins also brings an unabashed over-emphasis on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France - at the expense of the French and Americans. British mistakes tend to get glossed over in this account and the role of Britain in the Allied victory borders on exaggeration. Simkins is also unwilling to swerve in the slightest from conventional wisdom on this subject and accepts unequivocal German war guilt at face value (views on this subject are highly controversial and have evolved over time, but Simkins eschews both controversy and historiographical evolution). While Simkins' two volumes offer an excellent summary of the First World War on the Western Front, readers should be aware that this is the &quot;official&quot; BEF version of events, with much less balance from other participants.The author's opening section on &quot;the road to war&quot; is excellent and carefully weaves together the wide diversity of factors that led to the outbreak of the First World War. While the author's assessment that &quot;the primacy of Germany's responsibility for war in 1914&quot; is obvious based upon its preparations of an offensive war plan, the guilt of other actors (such as Russian cultivation of Serb ultra-nationalism that led to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) is alluded to but not exposed. The section on opposing armies, while brief, is also excellent. The author includes ten maps to support his narrative: European alliances 1914-1916; the rival war plans; the battle of the frontiers; the First Battle of Ypres; the Battle of Neuve Chapelle; the Battle of Loos; the Western Front 1914-1918; the Battle of Verdun; the Somme Offensive 1 July 1916; and the final phase of the Somme offensive. The author's English bias is evident in the maps, with five of ten maps focusing on British battles but only one on a French battle; even the map on the 1914 Battle of the Frontiers fails to depict the doomed French offensive in Lorraine. Given the importance of the Battle of the Marne, a map should also have been included on that subject over a relatively minor battle like Neuve Chapelle (which was important in English eyes, but otherwise no more significant than the many failed French offensives in 1915).The author's narrative of the fighting in 1914-1916 is clear, concise and often insightful. While Simkins notes the standard criticisms of the German Schlieffen Plan - logistical weakness and Moltke's weakening of the critical right wing - he also notes that the Germans failed to adequately address Belgian resistance: &quot;what really harmed their plan was the need to detach some five corps from their right wing to invest Naumur, Maubeuge and Antwerp.&quot; As Simkins sees it, the Germans put inadequate forces into their main effort, then diverted too many forces from that weakened effort on secondary tasks, then loss their nerve due to a puny Allied counterattack on the Marne. Simkins also views the German decision to revert to the defense on the Western Front in November 1914 - instead of finishing off the depleted BEF - as &quot;a huge mistake.&quot; Aside from ignoring the exhaustion of Germany's own troops at that point, Simkins exaggerates the value of the BEF remnants in the fall of 1914, which were perhaps 5% of Allied troops on the front. In fact, the original BEF was essentially destroyed by this point and the Germans had no ability to destroy the dozens of new divisions being raised in England, Canada and Australia. After detailing the various offensives of 1915, Simkins concludes the narrative section with accounts of the two great set-piece battles, Verdun and the Somme. The discussion of the Somme is adequate, but fails to convey the &quot;mission creep&quot; in the German plan that caused a deliberate attritional battle to transform into a major bloodletting for both sides. On the other hand, Simkins' discussion of the Somme follows the standard British line, that while losses were high, the offensive succeeded in &quot;gutting&quot; the German army of pre-war regulars and thereby contributed to victory later. In reality, the Somme was an expensive failure that &quot;gutted&quot; the BEF far more than the Germans and it was the combination of having to fight both Verdun and the Somme in 1916 that really strained the Germans. The only real omission in this volume is the lack of any real detail on the air war (e.g. the &quot;Fokker scourge&quot;).The final sections in this volume are paeans to British sensibilities about the First World War. The section, &quot;Portrait of a Soldier&quot; details the experiences of a 19-year old British private who served only six months in the period of this volume. Certainly highlighting one of the &quot;Old Contemptibles&quot; of 1914 or one of the New Army &quot;Pals Battalion&quot; members would have been more representative of the British war effort in this period. This section is followed by &quot;Portrait of a Civilian&quot; which - surprise, surprise - covers a British female auxiliary. Obviously, no attempt was made to balance this volume with French or British perspectives. The section on home fronts does provide three paragraphs each on Germany and France, but this is relatively an afterthought. Overall, this volume is an excellent summary of the first two years of the war on the Western Front, albeit for an Anglo-centric perspective."},{"Title":"The First World War (2): The Western Front 1914-1916 (Essential Histories)","review":"2002's \\"The Western Front 1914-1916\\" is one of several entries in the First World War series of Osprey's Essential Histories. Veteran British historian Peter Simkins provides a concise introduction to the Western Front, which became the decisive theater of the war.In rapid fashion, Simkins sketches the road to war, the opposing armies and their respective war plans, and how those war plans played out in the opening weeks of the war. The narrative then settles into the prolonged stalemate of of trench warfare, including the massive bloodlettings at the Siege of Verdun and the extended Battle of the Somme. Simkins closes with two featurettes, one on a British private soldier and another on a woman's auxilliary member, before forecasting the epic 1917-1918 struggle on the Western Front.Simkins' narrative is supported by the usual excellent Osprey selection of photographs, maps, and graphics. Presenting two intense years of military and political developments in under 100 pages inevitably leads to simplification. Although Simkins surveys a complicated story fairly well, there is no attempt to wrestle with controversy or alternative points of view. \\"The Western Front 1914-1916\\" is a decent introduction for the general reader and highly recommended to that audience."},{"Title":"The greatest summer: The remarkable story of Jim Bouton's comeback to major league baseball","review":"It seems odd, in a way, to review an out-of-print book that is over 30 years old now, but since I've only read it myself just now, Jim Bouton remains a well-known person of interest, and Pluto has in the interim become a well-known and well-respected sportswriter, why not?The subtitle tells you pretty much all you need to know about the subject: Bouton's successful attempt to make it back to the big leagues in 1978, after a seven-year layoff. The story was a big deal at the time, as his fame/infamy from the publication of Ball Four was still at a high point and nearly everyone involved with baseball, from commissioner to fans, had a strong opinion of both book and author. That freshness is missing 30 some-odd years later, but Pluto gives you a sense of it in his reporting.And reporting is what you get here. Bouton, at the time at pains to avoid having his comeback attempt seem like a publicity stunt, did not cooperate with the writing of the book, and so there is little \\"inside\\" drama. It is all seen from the outside. In point of fact, this reads rather like an extended magazine profile. In another point of fact, frankly, it is extended a little longer than it needs to be as Pluto repeatedly touches on the same aspects of the comeback and what it meant to Bouton. Novella length might have served it better.So, 30 years on, it is still a worthwhile read for those interested in Bouton, fans of comeback stories and baseball fans looking for a short, fairly breezy read. It is hardly essential on any front. Bouton's own books are more interesting overall; Pluto went on to write a number of terrific sports books, most of them better than this one. Still, if the subject strikes you as at all interesting, grab a used copy of this and enjoy it. I did and am no worse for it."},{"Title":"The Prentice Hall Essentials Dictionary of Culinary Arts","review":"This is a great reference book.

I am waiting for a sequel."},{"Title":"P.E.A.C.E.","review":"The problem with this book is that the setting has almost nothing to do with the plot or character. So it's an orwellian world. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, all susupicious moves are screened out by pattern matching and suspects are immediately identified.And then, the special unit named PEACE will nail the suspect using a tranquilizer gun. The city became safer, less crimes. Fine.You would imagine that this sort of setting would lead to an Orwellian dystopia, where people's freedom is compromized under a police rule. No. The only problem is that there is some side effects with the tranquilizer and the hero goes after it. and then he uncovers this huge conspiracy...But even after everything is revealed, I can't really understand the problem. So why not use another tranquilizer??! That's all there is to it. Everything else about this system, according to this story, is just peachy. Really?The story avoids all difficult issues about this sort of setting, and just does this tough good guy (with a beautiful wife) against a big conspiracy. I don't think the characters and the plot are well worked out. He devotes a chapter about a news reporter's past, you think he's an important character, but he doesn't do ANYTHING. Why bother? The final battle seen, where somehow, the major characters come together, is totally unbelievable.I regret the time I spent on this story. I wouldn't want other people to repeat that waste."},{"Title":"P.E.A.C.E.","review":"The law abiding citizens of New York City welcomed the Police Enforced Anti-Crime Environment (P.E.A.C.E.) system that placed surveillance cameras all over town. Although freedoms were surrendered for safety, most New Yorkers have been elated with the results of their new surveillance system that has dramatically reduced crime.While monitoring cameras watching over the subway, police officer Mac Wells and his partner Sam Mullane notice a crime in progress. They quickly arrive at the scene, but during the ensuing fight, Mac accidentally tranquilizes Sam, which is a minor inconvenience. However, a few days later, Sam stunningly dies. A guilt wracked Mac clandestinely makes inquiries starting with the so-called safe stun gun, which soon leads the former loyal cop into uncovering something sinister about P.E.A.C.E. Now his former employers assign Mac's former peers to make Mac meet with an accident.P.E.A.C.E. is a fast-paced futuristic police procedural thriller that will provide much satisfaction to sub-genre fans who don't mind loose subplots. The action-packed story line takes a close look at the issue of safety vs. First Amendment rights with the major advancements in technology making &quot;Big Brother&quot; quite feasible. Although the characters including Mac never quite seem real, the story line packs quite a wallop as Guy Holmes cleverly relates his basic theme of who watches the watcher.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"P.E.A.C.E.","review":"In a future New York City everyone lives in a surveillance state where video cameras record everywhere in subways &amp; streets, elevators &amp; offices; everything from vandalism, burglary &amp; murder &amp; the NYPD wield innovative &amp; much-touted tranquilizer guns. The Police Enforced Anti-Crime Environment(P.E.A.C.E.) seems to be working perfectly - crime is down &amp; the citizenry seems content.Everyone says those tranquilizer guns are harmless, they simply stun perps for the few seconds needed to restore peace. One of New York's elite undercover agents is not so sure. During a fracas in the subway he had accidently tranqed his partner who began showing strange symptoms &amp; ended up in hospital, dead.In a heart-pounding, ungodly vision of the future of Big Brotherhood, Guy Holmes' maiden novel paints a deadly, intricate dabble into the profit of science &amp; experiments, politics &amp; justice. A satisfying &amp; thought-provoking read!

But what if the drugs used in the gun are not as innocent as they seem? Guy Holmes explores the (grim prediction for) future with breathtaking detail. This stuff sounds so real, that I am afraid that, few years from now, we will be walking the streets we only read about."},{"Title":"P.E.A.C.E.","review":"In light of the recent tragic events I began thinking of this book which I read a while back. As we (rightly) edge our way to becoming more of a security state to protect ourselves from terrorism the scenario laid out in Holmes's novel set in New York city (massive video surveillance linked to facial recognition technology linked to behavioral recognition neural networks) looks frighteningly relevant. Though this technology is only begining to be effectively used and is just entering the American public's conciousness it is obvious that it may become a vital part of our future. Holmes touches on the possible (probable?) abuse of this invasive &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology but he doesn't take this obvious route and looks into more subtle and complex underpinnings for the conspiracy which propels the plot. In this regard, I strongly disagree with the previous review. In questioning the saftey of a widely embraced but untested technology Holmes takes a route less predictable but still exciting (you have to read the book to get the details but a good present day analogy might be the massive proliferation of cell phones). There's a secret government and enough conspiracy here to make even the most trusting of us a little paranoid. With recent events I took a second look at this novel. Though a fun, can't-put-it-down kind of read, P.E.A.C.E is also the type of book that can change the way you look at our future."},{"Title":"P.E.A.C.E.","review":"Guy Holmes has taken an engaging political topic and painted an in-your-face kind of story. What could really happen if &quot;big brother&quot; watched too often and inserted too much control in our lives. This book's setting is very New York; you can almost smell the city, but without an overkill in adjectives. The novel is written in a straight forward, almost sticatto form. Quick, pointed, and simple. The plot sets up well, and the character's relationships are built well for a solid working novel. There are only a couple of awkward moments in the story where the characters are dreaming or seeing others around them supernaturally that the story line takes a brief and unusual, maybe unrealistic detour. The plot is strong and heroic, however, and keeps you attentive and interested through the entire novel. Good work Guy!"},{"Title":"The Reading-Writing Workshop (Grades 1-5)","review":"This book was like a staple to me in my student teaching experience as well as my first year of teaching.

You will come away form this book with a healthy respect for those hardy souls that settled the American frontier and will understand why Texans revere this man...."},{"Title":"Charles Goodnight: Cowman and Plainsman","review":"If you are looking for an authentic work on the Old West, the West that really existed, not the West fabricated by Hollywood, this work by J. Evetts Haley is sure to please.Charles Goodnight was a most remarkable man. He emigrated to Texas from Illinois at 9, was hunting with the Caddo Indians at 12, entered the cattle business at 20 and guided the Texas Rangers at 24. His 2,000 mile Goodnight-Loving cattle trail delivered Texas Longhorns through Comanche territory from West Texas to New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming long before the railroads or settlement. He established the JA ranch in the Texas Panhandle in the former Comanche stronghold of Palo Duro Canyon, dominating nearly 20 million acres of range, and would go on to be highly regarded for his breeding techniques. Under his management, the JA ranch would return 72% on invested capital for 10 years. He appears to have been a good, fair man but hell on rustlers.But his most significant contribution to Texas and the Nation was as a conservationist. Alarmed at the slaughter of the buffalo, in 1876 he preserved a herd on his ranch. Descendants of that herd still exist in West Texas as well as numerous zoos throughout the country. Importantly, it was from this herd that bison were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1902.This is a fine biography about a man whose life spanned the settlement of Texas. It took Mr. Haley 10 years to compile the detailed history, stories and yarns contained in this book. It was time very well spent. Haley will make you laugh and tug on your emotions but mostly it will amaze you that a no nonsense, iron willed man like Charles Goodnight could come from such a humble, frontier existence to accomplish so much good for his State and Nation."},{"Title":"Charles Goodnight: Cowman and Plainsman","review":"Charles Goodnight fell in love with the Palo Duro Canyon when he was a Texas Ranger. He returned later in life to establish a perfect ranch in this lovely natural site for a ranch. He only had to fence one entrance and the rest nature took care of with deep canyon walls and natural water supply. Although the canyon had seen a time the Commancheros used it, the ranch became a peaceful place in the Texas Panhandle to raise a mix breed of buffalo and cattle. The leaner beef caught on. Charles Goodnight was a powerful figure head in the Texas Cattleman's Association and his voice could be heard at the head of many of the surrounding cattle round-ups held before fences. All the Panhandle ranches would converge upon a site and sort and brand the cattle belonging to individual ranchers.

One of the outstanding things he did, among all his other activities, was his work with the Bison (buffalo) saving a herd but also in achieving the 'cattalo' a cross between range cattle and the bison.This book was already 20 some years old when it crossed my trail, and though I have a good hardcover copy, it is a second printing. But no matter which copy one may have, it is definately a prime source of information and no small classic in its own right.In September, 2007, the University of Oklahoma will publish a newer biography of Charles Goodnight by William T. Hagan.

Most of the book is told as a chronological story that weaves together some great Texas history with the early life of a great Pioneer and Texan. Reading this book I came to the conclusion that Larry McMurtry's Characters and part of his story for Lonesome Dove were \\"borrowed\\" from this much earlier work of non-fiction.Personally, I find the truth and the actual history more fascinating than McMurtry's fiction.This is a good read. Great information and much of it given to author first hand while Mr. Goodnight was still living. References are extensive and the legacy Mr. Goodnight left is very well documented, supporting his first hand descriptions.As rough and tough as Charles Goodnight was and had to be to survive, he was a civilized man with a tremendous sense of morals and a sense of duty. That lesson alone makes this a biography worth reading."},{"Title":"Charles Goodnight: Cowman and Plainsman","review":"True story of the cowboy and indian saga, with priceless history abounding.

The book was very helpful and gave me insight into both the character of Charles Goodnight, as well as the areas of the country that he made home. I was particularly interested in his partnership with the owners of the JA Goodnight Ranch in the Palo Duro canyon near Amarillo, Texas, and what motivated him to move to an area where the nearest neighbors at the time were 150 - 200 miles away.

However, each was capable of humor in their own unique way, and this collection of stories about the presidents from Washington through Clinton shows much of their humanity. The funniest President of all was probably Abraham Lincoln, and his sense of humor helped him get through the greatest crisis this nation has ever faced.However, I found the funniest one to be when a society woman sat next to Calvin Coolidge and informed him that she had a bet that she could get more than two words out of him. His reply was, \\"You lose.\\" Any person who could utter such a line without breaking stride would have made a great straight man. While there is no real historical significance to the anecdotes, some of the public performance of these men does come through in the stories. There were many times when it was possible to see some of their effectiveness as leaders reflected in their jokes. Politics will always remain an exercise in personal charm and there is no better way to do that than making jokes.I enjoyed the book, finding it a light journey through the history of the American presidency, not in deeds, but in funny words."},{"Title":"Presidential Anecdotes","review":"This book attempts to show the human side of presidents, and includes a short profile of each as well as amusing anecdotes. In reality it is hard to really get a feel for the personalities of some of the presidents profiled because many of the anecdotes are fanciful legends rather an accurate portrayal. For example, the George washington and the cherry tree legend is repeated here. On the other hand, much presidential wit and humor is recounted. Some fairly mediocre presidents ahd a pretty good wry sense of humor, such as Warrren G. harding. This book is entertaining but not a primary source for historical information."},{"Title":"Presidential Anecdotes","review":"Very light reading and not at all comprehensive, but this book doesn,t aim for that. Instead it uses anecdotes (real and unsubstantiated) to give a different view of America's past and present leaders.

It is very good for what it is."},{"Title":"Presidential Anecdotes","review":"And that's through no fault of Boller's.First, with Congress, Boller had tens of thousands of MCs and their anecdotes from which to choose.Second, especially in the early days of the Republic, you had stalwarts such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster in Congress, which you had such notably dry, unfunny and serious presidents as Madison, Monroe and J.Q. Adams. And, Boller could arrange Congessional Anecdotes around different themes, while, due to the small number of presidents, he feels constrained to do a president-by-president blow."},{"Title":"Presidential Anecdotes","review":"No, this is not a scholarly reference work. What it is is an amusing read that helps to put human faces on our Presidents- especially those who served back when we didn't see the President on TV every day. Each President is covered with an introduction of a few pages, then a series of anecdotes that range from touching to laugh-out-loud. Some are unsubstantiated, and the author is up front about that. Extensive footnotes provide documentation on every story.You learn that Lincoln was not only one of our greatest Presidents, but also one of the wittiest. That Coolidge was a penny-pincher with a dry wit. That Washington at times had doubts about his abilities. We even get Reagan and his one-liners, and Clinton with all his back slapping (though the book being published in 1996 leaves out some of the best material of his Presidency!)"},{"Title":"Presidential Anecdotes","review":"A breezy, and interesting collection of information about the presidents. The contents match the title exactly, no surprises here.

Judge for yourself.My two favorite short shorts:A reporter on Air Force One asks John F. Kennedy what would happen if the plane crashed. JFK answers: \\"Two things. First, tomorrow your name would be in the paper. Second, it would be in very small print.\\"In the middle of a debate over teenage birth control in California (when Reagan was the governor), a state senator charged \\"Illegitimate births to teen-aged mothers have increased alarmingly while Reagan has been in office.\\" Reagan: \\"Thanks very much...

It does require some minimal knowlege of the life during the Renaissance era, but ample footnotes are provided to explain the numerous classical references and anything else that the reader might find confusing.One thing to be aware of. While the title of the book is \\"The Worth of Women\\", the dialogue spends FAR more time talking about the lack of worth of men. (The author's basis thesis seems to be that women are virtually perfect, so the occassional \\"bad\\" woman is either an utter anomoly, or has been made \\"bad\\" due to the influence of men; while men are basically evil, and the even rarer \\"good\\" man is an anomaly.) I will confess that the constant harping on the evils of the male sex got a little tiresome after a while.If you don't want to read that men are incapable of love/kindness/caring/intelligence ... this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"The Worth of Women: Wherein Is Clearly Revealed Their Nobility and Their Superiority to Men (The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe)","review":"Today, any advocate of womankind operates under the shadow of feminism. Some react against it, some seek to extend and refine it, and some seek to preserve it. Either way, they must respond to some claims, going back to Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, and other early feminists, such as:-many of the behavioral differences between men and women are socially constructed, not biological-the path to sexual justice lies in the diminution of gender roles (i.e. \\"seperate spheres\\") in favor of free choice-most fundamentally, men and women are of equal moral worth.Moderata Fonte existed before the feminist movement as we know it. As a result, she did not think in the same terms as we would about sexual justice. For example, she never challenges the idea that differences between men and women are intrinsic, as far as I can tell. Similarly, she does not attack gender roles: rather, she asserts that the woman's proper gender role as homemaker, mother, and teacher is undervalued by patriarchal society, and the man's gender role as conqueror and ruler is overvalued. She does not claim men and women are moral equals: she claims women are superior.The book is written as a three way dialogue. Sometimes, the conversation drifts (realistically) to other topics, unrelated to Fonte's main point. This may be frustrating to readers expecting concision, but the diversions can also be interesting, offering insights into the culture of the time."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time.

The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross. &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad with a merry heart. He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death. Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot; Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them. Truly this is a book that warms the heart, rekindles our affection for Christ, and provides encouragement for us in our own journey to the Celestial City."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago and still have it in memory. I cannnot recollect everything the book said vividly as at now. However, I still recollect what the story entails: a guy named christian who decided to leave his home to the celestial city. Basing all his actions on his strong faith in God, he went through a lot of up's and down's. I remember at one time he gave up and decided to return but he had a change of mind on the way and decided to pursue his journey. This is a great book and I'll encourage anyone who gets the opportunity to spend a little time reading it. It is highly inspirational."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"The Pilgrim's Progress is perhaps one of the most enduring allegories ever written; it has set the form for several more recent works (Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hind's Feet on High Places,\\" most notably). Bunyan's work was, for 18th century Christians, a companion to the Bible. The theology is a perfect example of Reformation thought, and were it not for a major flaw in the allegory, this work would be just about perfect.Setting out from the City of Destruction, Christian makes his journey throughout many perils and temptations, eventually finding his way (through death) to the Celestial City, to live with Christ and the saints. Along the way he learns much about evading temptation, and much practical advise on escaping sin is given to the reader through his discussions with travelling companions Faithful and Hopeful.However, by no means is Christian's journey representative of the Christian life as it is meant to be lived. Two stunning flaws stand out - first, that Christian in no way has any direct contact with Christ, until after his death; secondly, that Christian's life is devoid of relationships, outside of his two travelling companions.These two realities of the novel are startling, especially given that the Christian life is, first and foremost, relational-primarily, the Christian lives in relation to God, and then in relation to his neighbor. The Christian is not an island; he is to evade the world, but love those in it. Bunyan entirely misses this key point.Not only is the life Bunyan paints theologically incorrect, but it is entirely undesireable. It would be unimaginable for the Christian to live an entire life without, along the way, enjoying intimacy with Christ. Indeed, it is these moments of intimacy in spite of imperfection, which drive the Christian's soul onward. And it hardly needs mentioning that a Christian who, rather than reaching out and loving those around him, dismisses them as sinners and leaves them behind, is more reminiscent of Pharasitical hypocrisy, than Christian love.If one is looking for a challenging allegory, they need look no further than Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hinds Feet on High Places;\\" its protagonist, Much Afraid, is throughout her journey often in direct contact with Christ, and her redemption comes not through death, but through Christ making her able to go out into the world and love. Though \\"Hind's Feet\\" is not as theologically rich as Bunyan's allegory, its practical application is far more uplifting, hopeful, and correct."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Other than the Bible this book has sold more copies than any other book in history. It is a must read for every person as far as I am concerned and the newer translation makes it simply facinating."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress. Hendrickson Christian Classics. ISBN 156563134X. (Due to Amazon's tendency to post reviews of one edition of a book on another edition's product page, make sure you're viewing the product page for ISBN 156563134X.)This review focuses on the edition only, as the Pilgrim's Progress itself needs no review. The hardcover binding is handsome and tasteful, and looks well on the shelf. The typeface is very readable. It would in fact be a perfect inexpensive edition of a great allegory, if not for two relatively minor flaws.The first is no \\"Note on the Text,\\" or even the name of an editor (of this volume; I believe the series may have a general editor). From what edition was this text edited? What other editions were consulted? What is the history of the text of the Pilgrim's Progress? A Note on the Text wouldn't have been much trouble, and would have raised this edition up a notch or two.The second is the glossing of words such as \\"I trow\\" which the unknown editor considers difficult for modern English readers. Glossing should properly be done either with footnotes or in the margins, but in this edition, the glosses are in brackets immediately following the word glossed. E.g. \\". . . I trow [believe] . . .\\" I find the procedure annoying; other readers might find it helpful. And if glosses in brackets make a great work of English literature accessible to more readers, then I suppose the editor is justified.Other than that, it's an excellent edition. I commend Hendrickson for bringing out their line of \\"Christian Classics\\" in handsome bindings for very low prices."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This is a Christian classic that is my favorite of all Christian works, bar none (except the bible of course). Possibly the second most published work outside the bible, it has been highly regarded by many, and was once widely taught in the schools.I wish my school had taught it. I first read this book a year ago, and I feel as if I've been deprived all my life.Pilgrim's Progress is written by a mature Christian, with insights that you will not get from anyone other than a mature Christian. Few people are capable of writing such a book.And the book shines with great quotes. Two of my favorites are:What means this? The Interpreter answered, 'This is Christ, who continually with the oil of grace maintains the work already begun in the heart, by the means of which, notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. AND IN THAT THOU sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.And this: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate speech. 'What a fool', quoth he, 'am I , thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty. I have a key in my bosom, called promise, that will (I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting-Castle.'A key called promise.. great thoughts.There are many editions to Pilgrim's Progress, and I haven't found one I am happy with yet. Try to get one with the original wording, and the references to passages in the bible. Many versions delete the references to passages in the bible, which are, of course, the most useful to Christians and of least use to the world.ISBN 0140430040 appears to be true to the original wording of the classic. On the other hand, it lacks the biblical passage references, chapter divisions, and is a paperback with (quite frankly) an ugly cover.ISBN 0785242228 is a modern spelling version. However comparing it to the original shows that a lot more than just the spelling has been changed, and it doesn't read nearly as well. This is a nicely bound hardback with quality paper and chapter divisions, and some (but not all) the references to the bible. Character names are annoyingly abbrievated throughout book.ISBN 1557480990 is a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress. While a children's book, it remains true to the original and is worth getting. The illustrations are great.There are also many etext versions of Pilgrim's Progress that include the original text and all the references the text makes to passages in the bible.I recommend you take your time reading the book, and reflect on what is being said. Also, if you have a full version of this book, with the references to passages in the bible, you could use it as part of a bible study.BTW: the phrase 'vanity fair' comes from this book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"In contrast to Dante, Bunyan fills his allegory with real people, not just stereotypes - or even archetypes. Though his characters have names like &quot;Honest,&quot; &quot;Feeble-mind,&quot; and &quot;Ignorance,&quot; they come across as real people given a nickname. The names apply to some extent, of course, but not to the point of making caricatures out of the characters.This volume contains parts I and II of Pilgrim's progress. The first part concerns the journey of a pilgrim named &quot;Christian,&quot; while the second describes the journey of his wife, Christiana. Both start from the City of Destruction and both encounter many of the same obstacles - the Slough of Despond, the Vanity Fair, the Castle Doubt - before reaching the gates of the Celestial City. Other than that, their journeys are rather different, for Christian travels on his own, with a bit of help here and there, and with one or another traveling companion, but his progress is almost entirely his own. Christiana, by contrast, travels as part of an ever growing company, who support one another and who are defended by one or two powerful champions.You never lose sight of the allegory, but this work is not a mere tract. The story itself and the characters entertain - even today."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book is essential reading for any Christian who wants to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; and to finish the race well. The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Everyone should read Pilgrim's Progress. I read it for the first time last week. It is a book about a journey by the main character, Christian. It will also set you on your own journey through the Bible. John Bunyan writes that his allegory contains \\"nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains\\" and he includes references to Bible verses on nearly every page. I found it easy to understand Christian's journey by looking up these verses in my Bible as I came to them. By doing this, Bunyan was giving me fresh guidance because I had not read many of these verses recently. The references also allow me to keep Bunyan accountable for his words by comparing them to Scripture.Reading a book is a journey in itself, especially when it is read along with the Bible. It was also a literal journey for me because I was reading Pilgrim's Progress while on an airplane. In one sense I was meeting John Bunyan for the first time through his book while at the same time my flight from Los Angeles to London was taking me closer to Bunyan literally. On City Street in London is a cemetery called Bunhill Fields which is full of non-conformist preachers (Puritans and others who severed their ties from the Anglican church establish by Charles II). This is where John Bunyan is buried. Last night when I finished the book I came across a related quote by Charles Spurgeon:Go into Bunhill-fields, and stand by the memorial of John Bunyan, and you will say, \\"Ah! there lies the head that contained the brain which thought out that wondrous dream of the Pilgrim's Progress from the City of Destruction to the Better land. There lies the finger that wrote those wondrous lines which depict the story of him who came at last to the land Beulah, and waded through the flood, and entered into the celestial city.\\"So the day after finishing Pilgrim's Progress I took Spurgeon's advice and went into Bunhill Fields to see Bunyan's tomb (as well as John Owens). It is ironic that a man whose life and thoughts so greatly followed and conformed to the Word of God would receive the reputation of non-conformist. It's clear from the story where Bunyan's loyalties lie:Ignorance: What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?Christian: Such as agree with the Word of God.Ignorance: When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of God?Christian: When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word passes...Ignorance: What are good thoughts concerning God?Christian: Even, as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts of God do agree with what the Word saith of him.I appreciate Bunyan's regard for the truth. He clearly shows that we all are born into the City of Destruction wearing nothing but rags. He insists that the only road to the Celestrial City is through the Narrow Gate. He portrays the progression of our sanctification as a grueling journey, but one that is nevertheless fueled by God's grace. The true nature of worldliness is portrayed in Vanity Fayre, Satan's schemes are encountered and explained, and numerous actions, attitudes, and feelings are examined.Pilgrim's Progress is about the ultimate journey of life of pursuing a pure heart through faith in Jesus. By modeling faithfulness and perseverance, its characters illustrate the trials and tribulations by which God works His good in us. This book is a classic and I hope it remains in print for a long time so many more generations can learn and be encouraged by it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"\\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" is a classic Christian text written by John Bunyan. Written in an allegorical format, the two-part story focuses first on \\"Christian\\", then on his wife \\"Christiana\\" and sons. Convicted of their own sinfulness, the characters set out on the journey to salvation at the Heavenly Gate. Characters such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Great-Heart\\", and \\"Faithful\\" aid the pilgrims on their journey, whereas they face trials from the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.Getting through the book takes some work, less because of the story and more because of the depth of the allegory. Also, the dialogues between characters regarding salvation and righteousness often require a careful read. However, the story is exceptionally creative and thought-provoking, and the lessons that can be gleaned from it are timeless and worth the effort that needs to be expended. I recommend reading this one at least twice."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"John Bunyan confronts the world head on in his allegory The Pilgrim's Progress. Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;. The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress has been accepted by the world as a classic piece of literature. However, just as Handel's Messiah is recognised as a magnificent work without people really appreciating the message it brings so Pilgrim's Progress can suffer from its own fame. Here we have the stories of believers moving towards heaven. They have ups and downs. They suffer pain and experience pleasure. All the time the christian reader is being led forward into experimental practical christian avenues. Despair, doubt, backsliding, the temptations of the world, helps from above and support from others on the Way all make this work so vital and relevant. Both parts, Christian's journey and Christiana's are wonderful in their own ways. For the past four years I have preferred the second part. Read it every year at least once.

Rich in Biblical theology, it is the best-known allegory of the Christian's life. It tells the story of a pilgrim named Christian as he walked a journey from the City of Destruction (where he lived before his conversion) to the Celestial City (an allegory of heaven), sharing with us the many challenges, obstacles, comfort, and encouragement Christian encountered in his long journey. This book reminds me that I, too, am walking in a similar spiritual journey as Christian did.When I read of Christian passing through the Valley of Humility and falling into the Swamp of Despondence, I'm reminded of those times when I, too, was in such a swamp and valley, and how God graciously used those trials to humble, comfort, and rescue me.The Pilgrim's Progress reminds me and encourages me with the Biblical promise that regardless of what deep valleys I may be in, whatever swamps I fall into, whatever rough roads I tread, whatever rivers to ford, or whichever steep hills I may be climbing in my own life journey ... my Guide is ever watchful, my Deliverer unfailing, and He is indeed faithful in keeping and persevering all of His elect in the faith till they arrive to their final destination at the Celestial City--that glorious, everlasting City that is so different than the one I've traveled from and \\"built not by the hands of man.\\" Every Christian can learn and be encouraged from the Biblical doctrines taught in this story."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I give this book away every chance i get $$$ enough to do so.The first time i read it i was amazed at how i was on this adventure and it was changing the way i thought of things.and how it influenced my dreams was amazing as well; being that the story is a telling of a dream, made me even more in wonder.than i read it a second time and could not believe the amount of detail that comes out of this little book. if you know your Scriptures you will see them jump off the pages and here they are with visual application.If you don't know Scripture and find it hard to understand what The Bible is saying, here is a story that puts it in perspective.I love this book and can now understand why it has been so poplular for so many many years.i will read this book again and again as medicine for my soulHigh five for John Bunjan"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This past year in school my class studied &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;.

Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story!

While Conrad used far more symbolism and allusions, I felt that Bunyan still did a better job of making the reader identify with his character's journey.

He doesn't yet fully understand everything and we had to stop and explain a lot to him, but it is something that we plan on reading over and over again as our kids continue to grow.I read a review that stated that a main flaw in this book was the lack of one on one relationship with Christ. I can understand what they are saying, but I think what you have to keep in mind is that while we are here on earth and in our day and age we do not physically see Christ. He was once here walking and living on this earth, but He is now in heaven. He uses other means now to maintain a personal relationship with us. For example, we can know Christ through His word and through prayer. Just as in the book, He often also sends other Christians along in our life to help us and encourage us. This book is a good example of a walk of faith. We can't see and physically touch Christ right now, but when we are in heaven we WILL see Him just as Bunyan talks about in the book. Christian persevered in his walk without physically seeing Christ and he was rewarded in the end for his faith. For now, how much greater our reward is for those who have not seen Him and yet believed!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This is a great classic and a must have for any Christian striving to follow Jesus Christ and His Word.

[July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in the World to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of &quot;Christian&quot; as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation. What more could you ask for in a book!If you're not comfortable with the old english, then try a modern language version. Either way you won't be disappointed. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This is super thick to me. It is pretty simple on surface, and fun to read. But diving into each of the characters and their virtues/vices has kept me up late since I received the book. Lots of personal questioning, lots of views that I hadn't considered. I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I can't pretend to understand the historical milieu from which this book arose, or the theological underpinnings that led to its writing. Instead, I come to the book as a modern and secular reader, trying to learn more about Western thought and literary tradition. Despite its archaic language and sometimes tedious preaching, I found my time well rewarded. The familiar aspects showed me as much as the unfamiliar ones did.Among the unfamiliar ones, I was struck by the pervasiveness of the religious sense in Bunyan's world. Seemingly ever action was seen in terms defined by religion. It almost appeared as the sole source of light in that world, without which nothing could really be seen, and tinting everything with its own color. Likewise, the literary tool of \\"morality play\\" naming sounded odd to my modern ear. Writers still use names in many ways, but characters names like Hope, Atheist, or Mr. Money-Love come across as heavy handed. Perhaps that mechanism helped in a semi-literate society, where subtlety of reading could not be counted on; perhaps it acted as a short-hand, invoking values shared consensually across a fairly homogeneous society.More familiar aspects of the storytelling also struck me, possibly because of their contrast to the ones no longer used in modern writing. Christian's journey, for example, has been copied repeatedly and in many variations by writers ever since. Not just allegory for seeking, it provides a natural way to expose the protagonist to a series of other characters and challenges, and foreshadows some destination for the story. The \\"journey\\" has been refined over the years since Bunyan and rarely takes such a central spot in more recent texts, but I enjoyed seeing it in this relatively pure and primitive form.In itself, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' holds only slight interest for me. As an historical document, reflecting the religious sense of its time, and as an ancestor of modern writing, I found it fascinating.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book was packaged in a plastic rap which was very nice as I am giving it as a gift to my Pastor and his wife.

Slightly disappointed in the quality!!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is without a doubt one of the true classics of time--an allegory that has remained a best seller years after its introduction.My first introduction to Pilgrim's Progress was as a child in parochial school. I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form. Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"In this classic work, John Bunyan paints a detailed picture of the Christian life/walk, giving true-to-life insights and experiences. The despair, sorrows, trials and temptations that a believer may face are depicted in an allegorical manner, as well as the hope, joy, and salvation found in Jesus Christ. The main character Christian (once named Graceless) sets out on a lifelong journey from the City of Destruction, where his family disowned him, and encounters many persons and difficulties along the way to the Celestial City (heaven). The characters he meets are given names that reflect their mindset or what temptation they bring. At times he stumbles and at times he perseveres, but all by the grace of God. The second portion of the book tells of the conversion and subsequent sojourn of the wife (Christiana) and children of Christian. The discussions of Christian in the first part and Christiana and her companions in the second part are very interesting, as they defend their faith and explain their purpose to those they meet along the way. The book is quite different from your ordinary novel, and has many interesting words of wisdom for the Christian life. Readers should be aware that some of the language is antiquated and has unfamiliar usages, so its a little bit of an adjustment to read."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"A letter to Marvin Minsky about this book:I urge you tolook at a remarkable book by the English Puritain John Bunyan(1628-1688), \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", which is one of the great evangelical Christian classics, though clearly that is not why it interests me and should interest you (although I AM interested in the puzzle that is the religious sense, which even the irreligious feel, and this book can give remarkable insight into that as well).Rather its fascination lies in the pilgrimage it depicts, or in the fact that human traits, vices, virtues, &amp;c are PERSONIFIED as particular individuals who are their living and speaking epitome, and who are encountered along the way in revealing situations.Bunyan's hero is appropriately named Christian. Someone once wrote that \\"Christian's journey is timeless as he travels from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, meeting such characters as Pliable, Talkative, Giant Despair, Evangelist, Worldly-Wiseman, Faithful, Ignorance and Hopeful.\\"At first this personification is merely amusing, even a bit annoying (as caricatures or truly stereotypical people can be); but after a while I found myself enthralled because I realized that the effect of this odd literary device was to give unmatched insight into the nature of such traits. The force of the whole thing comes from the fact that one journeys about in - literally INSIDE of - what is both a comprehensive and finite moral and psychological landscape (a \\"psycho-topography\\"), very much as though one were INSIDE the human mind and your \\"Society of the Mind\\" was embodied in the set of actors. This is more or less the opposite or an inversion of the \`real world' of real people, who merely SHARE those attributes or of whom the attributes are merely PIECES; in \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", by contrast, the attributes are confined in their occurrence to the actors who are their entire, unique, pure, and active embodiment, and humanness, to be recognized at all, has to be rederived or mentally reconstructed from the essential types.The effect, for me, was something like experiencing a multidimensional scaling map that depicts the space of the set of human personality types, by being injected directly - mentally and bodily - into it by means of virtual reality technology.So Bunyan's book has something of the interest to a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher that Edwin Abbot's \\"Flatland\\" has to a mathematician.I don't mean to overpraise \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", of course; it was written for theological rather than scientific purposes, and has conspicuous limitations for that reason. But its interest to a student of the mind who looks at it at from the right point of view can be profound.- Patrick Gunkel"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Pilgrim's Progress. Despite the fact that I usually like all sorts of folk art and corny stuff in general, this ham-fisted allegory just seemed too weird---too kooky.Yet Edward de Souza's *reading* of the text turns the thing into a work of art. I'm a voracious consumer of audiobooks, and I have to say that De Souza's performance for Naxos here is the best I've ever heard. The dramatic pause---almost as if perhaps he's thinking up the name---just before he tells you the goofy name of each new character, turns what I used to consider the most annoying aspect of the book, into the most charming instead. Bravo.And it's not just this book. From the opening strains of the fine, authentic 17th century music, you're at once made to know that Naxos has thankfully brought the art of the audiobook out of the dark ages.

Forsaking all he knows, all he owns to take a blind leap of faith into the unknown, Christian meets with many trials and tribulations. The second part of the book for me was just as good, as a matter of fact, a bit more touching as I had standing water in my eyes in a few places.

I highly recommend David Suchet's reading of this endless tale."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot; -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's ProgressPilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence. However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City. In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow. In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy. Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.It's easy to see why the story was so popular. First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones. Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed. Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England. Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular. Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time. Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb. Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell. These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual. John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone. It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does. Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates. Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license. The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient. Freedom, though vital, is not everything. In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God. As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct. But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally. Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough. It is a brilliant, though flawed, work, one who's impact on English Literature and Western Culture can not be overstated.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone. It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here. Bunyan does preach and moralize, but he tells a darn good story too. This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible. The book is a religious and political allegory that symbolizes particular qualities and actions that should form the cornerstone of a Christian's life.

She lives on the wrong side of the tracks in the factory and mill area known as Milltown. The wealthier side of the tracks is Brockton, in northern Indiana. The story covers a little more than a year in the working class family's life.Ellen enjoys designing clothing fashions, is good at it, and her mother sews clothing for the rich ladies of Brockton. Ellen is determined to get herself and her family out of Milltown through her ability at designing women's dresses. The mill has already cost her father his life.She gets involved in a local charitable endeavor intended to give some enjoyment and training to Milltown inhabitants. A director of the \\"Pearl Street House\\" is hired, John Morgan, and he enlists Ellen's wide range of abilities toward the needs of the house and the local people. Thus begins the struggle within Ellen, to stay in Milltown and Pearl Street House or to go to Chicago and become a designer. She gets assistance from a Chicago lady and gets her chance in Chicago. That success makes the decision even harder. John wants her to stay and help him.The reason for not giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 is, like most books written by this author who began writing in Marion, Indiana, the ending is nice and predictable. You know what's bound to happen but you will find pleasure in reading to get there. It was originally written for teens and young women, but due to the writing and story location it is a great bit of Indiana lore. It is a good book to read when interested in the lifestyle of the Midwest at the turn of the century, and Hoosier history buffs.Recommended reading for all.

As a charity, it is committed to education, relief of poverty, help for the homeless and refugees, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation. As a church, it is unabashedly committed to the advancement of the Christian religion as defined by eleven key doctrines which are conservative and evangelical in tone (pp. 675-676).Especially interesting and authoritative articles in the dictionary include many biographical entries on past and present leadership. Naturally, much space is devoted to William and Catherine Booth, who founded the movement in the year 1865 in London's East End. Both of the Booths were excellent preachers and chose to focus their efforts on the poor. Their organization grew in large part due to their charisma, and many of their descendants have also played prominent roles in the organization.Other articles detail the expansion of the Salvation Army's work into more than 100 countries. Work is currently conducted in 175 languages and the Salvation Army operates its charitable work on a budget in excess of 2.5 billion dollars annually. Expectations of true members (officers and soldiers) are high, including the expectation that they contribute to the ministry as large a proportion of their income as possible. However, much of the work of the Salvation Army is done by \\"adherents,\\" people who have not taken the oath to become soldiers but otherwise embrace the teachings of the church, and by several thousand employees who serve in various capacities.This book is a handy compendium of information on Salvation Army personnel and activities, and would be of interest to both scholars and lay readers. It does not give sources or bibliographic references at the end of each article, making further research difficult. It does, however, have an extensive bibliographic section near the end of the book."},{"Title":"Panoramic Colombia","review":"As a recent traveler to Colombia I found this book to be a truly great reminder of my trip.

It also has sections on 'Science and Civilization' on 'Plays' on 'Great Confessions and Autobiographies' and on 'Philosophy and Religion'. I have been using the book to read about books I have never read, or to fill in parts or answer questions about books read long ago. So I read the interesting plot summary of 'The Return of the Native' and at last discovered who the Eustacia Vye, Holden Caulfield was so infatuated by was. I also had curiosity about Franz Werfel's 'Forty Days of Musa Dagh' which tells of the Armenians attempt to survive the Turkish massacre of their people.I filled in details of the Aeneid. All this worked fairly well. But when I went to the non- fiction especially the Philosophy works I found a very weak and poor summary of the works. On the whole my guess is that the list is somewhat dated though reasonable for its time. Again this book can be enjoyed by selecting individual works and getting some sense of them from reading their summary. Of course to really know and feel the work is something entirely different. A book of this kind will not help. But for light reading and amusement and a quick attainment of superifical knowledge the work is fine."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Mill's book, On Liberty, tries to answer the question of what is the legitimate power that government can exercise over the individual . His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments. While it can be tempting to accept some infringements on liberty, I think it's necessary to have a philosophical framework through which to understand what limitations on liberty are justifiable and which aren't.Jorge"},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"When J. S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was interested in the nature of Civil Liberty, and the limits to the power that a Government can legitimately exercise upon its citizens. He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it. All in all, recommended :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This Kindle edition has an introduction written more than a century ago that offers no insight into Mill's essay and deals almost entirely with the relationship between Mill and Harriet Taylor. It is therefore primarily of general rather than academic interest.\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force when he wrote. As for primitive societies, we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals. The purpose of this book is to inform interested individuals about the rights of individuals and the limitations of the government. This book of philosophy was written almost 150 years ago. By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals. John Stuart Mill wrote an informative book geared towards an educated audience. He has achieved his purpose for the essay through the use of situations and examples that can be applied to real life cases still today. He managed to keep the readers interested and I look forward to reading other books he has written."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of &quot;civil liberties&quot; --not the metaphysical issue of &quot;free will&quot;. While most attacks on cilvil liberties have historically occurred from the right, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. While the aim of the early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed, Mill identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments as well. He argues that those who exercise powers in democratically elected governments are not the same as those over whom that power is excercised. Those exerting the power of the government (elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary, etc) develop their own interests and are influenced by special interests often at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals. Writing as he did in the 19th Century, Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight in light of what is happening today. In every literate criticism of &quot;special interest groups&quot;, PAC's, &quot;over-zealous prosecutors&quot;, etc., one sees the lasting influence of John Mill. Mill may be considered the heir apparent to John Locke and his work is most valuable when it is considered in an historical context which includes Locke's influence on our own founding fathers and James Madison's authorship of the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;, arguably the most effective limit on those forces tending to undermine civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Mill provides a brilliant analysis and commentary on the give and take between the need for government protection and the exercise od individual responsibility. This is now the third time that I have read this book since my college days and I find that I get much more from reading the text each time I read it / separated by a decade each time."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This is a nice inexpensive edition of On Liberty with a solid introductory essay. Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Mill's book about liberty was of vast importance in freeing the individual from the tyranny of communal opinion. Someone may dislike homosexuals, but has no right to harass them or pass ethical judgements on them for what is their choice, of no harm to anyone else. Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.)

This book is good for its historical value and studying political theory, but don't be fooled into thinking 'On Liberty' is at all faithful or indicative of the classical liberal or libertarian philosophy on liberty.Get Liberalism in the Classic Tradition by Ludwig von Mises to understand true classical liberalism."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"I would certainly rank John Stuart Mill as the most overrated philosophical windbag of all time. I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing.

Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person\`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others.

It is the state's job to ensure the former right is upheld and the latter transgression punished. Mill's argument is very strong - convincing not only as an inherent right but also as a practical advantage to individuals and society. This is probably now his most famous work, and it is very easy to see why; his argument is not only compelling philosophically but widely applicable and, at about 140 pages, easily read by nearly all. Everyone from pure philosophers to political theorists to practical politicians to general readers can find something to like and learn."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"\\"On Liberty\\", by John Stuart Mill is one of the most important works in political philosophy. Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision. Liberty - this book is ON LIBERTY.Anyone who thinks this book is in favour of socialism is completely misguided and confused."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"It is surprising to me how many people assume that \`On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century. Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then. It is understandable by most high school seniors.

This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."},{"Title":"On liberty,","review":"This book represents the beginning of the peversion of classical liberalism (Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry) into the tyranny of modern day liberalism (socialism). Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S. Mill, not a very good thinker and an appalling one on the nature of liberty."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I see it has a high rating so I bought it.

This is a much better book f the beginner."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"My friend had suggested this book after I had asked her for her veteran potter advice. She told me it had been her first book and had been perfect for learning the basics. i agree. With pictures illustrating the detailed instructions, it augments any beginning instruction. If you're taking a class, the instructor has to divide their attention between students and won't have the time to spend perfecting your technique. This gives you a great reference to help in that process.I read through the entire book up to the advanced techniques in one sitting. I was amazed at the author's ability to translate physical experience into so few words. Her explanations are concise and convey the experience of hand throwing very well. The photos complement the text nicely. Plus, written in the 70's, the pics took me down memory lane! Even if you're not well-situated in middle age, I still recommend this be your first book on your journey of the ancient art."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"nice pictures, detailed, nicely done. easy to follow. prepare to get clay on the book as you are learning it."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"This book is a fantastic resource.

It shows you explicitly how to hold your hands and little tricks that you usually learn with lots of practice time. It's like having a personal teacher when you can't get the teacher on the phone! I am going to buy it for all my new potter friends! Great price too. I love it!"},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"Pottery on the Wheel - Elizabeth S. WoodyThis is a wonderful book for all potters who love the wheel; and especially for beginners through advanced intermediates. I suspect, however, that even the most advanced craftsman could pick up more than a few technical pointers due to the extensive coverage of the multitude of ways to form beautiful objects using one's hands and the spinning surface of the potter's wheel,Pottery on the Wheel is especially useful for people like me, who learn by watching; but also need the reinforcement of the printed word to set new concepts firmly in their minds. This book does just that through the exceptionally well explained topics and the multitude of large photographs that accompany each step she addresses.I am fortunate in having a wonderful instructor, Linda Dalton, a well known potter who carefully explains and demonstrates each new step. But no matter how carefully she explains things my aging brain isn't able to take all of it in, or worse yet, store it in its proper \\"box\\" for retention when I need it. Using this book to supplement my lessons provides me with the joy of seeing Linda's words jump out from the text enabling me to enjoy the \\"Aha, so that's what she means\\" experience. Although this puts the topic halfway in the box, I have to remind myself of Linda's constant words of \\"practice, practice, practice\\" and follow them before I can be assured that the topic slides all the way into its container and is properly stored for instant automatic retrieval when I need it,The layout of this text is excellent. The wealth of information is introduced by a table of contents and ends with an appendix, a glossary, and a complete index making any subject easily accessible. The information itself is presented sequentially and logically and often with alternative methods.I can not imagine any way that the subject material and the depth in which it is covered could possibly be presented in a better or more understandable manner; and imagine it must be a required text for any institution offering pottery courses.Between the patient instructions of my teacher supplemented by Woody's book I feel excited about mastering the art of the wheel and I thank them both for making the endless hour of practice so worthwhile in attempting the journey from making bowls for Thumbelina to something I can place on my mantle with pride."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I purchased this book for the excellent graphic illustration and description on throwing clay pots on the potter's wheel. We'd been introduced at my public library. Would have waited weeks to \\"get what I wanted!\\"It came promptly in a sturdy box, which sat on my porch in the rain for the day, but the book inside was packaged well and remained dry! The cover has some sun damage and a small piece of tape on a tear, but no matter; text and illustrations are fine. I'm very happy to own a copy of this book! Thank you for being there Amazon.

Julie also promptly answered some questions I had regarding the sale. Great transaction!"},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"As a student potter, I've looked at a lot of beginner's books. I bought one when I bought the wheel, some at the local bookstore, and some more at the local ceramics supply store. This one I got from the library and liked it so much I ordered it to keep as a reference. It has all the stuff in the detail that I wish the others had - detail sufficient to be of immediate use, but not so complex as to be difficult to understand. There is even more detail that will be of value when I gain more experience.The book points out typical beginner's errors - I made 'em all - and how to prevent them. It discusses the sequence of pulling the clay to make a pot while maintaining center. Each chapter also has an outline at the end of the main points/steps that were the focus of the chapter so the reader will be sure to learn the most important considerations of that particular topic.The text is clear, easy to read and understand, and the many photographs, in my opinion, could not be better - they are close-up, in focus and large."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I bought this book for my wife who had just finished ten weeks of throwing lessons. She read the book and was able to improve her work in just a few practice sessions. She is so pleased with her new knowledge and skill. The fine detail and the pictures of sectioned pots were easy to follow. The accompaning text was clear and the summeries allow for quick reference.We can only recommend this fine book to anyone that wants to improve their skill."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"The text is detailed, but easy to understand and the pictures do an excellent job of reinforcing the concept. I have been throwing for about a year, but reached a point where I was &quot;stuck&quot; and couldn't seem to move forward. After only ONE day of using the techniques in this book, I was able to double the amount of clay I could successfully throw and the results were better than anything I had previously produced. This is the best book there is on throwing."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"Elsbeth Woody does not provide us with a lot of pretty pictures of finished projects which we have no idea how to duplicate. What she does do is provide exact instructions with plenty of pictures of a clay-spattered potter doing exactly what she is telling us to do (and we assume the potter is herself). She provides invaluable photos of each stage of each project with the project cut in half so you can see exactly where her hands are inside the pot. This must have taken an enormous amount of care and time to document. I am a fairly new potter, but with Ms. Woody's book, I have found the confidence to begin throwing much larger pieces of clay, as her instructions apply particularly to medium-to-large pieces. My only regret is that Amazon does not carry her other book about hand-building with clay."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I'm a professional potter, who's also a pottery teacher for Technique Ceramics, Scottsdale Az. &quot;Pottery on the Wheel&quot; is by far the best book that I've found for teaching wheel-thrown pottery. Ms. Woody covers a wide range of pottery techniques, from centering clay, making bowls, plates, lids, cylinders, pulled handles, and more. This book is also filled with wonderful photographs of each step. Ms. Woody slices each clay project in half to show the correct position of the potter's hands while forming the pot. This is the book that I credit my success as a potter to, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is really serious about learning pottery on the wheel! Buy it, you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I bought this book 25 years ago when I started pottery and my well-thumbed copy is an important part of my studio. I'm a Canadian potting in Japan and though most of my students are non-English users, the photographs in this book speak thousands of words. It is laid out logically and the cross-section cuts of the whole process from entering the centered clay to finished work are everything a student or teacher could want in an instructional book. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover it is still available and my student is looking forward to having her own copy."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"As someone who has just started to learn pottery in a class, this book gives detailed information that your teacher may not provide. Even if you are learning by yourself the step by step (very detailed) lessons by themselves gives the beginner good and easy to understand steps for success! Lots of great pictures too."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"This book was a Christmas gift to my daughter and son-in-law, since both of them recently started taking pottery classes. She really liked the details shown in this book. It shows step-by-step directions and pictures. The photos showing how the hands are placed inside the item are a big plus. It made a great gift to them."},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I was given this book by my son, and it has literally changed my life as a potter! I was an intermediate student, who sometimes threw beautiful pots and sometimes not. Who sometimes could center clay beautifully and then sometimes fought clay off the wheel. I had a love of throwing but little control over the actual process, and was becoming frustrated with not having consistent experiences each day. After reading the first few chapters of this book, that all IMMEDIATELY changed. Really! I center easily now. I raise the sides evenly now. My bottoms aren't too thick along the sides... ever. My rim's don't go out of whack. And that all happened the day after I read the first couple of chapters! I am now going back and re-reading in detail. One of the best parts of this book, is the great detail (and photos) of hand positions and her discussion of pressure points, and exactly where you should be touching the clay. Now when I sit down at the wheel - 9 out of 10 pieces are almost perfect... every time. It is so cool. My fellow students call it the \\"miracle book\\". I do too!"},{"Title":"Pottery on the Wheel","review":"I sometimes wonder how the beautiful conversational style used in this book came about.Woody has built creativity into its simple, yet very effective composition, design and production.I imagine whether Elsbeth S. Woody was just stating her instructions as she threw on her own wheel before the photographer who took all the photographs. The photographs of pottery cross sections provide a great touch in the teaching technique used in this book.I'm a beginner and having read and applied (albeit partially and to the best of my abilities) only the first couple of chapters so far, I look forward to owning a copy as a lasting reference, and a great read.

To be sure, I had read some of his short stories over the years: \\"En Route to Pluto\\" (_Astounding_, 1936), \\"Sculptors of Life\\" (_Astounding_, 1939), \\"Dawningsburgh\\" (_Galaxy_, 1962), and \\"Glimpses of the Moon\\" (_Analog_, 1965). And there was the occasional piece of nonfiction for _Astounding/Analog_ that was usually interesting and well-written. \\"In Case of Fire...\\" (_ASF_, 1953) was a history of modern fire-fighting techniques. \\"Steamer Time\\" (_ASF_, 1965) was an affectionate defense of old fashioned steamer cars. (West was an environmentalist who owned several steamers.)I believe that _Lords of Atlantis_ (1960) is based on a series of earlier magazine stories. At this point in time, however, I have not been able to find any bibliography that specifies what the stories were and where and when they were first published.The novel is based on a rather clever premise. Once upon a time, the Titans ruled Atlantis (capital city, Atlan). They were surplanted by the red haired, red skinned race of Martians -- Zeus, Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, and others. My personal favorites were Hermes, the irreverent reporter for the _Evening Planet_, who monitors all the scandal in Atlantis, and the luscious Aphrodite, who is No Better Than She Should Be. During the reign of the Martians, there is travel between planets, peace, prosperity, and advanced technology. But pettiness among both men and Martians leads to tragic consequences.Unfortunately, there are a number of sections that strain credulity. For example, there is a comet that explodes between Earth and Mars, creating an asteroid belt so thick that no spaceship can pass through it. (Such a \\"comet\\" would have to have a head several times the size of Jupiter.) And there is the decision on the part of the Martians immediately after they have been attacked by the Egyptians to: (1) send a delegation to Egypt, (2) headed by their king, (3) to return the Egyptian princess whom they are holding prisoner, (4) in the hope that someone in the delegation will be able to spy on the Egyptians. This is stupid in _so_ many ways!If you are a fan of Greek mythology, Old Testament stories, or Joel Chandler Harris tales, you may enjoy the references that West tosses off. There are some passages that jar a little, as where he compares muscular Martians to \\"strong men in a circus\\" (9). But for the most part, the jokes are not too anachronistic. The novel was doubtless fun to write, and it is fun to read. It works as light entertainment."},{"Title":"Lords of Atlantis","review":"Not sure if this was intended for a teen audience, but okay story line but very scattered and little depth. Also the download was full of messy spacing and made it frustrating to read at times"},{"Title":"Lords of Atlantis","review":"Certainly a light read, but a lot of fun. \\"Answers\\" where many myths came from. Somehow greater than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"Lords of Atlantis","review":"In the dim past, men had fled to Mars for refuge, but now the red planet was a dying world, and the Martians returned to colonize Earth and rule over the Titans - descendants of those who had stayed behind at the time of the now-legendary catastrophe.But the rulers of the Titans, retained by the conquerors on their ancestral thrones, grew restless under the benevolent progress of the Lords of Atlantis, looked back to a so-called \\"golden age\\", and plotted rebellion.Here is a thrilling novel of what might have been the basis for the Greatest Legends that have come down to us: of the \\"Gods,\\" of Atlantis, of Zeus, Hermes, Hephaestus, Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, Jason, Medea - and of a mighty empire which was weighed in the balance and found wanting!"},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"I have always been impressed by the work of the Kepner-Tregoe team because their methodologies really work.My first encounter with their work was the mastering - and application - of their Problem Solving & Decision Making (PSDM)strategies in the late 70's/early 80's, while I was a practising engineer. Subsequent fruitful encounters include reading - and assimilating - Tregoe's Vision at Work and Top Management Strategy (both of which are great works) when I was a General Manager.This book should have been available when I was still working in the corporate world. Anyway, I am very pleased to have bought and perused this wonderful book, which I will now add to my Strategic Thinking and Strategic Leadership bookshelf.I particularly enjoyed digesting the authors' practical approach to strategy formulation, which has been extensively covered in the book. The attendant case studies - field-tested - have been well selected and the process of working out their integrated model to help readers to understand - and eventually apply - has also been well crafted.I also like their way of posing pertinent questions to think through some of the process steps.All practising managers must get hold of this book. In terms of depth and breadth in the strategic thinking process, as well as the clarity in writing and presentation, I would rate this book in the same genre as Michel Robert's strategic thinking books. Across the board, the authors' writing in the book is crisp and succinct, and I really appreciate authors who write this way."},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"I have long believed that any organization without a cogent strategy is vulnerable. Too much strategic thinking these days is driven, in my opinion, by a desire to appeal to Wall Street investment bankers and analysts or by a dot.bomb-fueled fear of failure.Strategy is a two-headed prong. It is creative enough to fashion a vision, while being disciplined enough to drive the vision into reality.Mike Freedman defines the word as the &#65533;framework of choices that determine the nature and direction of an organization.&#65533; It is a definition I like. The word &#65533;framework&#65533; establishes boundaries and scope. &#65533;Choices&#65533; are about products, services, markets and capabilities. &#65533;Nature&#65533; describes the character of any organization. &#65533;Direction&#65533; is the organization&#65533;s course determined by choices about future products, services, customers and markets.Notice that a decision is not strategic simply because it is long-term or involves mega-dollar expenditures. While these can be made within the strategic framework, only those decisions that change the framework are strategic.Freedman says there are three critical aspects to a strategy:1. A strategic vision is based on facts, informed assumptions and critical what-if thinking.2. The vision must be communicated throughout the organization.3. Its implementation must be monitored.I particularly enjoyed the section on Strategic Master Project Planning. Freedman says the purpose of master project plan is to assess the necessary strategic initiatives, integrate the existing operation projects, identify project priority and interdict those projects which are out of line with the strategic vision.This is a great book. As always, organizations that desire to survive and thrive will have to mast the art of strategy creation and implementation. The Kepner-Tregoe five phase model on which Freedman bases this book is a great foundation for organizations and managers who wish to begin the journey."},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"Strategic leadership certainly requires discipline, and it clearly is an art form. But it is not as complicated as the authors would have their readers believe. Furthermore, the 5-phase model for strategy formulation and implementation that the authors claim to have developed is not unique. It's the same model just about any entrepreneur who writes a sound business plan uses to start a new business, and entrepreneurs have been around since before the authors were born.I think the book was written adequately well, and I recommend that entrepreneurs who have read a few books on how to write a business plan read this book, too. I would have liked the book better if the authors had first described what a company founder goes through when he or she practices strategic leadership in starting his company. Then explain what the company founder (or his or her replacement) must do to monitor the strategy, renew it, or possibly change it. Then, and only then, discuss real-world examples about how it is hard to monitor strategy, renew it, or possibly change it. I did not like the way the authors sprinkled real-world examples throughout the text. I think they should have been included in a separate section of the book.If the authors had titled the book \\"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership at Large Multi-National Companies,\\" then I would have rated it higher. Strategic leadership at large companies is complicated because of their size, and because their leaders are probably not all that competent at thinking strategically. It is hard to implement strategic change in something that is old and big, especially if one hasn't been at the helm for long.Probably the most important thing I learned from reading this book is that many people enjoying the role of CEO in large multi-national businesses hire consultants to educate them on things they would already know if they had ever started their own successful small business. I would not have learned this if the authors had kept to describing strategic leadership rather than the problems large companies face regarding their strategic leadership. This book is worth a read, but it is not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"This is a follow-up to Tregoe and Zimmerman's original work on strategy, Top Management Strategy: What It Is and How It Works. Incredibly, the author, who is an officer with the firm of Kepner-Tregoe, only includes Ben Tregoe as \\"with\\" instead of a co-author, and manages to make a great, clean, Occam's Razor of a concept into a convoluted detour. The crisp \\"driving forces\\" of the original book have been recombined, and not with a great deal of reasoning, and long passages are created to provide some mathematical support for issues that don't need it. It seems to me that Freedman is trying to jam in something representing his contribution to the process when he really has nothing to add. His corporate examples seem arbitrary and inserted simply to try to make the appeal more international.The original book is one of the best anywhere on strategy with its clear definitions and seminal use of the \\"driving force.\\" It's too bad it may no longer be widely available. This newer book is a poor successor and is remarkably ungracious to Ben Tregoe, who passed away a year or so ago, and was one of the great thinkers in this field. If you can get the original, do so. The two stars I've given this one are purely for what Freedman has retained of the original."},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"Product was as described online and shipment was fast. Do not have time to write loooooong review. Great doing business with you. Great is great. If Amazon force me to write a paper long review, I guess this is the last time I am reviewing any product from Amazon I purchased."},{"Title":"The Art and Discipline of Strategic Leadership","review":"Strategic leadership is an abstract topic, yet is strongly emphasized in leadership courses. In this respect, Mr. Freedman's tome is probably the bible on this subject at the current time. While he thoroughly elaborates on modern concepts in accepted strategic thought and planning ideas, there still seems to be more 'art' than 'discipline' to the underlying ideas which the author discusses. The reader is left with only a hazy 'sketch' of the authors concepts, rather than concrete scientific principles, to rely on for making sound business decisions."},{"Title":"MEMORIAS.

Both books offer beautifully stunning color photographs taken in WWII. The pictures alone make this book worthwhile...whether you are a vintage aircraft enthusiast or an amateur historian. But the stories which fill in the rest of the book are also great reading. Told by many different people who were there, you get a better sense of what people had to endure during wartime. Alongside with the color photographs, it makes the war seem not so distant.It WWII as you're not used to seeing it (unless you were there, I suppose)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"That should say a lot about how much I liked it. I'm a quick reader, and I usually devour books in one sitting, but I savored this one for a month. I would put it down, read a couple more books, watch some TV, start reading again... you get the point. The book is very interesting and entertaining, the characters are extremely complex and the plot, though slowly developed, is absolutely great. One of the things I loved most about this book is how it treated the existence of magic as a matter of fact. It mentioned old magicians and their books and spells, and it had these great footnotes that sometimes described entire stories within. By the end of the book, I was thoroughly convinced that magic had once been abundant in England. Another incredible aspect of this book is that it defies classification: it's fantastical without being Harry Potter, it's historical fiction without being Philippa Gregory, and it's a love story without being Twilight-y (thank God!). So, should you read it? Yes. Will you like it? I honestly do not know. The only thing I can tell you is that I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This rather long and sometimes meandering novel is one of the more unique pieces of writing to come along for quite some time. The fact that is has so many 5-star and 1-star ratings is indicative that it isn't everybody's cup-of-tea. More than most books, the writing style is either going to enamor or turn off readers. I personally liked the novel, and gave it five stars, but I also understand those who didn't like it and gave it poor reviews. Neither the high-reviewers nor the low-reviewers are right or wrong. This is the anchovies of books; some love them, and some hate them, and so with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.One thing for certain is that this is not the \\"Adult Harry Potter\\" as it is sometimes described. Other than taking place in England and having magic in the storyline, not much else is similar. I was more inclined to see similarities between this book and Tom Jones, despite the different eras and the complete lack of magic in that classic. But the feel of Jonathan Strange was reminiscent of that in Tom Jones.In other books with magic, the magic is usually center stage, the raison d'etre of the story. Despite the increasing amount of magic being conducted as the story progressed, I never got the feeling that magic was center stage. This novel was more about people and relationships, with the magic just being a skill that some of the characters could do.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but that is personal taste. Not everyone has enjoyed it. On the Kindle version, Amazon lets a prospective reader download a sample before purchase. I would recommend that readers take advantage of this opportunity to see if the story and style resonates with them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. What an amazing story with such endearing characters. Many times I read books that are characterized as \\"well written,\\" only to be disappointed with a dull story line and thick prose. THIS book, however, was anything but. While it took me a while to get through it, I could never be gone from the story and its characters for too long. There were many different character story lines, all of which were interconnected and beautifully woven together - the jump from one character's story to another was not choppy at all. The love/hate friendship between Strange and Norrel often made me smile and even laugh, and once the two were together in the text, they complimented each other so well.I also loved how the study of English \\"magic\\" was akinned to philosophy or the law - a nobel profession quite unlike other contemperaneous depictions of magic where it is shunned and/or hidden from the \\"muggles\\". Yet in the end, well . . . I guess you'll have to read to find out."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"1,024 pages felt like 5,000 pages. The Author is brilliant, weaving her tale from story to story. However, I feel that it could have been condensed. It was tedious and felt like it was never going to end. I don't want to give the ending away, but it was not as climactic for all the time invested. I'm happy with myself that I finished it, but just not my cup of tea! I should have read the reviews, first!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said elsewhere: JS&MN is an awesome (in pretty much every sense of the word) literary achievement. It is a beautiful piece of writing and an exceptional act of story-telling. JS&MN is a fully-realized, wholly convincing, 19th century British novel from the pen of a 21st century author. In every way, on most every page, JS&MN astounds with its artful turns of phrase, its unexpected narrative twists, and its subtle humor. I was, for the most part, completely absorbed in this book. It's hard to believe this is Clarke's first novel. Here's hoping it is the first of many to come. The note of hesitancy I strike in the title of my review is not on account of any intended criticism of this novel or its author. In the interest of providing a full accounting of my own readerly experience, I simply feel the need to note that I personally found JS&MN a bit long in the tooth. It's not that this novel's page count was excessive (though it is, to be sure, quite high) or that any of that count seemed like filler (it did not). It's just that 400 or so pages in, I wasn't quite so interested in the world of this novel as I had been at the outset. There's so much to read, and only so much time... That said, I am very glad I read this brilliant and highly original book. Clarke richly deserves a space on the shelf with the immortals of fantasy literature. Whatever your tastes in fiction, you'd be crazy not to give JS&MN a go."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This was my second attempt at reading this book.

Since it was a fantasy novel with magic and wizards and set within a historical period, I was expecting something fast paced and somewhat action packed. So when I got 200+ pages in and had yet to have a scene where something physically happened involving some sort of action, I gave up.When the paperback came out I was unable to stop myself from purchasing it. This is a thing that's developed in me over the years spent in the book business. When I see a book that I think should be good and has a really great cover (since I have seen many bad covers, such as all the Robert Jordan books), I need to own it. I'd told myself that I'd give this book another try at a later date and so before I left Copperfield's I bought it.About a month ago I started listening to it on audiobook, got about fifteen minutes into it, and while the voices were very good and English, I could tell from the well developed language of the book that it would be better and deserved to be read in the paper form. I sloughed through it this time, finally rewarded with a few actions scenes, and some very interesting plot. I still felt it went on a little too long and there could've been an entire book of the same size with all the stuff that didn't get revealed in the book. When you create a unique world, I like to know how it came to be and a lot of the details of why it is this way, and there wasn't as much of that in Jonathan Strange. It centered more around two kind of lame magicians, one of which is an old annoying selfish fart, and an ego-maniacal fairy who wants to control the real world as well as that of Faerie. Near the end some of the characters did some weird things as well that I thought were unwarranted and kind of came out of nowhere, which really bugs me with long books that have the room and the time to set this up.Nevertheless, I'm definitely glad I worked through it and read the whole thing and that I own it and maybe, in five or ten years, I'll give it a reread and see it in a totally different way.I've discovered in my reading that it really depends on my current mood and state of what I can get from a book. I can be impatient and want something to grab me right away, which is why I didn't like the book at first, but when I tried again in a calmer state, I was able to enjoy it. It's all very weird and probably a little OCD in some way, but over the many many years of reading and the many many books read, I've become picky in what I read and what I want to read and how I want to read it.Originally written on April 26th, 2006 Alex C. Telander.For more reviews and exclusive interviews, go to BookBanter:[...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In response to the reviewers who found this book too long and too boring:I found this book enchanting. There were times where I couldn't put it down. There were other times where it was difficult to read and I had to slog through parts, but it was incredibly rewarding in the end. The best reward is that here I am 6 years later thinking about the book and wanting to re-read it. So many images from \\"Strange\\" are burned into my memory, and still haunt me. The magic performed in the book is almost tangible, and it does go to some dark places (that sometimes resemble the subconscious). For example, raising the dead, who is then nothing but a shadow of her former self, more married to the other world than this one. The other scene which is burned in my mind comes towards the later half when the protagonist is exploring how to drive himself insane, and poisons himself with the essence of a truly insane woman and her dead rats. Wow. Who thinks up that stuff?So while the plot often meanders in many different directions, I enjoyed the journey, and am planning to take the trip again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell has the style of Charles Dickens mixed with the social comedy of Jane Austen with a little bit of magic sprinkled on top. Deliciously sarcastic, witty, mysterious and entertaining the whole way through. Magic is handled in a way that was so refreshing and unique. It flows beautifully and isn't chopping like old-fashioned novels are wont to be. There's a slight eeriness woven throughout that makes it so compelling. I'm not going to lie, though. It took me a good 4 weeks to plow through the whole thing. It doesn't end on a cliff-hanger, but at the same time it doesn't wrap everything up for you - it leaves you to imagine what will happen next. It's possible that the author left it open for a sequel, but there just wasn't enough story left for an entire book (as far as I can tell)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I received Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell as a Christmas gift and was put off from reading it by its considerable bulk. I'm not typically into fantasy novels, and I was put off by a few remarks from friends about it; however, over the summer I finally decided to delve into this book and found that it was a treasure. I suppose the book was tailor made for me as an English major and somewhat of a history buff. Ms. Clarke does a superb job of weaving together Austenesque Regency England, fantasy and a lite version of Wallace/ Mark Z. Danielewski footnoting.Anyone venturing through these reviews will have the gist of the story. Two wizards, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, appear in England to revive magic and gain considerable fame in the process. The two wizards become friends only to develop a personal rivalry, etc etc. Of course, you can get most of that from the Amazon description. What really makes the story is the world that Ms. Clarke develops. As a historical novel, she frequently mixes historical and fiction figures; equally, she does a good job of depicting Regency England, while also critiquing certain aspects of society.A lot of the negative reviews bring up the footnotes. I can see where people are coming from. Most of the footnotes do not necessary change the story in any dramatic way, but I think the footnotes do add an extra layer to the story. Also, it seems impossible to not compare and contrast this with Harry Potter, yet I would urge potental buys to resist the tempation. If you're looking for an extention of the Harry Potter series (which a lot of people were asking me when I was reading this), then you'll end up dissapointed; equally, if you are looking for the \\"adult\\" verision of Harry Potter, I think you'll also end up a bit dissapointed. In the end,it's unfair to compare these books to each other (especially considering there are six more books in Ms. Rowlings series, and it appears that Ms. Clarke will be laboring on the possible sequal to this book for God knows how long).While I wouldn't call Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell great literature, I do the book is an excellent read. If you give the story time to do its magic, you'll find that the 1,000 odd pages hardly seem long enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I find it difficult to recommend this book to anyone, even though I thoroughly loved it. Whether or not you enjoy it truly depends on what you want to get out of the book.Pros: immensely intricate plot, likeable and believably flawed characters, occasionally beautiful writing, events are consistent with the time period described, humor throughout, clever alternative history, satisfying conclusionCons: very long, extensive exposition in footnotes, writing style may seem gimmicky to someI didn't personally have any problems with the length, footnotes, or writing style. This is not a quick read. Nor is it a fantasy epic in the traditional sense. This is a book to be savored slowly, not devoured. And the only way you can really savor it is if you give it the time of day. The often meandering plot is punctuated with several extraneous details -- and it is not until the last third of the book that these diverging plot threads take on some meaning. If that doesn't sound fun to you, I don't blame you. Even I felt that the plot dragged at some points, but the writing was always so sharp that I didn't end up caring.The star of this novel is the writing. Clarke has a firm grasp of her characters and setting and can show us, rather than tell us, what is going on. She has the gift of saying a lot without saying much. This novel has some great one-liners which are sure to make you chuckle. In fact the humor is what drew me to it initially. It's a pretty good way to see if you'll like the book, actually: Read the first couple of chapters. If you don't think they're funny, then you probably won't enjoy the book.Give it a try. It requires a commitment but is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"you'll either love this book or else put it away esp. if you're the type of reader who prefers instant gratification. this work may appear initially daunting and voluminous, but therein lies its magic... it's not for everyone to appreciate and immediately like. in fact, i find it difficult to explain to my friends why i like it so much. i just know i do, and for some selfish reasons, it makes me even feel more blessed that only a few appreciate it the way i do. i know that sounds weird, but i'd probably feel bad (and somehow insulted) if i could hear somebody discuss it like some piece of pedestrian literature -- which isn't really far-fetched had the book become even more explosively popular than it already is. if you appreciate the exquiste combination of austen, wit (rather than just plain humor), history and fantasy -- like i do -- this book is for you. believe me, it's worth it. ENJOY"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I never thought I'd read, let alone positively review, an 800-page novel about magicians in 19th-century England. I admit I wouldn't have picked this up had the hardcover jacket not had such glowing reviews from American media. But pick it up (no small feat) I did and I am happy to report that nearly a month later I am very glad I did. The book takes a while to settle into, and requires no small amount of patience. There are numerous footnotes and archaic spellings. But its good qualities: sharp,subtle humor; beautifully realized characters; lovely writing--all make it worth the effort. It is Jane Austen and Tolkein and Dickens all at once. My only major complaint is that there are not enough compelling female characters! The most interesting one, Arabella Strange, is only there as a foil to her husband. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an absorbing and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Note: this review pertains specifically to the unabridged audio version of this book.I don't think I would have been to finish Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell if I had read it rather than listened to the unabridged audiobook. The story is slow moving, frequently digresses, and sometimes seems far more interested in atmosphere and background than in moving any story along. But at the same time there are pleasures to be had in abundance. If one likes the social panorama and dense detail of Dickens and the social commentary of Austen, you can find all of it here, in a panoply of characters ranging from the servant class through the military to the highest ranks of royalty. And all in the service of an alternate history/fantasy of an England once ruled by magic, and the quest to recover English magic and return it to the service of the nation.Parts of the book gallop along, including the segments showing the use of magic in the Napoleonic wars and the long awaited climax. Other parts tend to drag slowly and could probably have been trimmed.HOwever, the excellent narration by Simon Prebble kept me interested and involved during the slow bits when if I were reading it myself I might have wandered off for more flashy and immediately rewarding books. He does a masterful job of accents and voices, enabling me to keep a large cast of characters straight and even reading the numerous footnotes (they are more interesting than you would think!) in such a way that the digressions never cause the listener to lose track of the story.The unabridged book was a project of several months of listening, and I did wander off a few times, but my enjoyment of Prebble's reading always brought me back in the end. My only disappointment is the incomplete ending--after 30-odd hours of story I expected everything to be wrapped up--but there is room left for a sequel. On the other hand, I do look forward to a chance to spend some more time in the wonderful world of 19th century magical England, with characters I came to like very much (some in spite of their cranky selves, like Mr. Norrell!)If you have been interested in this book but find yourself daunted at the length of it, definitely check out the audio version. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am really amazed by some of the hostile reviews this book has recieved. First of all to say a book is horrible and a waste of time without giving a reason isn't very helpful. Tell us why you don't like the book instead of just spouting off about how much YOU hated it. Now that being said, this is indeed a long book, the first 200 or so pages do drag a bit, however it is so well written that it makes it worth while to stick with it. I found the last 600 pages are very entertaining. All of the charachters are very well developed, something that is really lacking in a lot of books. I can't say buy this book you will love it, because you may not, however if you enjoy any of the following:19th Century English History, Charles Dickens, British wit, intellegent writting,established charachters you actually care about, a book without swearing and sex in order to make it interesting, and you don't give up on a book just because it's too long, you will enjoy this book.If you enjoy any of the following:complaining a book is too long (for pete's sake Harry Potter is over 600 pages and 10 year olds read it without complaning), don't read anything but comic books, think farting and burping are funny, and find that intellegent, beautifully crafted writing is boring, then by all means stay away from this book. It's probably too deep for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Not your usual fantasy book. I was sad to finish this book because I had grown to enjoy your characters. Don't be put off by the first 200 pages, this is a beautiful read, which really uses the 1820 period as if you where there. If you are looking for elves and orc's don't bother, if you are looking for complex characters and well written story then this is a must read. If you've got a lot of time then I recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The book is about two 19th century magicians who attempt to return magic to England in a time of war.Four points:1. Clarke's language can be alienating at first to one expecting clipped, modern prose. You get over it - rather, you get into it.2. It is a well-researched book. Enough to fake it well. The footnotes I found distracting I skipped - reading them or not didn't effect the tangiblity of the world; they are a trick, but not an unpleasant one. Real historical characters wandered around the plot and are a good fit. Felt accurate, if not real.3. The book builds slowly, like falling snow. There's a lot of magic, but no 'set-pieces' - Clarke's success and failure comes from the slow integration of magic into the mannered comedy of her 19th century England. It never feels forced; it never explodes.4. There is sufficient resolution in that we know what each of the main characters will be doing at the start of the next story. It's the strangest thing - for so big a book to leave you wanting more. Magic indeed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just finished today and was much more moved by the book's end than I expected to be. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, loved the characterizations, loved the historical detail and the dry dry humor, but wasn't very emotionally involved until the end. This is the kind of book you can't expect to like if you are impatient for things to \\"happen.\\" Things do happen, but it is minute attention to detail, manners and mores of the time, and an enjoyment of language that gets you there. I'm looking forward to the next one, whever and whatever it may be!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can't tell you how refreshing it was to read a fantasy novel for adults that was not yet another \\"Lord of the Rings\\" rip-off. Instead, Susanna Clarke treats us to a story filled with magicians, folklore, fairies, footnotes and creatures from her own imagination that enrich the pages of her first novel. Perhaps her only similarity to Tolkien is her skill in making us believe that the events she describes are true occurrences, helped by her extensive use of footnotes, grounding in real folklore and enlightened, chatty prose. The next time you read of the Napoleonic War you may be surprised to find nothing of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell in the sources.Set between 1806 and 1817, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" tells the story of these two gentlemen magicians and their attempts to bring magic back into England and to magically assist the government in the war against Napoleon. After Mr Norrell proves to the country that he can indeed perform magical feats, he takes Jonathan Strange as his pupil. Eventually however, they find that they are too different to work together: Mr Norrell believes that magic is a studious, secret thing and keeps all his magical books locked away in a library. Strange however, thinks that magic should be shared and explored, and is attracted to the most perilous and dangerous magic that there is. Their biggest difference concerns the Raven King, a human child stolen and raised by fairies before coming back to conquer northern England. Though his reign ended hundreds of years ago, Norrell detests him and Strange adores him...and there are signs he has not quite left England...They are also surrounded by many other characters; wives, patrons, servants, friends and associates, most of whom have their own interconnecting stories throughout the story. This is perhaps one of the most rewarding parts of reading the book: the different threads of narratives that seem random and unconnected, but which exquisitely join together as the story reaches its end. Clarke does not spoon-fed the reader what he/she needs to know - if you want to unravel the various mysteries and intrigues, then you'll have to pay close attention to what's going on.Clarke speaks with a delicate narrative voice that is much akin to what you'll find in Jane Austen and other books published in this period, and she often addresses the reader directly, making it quite a personal read. Her use of footnotes is wonderful - every time a character mentions a book , a theory or story, she'll footnote more information concerning it, which once again gives the feeling that you're reading an historic account of these people's actions. Furthermore is her use of \`real' fairy lore, such as the capturing of human beings into the realm of Faery. Best of all, there's none of this \`sparkly, pretty, rainbows-and-flowers' fairy rubbish - these fairies are as they're meant to be - mysterious, sinister and capable of much destruction.Likewise, key historical events and figures, such as Napoleon, Wellington and Byron are included, and the story stretches from London, to the English countryside, to Italy, all of which is described in beautiful detail. Moments of intrigue - from the murder of a girl with ivy in her hair to an old woman who can only speak in cat - are scattered throughout, and exist only to add beauty and mystery to the overall novel. Such episodes are wonderful to read and ponder over.One thing that must be said though, is that it is a very unique book in terms of plotting. Though a climax to the tension does come (eventually), Clarke is content to explore the everyday life of the magicians and their associates, with the underlying mystery rearing its head on instances few and far between. This may not appeal to some; others may enjoy the slow meandering and subversive feel of the plot - that something sinister is going on beneath the more everyday occurrences. Another slight fault is the main characters themselves: although they are realistic and interesting, at times they do not come across as very nice people. Strange is certainly more sympathetic than Norrell, but he does not fully turn up till midway through the story.This is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in a long time: at different points thoughtful, original, clever, humorous, poignant and even scary! In a genre that is made up mostly of magic swords, dark lords, plucky young heroes and all the other fantasy cliches, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" is a welcome relief. If only all such authors took the same care and creativity with their novels that Susanna Clarke does with hers."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found this book so enthralling, so well-done, so moving, and so intelligent that I savored it night after night, rationing my consumption to just a few pages at a time. If the book has one shortcoming, it is that it is not at least twice as long. I think it deserves all the praise it has received--and then some (why it wasn't nominated for the major international book awards mystifies me, bu then I quickly remember how hide-bound and resistant to real interest, accomplishment, and innovation such award-granting committees are). As a fan of J.K. Rowling, who is diverting and amusing in a thoroughly trivial way, I found Clarke's book devastatingly superior. The \\"Harry Potter for Grown Ups\\" marketing of this book never made sense to me. This book is a masterpiece, and comparing it to the chronicles of Hogwarts is like comparing Shakespeare to, say, John Grisham."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a busy working mom, my one chapter of a book a night before going to bed is my daily treat. With Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, it became THE highlight of my day. You do not have to be a Sci Fi or Fantasy reader to love this book. I was totally engaged from the first chapter and so sad when I read the final words. (Actually, the final \\"scene\\" in the book was my FAVORITE. Could definitely see it in a movie.) What really stuck with me, beyond the incredible imagery, the rich characterization, the wonderfully creative premise and detail, was the story of an enduring friendship based on a love of a craft. I loved the beginning, I loved the middle, I loved the end. This book is my MUST READ of 2004."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Although she is the author of several short stories, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" is Susanna Clarke's debut novel. Set in England in the early nineteenth century, it was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award.The book opens in late 1806 and charts the efforts of two men to re-establish magic in England. Of the title characters, Gilbert Norrell is introduced first. A 'gentleman', Norrell has seemingly devoted his life to the study of magic. He has an extensive library at his home (Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire) - so extensive, in fact, that very few others possess any books of value on the subject. While there are many 'theoretical' magicians throughout England - the Learned Society of York Magicians, for example - Norrell is the country's first practising magician in over two centuries. He deludes himself that he wants nothing more that the restoration of English Magic - in reality, he is a small, petty and vain man who really wants to be England's only magician. The early pages cover his meeting with two members of the York Society - Mr. Segundus and Mr. Honeyfoot - and his efforts to close the Society down. This final nail in their coffin comes when he casts a spell that makes the statues in York Cathedral 'come alive' they move and speak, telling all they have seen over the years. Shortly afterwards, following the advice of his servant Childermass, Norrell moves to London - here, he hopes to win greater influence. However, in convincing the government and military of his worth, he resorts to magic he would rather not use : he seeks help from a gentleman with thistle-down hair. Although the resulting magic brings him the fame and influence he sought, it ultimately causes a great deal of trouble for its beneficiary, Lady Pole, and her butler, Stephen Black.Jonathan Strange isn't introduced until much later into the book. Another gentleman, he is a good deal more likeable than Norrell - though some think him arrogant. Until a chance meeting with a character called Vinculus, Strange had tried his hand at several professions - but settled on none. Vinculus is one of the book's minor, but influential, characters. He had been one of London's 'street magicians' (mostly con artists), and was driven out of the city by Norrell. However, it seems that, one way or another, he has access to a prophecy relating to Norrell and Strange. Upon hearing it, Strange settles on magic and starts studying as best he can - in fact, he seems to have a natural talent for it. In time, he becomes totally immersed in his new career - perhaps sacrificing some things he shouldn't have along the way. However, at no point does he display the spiteful, self-centred streak Norrell regularly does.It is only a matter of time before the two magicians meet and, for a while, they appear to work well together. Before long, however, their relationship turns to rivalry. They key factor in the change is their differing opinion of John Uskridge, The Raven King. The greatest magician England had ever known, Uskridge was born in England but raised in Faerie. He returned in the 12th Century to establish his kingdom in Northern England. Norrell detests Uskridge - he considers the Raven King's magic to be of the darkest variety and should be removed from English Magic. Strange, on the other hand, feels this is impossible. In his opinion, Uskridge established the tradition of English Magic and one cannot exist without the other.While I did enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend this book unconditionally. Anyone expecting a grown-up version of Harry Potter will be disappointed - in my opinion, it's more like a grown-up version of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". It is very long (around 800 pages) and gets off to a slow start. Clarke is a big fan of Jane Austen, and seems to have modelled her writing for this book on Austen's. For example, some of the spellings are 'old-fashioned' - 'chuse' instead of choose. This may put some off - I know I'd have hated it as a teenager. It'll be hard work, but it's worth it in the end !"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Don't buy this book if Rowling is your template of excellence. It takes a more sophisticated reader to enjoy this book. The 19th century authors that seem closest to me are Trollope, Eliot, and Dickens. Perhaps the dry wit is Austen-like but it is too dark and large in scope to truly be like Austen. (I too am a huge Austen fan but that doesn't mean I can write like her). I think she has unacknowleged debt to Saki and M.R. James, two English authors from the early twentieth century who also wrote fantastic literature. Saki stories almost always take place in the countryside of England (and he, too, writes about the natural/fairy world as often malevolent) and James wrote about magic without using that word (characters in his stories cast runes or look in mirroirs and see the past or future, they cast spells on one another).I also agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is easier to read if you are familiar with 19th literature and history. It is possible that some of the jokes might be lost, but I am confident that it is more likely that whoever enjoys this book and doesn't know 19th century lit will realize that there might be some really wonderful books to be read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm not going to lie, I nearly gave up on reading this at 3 different occasions. The first third of the book is almost painfully dull and reading it is almost a chore. However, the author is just laying the foundation for the second and third acts of the book which pay off in a big way. Congratulations to the author on her achievement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Author Susanna Clarke lists among her influences both J. R. R. Tolkein, and Jane Austen. Both these inspirations show strongly in \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.\\" This book, set in an alternate-historical England during the Napoleonic wars chronicles the restoration of English Magic through the efforts of two magicians (the titular Messrs Strange and Norrell). Conflict builds between the magicians, and an immortal, amoral third party threatens the life and sanity of all.Written in a style adapted from Austen's classics (known as 'Free indirect speech' to the English students), \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is enthralling primarily because of the brilliant imagination of setting and characters. A continuous witty sense of humor combines with rich and believable (if fantastic) back story to create the feeling of something actually written in the nineteenth century. One entertaining extra is the wealth of footnotes explaining events both historical and fictional.One word of caution: This book has been presented as an action story like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or Harry Potter. This is not the case. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is more \\"Downton Abbey\\" than \\"24\\". While absorbing and even exciting, this book is not thrill-a-minute.I recommend this book to all readers, but especially to the Ladies and Gentlemen with the patience to appreciate its depth and wit.If you can quote along with \\"The Princess Bride\\", or spend six hours with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth with A&E;'s \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", this book is for you.Five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me start by saying that I don't normally read in the fantasy/sci-fi genre, but this one came highly recommended to me by a friend, so I gave it a chance. It almost didn't get finished. At over 850 pages of smaller than usual print (and given my limited reading time), I was a little leery of committing that much time.I was also nervous when I saw the style compared with Jane Austen. I've never been a huge fan of that style of writing. The characters often seem more like caricatures, either flat or over exaggerated. And this was the sense I got at the beginning of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, but I decided I would give it 100 pages before I gave up on it.Previous to the 100 pages, while I didn't find myself caring that much about the characters, there were just enough interesting moments to keep me going (such as Norrell essentially banning all other magicians from ever doing magic again... or more specifically how he pulled that feat off).However, I was hooked at probably page 96. Just in time. There was an act of just enough darkness to string me along past page 100, and the more I read, the more I enjoyed the story. There were still many moments where the character interactions bounced back to the superficial, but soon they started to fill out and seem like real people.I also enjoyed the historical aspect, especially the idea that magic played a part in the Napoleonic Wars (and I really enjoyed the individual acts of magic used) and the idea that this was a time when magic was accepted as reality (I believe this would fall under \\"speculative fiction\\"?).I even liked most of the numerous footnotes (although some tended to go on a little long. I've always been a fan of footnotes, often inserting them into my nonfiction). They added an element of \\"fantastic truth\\" to this world of men interacting with magic and the fairy realm (the latter of which was different than anything I've seen, although again, this isn't my normal genre). The mythology surrounding the mysterious Raven King, a child taken by fairies who went on to become a king of both England and Faerie, was well-crafted.I only had two gripes (besides the writing style/characterization in the beginning), which aren't that major. The first one was that it seemed like Clarke wasn't sure what type of story she wanted it to be once it really got going. There were several points where the story took very dark turns, and I would get excited and think it was a changing point, but then she would go back to the farcical. Some scenes were downright graphic (some I would even go so far as to describe as disturbing), and while I enjoyed them, they didn't seem to fit with the flavor of the rest of the book. I found myself wanting more of that type of story . I understand that ultimately this is her story and she can write it however she wants, but there was an accompanying unsettling feeling brought about by the shifts in tone.SPOILER ALERT FOR MY SECOND GRIPEMy other gripe was the fact that the Raven King never plays a significant part in the action of the story (beside in the development of the story). As I mentioned, the author goes to great lengths to create a mythology around this character and at least this reader was led to believe that he was going to make an appearance in some major way in the story. However, he only shows up for perhaps two pages towards the end (if I'm guessing correctly. The aforementioned figure is never named). Granted, what he does in those two pages is indeed important (and I know this isn't his story), but it seems like all of the build-up should've had more pay-off.IN CONCLUSION:Well, I hope I've given you enough information to decide if you want to read it or not. If you like historical fiction, matched with magic and fantasy, you'll love it. Personally, even though I'm not normally a fan or any of that, I'm still happy to say that I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable and immersive books I've read in a long time.

Jonathan Strange becomes an apprentice to Mr. Norrell and together they help England defeat Napoleon. After the war, Strange and Norrell part company and form competing schools of magical study. In the end, they must work together to save innocent lives....................spoilers...................................Long version:Meticulously detailed, Susanna Clark has created an elaborate and historically accurate picture of early 19th century England ...except for the magicians...and the faeries.Her drawing room conversations contain all of the acute observation and dry wit of Jane Austin.\\"It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week\\"Her colorful characters lampoon British law and the aristocracy in the manner of Charles Dickens.\\" \`I would not have you think that the Admiralty is entirely helpless without Mr. Strange,' smiled Sir Walter. \`They have done what they can. They sent one of the clerks, a Mr. Petrofax, to Greenwich to seek out a childhood friend of Admiral Armincroft's to ask him, with his superior knowledge of the Admiral's character, what he thought the Admiral would do under such circumstances. But when Mr. Petrofax got to Greenwich the Admiral's childhood friend was drunk in bed, and Mr. Petrofax was not sure he understood the question.' \\"She rivals Tolkien in the scrupulous, painstaking development of her magical history. Tolkien added appendices and timelines to the end of his books. Ms Clark specializes in footnotes; many, many footnotes. In chapter 25, footnote 4, is actually a four page short story about the Master of Nottingham's daughter and a magic ring.This novel progresses very slowly with numerous sub-plots and the ever present footnotes. The atmosphere of the story changes with the scenery. Tales of the magic done in the war against Napoleon have an almost campy humor. (Before the Battle of Waterloo, Mr. Strange is called upon to move the city of Brussels out of harm's way. He removes it to a remote part of America. According to footnote 1 of Chapter 40, some deserters of the battle were discovered 15 years later, living among the Lakota as The Tribe of Half-Finished People.) On the other hand, the story Lady Pole's enchantment has a much darker tone of gothic horror. At the end of the book, Lord Byron makes a darkly comic appearance as he studies the seemingly mad Jonathan Strange with a view to using him as the great poet's muse.It is very hard for me to believe that this amazing book was a debut novel. On the other hand, I have no difficulty believing that Susanna Clark took 12 years to write it. The book comprises 782 pages of densely packed reading. Simon Prebble gives a superb performance on the 32 hour audio edition. One advantage of the audio version is that each footnote is tracked separately, so it is possible to use the forward button to skip past them. Those footnotes are the feature that prevents me from giving this book 5 stars. Most of the notes were interesting, entertaining or funny, but they always interrupted the narrative and brought an already slow story to a snail's pace.At times I wondered if Jonathan Strange, Mr. Norrell and Susanna Clark were having a good magician's laugh by continually adding pages to the text as I read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This 782-page book is ponderous in both weight and pace. I looked forward to reading it, as it had been described as Harry Potter for grownups. Additionally, the reviews on the book jacket compare it favorably to both JRR Tolkien and Jane Austen. I found that the first half tells a good tale with style, but the second half was very disappointing, seeming to be inconsistent, confusing, and unsatisfying. I had to force myself through the last hundreds of pages. Some passages from the book are wonderful, so there is no question of the author's writing talent, but I felt the plot collapsed. While the comparisons to illustrious authors are quite flattering to author Susanna Clarke, I really couldn't see the connection at all, and rather think Austen and Tolkien would be offended.The coherent part of the story involves two magicians who become famous for using magic to bolster the British war efforts. After 500 pages Strange realizes that his real opponent is not Bonaparte but a wicked fairie who has spirited away his wife. At this point the story loses its continuity and purpose: the war plot evaporates, Strange and his wife are never reunited, and though the reader is aware that the fairie poses a threat to England, neither magician ever appreciates this or confronts it. In short, all the strands of the complicated plot that are developed in the first half of the book remain unresolved through the final 300 pages: The characters that are developed in such painstaking detail are either abandoned or left struggling. The obstacles they struggled against have not been overcome or they have been replaced with new challenges. The objects that have been the goal of exhaustive searches remain lost or fail to be recognized for what they are. And the powerful spells they have tried to master have unexplained results that they do not understand and cannot solve.I am reluctant to be so critical of such a huge quantity of work that took 10 years to write, but the story left me bewildered and disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation, the recommender knowing I am a fan of Harry Potter, Stephen King, and JRR Tolkien (though not \\"Fantasy\\" in general), and I must say, though the elegant and precise language and gentle humor is mildly pleasing, the historical research impressive, and the weaving of historical events into fiction clever, the lack of a strong narrative thread makes it the sort of book one either throws down in disgust after about 200 pages, or forces oneself to complete, depending on \\"one's\\" reading personality. If you find it hard to sleep, and don't like to rely on pills, this is the bedtime reading for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The reviews of this book are polarized. A large number of reader-reviewers love this book, a smaller but apparently equally passionate reader-reviewers can't stand it. On balance, this is a good book. The premise and development of an alternative universe involving magic are very good. The plot is ingenious and I found character development to be good. Set in the early 19th century, Clarke made a conscious and largely successful effort to pattern this book on the work of Jane Austen and particularly Thackray. The combination of fantasy with serious comedy of manners in unusual and largely successful. Clarke has also done a reasonably good job of integrating some real historical personages like Wellington, and Byron into the book.Readers, however, who object to the length of the book are justified in their complaints. I think more vigorous editing would have improved the book without sacrificing the period quality of the presentation. This is a first novel and the conclusion leaves open the door for a sequel. We'll see what Clarke can do in her next book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found myself gripped by this novel right from the start. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell surreally combines the righteous ordered world of an early 19th century novel with a fierce mystical magical vision very out of place with an early 19th century novel. This discontinuity sets off a delicious tension; between the real and the unreal; between good and evil; between the natural and the artificial; between love and hate.Susanna Clarke creates brilliantly realized characters that play off one another in classic, but seldom unoriginal ways. She then stirs in a vision of magic that is both ancient, sublime, and yet utterly modern and original too. At its heart it's a buddy story - a pair of two totally different people with real love-hate relationship. The narrative plays with notions of good and evil but things are seldom as cut and dried as they seem. Good and evil frequently change places (or at least our perception of whether a given character or act is good or evil frequently changes). Throw in a good dose of danger, excitement, weirdness of the supernatural and madness and you have high gothic thriller than manages to be something more sublime - a superbly detailed parallel universe; one with recognizable people and historical details but one very alien to our own suffused with magic as it is.My wife didn't like or recommend this to me. She found too many of the characters unlikeable. I feel she has missed the mark. Just like Dickens - there are some really odious characters here - particularly the jealous, fearful, miserly Norrell; the sycophantic and scheming Drawlight; the foppish yet morally bankrupt Lascelles - and even the eerie, somehow sinister and uncouth Childermass. I haven't even touched on the villain of the piece either. Even Strange - apparently the most admirable character is somewhat maddeningly self involved and unobservant. Many of these characters have redeeming and even heroic aspects. Secondly, the use of the dark underbelly of the human soul sets off the shining virtues (when they appear) like chiaroscuro. This isn't a standard adventure tale. This is far more sophisticated stuff where people make choices of ambiguous moral content and then live the consequences, even if their hearts are in the right place.But even more impressive than the characters is the depiction of magic itself. Landscapes and elemental forces are molded - water, earth, paintings, and brick are molded into magical servants. Bowls of water are visionary portals. Mirrors are doors. Landscapes are putty to be moved around. Whole cities and rivers are moved. In the latter phases of the book when the plot ups the magical ante a deep mysterious connection between an animistic consciousness in aspects of the natural world (the sky, rocks, rivers, trees, the earth) communicates and relates. Sorcerers in fantasy tales are usually viewed from a 3rd person perspective. In a modern, Tolstoy-like manner, Clarke takes us inside the minds of people doing and experiencing magic. Her vision is original and powerful and the experience is unsettling.Looking over the reviews here I can see lots of folks complaining about the length and pacing of this book. I didn't have any problems with either. Certainly it's very long (probably same word count as War and Peace - to keep my Tolstoy parallel going) - and like War and Peace it alternates between domestic spheres of action (conversations in drawing rooms) and action on the (many and varied) battlefields. Magical terms and a vast, vital, library of magical texts and traditions, lore, tales, characters, history is invoked and then explained in lengthy, brilliantly detailed footnotes. Undoubtedly this drives some people nuts. In many ways the stand-alone stories in some of the footnotes are the best and must fun things in the whole book. This extra level of detail suffuses the whole enterprise with a convincing verisimilitude that made me actually believe in these pseudo traditions enough to look them up on the Internet to find out more - (but of course they are part of Clarke's inventions). Such amazing inventiveness! I could have devoured it if it were twice as long.This was just a great great read - especially recommended if you can stomach Dickens (as a touchstone for your ability to handle 19th century English language, wild characters, and narrative darkness). Pick this up and just read the early chapter \\"Brest\\" out of context. It works brilliantly as a stand-alone short story. Then just see if you can put it down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've been listening to Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in the car for a week or two now -- and I'm only half way through! Yet, the really amazing thing is this: I wish it was four times longer.I don't know if the Man With the Thistledown Hair has enchanted me, or if I'm just held enthralled by Clarke's narrative (or both), but I know I'm going to be incredibly sad when I've finished this extraordinary audiobook edition of the 10 pound novel.Describing Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is probably best left to other reviewers (as well as Amazon's own staff). Suffice to say this is a historical novel of English magic in the same way This is Spinal Tap is a \\"rockumentary\\" about a British rock band.Which is to say it's a fantastically detailed fake. From start to finish. But you'd never know it. It contains footnotes, sometimes in exquisite detail, of published books that never were...of lively conversations held between people that never existed...combined with historical references (such as to the Napoleonic wars) that serve to give the book an uncanny air of verisimilitude. Like it's a book of history, rather than a novel.All of which is remarkable enough on its own. But when viewed as part of an intricate tapestry that weaves together stories about fairy kingdoms, England's two best known magicians (the titular Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell), servants, dukes, ladies, wars and every day life in Britian in the early 1800s...well, it's almost overwhelming.I used to think Neil Gaiman (who heartily praised Clarke's novel) was the king of dreamscapes and enchantments. I often thought Clive Barker had a corner on writing books so involved, detailed and engrossing that it literally felt like stepping into another world upon opening their pages. I even considered Tolkien to be the master of creating magical lands and creatures.But Susanna Clarke has them all beat. And I say that with all the reverence such a statement requires.She has a command of the English language that makes listening to her book (which, by the way, is narrated by British actor Simon Prebble) a delight. Honestly, I run the risk of sounding hyperbolic when I tell you that this is the most engrossing, enjoyable audio book I've ever heard in my life. And I include Jim Dale's outstanding narration of the Harry Potter series among those I've heard. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, as narrated by the remarkable Prebble, offers a world that's deep, rich and real -- despite the fact that the subject matter is (a) made up, and (b) about magic, fairies and magicians.I can't praise this book -- especially in its audio edition -- highly enough. As I said, I'm only halfway through listening to it. I have no idea where the story will take me. But I'm enjoying the journey like never before.This book belongs on the shelf of every lover of superb storytelling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When I bought this book all I knew about it was that it takes place during the Napoleonic Wars and was supposed to be \\"the Harry Potter for Adults.\\"The book is long. Let's just get that out of the way. The print is small. This book is very daunting when you first pick it up.However, it is very good. It does take a while to get going, but it is very engrossing once you are into it. The character are rich and well described. Susanna Clarke has a definite talent for describing settings and people. She doesn't use the same old tired cliches.In many ways the book is like a Dickens novel. There are a wide range of characters that in one way or another are related to each other, but it takes most of the book for us to figure out how.I honestly loved this book. It is not the Harry Potter for adults because it does not relate to that book other than the fact it is about wizards. This book should be considered a fine classic and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading a good novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a series of contradictions. It's a magical tale about the mundane, an alternate history nearly identical to our own, a comedy of manners that is itself as affected as a smoking jacket and meerschaum pipe. It's at once refreshingly new and hugely derivative, a mashup -- \\"The Prestige\\" as directed by Tim Burton and produced by Merchant Ivory. Deserved or not, it is a phenomenon.\\"Jonathan Strange...\\" arrives like a Duchess at a royal ball, bedecked with \\"Best Novel\\" honors from the Hugo, World Fantasy and Locus awards. Its path was strewn with praise by fantasy's regining King of Cool, Neil Gaiman. The publisher reportedly paid Ms Clarke a seven-figure advance, a bet that paid off when the book peaked at number three on the New York Times bestseller list.So it's with great trepidation that I step in front of this lumbering bandwagon as it caterpillars toward me, and say, I do not like it.Sorry. I admire it, respect it, but I don't like it. However much I stand in awe of Ms Clarke's work, and I do, it is awesome in the same way that Stalinist architecture is awesome: the sheer scale takes your breath away, but it is hard to love the final product.In Ms Clarke's England, magic and fairies (think \\"Labyrinth\\", not \\"Peter Pan\\") are real but forgotten, and there have been no true magicians for centuries. None, that is, until magic stages a return in the persons of scholarly and Scrooge-ish Gilbert Norrell, and talented gentleman amateur Jonathan Strange. The focus falls first on Norrell, as he rises to fame after bringing back to life the fiancee of a leading politician, then on Strange, as he first becomes Norrell's pupil but then rejects his master's timid approach. In the third act, the two are thrown back together to face the deadly consequences of Mr Norrell's earlier act of resurrection.Ms Clarke's innovation is two-fold. First, she sets her tale not in some unpronounceable empire ruled by jockstrapping barbarians and pneumatic princesses, nor in a medieval kindgom of errant knights and distressed damsels, but in the stuffy drawing room of 19th century England. Second, the book itself is written in the Romantic style of 19th century literature. Ms Clark uses archaic spellings such as \\"shewed\\" and \\"chuse\\" in place of \\"showed\\" and \\"choose\\". The plot is episodic and the pacing not so much glacial as granitic. Finally, the nameless narrator is a keen observer of social manners and possessed of a positively Saharan sense of humor. The illusion of historicity is buttressed by hundreds of footnotes, some of them pages long, detailing an invented history of magic and folklore.Sustaining this style and tone over the course of a 1,000+ page novel is an act of endurance on par with running back-to-back marathons. Bravo. Sadly, what should be immersive winds up being distancing. \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" has been compared to the works of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, but frankly it feels closer to \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\", a one-line joke that gets carried on for an entire novel. What's worse, the slightly mocking tone invites you to ridicule rather than sympathize with the characters, and it is hard to find much warmth for either Norrell or Strange when the author herself regards them so coolly.As a work of imagination, too, \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" is a bit of a letdown. No, scratch that. It positively bubbles and froths with invention and ideas. A pity they are almost all buried in the footnotes. Ms Clarke presents us with a richly-detailed, colorful backdrop, then foregrounds a rather dull, grey tale. The first three quarters of the book are so singularly lacking in incident that the language becomes not sedate but soporific. The final break between the two main characters, for example, involves a mildly critical magazine article.Despite the hype, this is far too inaccessible a novel to merit the mantle of \\"Harry Potter for adults\\". Indeed, the book's highest accomplishment will probably to help move fantasy beyond Rowling and Tolkien wannabes. Funny that a book so rooted in the past should propel the genre forward, but hey, what's one more contradiction?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm plowing through this one, but it is a labor. Lots of cutesy period detail but an abundance of characters who drive me to wishing awful fates upon them. Technically very very throrough, but I need some positive feedback every now and then."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"At first I was a little hesitant having read so much praise for this book. The first 100 pages seem to drag along. Clarke seems to find her story after that rather long setup. I won't say the plot kicks into high gear, that doesn't really happen until about the last 1/3 of the book, but the characters and their interactions as well as the build up of the story make it a page turner.There's alot of humor hidden in this story, not the kind that grabs you and hits you over the head, but the kind of humor you get a little chuckle or say that was clever to yourself.As for the footnotes, I loved them. Some were stories within the story and were very entertaining. The others helped to go in to more details on things that you didn't necessarily have to know to keep up with the plot.I'll definitely be looking for more works from Clarke and hoping she decides to revisit this world."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel, by Susanna Clark is an odd egg to describe. It has been called a Historical Fantasy, and I guess that is a good enough summarization. It is historical in the sense that it is set in England during the Napoleonic Wars. It is fantasy in the sense that there are magic and fairies. That is about as far as it goes on both aspects.I've read my fair share of both historical and fantasy novels. I've read good and bad in both genres. This novel is the best of both without completely being either. Most historical novels or alternative history novels that I have read concentrate on setting. When reading these, the reader is given lengthy descriptions of foods eaten, clothes worn, architecture, customs followed, etc.. Too often in the weakest of this type of story, these elements overshadow plot and characterization. The fantasy novel tends to be re-hashed Tolkien. A group of unlikely heroes set out upon an impossible quest, only to persevere in the end against all odds, proving yet again that there is a bit of a hero in the seemingly unlikeliest of characters. Along the way, fantastical places are visited and amazing feats of magic are performed.Clark's novel is none of the above. She does not give lengthy descriptions of setting and customs; rather, she gives just enough that the reader knows solidly where she is. While there are elements of fantasy, she avoids the Tolkien re-hash syndrome and gives her reader a fantasy experience that they will long remember.Her novel is not driven by plot. For me, pages were turned quickly, but not to find out what happens next. Clark explores her two protagonists in depth. I found Mr. Norrell fascinatingly flawed. He comes across as jealous and petty. Many who have read this novel disliked it for they could not find anything likeable about Norrell. He isn't likeable, but he portrays those characteristics that humanity as a whole has within them. Strange is more accessible, but is no everyman character. He is flawed in his own unique way.A few words of warning, this is a long novel. Do not drop it on someone's toes, even your own, or you might break a few; however, the length did not detract from my enjoyment and I tend to gravitate towards novels in the realm of 300 to 400 pages, less than 300 is even better in my opinion. This comes from my preference for short stories and a belief that too often authors meander without focus. Clark does meander, but I willingly and joyfully followed her wherever she traveled. She uses footnotes throughout. These are pseudo foot notes. She has created them all, but they are so well done you'll find yourself searching the Internet for more information on the Raven King (I did). Again, the footnotes are a turn off for some people, but I found them enjoyable. The voice of the novel is Dickenesque, with intentional period miss spellings that may aggravate some readers. For me, a Dickens fan, the voice was a treat and the miss spellings heightened the denseness of the novel. I found her style completely satisfying.With all that praise aside, if you do not like long novels, or really want to know what the characters are eating and wearing ad nauseam, or are expecting more re-hashed Tolkien ala Robert Jordan, then do not waste your time on this novel. If you enjoy something original and are willing to be taken on a pleasant journey through pseudo-time, then pick up this novel, make some tea and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you need to decide quickly if you will like this book I offer the following advice: Flip through the pages and look at the pictures.You will notice that many of the pictures are of scenes that take place indoors. Not only that, but there really isn't much going on in these pictures.Expect lots of eccentric characters, sophisticated dialogue, scenic descriptions (without being flowery), but at the same time don't expect the plot to make leaps and bounds and raise question after question. If you're going to read it, I suggest pacing yourself.In a nutshell, you have two magicians. Mr. Norrell, who hordes all books of magic and loves to talk and read about the subject. Then there's Strange, who is more interested in practicing it.Straight away you can see how the two are going to conflict with each other.Both are trying to bring Magic back to England.To add to this concoction, the Napoleonic Wars are taking place (it was these parts I found the most exciting) and later in the book you even stumble across the mad King and Lord Byron.The magic is interesting, but not of the sword and sorcery variety. (The parts where Strange moves entire objects/places are absolutely hilarious though).The fairies aren't what I was expecting either. I was actually reminded of the faun in Pan's Labyrinth--comes across as nice, but apparently has another agenda.The blend of history and fantasy is pulled off very well, to include footnotes that honestly don't add much, other than to give you the feeling that you're reading a non-fiction account of magic in 1800's England.All this being said, I can easily see how this won the Hugo award, but it's not for everybody.There is a part in this book where the author describes a carriage ride being bumpy despite it having iron springs (a high-quality carriage for those days, I presume). Such is this book, it has lots of components that are high-quality, but the road (plot) it rides on is not always smooth. But it is fun to look out the window and take in the sights (the characters, history and attention to detail)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"first off, i have to point out that this book is quite a fun.the style of writing Clarke has is pleasant to the ear and mind.but what strikes me very peculiar is that the first volume of this book titled MR. Norrell is focused on a character that is rude, arrogant, snobbish, pretty much the most unlikeable character i have ever read about and i couldn't put the book down. people who complain about this book being too slow need to realize that this is not something like Harry Potter. Clarke uses much of her language in this book not to tell the story so much as to play and experiment with the form of English during the 1800's i feel this book says much about common day literature. the story does drag in spots of the first volume but i found that once Jonathan Strange was introduced the book picked up quite nicely.the story is original and has many twists and turns. her writing is fun and sophisticated.great book. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is quite simply the best work of fiction I've ever read. Ok, yes, I admit, Harry Potter is a very close second and yes, I do think that the widely used \\"Harry Potter for Adults\\" is accurate enough.This is a book that the reader may have to put a bit of work into - it is very long, heavily footnoted, and quite complex. The footnotes are a great enrichment to the world of the story, but they could be skipped I suppose. I personally enjoyed them. The payoff for the investment in time and attention is an immersion in a world that is at once historically accurate, but with an open door through which magic and the fairy world flows out to merge and change the nature of reality.I also enjoy the 'nonfiction' occult genre. I think this book will appeal to readers of that genre as well. It draws upon such a wealth of mythos and folklore that an occultist will recognize that Ms. Clarke is obviously well acquainted with magical practice, folklore, and history...could she at times be modeling some of the book after Doreen Valiente's Magickal Battle of Britain (an account of a real magickal battle) and could it be that her stuffy magical societies reflect a bit the Golden Dawn with A. Crowley coming in saying I don't want sit around and talk, talk, talk about it, I want to DO IT? Oh yes, I DO think so. :) So, if you have been studying the history of the occult, I really, really think you will enjoy this book even more with that knowledge.This lady has really done her research well. I look forward to the movie, which I understand is in pre-production now.I do recommend you get the hardback. It is a beautiful book and to me enhanced the read, as it is a treasure for me as I love the look and feel of this particular book. I'm not sure if a paperback could hold up, my experience with books this thick is that they do not for me.I'm on my second copy now. My first copy was borrowed, loved, and never returned."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Pros: Immerses the reader in the nineteenth century, but still manages the fantasy elements very well. Pulls off the writing style perfectly. Has well drawn characters.Cons: The pacing is a little off. Begins very slow, but has a rushed ending.If you are a reader who has to love a book from page one, then you may have a bit of trouble with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It is certainly never bad, but one is left with the feeling that the story hasn't quite picked up yet for the first 300 - 400 pages. If you are willing to stick it out, however, then this book is certainly worth the trouble.Once Clarke manages to get all the interlinked plots and subplots going, the story is full of interest. Magic, done up in a polite nineteenth century style, abounds. Clarke creates a rich alternate history complete with stories of magicians that stretch back to the middle ages. The scholarly Norrell is set on bringing magic back to England in his own very modern way. Norrell is a fascinating character, especially when juxtaposed against the much more vibrant Strange. The characters in general are very well drawn and even side characters like Stephen provide a good deal of interest.Somehow, Clarke has found the perfect balance between writing in a nineteenth century style and writing in a way that will please modern audiences. One gets the feeling that her book could be read by people from either time.Though the ending is a tad bit rushed, it creates a high degree of excitement. This book is recommended to anyone looking for something different in the world of fantasy. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There are few novels that can walk the line between the fantastic and the real, where the outstanding becomes inseparable from the common-place, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is one of these books. Susanna Clarke has succeeded in creating a 19th Century England full of magic and mystery, while still being anchored in the realities and histories of 19th Century Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. The novel can best be described as an alternative-history. In this world northern England was once ruled by a magician-king, referred to, among other names, as the Raven King. He is responsible for bringing magic to England, ruling for over 300 years before mysteriously disappearing.The novel opens long after the departure of the Raven King, magicians are nothing more than glorified scholars, pouring over books about magic, unable themselves to preform any. Magic is gone from England and no one really understands how or why. The great acts of magic performed by the Raven King and the other great magicians has long been sequestered to books and fables. However, an old man appears and performs an extraordinary display of magic, sending all of England into an uproar.The characters in the novel, on the surface appear rather stereotypical. Mr. Norrell is an old, scholarly magician bent on preserving tradition and pouring over his numerous tomes. His pupil, Jonathan Strange is young and brash, eager to push the boundaries of magic, to experiment rather than read about magical pursuits. However, as the novel wears on you discover each as a depth of character unlike their outward persona's. Each is driven by different fears and passions, and they both have much more in common than they realize.The novel's greatest strength lies in how believable and tangible the world Mrs. Clarke portrays is brought to life. The novel is littered with footnotes outlining interesting facts and fables (some of which span multiple pages). These are never tedious and all serve to annunciate the \\"believability\\" of the story. In this fashion she reminds me of another great English author, J.R.R. Tolkien who went through great pains to add color and depth to his world, expanding upon small details, evening creating a language of his own. Mrs. Clarke also has a keen sense of mixing humor with drama, adding the right touch of levity at appropriate times. Her humor is very much like that of Jane Austen, poking fun at the social dilemmas gentleman and ladies found themselves in during the 19th century, where morality and social acceptability ran counter to emotions.The novel is broken into three volumes, each segmented into many chapters, with few running more than twenty pages. This does a good job of making the 846 page novel easily digestible. This is Susanna Clarke's first novel and pacing is one issue she has yet to master. The novel lags during a few places (notably during the beginning and end of volume I), and the ending seems to flow in a torrent. However, it is very easy to get lost in the prose, which is succinct and well constructed. Her descriptions of magical acts are particularly well written, with metaphors that precisely illustrate the events at hand in perfect detail.In the end this is a tremendous novel, one of the best constructed literary worlds I've had the pleasure of exploring."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"...to the loads of excellent reviews here. If you've read Jonathan Stroud's \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\" (The Amulet of Samarkand, Ptolemy's Gate and The Golem's Eye), you will enjoy this book a lot, as it seems like the authors were working together to create a believable alternate British world structure. Clarke's world is easily seen as the forerunner to Stroud's modern British world, with their magics being extremely similar."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First of all, I have to admit that my mind has been mixed on this book. Actually, I started it a year or so ago and put it down. It is SOOO long and I was losing interest. Images, however, kept coming back to me and something drew me in with the resolve to slog through it from beginning to end. From that persepective, I have been reluctant to recommend this book to friends as it is a great investment of time. Therefore, I cannot discuss my thoughts with anyone but you, dear reader.I am not a fantasy fan but got entirely engrossed in this novel as it did not appear to be fantasy but history with an otherwordly air. I found the plot to be complex and even (do I dare admit it) plausible. Because of the length, the protagonists keep changing but everything gets woven into the end.The language was beautiful and the spells and prophesies sheer poetry. I thought the footnotes were some of the best parts of the book. They speak so vividly of other sources that I was actually Googling the reference works to see if they were available. Sadly, all were fiction.The lasting impression I have is that there are other worlds with which we only sometimes intersect. Faeries are definately more than the cute little statues in my garden and if I ever meet one, I will head the opposite way! Beware of men with thistledown hair and if you see a flock of crows/ravens, lock your doors as the king may be lurking about. Beware of any bargain that seems too good to be true, as the price exacted can be enormous - and those ancients can be so tempting and alluring!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Although I am neither a fan of Austen nor a devotee of Tolkien, I found myself strangely situated on airplane back to Los Angeles with a rather large and ungainly text whose author has been compared to both literary personages. Which makes sense, given the blend of English folklore, alternate history, and fantasy that fill Clarke's pages. Of course, there are footnotes too--sometimes pages of them--as well as frequent tangents and roundabouts. All of which are generally amusing if occasionally overlong.To call the text slow, however, is somewhat of a misnomer. Clarke is at her strongest when she indulges in historical interludes and careful, detailed studies; for example, the chapter entitled \\"Heart-break Farm\\" describes the origins of one of the two title characters in a fashion that is both illuminating and entertaining. In contrast, her action sequences, such as those depicting Norrell and Strange's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars, tend to be lacking in dramatic chutzpah. If you are undaunted by this, then you will be suitably rewarded by the fascinating and peculiar conclusion.Suffice to say, those who enjoy nibbling on bits of this and that will relish the opportunity to explore Clarke's richly decorated world while those who prefer leaner prose should best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio book narrated by Simon Prebble. The narrator did an excellent job of giving a unique expression to each character, which really helped with the enjoyment of the book. His voice was perfect for the tone of the book and he sounded like a staid British scholar giving a serious lecture on the history of magic while narrating.The book starts out slowly and gains momentum over time as more and more interesting things happen with magic and the characters. The story is based in England in the early 1800's and intertwines existing history with a past that had magic that has dwindled until the time that the novel starts it is only studied as history. Mr. Norrell comes into the picture as a real magician who has studied magic his whole life and wants to slowly reintroduce the practice. Jonathan Strange shows up later as an apprentice to Mr. Norrell, who is much more adventuresome and wants to accelerate the introduction; this creates tension between the two major characters. The novel is presented as a scholarly history and even has faux footnotes referring to the events discussed. The unintended consequences of the magic performed were very interesting; and the reaction of the public and public officials to the reintroduction of magic was a fun part of the novel.I recommend this novel, but note that this is not for those that want a quick dive into magic. It fits more of the style of a 19th century novel in length and tone. The audio book is an excellent way to go through this novel. It made for a few weeks of enjoyable commutes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The book starts out much like an interesting history book of English magic, much of it told first hand. The book was complete with historical footnotes that were full of wit and interesting stories in and of themselves. The magic is fresh without all of the typical magical crutches and stereotypes. Also, the way magical \\"history\\" is woven into real English history was clever and super cool. The part magic played in Wellington's victory over Napoleon including the last battle at Waterloo is alternate history at its best. Still, it takes some time (like the first 600 pages) before the \\"actionable\\" plot of the book becomes clear, there is evil afoot in good ole England, at a time when the country's 2 magicians are at odds. The last 250 pages of the book make the first 600 worth the effort. The plot quickens and the twists and turns (after all, what kind of fantasy would it be, with out twists and turns) are unexpected and rewarding.The book is recommended, but only if you are willing to take the time to read the footnotes, and not rush the expierence."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The joy of this book is not in its length, for it is too long, but for the fully-formed world and the arch manner of the writing. Too many people have tried to compare this to Harry Potter for some very superficial similarities: it's set in an England where magic works, the author is female and the book is a brick. But this is not a children's book, albeit those weaned on Potter might find this interesting if quite slow in comparison, for Clarke's method is much more subtle. This is a comedy of manners in the traditional sense. In Rowling's world, we're never going to see Draco Malfoy as a sympathetic figure, yet the complex character who is Mr Norrell comes across as equally malicious as Malfoy at times and yet also quite sympathetic at others. He, and Strange, and most of the rest of the characters in this book are entirely too human, who do stupid things and smart things and they are never quite sure which is which during the action thereof.Mr Norrell is the last practical magician in England, who is determined to be the only magician as well, because all of the others are charlatans and theoretical. He's a vain man, who wants to restore England to glory through magical means, but only if the means and ways are those that he approves of. Norrell is also quite naive, and quickly is surrounded by a pair of handlers in the high society of London who use him much more than he uses them in their employment. A combination of Norrell's misuse of his own magic (in a severe lapse of judgment) and the arrival of Jonathan Strange, a ne'er-do-well turned magician through natural aptitude, who joins Norrell as a pupil, that proceeds to give the book its slight plot. While nicely resolved at the end, it is the examination of the characters and the world that is of more interest, as Clarke does a wonderful job of creating a magic realist alternate history, where the magic, while unnatural, isn't viewed with alarm by people, but taken as it comes.This is Clarke's first published novel, and I'm somewhat surprised it didn't have an editor trim it down, but this may very well be due to Rowling's proof that the marketplace can embrace 800 page novels. I look forward to her next, as this novel holds promise for a bright future for her."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I could tell by other reviews that this is one of those books one either loves or hates. I am on the love side. The one thing I did not see mentioned in any of the reviews are the lovely illustrations by Portia Rosenberg which added so much to my reading pleasure. In fact, the copy of the book I bought (from Amazon) turned out to be a First Edition printing, and the entire book is amazingly beautiful, which also added to my pleasure."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just closed the back cover of this book, which I started well over three months ago. I agree with much of what everyone else is saying here; it is enjoyable entirely all the way through, but not until book three does it ever become a \\"page turner,\\" it is absolutely not in the same realm of \\"Harry Potter,\\" and it is oddly more dark and yet more funny than those books. The reason I am bothering to add to almost 300 other reviews is to discuss one aspect of this book. Which is, if you follow along, and read all the footnotes in this book, you come away with the odd sense that you have actually, honestly learned a lot of factual information about 18th century English magic. This is of course, ridiculous, but Suzanna Clarke writes with such authority and confidence (and detail) on the subject that, unlike the Potter books where you come away wishing the world were so, but quite aware it is fantasy, you leave the world of Strange and Norrell, quite convinced that it was indeed so. In this way this book is astoundingly unique. Her writing style, almost a Austen type comedy of manners, works well to make you believe she is just relating a story of everyday life, with all the petty jealousies etc, that people go through. Magic is simply part of the world they live in. You will either love or hate this book, but you should at least try it, and give it a chance to unwind itself for you and leave preconceptions behind."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I started this book with enthusiasm, and had to force myself to finish it. The prose is very good, the characters fully developed, and the situations range from entertaining to outright funny, but...First, it's too specific in genre. You really have to have read a lot of fairy tales to understand many of the references, but if you do understand them, the direction of the plot eventually gets obvious. I was hoping from a departure from the norm, but this isn't it.Second, it's just too long. All the tension is in the first two thirds of the book and the last third is a long winding down.Still, a great first effort. Buy it used, there are sure to be 100s of copies around soon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Disenchanted with Fantasy for the past several years I had begun to despair of finding anything interesting and unique. To be sure, there have been several quite popular novels and series. But most ran to tales more distinctly political intrigues than magical or meandering stories that should have been put to bed long ago - none of which is to my taste. It was one reviewer's characterization of Clarke's style as \\"pitch-perfect Austen\\" that intrigued me enough to purchase, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and am quite fond of them. Having recently finished Clarke's debut novel I can attest that, on the face of it, the reviewer wasn't far off the mark. But if Clarke is a modern Jane Austen she is a more melancholy one.Clarke should be congratulated for such a finely crafted first novel. Her mastery of language and structure allow her to maintain the fiction of a story set and written in the nineteenth century. It is marred somewhat by her choice to \\"misspell\\" - or use a much older spelling - a word or two to maintain the illusion of some age. It had rather the opposite effect on me in that it seemed more like the contrivance of a modern author attempting to lend an antique air to her voice. Nevertheless, this is a minor quibble. A more annoying habit was the constant use of long footnotes. Instead of a few short lines or references we are often treated to footnotes that either take up over three-quarters of the page or run on for several pages! They are a distraction that adds next to nothing to the story itself. The attempt reminded me of Penguin's series of literary classics containing notes explaining terms or ideas likely unknown to modern readers. But they are mercifully short and to the point.The lack of action in Jane Austen's novels is counterbalanced with a nearly perfect choice of when to end the story - just before interest turns into boredom for lack of anything substantial happening. Clarke throws in more action but the story still seems a little long (more than twice the length of an Austen novel). The story builds so slowly that the climax sneaks up and it is almost over before you know it. It turns darker towards the end. Clarke turns Strange, for a time, into a more Poe-like character - sad, insane, dark - than anything you will find in Austen. You might think that someone writing in \\"pitch-perfect Austen\\" would be out of their element in such a setting. But Clarke's imagery and characterization remain strong even as it becomes less Austen-like. The ending felt neither like a resolution or the promise of one. In the end (pun intended) I was dissatisfied. But the journey itself was pleasurable enough to make up for it.Despite criticism the story is very fine indeed, if a little long. It is one of the finest I have read in recent years. If you enjoy Clarke's storytelling you might want to pick up a Jane Austen novel or two."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"beacause all I want to do today (and for the next couple of days), is read this book. I am only on page 103 and I know that I will be staying up tonight to see how far I can get within the story.This novel, is by far, one of the most unusual and well written books I have read in a long time and I read a lot.I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Clarke during a book signing in Oxford, MS and I had told her that I travelled from my home city of Memphis, TN to see her that day. That afternoon was an absolute pleasure!Even if you are not into fantasy, or British historical novels, and into ANY kind of reading, do yourself a favour: get $30, buy this book, get comfortable and read it!Thank you, Ms. Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can't remember when or why I'd purchased this book. It's almost as though the book found me. At first glance, a novel of over 800 pages written in period style may seem like a challenge you don't wish to undertake, but you'd miss out on this truly astounding and, yes, magical story. The story offers surprises, wonderful and rich characters and more humor than I could have anticipated.The setting is England, but not the England we know. This is an England torn in half, ruled by two kings; the mad King George in the south and the long-disappeared Raven King of the north, in whose stead the southern kings rule according to treaty until the Raven King's highly unlikely return. The Raven King ruled with magic for three hundred years and it would seem that magic had disappeared with him, and for the four hundred years since his departure, English magic has faded out of both fashion and effectiveness. Plenty of men consider themselves magicians by way of theoretical study when our story begins, but no one has successfully practiced magic.A Northerner of means named Gilbert Norrell has accumulated as many magical books as he can, buying or outright tricking the volumes out from the hands of the rest of the country. He makes a name for himself with a demonstration of his magic, a demonstration performed in order to discredit a society of magicians and claim their library for his own, and he comes to London intending to offer his talents to the crown so as to return magic to England once more. But Norrell is a small-minded and selfish man lacking the required social graces to make much headway into London society, despite gaining the efforts of two petty gentlemen bent on riding his coattails as long as fashionable. Desperate for attention from the crown, Norrell finds himself backed into a corner when his two gentleman associates promise a neighboring Government Minister that Norrell can bring his young fiance back to life. Norrell does so, but only by making a hasty bargain with a fairy he summons in secret. Norrell's feat succeeds in bringing him the attention of the crown and his services soon prove indispensable.Norrell comes to be regarded as the face and guardian of English magic, but an ill-regarded street magician delivers a prophecy to Norrell, a prophecy about TWO English magicians. Norrell dismisses the prophecy, but some time later, a young gentleman named Jonathan Strange encounters the beggar and purchases a few spells, eventually finding he has a proclivity for magic he hadn't realized.The two magicians differ in every way but in their love for magic; where Norrell researches and researches a spell, Strange is quick to cast the spell and improve it; where Norrell is merely tolerated by society, Strange and his wife are embraced warmly. Strange is at first happy in assuming the role of student to Norrell, but as his talents grow and Norrell's jealousy stews, the war between England and France draws the two men to different fronts, and all the while, the bargain Norrell had made has given the mischievous and brutal fairy all the license he requires to meddle in the lives of those surrounding the two magicians in ways that Norrell and Strange are at once unaware of and unable to repair."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The thing about this book is that it is long. That's it, really. If it were shorter and to the point, the great many negative reviews here would be positive. Most of the people who didn't like this book just grew impatient with it. And I'm not faulting those people; this book is really, really long. It's easy to lose your patience with it.However, everyone has had the experience of reading a truly great book and then being sad when it was over. \\"I wish it had been longer,\\" we think. In the spirit of that, Clarke has written a book that is less about conflicts and stories and more about the very act of story-telling. She has created smart, interesting, and unique characters, put them in a rich, evocative world, and then she's let them go about their business, having funny conversations, dealing cleverly with small problems, and creating and breaking relationships with one another.Although I grew a little annoyed at the start by the rambling style of plotting, once I saw it for what it was -- a sort of bedtime story that your parents just add onto every night so that it might never end -- I began to enjoy it quite a bit. Clarke is a gifted writer, and her world was so well-rounded that even when nothing much seemed to be happening in it, it was still a joy to visit.At its most basic, the story is about two magicians who develop a friendship/rivalry over the state of magic in England. They are (without much realizing it) at odds to the story's biggest antagonist, a deceptively kind and magical spirit known only as the gentleman with the thistledown hair. If the book is to be said to be about anything at all, it is about the consequences and ramifications of this unlikely triangle of magicians. Even so, the ultimate conclusion of this plot is done so hastily and obliquely that Clarke seems openly to announce that it is not really the point of the book.The vivid and archaic tone of voice of the book is quite enrapturing for those who aren't in a hurry to get anywhere, and although the constant footnotes seem unevenly applied (some footnotes seem necessary to understand the story, while others discuss things that barely have any connection at all to the plot), they are almost as entertaining as the book itself. Clarke, it seems, has crammed every magical idea she could come up with into them, including how that magic would fit in the larger world that we more regularly experience (the footnote that details the conflicts between magicians and priests was my favorite). In fact, ironically, I found that it was the magical aspect of the story that bothered me the most.The book treats magic as if it were no less common to people than Latin: something old, once ubiquitous, but no longer in use. Norrell and Strange are responsible for bringing magic back into use, and with it they get church statues to talk as well as foil the forces of Napoleon's army. Unfortunately, magic (much like time travel) can be a tough element to have in a story unless there are clear and recognizable limits to its use. If anything really can happen, then it makes what DOES happen less interesting or at least less at risk. It is never obvious what rules govern the magic that Norrell, Strange, and Mr. Thistledown Hair are utilizing, and so, when they are suddenly able to do something amazing (walk through mirrors) or are suddenly NOT able to do something they could once before (locate people through bowls of water), the reader is asked simply to believe that, yes, suddenly these rules have always existed.It was the same reason I stopped reading HARRY POTTER: writers of magical worlds often seem to have the least work to do in creating conflict or tension. A new rule is introduced, or a magical exception is made to an old one. It seems a little cheap, and if this WERE a story-driven novel, I'm sure this arbitrary wizardry would've dropped my enjoyment of the book. However, being so obviously about the mere joy of fiction, the book only uses these few cheap tricks to keep some semblance of a trajectory to the otherwise static, playground world of the book's various heroes and villains. There are a few satisfying resolves to some of the book's questions, but the end result, really, is just about enjoying those questions for as long as you can."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Intricate, funny, and affirmative. This is a novel for adventure-seekers and home-bodies alike. Interesting commentary on the nature of duty and power."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The biggest strength of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke is that the writing is spectacular, and Clarke obviously did her research. Sometimes, I don't think good writing is stressed enough when it comes to novels, and the author often sacrifices it in order to spend more time on entertainment value and drama. Not so with this book. It is both entertaining, and brilliantly written. Besides that, the plot is incredibly thorough; each character gets his or her time in the spotlight and the end comes together beautifully.However, this book does tend to be a bit tedious. It reads more like a historical narrative than anything else, which sometimes got in the way of me enjoying it. But there are some fun parts having to do with magic that had me laughing out loud. (If a book that deals with magic doesn't have a bit of playfulness in it, it's taking itself far too seriously.) But Clarke doesn't make magicking all fun and games -- she strikes a balance between serious and light-hearted. I appreciated the combination of the hard work (the studying, the danger, and all the effort Norrell and Strange put in) and the fun. Norrell and Strange make stones speak, bring the dead back to life, and wander around thousand-year-old magical roads that can take them anywhere in England or Faerie.This was a perfect book, except for its length and tediousness. A quarter of the way into it, I thought that quite a few chapters and anecdotes could have been cut without making a difference to the rest of the story. There was way too much time spent on some characters (Drawlight, especially), and on describing some events that didn't go anywhere in the end.Still, I consider this worth a read. It won't be for everyone, but lovers of magic, alternate histories, and lengthy books will find it satisfying."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The reviews for this book vary widely and for good reason. This is a book set in 1810-1820 England where magic is being rediscovered. It is also written in a voice and meandering style approriate to the period. The emphasis of the story is on the English manner, personality, ethos, and world-view rather than magic, sorcery, and quests. Magic is in many ways secondary to the rest of the story. This difference in perspective will delight readers of English period stories and frustrate readers of fantasy.While I really enjoyed the book. It is not without fault. It is overly long, and many of the side excursions lend little to the overall story. There are many named characters (at least 40) that pop-up throughout the story. While the language is appropriate to the period, it often seems stilted and somewhat artifical to the modern ear.I suggest you read the first 100 pages. If you are not entranced, put the book down and read something else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I think this book has been unfairly advertised in order to hopefully grab people who enjoyed the Harry Potter books. when I was given this behemoth of a novel to read, I was told I'd like it because \\"its a mix of Harry Potter and Jane Austen.\\" Its an entirely different kind of novel than Harry Potter; and the only connection to a Jane Austen novel would be that its set in old England and uses old English (\\"chuses\\" for example). That said, the writing style is more in line with Jane Austen than some of the modern authors. But, I wouldn't call this book Harry Potter done by Jane Austen. Its also a fairly hard book to get into which is highly different from the pickup and readability of Harry Potter.I don't even want to talk about what the book is about and my recommendation is to not read the book jacket because it basically tells you the entire story. Strange and Norrell tells the story of a magician, Norrell, who wants to bring magic back to England under his own terms. But it doesn't start out like that. It starts out with totally different characters who consider themselves magicians but don't practice. Then it becomes a different novel about Norrell and his personal idealogies...then it involves Strange and tells his whole life history up to this moment before showing his ideologies.Part of the problem with the novel in its early pages is that it has a ton of beginnings. It feels like the story will be about one thing but then introducing someone else gives another beginning to the story. Its filled with too many false starts. It also spends a large portion of the book setting up what will unfold in the last two hundred pages; in fact the majority of the story dictated in the book flap happens in the last half of the novel. Fans of very pickup and read novels will probably be turned off early on. Its a shame because this novel is very rich.It has a lot of subtext involving the time period (1800s) that fans/history buffs of the time period will enjoy. I hate to call it a historical fiction, but it closely resembles this but with a fantastical twist (namely magic). Susanna Clarke spends a good deal of time describing the time period, the setting, the characters, their motivations, etc that you really do get a good feeling for the characters. She does a good job developing characters that will definitely have an idealogical and moral confrontation. Clarke does tend to lean on cliches every now and then, what with the yes-men surrounding Norell and their tireless bickering on who's better. Its handled deftly, but its still cliched at parts.My recommendation is that if you enjoy a quick read (and I don't mean page length) then I would just check this novel out. If you are interested in devoting a good portion of your time to a novel that is thick with description, characterization and a plot that involves a ton of setup and involves a ton of characters that need to be introduced, then this is a good novel for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke has put a different spin on the fantasy novel with JOHNATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL. By using the conceit of treating the novel like a history, with footnotes included, Clarke does a nice job of creating a \\"realistic\\" England that never was; a land where magic had a strong influence on the development of the nation.Mr. Norrell is an unpleasent individual, who having brought practical magic back to a land that treated magic as something to be studied rather than performed, chooses to keep magic to himself and continue as its sole practitioner. Along comes Johnathan Strange, who is everything Norrell is not, even tempered, congenial and in possesion of a sense of humor. At first Strange becomes Norrell's pupil and after a difference of opinion over the future of magic his foe.Behind the scenes a member of Fairie is creating problems that will lead to climactic scenes of magic and a satisfying tying together of the various subplots in this novel. At almost 800 pages the novel does occasionally get bogged down in all the details that Clarke puts in and occasionally the footnotes are of little value, (Ex: Hexenmeister is German for magician. The context easily answered this without a footnote.)but overall this is a fine addition to the world of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It took me several tries to get started with this book (much like the first time I read Dorothy Dunnett's \\"The Game of Kings\\"), but once I got to the first bit of magic, I couldn't put it down.

I enjoyed the leisurely pace, but since so much of the book was not concerned with what turned out to be the main action, when that action was over I didn't really see any reason the book shouldn't ramble on for another four or five hundred pages! I felt that at a certain point the author got tired of it and wanted to wrap it up quickly. The characters and \\"historical\\" incidents are fascinating and I wouldn't mind a sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What a book! It took me a little bit to really get into the story, but then I was fascinated. It is a wonderful story, and its really more than just a story. It is a whole alternate history of England with magic. Ms. Clarke has crafted an entire world that is just fascinating. She provides plenty of detail about all the characters, sometimes seeming like the book is wandering off into another story, but I think that is just part of its charm. I was kept guessing throughout about what would happen and who was evil and who was good. I could read a chapter and savor it for a long time before moving on. It was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Most of the reviews I've seen complain that its tedious and boring and a triumph of marketing.

I feel the truth lies in the middle. The novel is not great and groundbreaking, nor is it a terrible piece of fiction. About half of the reviewers who give this work 1 star state they did not read the entire novel. I find such reviews worthless. Half a movie or half a painting is as inadequate a review as half a book.This novel is not typical modern fantasy. It is not action packed or fast paced. It is not shocking in its violence. A reader who's palate is completely satisfied by orcs and elves fighting their way across a strange landscape will be bored here. If you require the harsh worlds of Glenn Cook or George Martin to be engaged, you will find yourself wandering in this landscape. This novel is subtle and well written. The prose and settings captures the imagination.That being said the book is long and there were substantial portions of the story where I had no feel for where the book was going. I dont require swordfights and damsels in distress to keep my attention, but this novel frequently lacked enough conflict and strain to keep me interested. I have heard this novel compared to Dickens. Perhaps the setting and some of the prose are similar, but one chapter of Dickens contains more engagement in the story than this entire novel. By the end of the novel, I had only minimal interest in the fates of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell. After 782 pages of characterization, I felt I should have cared more. I recognize and appreciate the moral ambiguity of the two protagonists. I dont require black and white characters to cheer for them. But it is far easier to care for Martin's Tyrion Lannister or Abercombie's Glotka, with all their disgusting and impish ways, than it is for either of these characters.In the end, this novel is very different from typical fantasy. Different does not equal genius or groudbreaking. Different does not equal boring drivel either. The refreshment of seeing a new story arch in a regonizable world was tempered with the lack of engagement in the story and characters.I think its worth reading for fantasy enthusiasts with a broad palate looking for something new and fans of Dickensonian era historical fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a gem of a book, written in the style of Victorian fiction but with modern sensibilities and literary references. Ostensibly the story of Mr. Norrell, the first practicing magician to emerge in centuries, and his apprentice/rival, the magical prodigy Jonathan Strange. Their story spans the book from their first meeting to their friendship, rivarly and beyond. Napoleonic Warfare and English politics are both equally explored.However, the real gem of the book is its extensive footnotes. Scattered liberally throughout the book, these notes make references to the magical history of England, as well as foreshadowing and commenting upon the events of the story. Some of the footnotes refer to the future of the characters long after the story ends, and others make references to the various disputes among historians on the accuracy of the story of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.The book moves slowly, spending a large amount of time creating a compelling world at the expense of the story, but it picks up quite a head of steam by the last third. It is full of well drawn characters who stick with you long after the book is over, making one wish to continue the friendship one feels with such colorful people as Childermass or the gentleman with the Thisledown hair.While the style might seem overly arch in imitating Victorian prose, Clarke does occasionally let herself have some leeway and when she does she proves that she has a real gift for poetic prose. Hopefully she finds a way to tap the magic again without simply drawing from the same well."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is founded on the same principle as the Harry Potter series - magic really exists, it is simply hidden from the experiences of the normal person. There is little else that is similar in tone or style between this book and the Potter series (except that both are thoroughly English in nature). Instead, the book is most like Jane Austin in both content and tone - it is sometimes very funny, is firmly rooted in the stratified English social structure, and its plot is simply a skeleton upon which to build a dense and enjoyable world. We grow to love the characters and take an almost personal stake in their trials and tribulations.The plot: Mr. Norrell is the first person in 400 years to successfully perform a magic spell. Unfortunately, he is bookish and extremely jealous; for example, he buys every copy of every magical book written in English and hoards them to himself. Along comes the prodigy Jonathan Strange, who becomes the second practicing magician. Instead of trying to destroy him like all his previous rivals, Mr. Norrell actually takes him under his wing to teach him magic. The collaboration is extremely beneficial for England and for the two magicians. Strange accompanies Wellington to Spain and later Waterloo to fight Napoleon. Norrell sets up a magic coastal zone into which no enemy ships can pass (and moderates the weather within it for English ships). But the two have a falling out - used to the independence granted him by Wellington, Strange chafes at what he sees as artificial restraints put on him by Norrell. The central issue: the magical world of Faerie and its magical Fairy inhabitants. Strange wants to call forth Fairy servants and helpers like the old Magicians of England. Norrell knows they cannot be trusted (based on a personal experience that he must keep hidden from the world).To give any more of the plot away would be a disservice to the book (besides what I've said already covers about 500 pages of this 1000-page paperback edition). Besides, the plot is not the point. Instead we are treated to a rich and colourful world of alternate-Napoleonic Europe. Real characters are seamlessly interwoven into the story, including the Duke of Wellington, King George III, and the poet Byron. We have people of low birth, servants, free gentlemen, and nobility all trapped by their training and upbringings. Ultimately, this is the genius of Clarke's novel - everyone acts exactly as they should, and the trials suffered by the main characters are exactly what they deserve because of their particular personal foibles. Shakespeare himself would be pleased, no doubt.It is not a fast-reading book. It is not an action-packed book. Neither is the Lord of the Rings series, but that hasn't stopped millions from reading it, nor should it stop you from reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It is a fun and well-crafted book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I haven't read a book in a long time that was as delightfully original as this one. Magic isn't just waving a wand and crying out some magic words. It is at times as fresh and beautiful like an English garden, such as a street in London transforming into a Faerie forest, and the little box \\"the color of Heartache,\\" and at times fascinatingly dark and macabre, like a bottomless Tower of Eternal Darkness following the magician, or the Faerie's nonchalant murders, like when he was extracting the essence of a kiss from women's lips.The author also added depth to the background of the story with all her footnotes which I found to be interesting.All in all a GREAT book, although it may take a bit to settle into it. For me I loved it from beginning to end. Witty and original all the way through. You might be bored because you don't enjoy the Jane Austen/Bronte Sisters style of 19th century English language, but never because the author's ideas were unoriginal."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I reserved this book from my local library based on a staff recommendation on their website. When the staffperson brought it out and it hit the desk with a resounding thud, I looked at the sheer thickness of it and thought \\"I absolutely hate to abandon a book that I've started, so this had better be as good as it sounded.\\" One hundred pages into it, I was rejoicing that it was so long, because it would last that much longer. Compared to the Happy Meal of my title, this is a long elaborate dinner with many courses, served with people who become good friends and who weave a spell with their dinner stories.But, as evidenced by other reviews here from people who had trouble with its style, it suffers from the kind of misperception that also spoiled the appetite of some mystery readers when they picked up Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The latter was not a mystery book in any classic sense; it wove a spell that pulled you into a time and place and it did so without being true to a particular genre.Even with the intrinsic presence of fantasy driving the plot, Strange/Norrell is much more a \\"classic\\" historical novel, character study and comedy of manners, footnoted with the kind of details with which Tolkien filled \\"The Silmarillion.\\" The fantasy is used to enrich it and to support several themes: Large ones such as the viral effects of advanced technology (substitute \\"genetic research\\" for \\"English Magic\\") or personal ones, such as the futility of dealing with one's worst nightmares by locking them up (oh, but just a peek won't hurt, unlocking it just this once can't hurt, oh yes). So I can say this, echoing other comments: If you are looking for Sword & Sorcery and lots of action, this isn't your cup of tea. But if you want something with substantial characters, wickedly dry humor, some existentialist horror, and scenes that will hang in your memory for months afterward, try this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is an odd book. It is 782 pages and, given the plot, should be about 150-200 pages, tops. In places, particularly at the the beginning, the author imitates the style and/or idiom of various 18th century writers. Towards the end, she appears to drop the pretense and just gets on with the narrative. In some places, imitative or not, the writing is quite good; at other times, it is merely servicable. The influences on the author apparently include Dickens, Thackeray, Austen, Stevenson and -- contemporary horror movies. In places, the dry humor and/or style references are amusing, at other times annoying or boring. After all, Dickens wrote in serial form and padded his works, but he was Dickens, and we don't quibble much now. It doesn't work for contemporary writers to imitate his excessiveness, which Ms. Clarke does.The faux-scholarly footnotes are a very bad idea. Particularly at the beginning, most particularly in the first chapter, the footnotes are a severe trial to one's patience, seeming like a very stupid addition to the story, having precious little to do with the actual plot. Any high school slacker could make up most of the footnotes, and generally they are not very amusing. The attention to detail with the inclusion of faux-scholarly old fairy stories in the footnotes is all the more bizarre when one considers that the author does not narrate or conclude her story in a scholarly fashion or even resolve her narrative satisfactorily. She raises a few questions about the fate of some characters, but doesn't honor the reader with so much as a footnote about the fate of the characters essential to her main plot.The first third of the book is boring, for the most part, because it is about Mr. Norrell. And, as many of her characters point out, Mr. Norrell is boring. When Mr. Strange enters the picture, things pick up. His development as a person and as a magician is quite interesting, but that's past the point where many readers will be sticking around to enjoy it. Moreover, the ending is disappointing and murky.If I were Ms. Clarke's editor, I would have insisted she rewrite the first chapter (many readers won't be tempted to go past it) and the last. When adopting the conceit of writing a faux-scholarly piece of fiction, no matter how unconvincing, the author would best serve the readers by concluding the story in accord with that conceit."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the most excellent books I have ever read. Snobs will not like it. People who only like fast paced, Television style entertainment will not like it. If you like brilliant use of words for their own sake you will like this novel. this book is a wonderful story, with wonderful characters. long time English professors will not like it. New English majors will not like it. People who are entertained by anything on network televsion will not like it. This is a book made for graduate students of English and anyone who loves language. You can not come to it with prejudices."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's a sad state of affairs that a writer who so obviously loves language, the flow and form and rhythm and meter of it (19th century formality in particular) will undoubtedly find many negative reactions to her fine book.Too few people genuinely read nowadays. I grant you, many will perhaps ignore a health warning upon their cigarette packet, or pass a fleeting glance over ingredient lists to spot those pernicious carbs a-lurking. Perhaps one has even picked up a J. K. Rowling novel (which I can assure you will never ever find its way onto the recommended reading list of any reasonable school. Strange & Norrell is very likely to do so).This is not 'reading', no more than using a camcorder to forever commit ones relatives gyrating drunkenly at a wedding makes one a 'director', 'cameraman', or 'film-maker'.Ms. Clarke loves language. She loves stories. She loves worlds. There are more good examples of these latter two within \\"Strange & Norrell\\" than you will find in most writer's lifetime careers. Those who choose to ignore the footnotes are bypassing little gems of brilliance: fairytales of true originality, historical references which lend Clarke's Georgian England an even more convincing tie with our own, and even simple cross-references that remind you that, above all, this writer crafts her work with conviction.Once the book reaches its popular apogee, it will be interesting to see how many people attempt to justify its presence on their shelves by insisting that it is somehow 'not really fantasy', that it is in some way more respectable than that noun would suggest. They will use terms like: 'Alternative History', 'Fantastical Reality', or that old chestnut: 'Speculative Fiction'.I for one believe that the fairies and magicians in this book give lie to this notion.Embrace this book for what it is. This is the finest fantasy creation you are likely to read for a very, very long time.If by 'Liking fantasy' you mean that you have watched 'The Two Towers' with a bargain bucket of the Colonel's chicken spreading a grease stain over your pants like a meaty glacier, guffawing at the hilarious dwarf-tossing references, or that you insist upon the presence of Elves in your literature, then please move along. There is nothing to see here, and most would not appreciate you cluttering up the view."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"My fiance and I love to read to each other. This novel was one of the best readaloud books we have read. The careful descriptions and slowness of the pacing perfectly suited us. We loved the wit of the author - her quick moves from profound to trivial were delightful. We have been describing it as Jane Austen meets Harry Potter - wonderful period descriptions of the English upper classes of the early 19th century, with magic overlayed.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":". . . that gives an average of 3 stars.This really could have been two books. The first would end at the point where Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo. But, if I had read that 1st book, I probably would not have gone on to read the second because the 1st was so boring. Interestingly, most of the descriptions that I've read of the book really only address what happens in the first half of the book. They talk about how the two magicians go out and help England fight the forces of Napoleon using magic. Quite frankly, this part of the book is unbelievably boring and the plot seems to go nowhere. In fact, the whole thing with Napeleon has nothing to do with the last half of the book other than to have introduced a couple of characters whose background could have been explained in one sentence. It also gives a reason for the two magicians notoriety. All of that could have been done in a chapter or two. The first half of the book is also where we become painfully acquainted with Ms. Clarke's annoying footnotes. There is one of these disgusting things that runs the major portion of 4 pages in tiny mice type. If all this information is truly important to the story line, then put it in the text! As one reviewer suggested, you get the feeling that she just couldn't figure out how to work it into the text, so she just stuck it in the footnote. I suppose that she feels that it give the book a feeling of being an historical work. No, it's irritating! I also read that it took Ms. Clarke 10 years to write this 800+ page beast. To me it's almost like she's learning to write during the course of the book. By about mid-way, she figures out how to do it. It's too bad that a good editor or publisher didn't convince her to reduce the 1st half of the book to a few background paragraphs explaining how Mr. Norrell \\"came out of the closet\\" so to speak, how he met Jonathan Strange, and how they rose to fame in England.But once the war is over and Strange and Norrell part company because they have vastly different ideas on how the future of magic should unfold in England is where the real and good book begins. Here we start exploring the motivations behind the characters, their good and bad points, what makes them tick. Here I actually started loosing myself in the rich descriptions of Venice and the strange old woman who holds the secret of how a mere mortal can gain access to Farie. Here the novel actually starts to seem magical. Although the annoying footnotes continue, they seem to shrink in size.One thing that I feel I must address is the claim that this is an \\"adult\\" Harry Potter. I know I'm not the first to say this, but it's not. Harry Potter has the major underlying theme of good vs. evil. In this book, there is no monolithic struggle between good and evil. Each character is painted in shades of grey, each with a mixture of good and evil making a complex whole. This book is more about the interaction between these people and their internal struggles with themselves.It's quite obvious at the end of the book that Ms. Clarke is leaving it open so that if she feels like it she can write a sequel. I'll probably read it, but I sincerely hope it will read more like the last half of this book than the first half.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found this book to be incredibly ambitious, but in the end, it just didn't satisfy me. I appreciated the depth of story, but I admit I got tired of reading footnotes, especially just to get referred to other footnotes. It broke my concentration. To suggest the world created by Clarke can step to Tolkein in term of depth and breadth is ludicrous. The constant \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" marketing is totally irrelevant, just because they are both about magic doesn't mean anything. I guess I had very high hopes and just got disappointed. At least it's long enough to last for a while, and very well written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There is no redeeming qualities in any of the characters, and there is not much of a story line. The ritual of magic did not make any sense. I think this book is a book that magically bewitches its readers into thinking that it is a great story telling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"One of the most boring books I have read in a long time. The characters are very shallow in design, with quite a clinical approach to their descriptions. They are equally stand-offish which makes it hard to relate to the characters or feel for them.The book is written in giant paragraphs. It makes it hard to follow dialog when they are all smashed into the same paragraph. With the old British way of speaking, and the unusual names, it is hard to follow the conversations.I know people who have loved the book, and one of them actually recommended it to me since we have similar taste in books. This was not one of them. Give it a shot if you really feel the need, but if you don't like the first 30 pages, the rest of the book is the same."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"From start to finish, Susanna Clarke's fantastical novel is rich and captivating. The characters of Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell are complex but nonetheless likable. An extraordinary, albeit lengthly, book that is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing. The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up. However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book. While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume. Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I read the first chapter in the bookstore aisle, fell in love with Ms. Clarke's style, and couldn't wait to spend the weekend lost in her world.Unlike most on here, who found the first 350 pages difficult and the end exiciting, I found the first section to be great fun. It was somewhere around the second third of the book that Ms. Clarke abandons her witty language, and without that I realized that I could care less about the plot or the characters.I never did slog my way through to the final rumored-to-be-action-packed final 150 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was totally fascinated by the world the author creates and couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.

Reading the entirety of this book is like starting a bicycle race on asphalt, then being handed a pogo stick and pointed at a bog. If you tough it out, then eventually you end up back on the asphalt, cruising to a delightful finish.Susanna Clarke is a woman with enormous talent, imagination, wonderful attention to detail and an excellent voice for parroting the masters of Old School. However, she needs to get the lead out - red, to be exact- and learn how to edit."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"No doubt anyone picking up this book will want to compare it to the Potter series, but this book was written for young adults and adults; not kids. that being said, this story is not one that can be classified as an outrageous fantasy. Instead it is a wonderfully written tale that tries to insert a magical air to a certin period of time in England's history. I was amazed to find that this was Clarke's first published book as it was well written with a very nice flow to it, (although it does bog down every now and then when she discusses the particulars of magic, but this is done deliberately and it also helps define the charaters of some of the participants in the story). The writing style has been compared to that of Austen's and I would agree. The biggest difference is the lack of ease in the conversational dialogue, but the narrative is wonderful, and it more than makes up for it. This is clearly a must read for anyone who loves adventure stories, as well as lovers of good books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"...was what Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange was for me; with the most vivid fantastical elements, combined with spell-binding prose. witty characters, and the most subtly addictive plot-line. I can never thank Susanna Clarke enough for the 14 hours of enchantment she has painted in my life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am really suspicious of professional reviewers now. This thing received so many absolutely glowing reviews I was stunned how dull this 3 pound tomb was. Take for example Neil Gaiman's review on the dust jacket that claimed the book was the best piece of fantasy fiction in the last 70 years. Normally I recoil when I see something proclaimed as the best in the world, you know like that pizza place down the street (every towns got one) that has 'best pizza in the city' or whatever. It never is, in fact it's usually horrible. And this book is no exception to the rule. To be honest, I've had better luck finding good books through the Amazon review system as there is usually a good mix of good and bad. I read through both until I stumble across someone that sounds reasonable and with a pov like mine, then I'll take their advice. With this book though, I relied on professionals. They suck.I will preface my critique by saying that I read fiction to be entertained, stimulated, and engaged. I do not read fiction for any other reason. As such, I don't read books like Canterbury Tales or Ulysses as I'm pretty sure it would be too much like work. Don't get me wrong, I like challenging (some would say boring) works, but I can only justify spending that kind of effort on nonfiction works. Fiction for me is supposed to be entertaining.So back to this work...First it's length is wholly unjustified. It is almost 800 pages and it could easily have been reduced to 1/8 that size without losing anything. Apparently she modeled he style on people like Dickens and Austen. Well, I don't know about Austen, but Dickens got paid by the word, so his works are incredibly padded and is a bad role model for authors, imo. Interminable descriptions of things that have little to no bearing on the story, boring characters that serve no purpose, rambling subplots, etc etc are all hallmarks of the $/word author, and that's how Clarke writes.The whole book is pleasant and genteel. Again, this probably comes down to some-kind of attempt at imitation of some 19th century writers. But from the 19th century books I've read, the authors could still produce tension and emotion, Clarke does not. Everything that happens in the book is written in such a way as to imbue it with as much impact as easy listening radio. Oh, somebody got shot? Pip pip, tally ho, thats ok. Another aspect of this style is the complete absence of tension or suspense. The plot has gone through some-kind of niceness filter that makes it as much fun as listening to the queen.Next up: the characters. The characters in this book are stiff 2 dimensionally non-developing caricatures of people. There is nothing to like or identify with any of them. I didn't want to spend one more second with any of them by the time the book ended. And their motivations are almost always inexplicable. It's not only the crazy ones that make no sense.Finally, the ending. First there is a giant plot hole involving the rules of magic as they operate in Clarke's world, and the big curse Thistlehead places on a couple of people. I wont say anymore in case I spoil things. But that aside, this is one of those books that doesn't satisfy. The ending is like the rest of the book, pointless, dull, and unsatisfying.So anyway, if you like hugely overwritten books with stiff cardboard characters with zero development and boring suspense-less plots but with really good PR, this is your book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This review refers to the mass market paperback edition.

She is obviously very educated (a ton of research went into this book)and has wonderful descriptive abilities. She can also be quite humorous.Unfortunately, the book did not move quickly enough to maintain my interest.

Over a hundred pages into the thing and I still don't feel any connection to the characters or even to the storyline; Mr. Norrell is regrettably like Niles on \\"Frasier\\" without the exaggerated humor and the situations are so plodding that even when the \\"magic\\" happens (e.g., speaking statues, ghost ships), it's not worth the wait.I don't mind waiting in general and I have more than the average person's appreciation of a story slowly told; I'm reading Austen's _Emma_ and enjoying the liveliness and characterization so much more and I'm the only person I know who ever bothered tackling the unabridged version of Richardson's _Clarissa_, but this story has baffled me. It's amazing how someone can take what could potentially be a wonderful idea and sap all the interest out of it by weighing it down with meaningless pedantry (the footnotes and \\"scholarship\\" -- I find them mildly annoying in real books about real subjects and even more so when they're about a fictional scholarly discipline that never existed).Honestly, I wish I liked this book, and by all rights, I should.

Nothing happens.I was most uncharitable when donated this book to the Y for their quarterly book sale. God forgive me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I tried to read this book. Really, I did. But I couldn't choke it down. Even after about 300 pages into it, I had to abandon ship. In concept, it should be a great book. Unfortunately, it is slow slow slow... Plus there are volumes and volumes of footnotes to the story that are completely superflous and have absolutely no bearing on the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is long...and it is written to mimic speech of the early 19th century, but it is really a fun read. It's not Harry Potter and that's just fine, it's still a nice little trip far away from reality. I love the author's style, the characters are exasperatingly real and the story is great.

I have no idea why people would complain about this book.

I enjoy a good fantasy novel, and bought into the \\"buzz\\" surrouding JS.Luckily, I grabbed a copy from the library, and didn't purchase it.It boils down to this:1) JS fails as a standard pot-boiler fantasy/adventure novel. That's fine. So does, for example, Mervyn Peake's \\"Ghormenghast.\\" It's not necessary for every novel to grip you by the lapels and drag you on a wild ride.2) JS fails as a literary work of art. That's ok, so do lots of fun and interesting novels. So does the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.3) JS fails as a historical novel. The \\"period\\" evoked is done so in an amateurish way; in some ways, it's not even up to Regency romance novel standards. But that's ok, not every book manages this trick very well.4) JS fails regards structure: it's not just a shaggy dog, it's a dog that's never been within 10 miles of a scissor. But that's ok, sometimes lack of structure opens up interesting narrative possibilities.5) JS fails to be interesting stylistically. The prose is very straightward and dull. This is pretty bad, but can be overlooked.6) JS isn't that funny. Very unfunny, actually. This is a serious strike against it.It's ok if a novel lacks 1 or 2 of the above. 3 or 4 is not so great. Sadly, JS lacks all 6.To sum, JS simply fails to qualify as a good or interesting or even mildly gripping novel.Take, for example, the very few and awkward uses of \\"archaic\\" words sprinlked through the text. Or old spellings, such as \\"surprise\\" rendered \\"surprize\\". That's fine, in moderation, or when done well. But honestly, Susanna Clark uses the word \\"surprize\\" on almost every page. I'm not kidding you. Go back and read the first 100 pages of the novel. Count the number of \\"surprizes\\" that stick up and poke you in the eye. It's an astonishingly amateurish display.I'm amazed that anyone's charmed by the \\"footnote\\" ploy. It's a very old trick at this point (entire novels have been written consisting of nothing more than a footnote in a footnote in a footnote, etc. Refer also to Nabokov's 'Pale Fire' for another take on it.) I found the footnotes:1) Not interesting or funny enough to warrant their inclusion,2) Not adding to the plot, mystery, sense of wonder, etc. of the overall novel.3) Irritating after a while.For those people comparing Susanna Clarke to any of the great writers of old, Austin or Eliot or whomever -- it's balderdash. Dickens infuses more life into a character in one page than Clarke manages in 700. There are more out-loud laughs in a paragraph of Austin than a chapter by Clarke. There is no emotional connection betwen the characters, between the reader and the characters -- nothing. It's empty.Once the loud buzz dies down, I think people will end up shoving this book off the nightstand and into a box, soon to be shuffled off to the attic or garage.I'm sorry to put it in these terms. I came to the novel with great hopes and expectations and plenty of good will. I now regret the time I've wasted reading it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's debut novel begins promisingly, but by about page 500 the book is starting to bog down beneath its own weight. The footnotes have by now worn on the reader's patience (they're either needlessly discursive or else pointless in their obviousness), and the dead-end plot lines are mounting (cf. the backstory of Jeremy and Strange's father, the old lady with the cats, and whatever happened to Lady Pole and Sir Walter?) After nearly 800 pages, one would think that Clarke could reward her readers (who have by now forgiven her meanderings and heavyhandedness) with some resolution. No. There is no resolution and the ending is far too 'cinematic' (and I mean that in the worst way possible). The possibility of a regrettable sequel is left wide open (though I won't bother reading it)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To all my fellow adult Harry Potter lovers and those who have enjoyed science fiction and fantasy for many years - I, like you, was all set to love this book. I had read a review of it prior to its release, and an interview with the author. I snapped it up the first time I was in the book store and settled down to read it. I am not at all daunted by the 800 page length, either. However, sad to say, folks, that I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as I thought I would. I never liked the Mr. Norrell character - there was nothing sympathetic about him for me to care about, so the first 100 pages or more, which were all about him, were very slow for me. I enjoyed the Jonathan Strange character quite a bit more, but his adventures were interspersed with frustrating moments with Mr. Norell. I usually read every single word of a book, but I found myself skipping paragraphs after about page 400 or so. The magic in the book was fairly enjoyable, but somehow, as much as the author tried to make the magic real, it just didn't connect for me the way other books about magic have for me. Sorry, folks, this one missed its mark as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There was a lot of fuss over this book when it first came out. The author asserted that it took her 10 years to write this book. It was touted as Harry Potter for adults, with the publisher so sure of success that they paid the author a 1 million advance. This was absolutely record breaking for a debut novel. Professional reviewers raved about the book. It won the 2005 Hugo award for best novel, and the 2004 Man Booker Award.So, curious, I picked up my own copy. I suppose, if I hadn't gone in with any expectations and more patience, I might have liked the book more. It is undoubtedly well-written, though not lyrical. More literary than a genre novel. However, I am a product of my television-reared generation... which means I have a very short attention span. This book definitely failed the 15 minute test (i.e. something must happen every 15 minutes or I get bored). I don't actually mean 15 minutes, though I do read pretty quickly... I'm just exaggerating to tell you that the pacing of the book is really slow.In fact, I found it so ploddingly slow that I gave up about 1/3 of the way through and have never picked it back up again. I've heard from others that it is quite rewarding if you can make yourself stick to it. However, I don't feel like I should have to make myself stick to something that I'm supposed to be doing for entertainment. Thus, the low scoring review. For those of you who are more inclined to work for your entertainment than just be entertained, have at it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm not sure why this book is so awfully transcribed.

He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"The ultimate novel. An epic on English magic which is first and foremost, English, and secondly, magical.Extremely well-written, well-researched, and most of all, humorous. Susanna Clarke writes with the breadth of Tolkien, but the characters she creates are utterly believable, despite their uniqueness. Her prose rivals Lewis, elaborate and luxurious, yet an effortless read. Her footnotes are given much importance, and at times a page has nothing but. It makes re-reading an original experience. They contain side stories that are, in themselves, potential novels.An example:\\"Richard Chaston (1620-95). Chaston wrote that men and fairies both contain within them a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. In men reason is strong and magic is weak. With fairies it is the other way around: magic comes very naturally to them, but by human standards they are barely sane.\\"Another favorite:\\"A thought appeared to strike him.\\"Would you like to be Archbishop of Canterbury tomorrow, Stephen?\\"\\"No thank you, sir.\\"\\"Are you quite certain?

Five stars? Susanna Clarke, is that you?This audiobook (or book if you read the print version) will break your heart. 32 hours of rambling tedium. Very little character development, not much internal consistency, and perhaps most damning of all, no action whatsover. Even the greatest \\"reveal\\" of the story is an offhand mention - no understanding of how it even happened.It was essentially a 100 page story spread out over 700 or so pages (over 30 hours).

There is no one distinct story. There are several places it could have ended.My wish is that this was a series rather than a single book. With over 300,000 words there's plenty here for three books.I'm amazed that Clarke managed to find an agent, much less a publisher. But, I see all those different editions and so many reviews, it must be okay.Being a writer and knowing a lot of writers, we'd like to know what spell Clarke used to get this first \\"novel\\" published.

However, the delightfully drawn characters, particularly subsidiary characters like Arabella and Drawlight, kept you feeling you were there with them so by half way through the book I'd say to myself \\"I really should read a book, it's been awhile since I read a book?\\", forgetting that I already was. Don't know whether this is a good thing or not. however, if you have been struggling to reconcile your love for both Harry Potter and Mr Darcy, i suggest a good dose of Strangites and Norrellites. 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Firstly, I should point out that I listened to the wonderful Audible.com audio verion of this book on my iPod. Despite enjoying it thoroughly, I probably would not have finished the book by reading (I am a ponderously slow reader.) I am sure that many will find the book not to their liking, as a number of reviews on here indicate.I can't argue with anyone's taste, though I found it comical when Stephanie A Weiss wrote \\"most people have been afraid to say \\"it's awful\\" out of fear that they just didn't understand what made it wonderful. I have no such fear.\\" HOW BRAVE of you Stephanie A Weiss!Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell does develop rather on the slow side, and most of the characters do not fall neatly into the hero/heroine category. Some people may find this hard to deal with, especially if they are only accustomed to overly developed senses of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in their stories. I find this to be one of the more interesting aspects of the book.Susanna Clarke also tends to go off on tangents, which might turn off some readers. But if you are open to it, and have the patience, these asides add immeasurable depth and color to her universe.At any rate, if you are inclined to listen to Simon Prebble's reading on audio, I would HIGHLY reccommend it. Otherwise, I can only say that you will -probably- enjoy this book if you think you will ahead of time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I enjoyed the book beginning to end. Responding to some of the comments I've seen, comparing S&N to Harry Potter is like comparing Spaghettios (Potter) to fine Italian food (S&N) - both are tasty, but your expectations are vastly different! S&N is not an action/adventure thrill-ride of a novel, but the characters are interesting and the story is always twisting. Susanna Clarke has an incredible imagination. Nothing in the novel was predictable. If you find the footnotes a bore, DON'T READ THEM! They're footnotes because they're optional to the story. However, I found some of the author's most imaginative work in them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke spent a decade on this long fantasy novel (782 pages) set in England during the its struggle against Napoleon(1806-1817). Well-written with a dash of humor, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a Harry Potter-like book for adults. The illustrations by Portia Rosenberg are wonderful.Image an England where magic has faded away only to be revived by the two title characters who are a study in contrasts. Magic, like life, has consequences for choices made, even well-intended choices. Mixing in exploits against the French with stories of the Faerie & the Raven King, Ms Clarke has created a masterpiece. Every character is fully-realized and the plot flows without being tedious.If you enjoy fantasy novels, you will read this book straight thru and regret when it comes to an end. Do not skip her faux-scholarly footnotes where her gift for dead-pan humor shines. If you enjoy this novel, check out Lisa Goldstein's \\"Strange Devices of the Sun and the Moon\\" (1993) which is set in the England of 1590 with playwright Christopher Marlowe and the Faerie Queen."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I remember when I purchased Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell as soon as it came out, after reading some glowing reviews, but wondering if I would ever read it. Not just the length but also the subject matter: magicians in England. How could that be anything other than done to death? Much later, I actually started reading the book and was very surprised by what I found.First of all, the writing style is amazing. The novel has a sense of being effortless in the writing. This, I have learned from my own unfortunate experiences, is very hard to do. I have a sense from the narrative that it was more discovered in its completed form than painstakingly crafted. This is the rare mark of a great writer. The author's style is clear and crisp and because of this, the pace of the novel is brisk and the pages fly by.Second, the characters came alive quickly after being introduced. I found them all to be fully fleshed out and believable and I have a strong mental image of what each one looks like. I cared about them also, as the author infused each with a degree of humanity and complexity that made me want to explore further as they grew into the story.I'm afraid I don't have much in the way of negative criticism, other than the footnotes, which I realize were there for some comic effect (as was much of the novel). But I have always had an attention span problem with footnotes, and they are also harder for me to read so I had to hike the heavy volume on a different angle so my bleary eyes could focus. Quite hard on the thumbs, actually.Finally, I was in awe of the satirical aspect of the novel. The portrayal of London society in the 1810s was hysterical. For me, the novel was very much of a social commentary, but not in the style of Dickens (as many have compared it to because, I think, of the size). I thought it had qualities of Dickens, especially with some of the more fantastic passages. But the insightful dialogue and portrayals of social interactions of thecharacters reminded me more of Jane Austen. I have always found something cartoon-like about Dickens (sorry!), which is exactly what I did not find in this novel. Instead, the characters here seemed engaged in highly probable conversations, have highly probable human reactions.Do yourself a favor, have a look. As a converted skeptic, I think you will be pleased. And soon you can get the hopefully lighter version in paperback!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The only difficulty with this book is it's nearly impossible to recommend to friends, if only because any attempt to pin it down ends up sounding asinine, ridiculous, and vague.Your first attempt might be (don't worry, no spoilers, this is all in the first few chapters) \\"Well, it's this fantastic book about two English magicians during the time of the Napoleonic Wars who unwittingly become enmeshed in the machinations of a mad, cruel, and powerful fairy...\\"Then, met with raised eyebrows, you try again... \\"What it's really about is an alternative history of England where during the late middle ages Northern England was governed by magic; only it's written in a 'Tale of Two Cities' sort of style where late-nineteenth century grammar and style evoke events in the early nineteenth century...\\"But this is even less successful, so you finally just give up and say, look, read the darned thing.Why should you? At the very least, the Dickensian ability with language. There's a paragraph near the beginning where the character of John Childermass is introduced that's just about one of the loveliest pieces of English writing you'll ever run into. It'll give you chills, I promise.But more importantly, it's an adult-oreinted rumination on everything you've always known was frightening, cruel, and beautiful about the dark, strange places in the world. I haven't read anything that made me feel this good in a long time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Embedded in the title is a delightful foreshadowing of what is to come in Ms. Clarke's extraordinary debut novel: we are in very strange territory indeed. But this strangeness is treated so matter-of-factly that any disorientation we might be experiencing, any intellectual vertigo, must be a result of our simply missing the author's wavelength. To get onto that wavelength, however, requires only that we persevere, keep reading, and that, with our progress deeper in, as the fat block of pages in our right hand diminishes and become a fact block of pages in the left, we inch into a strange-but-familiar world that recalls - it slowly dawned on me - the matter-of-fact strangeness of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie, and other writers toiling in the domain of \\"magical realism.\\" Ms. Clarke does not call attention to the effect she is working; she simply writes, on and on, in a style that alternates between a straightforward, almost reportorial, mid-19th century descriptive clarity reminiscent of Wilkie Collins and an inventive and lapidary beauty that is wholly unique in its power of \\"observation\\" - for it observes things that in our much less strange world cannot be - and strikingly curlicued descriptions of the marvelous. The great possess such powers as Ms. Clarke displays and, in fairness, we must admit that Ms. Clarke dons greatness here.One has to marvel at the patience Ms. Clarke exhibits. She will not be rushed into her story (and, as a result, many impatient readers and reviewers have flung the dictionary-sized tome across the room, never to be lifted again). It is a pity that our reading culture no longer supports the serialization of long, segmented novels - except for a rare Tom Wolfe-Rolling Stone collaboration - to be consumed in bite-sized pieces. I'm surmising that readers who couldn't get through the first 200 pages would tool along nicely at a 40-page-per-month clip.And what would such patience gain? Above all, Ms. Clarke's marvelous, richly drawn and detailed characters. And apart from those of the title, whom I found wholly convincing, she has created the formidable John Uskglass, the \\"Raven King\\" who ruled the north of England for 300 during the Middle Ages and who has, in Ms. Clarke's hands, the sheer physical quiddity of a historical personality, whose name sent me and countless others off on library and Google searches for the real Uskglass . . . only to come up empty. He is purely Ms. Clarke's invention, and one more reason to be in her debt.And she has invented so much more than she had space to use. Hence the footnotes, and more footnotes, and still more, which one can either love or hate but will skip at peril to their own pleasure. Because Ms. Clarke is a fabulously funny spinner of yarns, and many of her funniest stories are loaded into long footnotes that sometimes stretch across several pages. The hilarious \\"Story of the Master of Nottingham's Daughter,\\" which begins on p. 240, could have been pulled directly out of Grimm, or an otherworldly Chaucer, but is found in an immense four-page footnote I'll bet many readers passed on. In truth, I found the footnotes exasperating; I read them all; but like the copious footnotes in Gibbon, you don't really need them - that's why they're footnotes. But they create the cumulative effect of an \\"alternate book\\" - in this case, The Great Book of English Magic - that should not be missed. I did, however, grind my teeth in the last hundred pages, when the story is hurtling toward its conclusion, each time Ms. Clarke throws a log-of-a-footnoted aside or two (or three, or four) into the road, utterly disrupting the momentum. (At these times, I skipped, and returned at an appropriate caesura in the main text.)But this is but a quibble in the context of the great pleasures this book affords. I loved Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, its bookish world, its swirling mists and vapours and diffuse light and soft edges, and I look forward to the sequel(s), resolved to follow Ms. Clarke through whatever door she cares to open for me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Norrell, a Yorkshire gentleman has spent forty years or so collecting and reading books on magic when he decides to go to London to revive the art of 'English Magic.' He needs to establish his reputation, and is persuaded to resurrect the fiance of a prominent minister who died a few short days before her wedding. He does, and the act vaults him into the highest circles of society. Before long he takes on a student, a much younger man, Strange, whose abilities far exceed his own.Soon we are following Strange around the Spanish, and the French countrysides where he performs minor miracles to aid Wellington against Napoleon. When Strange returns to England, things begin to go pearshaped. The woman resurrected by Norrell tries to shoot him. And Strange's wife disappears.Frequently the formula for success in a novel is to quickly put the hero in the path of danger and demonstrate how he heroically extricates himself. Or pose some moral problem for your hero and see how he resolves it. At very least, create characters that we identify with quite strongly, give them some knotty problem to work out and follow them around as they work on it. Until the closing pages Clarke exposes her characters to almost no dangers, only a couple off-hand moral dilemmas, and hardly any knotty problems. We are given insufficient information of the nature of 'English Magic' - its capabilities and its dangers - to make good moral assessments of the magician's acts. And it is hard to develop more than the mildest sense of attraction to the main characters.So why like this book? There is a kind of level-headed sensibility to ninteenth century English literature that many readers find attractive. Those who do, love Austen, Dickens, and probably this novel. I count myself with these readers. I simply enjoy living in the world Clarke invented. There is a kind of simplicity, a kind of clarity, a kind of level-headedness that the one we occupy today seems to lack. None of the characters is individually compelling; but the kind of warm, gentle treatment the author gives the people, places, and events just makes it an inviting world to visit. And if you enjoy being there, the 800 pages makes it a real value."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I know I speak for many readers when I say that the vast majority of novels written in either the Sci-Fi or Fantasy genres are rather formulaic, predictable, hastily written and contrived solely for the purpose of creating an endless stream of sequels. None more so then the usually pathetic attempts at creating \\"alternate histories\\". I am happy to say that Ms. Susanna Clark has broken through this morass of dullness by creating this wonderful novel of an \\"alternate\\" universe where magic is real, but only practiced by two rather diverse Englishmen.If you only want to read one novel this year, read this one. The writing style just jumps off the page at you. The characters are rich, detailed and have definite lives of their own. The plot moves briskly through different scenarios and through the course of a decade with not one bump in the road. The story is laced with a wonderfully sublime sense of humor and you get the feeling that the author wrote this for the pure enjoyment of the effort. It certainly pays off to the reader. The whole novel is just a PLEASURE to read and even though it's incredibly long at well over 700 pages, it leaves you wanting more. Please don't let the length of this novel stop you, nor the inevitable comparisons to the works of Jane Austen, from which the author does borrow heavily.This is evidently the author's first attempt at the novel and I can only hope she does not listen to the pleas of her publishers and attempt to create a \\"sequel\\", which would be both unnecessary and detract from the beauty of the novel. Again, please read this book and don't be ashamed to say you enjoyed something on the Best Seller list."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What if magic was real, and enjoyed a long tradition? And what if magicians only studied magical history and not magical practice? Then, what if someone discovered the practice of magic again, and brought it back?This hefty tome by Susanna Clarke explores those ideas, as well as the arrogance and failings of hubris. It's not a classic good vs. evil story, which is really what I expected when I bought this book at an airport (for the 800 pages of light reading). It's conflict of the establishment against progress, of innovation versus convention, of the young and the old both grasping for a valid place in the world.It takes place in early 19th century England, primarily in London although there are forays to the countryside as well as to the French battlefield when Napoleon becomes a nuisance. The author wrote in what she deemed the period style, but it was much more easily readable than, say, even Victorian (shudder) literature. She was quite liberal with commas, which certainly lent a degree of credulity to the period writing style. She also used footnotes throughout the book, and if I were the sort of person annoyed by footnotes, I suppose they would have annoyed me. But since I'm the sort of person who uses a second bookmark to keep up with even endnotes, and I kind of enjoy flipping back and forth (it burns more calories)I found the footnotes to be a humorous way to give the reader \\"background\\" without sacrificing the pace of the story.The pace of any story that takes 800 pages to tell will occasionally drag. I really didn't find that to be the case with this book, though, until very near the end, when poor Jonathan Strange spent entirely too much time in Italy and not nearly enough time arguing with Mr. Norrell. I liked their conflicts.I gave the book to my mom to read. I figured with her science fiction/fantasy inclinations she'd really enjoy it. Shows how much I know! She struggled through it to please me, but the last 100 pages never got read. How she could have left the story before it was resolved, I will never understand! But she got bogged down in Venice and just had to extricate herself before she suffocated, I think. Oh, well. Thankls, Mom, for trying. Now I really wish I knew someone else who had read the book so I could talk about it without giving away the many significant plot twists!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ opens, we are introduced to a society of theoretical magicians based in Yorkshire. It seems that the practice of magic has disappeared from England in the previous couple of centuries. At one time magic was very common, and indeed the Northern part of England was ruled by a powerful magician, a boy raised in Fairie, called the Raven King or John Uskglass. The magicians who practiced during his 300 year reign were called \\"Aureate\\" magicians, and their successors \\"Argentine\\", but nothing remains of magical knowledge but a number of books of questionable authority, and occasional stories of the appearance of fairy roads and suchlike. Then a man named Mr Norrell makes a proposition to the Yorkshire society -- he will demonstrate to them that he is an actual magician. If he succeeds, they must all agree to renounce their claim to be magicians. Of course he does, quite spectacularly.Mr Norrell, it transpires, wishes to revive the practice of English magic. But in a very limited way -- he seems to want no rivals. He buys up and hides as many reliable books of magic as he can find. He actively tries to suppress other magicians by such means as his deal with the Yorkshire society. And he is determined in particular to denigrate the memory of John Uskglass, and to avoid the Raven King's sort of magic and especially any dealings with fairies. However, he has some difficulty in getting an in with the powerful men of England -- to whom he hopes to offer his services. Only be bringing back the fianc? of one influential MP from the dead can he establish connections. And unfortunately he can only do that by dealing with a fairy -- and dealings with fairies are indeed dangerous.Mr Norrell's bargain with the fairy works out very ill for the young lady he has revived, as well as for another couple of people. But other than that he is soon very successfully aiding the English side in the war against Buonaparte's France. Then another magician appears, a dilettantish young man named Jonathan Strange. Strange agrees to become Mr Norrell's pupil, but is soon chafing at Norrell's refusal to let him see many of his best books, and at his fears of dealing with fairies or studying John Uskglass. Strange also develops his independence by spending some years with Wellington in the Peninsula, aiding the Army by magic. After the war Strange breaks with Norrell, and threatens to publish a vast History of English Magic. But Norrell has his own ideas -- and more tragically, Strange's wife becomes a victim. The conclusion brings together, in a very satisfying way, Strange, Norrell, the enigmatic fairy that Norrell had summoned, the fairy's victims, Norrell's intriguing servant John Childermass, other magicians, and of course John Uskglass.I found it completely delightful. Readers have noted its extreme length (about a third of a million words -- nearly 800 rather full pages). It is true that the plot moves slowly, and one can readily see ways that the book might be cut without losing the essentials of the story. But I don't think I would like it better cut. Clarke's witty voice is ever a delight, and I enjoyed all the meanderings. Her descriptions of magic are very effective -- there is a real sense of otherworldliness, of caprice, and too the effects are quite imaginative. Her characters, if perhaps a bit thin in places, are still interesting. For all the plot moves slowly, its resolution is as I said quite satisfying, and somewhat surprising. I was moved on occasion, laughing quite often, and never bored. (Which is not to say the novel is a fast or facile read -- it is easy to put down, but you will want to pick it up again. It is a book to live with for a few weeks, not to gulp down in a few sittings.) _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ stands as my favorite novel of 2004."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A society of magicians meets each month in 1806, in York, England. They can't actually work magic, but they study the history of the practice. When newcomer John Segundus joins the group, he asks a nave yet pertinent question: Why is magic no longer practiced in England? The query throws the club into an uproar. Although they don't actually know the answer, the irate members respond defensively, asking Segundus why magicians must practice magic when it is their duty to study it.One magician, Honeyfoot, sides with Segundus. The two seek out and visit a magician named Norrell, who is a stranger to the group. Visiting Norrell is a mysterious experience full of happenings the two men can't explain to the York group. But one message strikes home: Mr. Norrell can actually PRACTICE magic.The group challenges Mr. Norrell, who strikes a bargain with them. He will prove he can practice magic or never again call himself a magician. But in return, they must do the same. All the magicians but Segundus sign the agreement. When Mr. Norrell (from the comfort of his own home) causes all the cathedral statues to come alive, he and Segundus become the only magicians left in Yorkshire.Mr. Norrell moves to London in his quest to bring magic back to England. Segundus has written a letter to the London newspapers describing Mr. Norrell's amazing feat of magic. London society welcomes Mr. Norrell, but when he offers his assistance in the war efforts with France, he is rebuffed and told that magic is not respectable. That opinion is reversed, however, when Mr. Norrell raises a government official's fianc&eacute;e from the dead. The British ministers immediately begin to argue over which of Britain's dead leaders Mr. Norrell should resurrect...until Mr. Norrell mentions the phrase \\"condition of the body.\\" Oh, dear. On to Plan B!Meanwhile, a young man named Jonathan Strange meets a street sorcerer who prophesies that Strange will be one of the two great magicians of England. On a whim (and mostly to impress the woman he hopes to marry), he announces his intention to study magic. Easygoing Strange becomes persnickety Norrell's pupil. An evil force is about. Norrell bargains with it, but it is Strange whose personal life is most affected.When Strange joins the troops on the battlefield to lend a magical hand, the commanding officer, Lord Wellington, asks hopefully, \\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Strange replies, \\"I suppose a magician might...but a gentleman never could.\\" Yet he assists the war effort in many sometimes droll and sometimes nightmarish ways.Fans of Dickens and Austen will dive headfirst into this book, but I must confess that I found the beginning a long, hard slog. It is a hefty, dense and heavily footnoted text, and I initially found the authorial voice to be intrusive and annoying. However, somewhere before the 100-page mark, I fell happily in love with the story and greedily devoured the remainder. (Readers who stumble in the early chapters should consider forging ahead; I guarantee it's worth the effort.)This is an amazingly detailed, ornate tapestry of a saga with shimmering moments of wry humor, threaded through with true tragedy. It is fantasy and historical fiction realistically combined and worth pondering, and sure to become a classic. I admitted that it was a slow read for me at the very beginning; after the middle, I dawdled for a different reason. I simply could not bear to see the end of the story approaching.

Long may she continue to enchant her readers!--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I agree with some of the other comments - this one REALLY needed editing. I have to say, when it's good, it's really, really good, but there were several times I almost gave up, it was so dull and plodding (the Venice part - Oh, my God, I was almost asleep during it!). I actually did stop reading it for a while, but I set myself a quest this year - 52 books read in a year, and I vowed to finish this one as one of the 52. So, I succeeded, but sometimes it was such a struggle! However, when Clarke is \\"on\\" she is very gifted and I very much enjoyed parts of the book. I found her writing style a little silly sometimes; other times it didn't bother me so much. I'd call this a cross between Harry Potter and Dickens, with the strengths and weaknesses of both. I've read all the Potter books and find them very enjoyable, and I've always loved Dickens, so I figured I'd like this book. Can't win them all, but like I said, it does have moments if you hang in there and maybe skim some of it. It's not for everyone, but then most imaginative books aren't. I definitely give Clarke points for originality, though, and look forward to seeing other work from her."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Wonderful character development and atmosphere.

Otherwise don't put it there.\\" A.P. ChekhovJS & Mr. N. kept me going through many long, foggy commutes--I listened to it as an unabridged audiobook when it first came out, and really didn't mind the length, but I still remember feeling bereft at the ending, and not because I was sorry that it ended. The writing is lovely, lyrical and can be quite humorous, the world-building intriguing, the characters diverse and Dickensian, but I'm sorry to say that there are too many plot-holes big enough to sail a man 'o war through. Seemingly important characters are introduced, then never seen again, really important characters are abandoned to their unfortunate fates without explanation, and much wandering and wondering go on and on and on and in the end it comes down to a sort of magical Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.Because of the premise, and the beautiful writing, I truly believe that this could have been a great and classic novel, beloved for generations, if only Ms. Clarke had understood the simple rules of cause and effect, that foreshadowing must be followed through (see Chekhov's shotgun quote) there must be resolution for important relationships and events and key characters need full-bodied development. Otherwise it seems to be just an exercise in authorial self-amusement, luring and ultimately cheating the reader, no matter how good the writing.Obviously, the premise and writing are rich enough to have satisfied many readers, as evidenced by the many, many reviews, but at the end of the day, I felt as if I had been the victim of a literary bait and switch. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a big book, asking for a long commitment of time and a mental investment.

Every atmospheric detail is rich and crucial; there is nothing that is not essential to this mesmerizing, often frightening tale. Clarke's graceful-yet-tight writing is to be venerated--she has composed a masterwork to rival that of Tolkien, though in a much different context, of course. Each character, even the most minor, comes to life in a way that mirrors the famous \\"cathedral statuary\\" scene at the book's beginning. Much can be said about plot and subplots, but it suffices to reiterate that this is a book about two English magicians who become associates and, eventually, bitter rivals. That should imply enough to get you to buy it NOW.This should be read by anyone who admires excellence in fiction/historical-fiction, etc. More than just a fantasy, JS&MN; is (or will one day be regarded as) a true English-language classic.

It becomes necessary to know what happens to the difficult Mr. Norrell and his more talented student, Jonathan Strange, particularly after they become estranged. The mythic threads of this book are so tightly interwoven with mundane historical detail that one becomes locked into a mindset where the magical almost seems mundane also.The subgenre of \\"historical\\" fantasy continues to broaden and develop. Personally, I get annoyed when real people show up in my fantasy, but it is well done here, and done with footnotes also.

What I do mind is a book that is so tediously slow and disjointed and lacking in much of a plot, let alone a plot that has any internal consistency or drive to it, that you have to force yourself to read a bit more in the hopes that it is going to get better, a task that becomes harder and harder as you get hundreds of pages into the chore only to find yourself caring less and less about the characters or what happens next. While it may be true that Susanna Clarke has an interesting voice and the premise has promise, what is set forth is more like a series of notes of potentially interesting people and scenes that simply do not hang together. Plot elements are introduced only to languish for scores of pages at a time and reintroduced in ways that make no sense within the confines of the story line. Nothing is credible in terms of motivation or reaction, so you just force yourself to slog along noticing the cute, pretty words here and there and realizing that an editor or a writers group or someone might have suggested that the multitude of potentially interesting things in the book might make a good story with some editing and some semblance of pace and some discipline in the writing. . .but then you realize you just don't care.

I will openly admit that, even as I proclaim myself to be an avid reader. I didn't enjoy all of the footnotes that took up four or five pages, because then I got distracted from the real story.The opening was pretty good, it had conflict and resolution and old men arguing. It doesn't get much better.But then the story died off for a while in lieu of miles and miles of information to shove into my brain.It didn't really pick up again until Johnathan began visiting the faerie world and opened a pathway for the mischeivious elf that steals souls away. That's how I interpreted it, at least. It made things interesting.The problem was that after all that, there was no real plot to the book.

There is as much Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Makepeace Thackeray in this book as there is Victorian (or earlier) supernatural. It's smart and fun, in my opinion. I'm loving it. Susanna Clarke writes a book that is suspiciously new while remaining reverential of old English ghost and fairy stories.If I had to pick a book to compare this one to, it would be Michael Chabon's incredible ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY.

If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline.As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults. It is definitely not that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In the first pages of this novel we're introduced to an England of the early 19th Century, where though mostly the same as our own England, scholar magicians spend their evenings in the polite company of fellow gentlemen musing on the facts, though rarely the implications of the historical practice of magic on the isle. This status quo of scholarly men discussing scholarly things, but declining to actually experiment with their particular area of expertise is soon disturbed by a young upstart known as John Segundus. Segundus dares to ask a question to the effect of \\"Why don't English magicians actually practice magic anymore?\\" That question proves to be one of the strongest themes of the entire work as the reader is pushed, pulled, and contorted in many other ways as the two English individuals of the title take it upon themselves to revive the practice of magic.Ms. Clarke introduces us to the period's first \\"practical magician,\\" Mr. Gilbert Norrel through John Segundus' attempt to answer his own question. Norrel is depicted as snobbish, antisocial, reclusive, bookish, and of a refined, though arrogant demeanor. In short, he is the stereotypical English country gentleman. Clarke eventually takes Norrel and his truly insightful servant, Childermass, to London, where she lets us meet many of the luminaries of English politics and high society.The characterization of every person is brilliantly detailed. There is not a servant, politician, soldier, magician, or vagabond that isn't treated as a full individual and graced with quirks and idiosyncrasies unique to them. A pleasant effect of this deliberate attention is that while getting into the story it's not easy to ascertain who is a major player, who is a supporting role, and who is just there to take up space. In fact, no character is there merely to take up space, and one character's social station has no effect on their influence in the story.One would be remiss not to mention the undeniably English feel to the story, prose, and characters. This is a story about English characters in England. Even when the characters are most certainly not in England, they strive to transform their environment to one more like England. They seek out the company of other English people, they arrange their things to a more English sensibility, and in some cases the fact that the land around them isn't English leads the characters to regard that land as a minor annoyance as opposed to an actual place. However, being away from England has a special effect on those characters that alienates them from their contemporaries that have stayed on the island. They take pride in being English, but the condition of being so far from anything that they can identify as English warps what that means to them, and thus those characters who remain in England are eventually less likely to identify with the travelers as they're gone and after they return.There are, of course, exceptions to all of this. There are major characters that are not English, but the condition of them being in England or interacting with the country and its people is a strong part of their character.Just as much as England is a character, magic is a character in this story. For most of the story magic is not only a character metaphorically, but literally, in the form of the fairy gentleman with the thistle-down hair. His nature betrays the nature of magic and offers insight into the answer to John Segundus' question, \\"Why don't English magicians practice magic anymore?\\"Finally, though the pacing could possibly be improved, the flaws therein are smoothed over by Clarke's satisfying resolution. Clarke brings the story to a fulfilling end, not tying up all of the loose ends, but finishing the story in a place well suited for such a purpose leaving the reader space to imagine."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Like Susanna Clarke, many of the reviewers here take too many words to get to the point: \\"a book to savor, not devour,\\" \\"will reward the patient reader,\\" and the like.Here's the short course: boring. Some decent fantasy larded with lots and lots of genuinely second-rate Jane Austen. I can't believe this author is also an editor -- if there was ever a book that needed a red pencil, this is it.If you want riveting fantasy, read Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy.

Honestly, new readers be warned, it's a mess, with no clear storyline and a wandering, episodic, unengaging structure. What is this book about, really? Where is the story? It feels to this reader that the author, over her 12 year struggle to put this on paper, came and went, ideas wandering here and there, adding chapters and characters and half-considered plot turns, without much purpose and with no clear sense of how to construct a narrative. She writes with charm to be sure, there are clever moments and a dry wit, and a handful of nicely realized magical moments -- but most are rendered 'practically', as an ordinary part of life, and consquently have almost no dramatic effect. Character development is poor. The coming together and then the splitting apart of the two main characters is not dramatized well and comes across as vague and spontaneously imagined. I suspect most of what was put down on the pages here was thought out in the moment and not previously outlined or considered, and that, for an 800-page manuscript, is deadly. If you like a good, clear, forward-moving story, avoid this novel at all cost."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me say two things about Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell:1. This is one of the finest novels I have ever read. Ever.2. You might hate it.Okay, let me say more. I listened to this book on audio and, because of the language and humor, I was delighted from the very start. I listened for 32 hours and approximately 25 of those hours are rather slow. Interesting stuff happens, but nothing that's going to put you on the edge of your seat. It's leisurely and teasing. It's not clear how all of the characters and plots relate to each other. If you're ready for action, it's a bit frustrating. But the action finally does arrive and all of the characters and plots finally come together in an unexpected and satisfying way. Looking back, you realize that the plot was clever and quite tight all along.What kept me going was that the writing is absolutely glorious. Susanna Clarke writes like Charles Dickens or Jane Austen or one of those other 19th century English novelists who we love because of the insightful and subtly witty social commentary and the plain but elegant writing style. She's right up there with the best. In fact, I can't think of anyone who writes better than Susanna Clarke. Not Tolkien, not Le Guin, not Bujold. And for this reason, I must give the book 5 stars. It is a superb novel.Particularly fun were a few devices that I really enjoyed such as the intrusive narrator somewhat reminiscent of Thackeray's Vanity Fair, fictional characters interacting with real historical figures (Lord Byron was my favorite), and a few little alternate explanations of how some historical events in arts and literature came to be (I won't give you any examples because discovering them is the fun part).The audiobook is also superb. The reader, Simon Prebble, is English (in case you couldn't tell by his name), and his diction, pace, and voices are perfect. I love the voice he uses for the more uncouth characters -- it just sounds slimy. This was a great novel to listen to--Mr. Prebble's voices add to the dry humor--but keep in mind that it will take you 32 hours. It's quite a time investment, but well worth it.So, I recommend that you read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell when you have the time to be patient and when you're in the mood to be delighted by a long elegant English novel. If you're in a hurry, or if you're in the mood for quests, orphan boys, sword-fighting, or dragons, don't bother.This is the perfect book for the right reader. I can't wait to see what Susanna Clarke does next -- she's brilliant!~ FantasyLiterature.net"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"My only regret is that I can't go back and read this book again for the first time. It was fantastic! I truly, whole-heartedly enjoyed every moment of the book. Sure, it's long. But it makes you READ, and think, and use your brain to follow the characters, their intentions, the storylines, the side stories, the mood and the world of the book. I have an awesome respect for Susanna Clarke for developing such a thorough, intricate world of magic and carefully integrating it with the \\"real\\" world that takes place during the Napoleonic Wars. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To begin with, imagine Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen. While that is an imprecise high concept version of \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" it embraces the two most important aspects of the book would-be readers need to reconcile themselves with. If you are uncomfortable with magic -- not magic realism, not imagined magic, but actual magic done by the characters -- the book is not for you. Likewise, if the notion of reading nearly 800 pages written by Susanna Clarke channeling Jane Austen sounds hard to bear, wait for the movie.But for those who find either of those bearable -- or, better yet, an exciting prospect -- \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is a strange and wonderful novel that you will live in for longer than you expect and shorter than you will end up wishing.One of the first truly adult fantasy novels -- which is to say, it emphasizes real emotions, subtle and conflicting motivations and genuine love over special effects, gore and sex -- Clarke's novel is full of characters who can be both repellent, attractive and pitiable, sometimes all in the space of one paragraph. The novel, even if one has given into temptation and read too many detailed reviews, is full of surprises, both of the large plot twist sort and or the small character moments sort. The ending, in particular, is a bittersweet wrench, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the novel, and yet slightly surprising and heartbreaking despite that.With the love between Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the scholarly passions of Mr. Norrell and a host of \\"theoretical magicians,\\" the strange and eventually fascinating Childermass, the various cloying toadies, the sweet and in-over-their-head Greysteels, Clarke creates more delicately detailed and compelling characters than most novelists manage in a whole series of novels. And it is as much the love between Jonathan and Arabella that drives this novel as it is the love of magic of the two protagonists. But there is magic a-plenty, including spectacular magic wrought on the battlefield against Napoleon, whom one feels almost sorry for as Strange gets more and more comfortable in his role as Wellington's magician.But the plot is longer and more complex than that, and Napoleon is mostly a stepping stone for the magicians in their quest to return English magic to its rightful place, and their real enemy is subtle and devious, and more than a little insane. Their enemy is one of the most interesting antagonists in fiction, and Clarke successful makes him a mythic sort of villain. At the same time, she also manages to create a great deal of mystery around the ancient Raven King, creating a mystique around a totally made-up character that has the weight of real world myth and legend.Despite the novel's historical period and many ties to real world history, it's not necessary to know anything about the British fighting Napoleon, the poetry and life of Lord Byron or anything else of the sort. Clarke provides more than enough to understand and enjoy the setting, although the more one knows about history, the more Clarke's very low-key winks at it are revealed -- Byron's and the Shelleys' legendary Swiss vacation that, in many ways, gave birth to the modern horror genre gets a dismissive reference from Strange at one point, who obviously does not yet know the historical significance of the house on the lake and those who stayed there, for instance.I normally whip through a novel this size, particularly if I love it, as I did this one, in a weekend, or a week at most. Instead, I found myself putting the book down and not wanting to go further, wanting to savor and digest the book in small doses. Now that I've finished it, I only have a small short story by Clarke (on the official novel Web site) left to me of it.If the initial description -- Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen -- sounds good to you, don't hesitate. The sooner you enter the 19th century England of Strange and Norrell, the happier you'll be. This is easily one of the best novels, of any genre or literary merit, I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What a novel! I read a lot and reading experiences such as the one I had reading Clarke's novel just don't happen very often. I'm so very, very thankful that a novel such as this was even published given the light, shallow, fast-reading novels that dominate most publisher's list these days.JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL has it all: memorable and richly drawn characters, vivid setting, poignant atmosphere, action, adventure, humor, horror, and writing that is pitch perfect on every page. I also liked the fact that it's long. When a story is this enchanting I want the experience to last a whileI really think this novel defies comparison to any other novels; it's in a class by itself. But if someone were to compare it to something else it'd probably be most accurate to compare it to something written in the 19th century, like Dickens.The story ends in a satisfying way and in one that's true to its internal logic, but Clarke leaves just enough unfinished to provide the perfect premise for a future novel. I've heard rumblings to the effect that she is planning a future novel with some of the same characters, and I, for one, can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"JS& MR N shines captures the attention and eggs you on to keep reading. Now, you don't particularly connect with the characters, as the tone of the writing is one that puts you ever at arms length from them, but you're always interested in what comes next. The book feels very similar to Gaiman and Pratchett's &#34;Good Omens&#34; in tone.While plunging into this world (with its masses of _seemingly_ random footnotes that build into a life all their own), be warned that you're making an investment.One that pays off!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Read 3/4's of the book before I just gave up. Nothing had happened of note 3/4's of the way into the book. It had been advertised as a Jane Austin period fantasy with wizards. Yup, set in that period, although you really had to look to find any period references and there was only one wizard who didn't do much. Lots of mind numbing dialog."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I LOVED this book, but I can understand why some people wouldn't. People nowadays just don't have the stamina to read long books. This may sound cynical, but one of the reasons why Harry Potter is so popular is because it is written on a children's level. To compare Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell to Harry Potter in order to rope people into reading it is a bit misleading.This book has short chapters, so it's easy to get through it. The humor is subtle, and the action picks up a bit at the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have recommended this to so many people, and everyone loves it!

This book is incredibly well written, and like an earlier review I agree with saying this is NOT Harry Potter. This book much more closely resembles the writing of Jane Austin.

If I were an annoying high school lit teacher I would make this required reading - lots of allegory, double entendres, stylistic stuff to test on!Bottom line, though a good read. (Some of the side stories become tedious and if I reread the book, I will skip them.

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrellby Susanna Clarke is a fictional book about magicians set in 1800s England.English magicians, once world renowned, are stagnant in the 1800s and have lost their ability to perform magic. However, the reclusive Mr. Norrell of Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire has been collecting old and forgotten English magic books.Raising a woman from the dead, Mr. Norrell soon finds himself at the service of the government fighting the French. Everything turns on its head when the handsome and charming Jonathan Strange, a rival magician, appears. Strange makes a name for himself during a campaign with Lord Wellington. However it is soon obvious that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell's idea of what exactly \\"magic\\" is or ought to be are very different.I usually don't read books about magic, but when Neil Gaiman, one of my favorite authors, recommended Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke, which was on sale for the day, I grabbed it up immediately.The novel surprised me. It was excellent, funny and imaginative yet not crossing into the land of unpronounceable names, fantastic creatures and geography so convoluted my simple mind cannot process it.As in any interesting book, this one also has layers which allow the reader to think about and explore. Jealousy, friendship, envy, love, arrogance and, of course, redemption are all touched upon by this most interesting book.The way Ms. Clarke has recreated England was, to me, one of the highlights of the book. In a style reminiscent of Mr. Gaiman she describes, with wit and clarity, seedy parlors, streets, buildings and houses both of rich and poor. The characterization of people within the story is brilliant, often funny and able to create an image.\\"The walls of the parlour were ornamented with cheap engravings -- portraits of famous criminals of the last century who had all been hanged and portraits of the King's dissolute sons who had not been hanged yet.\\"\\"[N]ot been hanged yet\\" - don't you love that?The story is told by an anonymous narrator who is writing a history book about Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, complete with footnotes and annotations. The footnotes were some of my favorite parts of the book even though they add very little to the story, however they bring the book to a whole new level and add several dimensions to it. Full of historical references, stories and brief characterizations these footnotes are a delight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am not going to say much more since am doing it on the kindle. (very slow at it) but that should tell you something."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What a fun fantasy. I thoroughly enjoyed Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Clarke continues her world of faires and magic in her other stories as if in the same setting, literally, as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke may be the sort of book which can't find a wide audience. It's really well written, but in a style which is more Victorian or Edwardian, rather than modern (figures; it's about magicians in the first decade of the 1800s trying to find out why magic isn't done anywhere in England...any more). I personally like the style, having been poisoned by English Literature early in my formative years. Really, you would have thought that Thomas Hardy would have made a lot less of an impression on an impulsive teenager, but you would be Very Wrong. I'm hardly started and I can tell already that I am going to really, really enjoy this, especially since it's been forever since I swallowed an entire Victorian novel, even if it doesn't contain unlikely suicides of young children.Anyway, the windup to this story is about the juxtaposition of two magicians and their faery servants fighting more or less alongside England's army/navy against Napoleon until their clash of styles reveals rather different motivations in each, leading to a wider war than merely all of Europe."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As I am not an native English speaker, it took me a while to get used to the language in this book, in the end though I really wished I could go and speak like they do in this book :) Susanna Clarke has written it beautifully in excellent English.I do not usually prefer books in the fantasy category but this is definitely a fantastic book ! I would recommend! (could not put it down)!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Reading this is like assembling a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. The details are all there but it takes quite a deal of work at the start; And like a jigsaw puzzle, it picks up very fast a little halfway through as more pieces are put into place. I like how the author instills imagination and speculation yet still give quite an ending that almost left nothing unanswered.I would recommend this book but you will need patience to appreciate it. The magic here is not what you might expect. Magic feels too ordinary in this book because that is what this book was all about - An alternate history where magic is part of the common everyday life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm only 100 pages into it and just have to say it is probably the best written, witty, and interesting piece I've ever read. It is just magical.As many have suggested I would suggest reading the first chapter because the way this book is written might be very unexciting for some people. Not that anything is wrong with you but it might be downright weird for some. It doesn't necessarily mean you are stupid or can't understand good books. It is just that there is a definite style, and style is in the eye of the beholder I guess.The setting and the characters are really entertaining, but might seem dry to some, with all their gentlemanly rules and such but that is what makes them entertaining to me.Overall, I highly recommend you at least try the first chapter!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke's novel, though winding at times, is superbly written. Her style (and even spelling) mimics Regency-era writing, making you feel as if this book were not only set in the Regency era, but written during or slightly after it as well. Her imagination, turns of phrase, and characterizations are wonderful. If you are looking for a quick read, this book is not it. It takes some dedication, but is well worth it. If, on the other hand, you are used to making your way through thicker, older books such as The Count of Monte Cristo or Jane Eyre, and are craving a new, intelligent novel that delivers both excitement and humor (I chuckled my way through every chapter), this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Ive read a lot of books in my life and I know the cream of the crop, Catch 22, The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Connie Willis's Passage.

I was enchanted by the near-Dickensian prose and enjoyed every chance I had to sit down and read until......about 100 pages into the work, a black butler is introduced, Stephan Black who is then revealed to be the most intelligent and witty character in the story. The whites around him (revealing how ignorant they really are) assume him to be some African king in exile. Everyone around him dotes on his wondrousness. I hoped that he would be some minor character and soon disappear but as I scanned the next few hundred pages I saw his name popping up again and again and again to the point where I knew that no matter how much I liked the writing and the flow of the story so far I just could not continue such an anachronistic uber-PC work."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After plodding through 400 pages of this immense, plodding tomb, including the annoying and unentertaining footnotes, I am at the crossroads of deciding whether I should waste any more of my life by continuing onward to the end.

Even more, I don't understand what convinced some editor to ever publish it. Okay, I convinced myself, I'm putting it down, taking it to the used paperback store and trading it in.

I wanted to like this book, but just couldn't. I have read many fantasy books of quality over my 52 years, as well as a lot of pure junk, and this was a book I found to be nothing short of pretentious the more I read it. Those footnotes are just plain ridiculous and ANNOYING, as they serve no real purpose. The attempts to sound Dickensian do not work and the premise is bogus, especially in a world going through horrible battles with certainly NO magic in them at all!

However, I got this book on CD from the local library without really knowing what it was about, and after perhaps half an hour I was hooked on it. The \\"fantasy\\" elements don't seem strained or ridiculous, somehow, and the writing is a joy. I later bought two copies of this book, one for my little cousins and one for myself, and I'm strongly considering getting my father a copy as well.

I'm not sure what motivated the author to do this but given the time she worked on it, it's a tribute to her determination.

I am not going to get into the plot here- you can read that on its info page. But I highly recommend this to people looking for an original read that blends sophisticated fantasy with enjoyable historical fiction. With the extensive footnotes and detail you find yourself actually wondering of any of these magical persons/books/events actually took place!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I approached this book with some trepidation. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre in general (I find most of it to be fairly derivative). I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, either, and when I saw this book appear -- a great big fat book about magicians -- I couldn't help but assume somebody was trying to cash in.I gave it a chance anyway, and I wasn't disappointed. This book is a lot of fun.Some people describe the writing style as being pretentious or stilted, and maybe it is a little. What it also is, however, is witty in that extremely dry way that just screams \\"England.\\" Imagine John Cleese teaching a college course on the history of the Zulu wars and you have the general idea.It's big -- maybe over-big -- but it never wore out its welcome and I closed it fully expecting to pick up Ms. Clarke's next one when it appears.If I have any criticisms, one is that the plot does tend to meander a bit and doesn't really pick up steam until late in the manuscript. The other is that by the end of the book there are so many references to Clarke's alternate-England world, with its fairy roads, magician kings and haunted castles that move from one part of the landscape to another, that it sort of loses its mooring and you no longer have any landmarks to keep it grounded in the real world. It no longer feels like real England plus magic, in other words, and instead starts to feel like a completely alien fantasy environment. But this is a minor quibble.\\"Harry Potter for adults\\" is an apt enough description, but this book is more than that also. I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In it's way this is a brilliant book and it certainly is entertaining in a very odd way. I couldn't really stop reading it though there were times when it's sheer weight made my arms tired. The character protraits and historical perspective are remarkable. The book is about two practical magicians who want to bring true magic back to England, where only theoretical Magicians prevail. It seems the best way to do that is to cleverly help the government wage war against the French...and so much more. One gets comfortable in this strange world where many unexpected things occur. One gets comfortable escaping into this well structured alternate reality and with it's characters. But unlike Harry Potter, the plots unfold slowly (if interestingly) and if you're looking for a gut grabber this one isn't it. All that said, I had to give it 5 stars because for what it is, it is extremely well done...and I hated to see it go."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"...this is what she would have written. It is not the perfect book, but it comes close, and what other book can appeal so well to the sensibilities of both Jane Austen and Harry Potter lovers? I want more books like this one!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It would be silly to pretend that anyone could like this book. Not true. You MUST have an affinity for language (Jane Austen-style), quirky, memorable characters, subtle humor, history and, above all, the supernatural. Susannah Clarke spent ten years crafting this novel--and it certainly shows, as she has created a world unto its own--a colorful, eccentric, macabre world in which fairies still keep humans enthralled and a man might save his wife by entering a perpetual Darkness.Clarke's much-maligned long footnotes are actually quite fantastic. Frankly, you do NOT have to read them to \\"get\\" the story--and in fact, they probably make up a good third of the 800+ pages. But to \\"get\\" the philosophy of Jonathan Strange's world, the history of the Raven King's England, the world around the characters, you absolutely MUST read them. The footnotes are where Clarke creates the magical background, so important to the story.Clarke skillfully entertwines real historical events and characters (Waterloo, Duke of Wellington, the mad King George) with dragons and fairies; her language is incredibly rich and evocative and subtle; she stays true to regency-style English, and does, in fact, read like Jane Austen. But the story told in that gorgeous, subtle language is not a little disturbing, though riveting; nothing like Jane Austen, who wrote mostly happy endings. Clarke explores man's essential evils through her characters: greed, vanity, obssession with an idea, neglect of another. Moreover, though she delivers her innocents, she does not always punish the guilty. You cannot be assured of a happy ending...This book is by no means an easy read, as it cannot be skimmed through and requires thinking. But as such a meaty book, it is very enjoyable: by the end of it, you will find yourself looking for ravens everywhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Do you like to read fiction on magic but are tired of hormone charged teenagers worried about who's \\"snogging\\" whom?

Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (JSMN) will end your sorrows!JSMN is set in early 19th century England where Mr. Norrell, the only practical magician in England is looking for a career as a royal magician, helping His Majesty fight the French and restore his own version of practical magic to England.Mr. Norrell has only 2 desires: 1) To be the only magician in England and 2) To rewrite magical history and wipe the Raven King out of existense.For his goals, Norrell is prepared to go to any length.However, as fate would have it, even he can't prevent another magician to come forth and experiment with Raven King's magic.As Jonathan Strange bursts into the scene, he gets tired of performing simple magic tricks to help the British army and decides that magic is more useful and several times more powerfull if King's ancient methods are employed.There begins the tale of Strange's thirst for knowledge and Norrell's attempts to stop him.But by no means Strange and Norrell the only people in the story. There's a Lady Pole brought back to life by Norrell (to advance his career in politics) and Arabella, Strange's wife and Stephen Black, a black slave serving Sir Walter Pole (Lady Pole's husband).Finally, an evil fairy, a gentleman with thistle down hair and master of Last Hope provide us with the complex villian that every good story must have.The omnipotent and mysterious Raven King is not revealed till the very end but when he comes, he brings the rain and wind and the sky with him.You will love JSMN for its rich charachters. Each and every person, from Duke of Wellington (general of British army in Spain) to Drawlight (a conniving socialite) has been given his true share of words. Enough time and effort has been spent to make you see what they see and feel what they feel.Since the story is set in Europe , you don't feel alienated from the location. Streets of London, dusty roads of Spain and villages of Belgium are fairly easy to imagine.Finally, the magic performed by magicians sounds real. No childish single word spells to unlock doors or fly. Magicians in JSMN actually wake up the dead, conjure up objects from rain and wind and make stone statues talk! They build roads to let their troops pass and venture to Otherlands where no one has set foot in over 300 years!By far, JSMN is the best novel I have read in a long time. It is long, very long, but sumptuous! You will love the little historical information at the bottom of the page each time a new magician or his magic is mentioned. You need patience but believe me, it is so worth it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The minute I read this book I immediately recognise Jane Austen and Charles Dickens' style of writing - to be expected of course since Susanna Clarke declares both to be her favourite authors. So in this sense, I find the book familiar and a delight.Many a review have labelled \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" as Harry Potter for adults. I've read all 6 Harry Potters, so I will have to disagree and say an empathic no.There is no fast paced magical action in this book, certainly no hair raising manouvers on broomsticks, dramatic pronouncements of spells, severe wand pointings nor bubbling potions in magical couldrons. Everything takes a much somber, grey and deliberate mood - as befitting English Victorian sensibilities. Next to Harry Potter, watching magic here is like watching donkey carts racing! Yes, you have to be really committed (or desperate) to find it exciting. But the results can be quite dramatic! If only Harry laid his hands on that raising-the-dead spell!The book is heavy on the history of magic - sometimes the book reads like a history book (zzzzz.....). Details and more details. Beware: tons of page notes! However I can see the point - they serve to make the story very excitingly rich. But the writer has managed to create a fine line between that and being mindnumbingly boring!The excitment comes really from the many interesting plots that are built layer upon layer of each other. The author is big on details and in the beginning this makes the book enjoyable to read. However as the plot thickens (not as thick as the book), this incesant detailing by the author just becomes plain irritating. Clarke can't seem to stop herself and I only wished the editor would've done a better job here. Despite the similarity in style Clarke is nowhere near Dickens' league as a skillful storyteller. Why do writers keep forgetting that restrain is a virtue!The book ends with a cliffhanger and thus setting a possible sequel. Despite the tedious slog at the end, I would read the follow-up if only to see the tale of these hapless magicians through to a happy conclusion. But I hope the editor does a better job next time 'round."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Although lengthy this book is enchanting and funny, truly an adult Harry Potter type book for adults. The satire is so seldom found in today's books: religion, formality endeavors, career jealousy and so forth. The footnotes have the reader believing in the magic, the Raven King, and the once Land of Faire! A truly fascinating experience. emme06bee@entermail.net"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"this book has all the sweep and richness of cryptonomicon, all the imagination and grotesqueries of gaiman, and all the narrative drive of the foundation series. rarely have i been so caught up in a book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I adored this book. With so many glowing reviews already here there's little left for me to say; I just want to add my voice to the chorus of appreciation._Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell_ is a complete delight from beginning to end: vivid characters and a rich alternate 19th-century setting are wrapped up in smooth, confident prose. There are definite shades of Austen in the narrative voice - arch, witty, clever, self-aware - but it's much more than just an intelligent pastiche. It's a tightly-controlled novel with an absorbing plot that simultaneously manages to evoke interesting themes from both its historical (social hierarchy and its discontents, rationality vs. spirituality) and its fantasy (the morality of magic-use) aspects. 'Real-life' characters turn up, but are used carefully and sparingly - and, in the case of Byron, hilariously.Those who like their books rapid-fire and dare I say a little more obvious may rail against its apparent lack of 'action' - but to do so is to miss the point. This is a book about rather more than just plot (although, frankly, it has plenty of that, too...). It is a character-study and a period-piece, and any dissimilarities with contemporary fiction in terms of pacing are entirely in keeping with the style and form the author intends. You're unlikely to find a more elegant, amusing and intelligent fantasy novel this year. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Now that this has been nominted for a Hugo Award, I expect that many will disagree with my opinions, but I believe they are justified. Although I typically try and push myself to finsish books I start, I was unable to sustain my motivation after the first 150 or so pages, and just gave up.1. The author's writing style I found generally pretentious and often uninteresting. The narrative voice is an attempt to mimic early 19th century British English. I will assume the author has achieved some level of authenticity, but it does not always make for readable prose. Although speech patterns may have been goverened by a stiff upper lip in those times, it doesn't mean the narrators inner voice has to adopt the same pattern.2. The author seems to enjoy self-indulgent asides and multi-page footnotes that don't serve an obvious rhetorical purpose. There are many examples of footnotes used to explain the obscure background or history behind a quip or phrase. To my knowledge, however, these don't seem to advance plot or add depth to the character development. I found them mostly irritating and pointless.3. At times, the book feels more like an analysis of political strategy and behavior of 19th century British bureaucrats. This might be an interesting topic, but to me was completely out of place.Or am I the only one who feels this way?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Boring, wooden and lackluster. The characters are unengaging, and I can't make myself care what happens to them. Yes, there is a lot of period detail, but good research does not a good story make. A triumph of marketing. I predict sales fall off precipitously as work gets around."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am an avid reader. I buy books and read them as soon as I get them, then go looking for more. I've read and loved Hawthorne, Dickens, Twain, Alcott, Bronte, Austin, and even some Melville (I mention these because they have been compared to this book's \\"denseness\\")...But this book has been sitting on my shelf for over a month. I keep pulling it out hoping that maybe time has let it ferment or meld itself into a readable book, but no such luck. I have yet to get past the first chapter. Reading it feels like slogging through quicksand with cinder blocks attached to your feet. I tried flipping ahead in the book in hopes it would be better and every so often I find a passage where there is something interesting, like conversation instead of the history of a non-existant magical comunity... but for the most part this book is serving as a dust collector. The only thing that keeps me coming back to it, besides the fact that I have never let anybook go unread once I got my hands on it, is the fact the last page in the book is very captivating...so I keep thinking for a book to end so well it must be good somewhere in the middle.If you like dry, long, boring books based on 'fantasy' this is for you... But if you don't, for heavens sake don't waste your money... go buy Jane Eyre, or Wuthering Heights or something...or if \\"thicker\\" books aren't up your alley go get some Artemis Fowl or Terry Pratchet books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell was a 700+ (for the hardback) page novel about..... yeah, that's just the thing. I read this entire stupid book, and I still couldn't give you a clear answer what it was about.After searching around online for an answer to why I just wasted more time than I should have reading this bland Dickens knock-off, I discovered that the question of \\"what is this book about?\\" is even in debate among people who actually liked it. It's either about the relationship between Strange and Norrell, the relationship between reason and madness, a little of both, some other drivel, or... whatever because by page 500 I really stopped caring and started skimming my way through the rest of this thing just to get to some kind of god forsaken conclusion to this jumbled mess by an obvious amature author.I can see the reason why so many people like it. It's long, there are a lot of characters, and a lot is going on creating the illusion of a book that should be considered \\"important\\". I flat out hated it, and here's why:-It is unnecessarily long. This isn't really a point of it's own as it ties in with the ones I'm about to make, but I just wanted to start by saying this should have been at least half as long. I absolutely hate the trend of believing \\"longer is better\\". NO! It is not. If you're just adding filler to your book in order to make it longer, you are diluting the quality.-There are entire plot lines which are introduced and just go nowhere.-There are characters who are introduced, and given a good deal of page space, who add nothing to the plot. Mainly because, once again, their plot lines are introduced and go nowhere, or because it is ended so abruptly you wonder what was the point of introducing it to begin with.-The point of this book is so hard to pick out because it seems to keep shifting focus throughout the novel. I swear it's like I read five different books. The flow of the book is clunky and lacks cohesiveness.-The book is so overburdened with \\"side characters\\" that once you get around to the ones that actual do matter (and their story lines) end up getting choked by all the rubbish that fills the book.-The footnotes are distracting and add nothing to the story line. Yeah, I get it, they add background information in a cutesy kitschy way. It's not needed. It's just another distraction.-With the exception of Strange, there is NO character development. And it's even a stretch to say there's any with Strange's character. If you are going to write a book that focuses more on character relationships than \\"story\\", at least have some kind of character arc or something. For a book that spans more than a decade it's pretty unbelievable that almost every single one of the characters have exactly the same voice/opinions/story/goal/etc near the end as they do in the beginning.It's not the fact there this is a character driven book with many interlocking plots going on throughout it, which makes me hate this book. I love character driven novels! It's just that this is written so badly that I'm not really sure where Clarke was going with this.So, as a brief summary, this book is unfocused, cluttered, and has no immediate point. I think it suffers from the classic rookie author mistake of Clarke trying too hard and taking on more of a book than she could successfully handle (a la \\"The Historian\\" by Elizabeth Kostova, but at least that had an actual plot, albeit ridiculous, unlike this novel). I don't know how else to express exactly how much this book sucks. It just does. It's really awful and an incredible waste of time. I cannot believe the crap got published, and it makes me even more astounded that it got such good reviews (then again, The Da Vinci Code and Twilight are also critically praised... so there you go...).Oh, and did I mention (no, I did not), that there is no conclusion after all. It basically leaves you by opening another plot line (big friggin' surprise), and a \\"Too be continued\\" type cliff hanger. Not an open ended \\"form your own conclusion\\" type ending, but an obvious set up for a sequel. God, do I hate authors who pull this stunt. If you can't wrap up your story line in your original novel (especially one this long), then it's probably because it's not good enough to continue into another one anyway. By the end of the book I'm left wishing I owned a fireplace for which I can chuck this trash into."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first hundred pages of this book, are the sort of writing that makes me want to file a lawsuit against Susanna Clarke for one's life wasted and the trees desecrated to print.The end part becomes slowly worhty of a novel, but at that point I really couldn't care less about any of the characters.It's written in a style from 19th century. With all the lovely 19th century bigotry and self-righousness of the pompous English (fat off her colonies in Asia and Africa) the sort of gentelmen that financed slave ships during the day and spent hours in ballrooms of London the rest)If you actually want a WELL written work in that style, I suggest and actual work from that time, Dickens, Austin etc...If you want to see a brat of writer try to re-imagine and re-do an imaginary place (English History with all the ugly little moral discrepencies tucked away), then this is the book for you.There is a deserving writer somewhere being denied her/his chance because this garbage was done by a publishing industry insider (she managed the cooking catalogs prior to this!) and pushed through.If you are an English lord who has thousands of guineas off your colonial holdings and plantations and have hours upon hours to waste, this might be a lovely diversion for you. If you fancy yourself an intelligent person, this book will waste your life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This was a LONG LONG LONG book that didn't engage me the way I thought it would. There are 26 full CDs to listen to, and the worst part, by far, is that there is no break/pause/music to let you know when you have reached the end of a CD and need to switch to another. The Cds were extraordinarily long, and I often found myself listening to the CD almost to track 3 or 4 again before I realized - \`hey, I already heard this!' It would have been helpful, especially with a book/CD set this lengthy to have the reader let you know that you need to switch CDs. The storyline was very hard to follow as well - there was an extensive cast of characters and a lot of action taking place, and it was hard to capture all of it through listening. I wasn't thrilled by this book at all, and I'm glad I opted for the CD instead of the actual book - it was a waste of time, really. The \`magic, Harry Potter story for adults\\" was not there - it was a character driven book and not fantasy or magical by the definition of Harry Potter. The book far exceeded the length it should have been and left me with a bad opinion for this author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I don't usually come across books that I don't like or have no interest in finishing but this was/is one of them. Now granted, I listened to all 26 cd's but there were more than a few times when I just wanted to bag it and stop listening. I am quite surprised at all the positive feedback this book generated as I feel it easily could have been half as long. I think it was a good long time before Jonathan even got introduced in the story.As it is I really can't recommend this at all. I did like the premise of the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After reading the reviews by others, it seems as though this might be an exciting book. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The author seems to lose focus of the story and characters. You might find yourself rereading passages to figure out if you are missing something, only to discover your disoreintation is the book's error and not your own. The character development is lacking and as well as the presence of magic. To even make mention of Harry Potter in any review of this book is demeaning to J.K. Rowling. The use of language is distracting (using the word 'shew' representing 'show' etc). This reviewer is not familiar enough to know if this is representation of english in the 1800's or not. None the less, it only adds more distraction to the pace of the story. Anyone who has read the Masters of Rome Series will know of challenge Colleen McCullough places upon the reader to absorb the highly complex characters and events she writes of. I have read this series beginning to end, yet I could not find the fortitude to get past 160 pages of Strange and Norrell. I had this book for a flight from Kauai to Phx, a 6 hour flight, yet chose to stare at the bulkhead of the plane than suffer through this book.If your are looking for an exciting book on magic, which breaks out of the usual genre, I suggest Jonathan Stroud and the Bartimaeus Series. It is listed under Childrens liturature however I think this is a gross mistake by the publisher as the books fascinate all ages. This author has woven a tight story, filled with rich characters that make it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There is no good in opposition to evil in this book, every one and every place is evil. The whole book is very dark and there is no deeper truth to the fantasy. On top of that, it is a very loooooong and boring book.
