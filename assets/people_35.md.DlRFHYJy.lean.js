The book also kept me interested all the time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Nothing different than other Clancy books. Something new would be good"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I got the game Rainbow Six for Christmas and it is the best first person shooter ever, so I got the book. It turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read. Tom Clancy draws you into the action with his description of it all. It's that good. Many people complain about the length and the price of it. But who cares if it is this good. Tom Clancy drew me into his book and I think you should be drawn into it too."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My recommendations after reading quite a few thrillers this year: Bob Mayer's special forces books. Try CUT OUTor DRAGON SIM-13."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is at his suspense filled best. This time I really ask myself how'er they (Clark &amp; Ding) going to get out of this one? This makes Flash Gordon, Tom Mix, Hoppalong Cassidy and John Wayne look like pikers! If I had to pick which book was the most thrilling of the decade, I would have said The Firm, until I read Rainbow Six. I found myself yelling at a book! ...Look out! ...Duck! Get the long un-abridged version ...it's the only way to out Clancy, Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't expect great literature when I read a thriller. I want good action, a smart plot, and some realistic characters. 0 for 3 in this book. Lots of action but since the good guys will always win there is no suspense. I recommend Bob Mayer's Special Forces series of books for those who want to read some excellent military thrillers. A friend of mine, retired from the CIA, told me Mayer's books are among the most realistic he's read about covert military special operations. Mayer is former military, having served in special forces, so he knows what he's writing about."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a die hard Tom Clancy fan from his first book on, how disappointing it was to discover this re-hash of Clancy standard themes that is mostly fill. I have my doubts if he did all the writing himself -- it smacks of pay-by-word. The plot has absolutely NO credibility and is slightly silly that he would ask us to suspend belief to this degree. Clancy was an embarrassment on the Larry King Live show. He seemed to have absolutely nothing to say -- just like his latest book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Quick synposis of the book: Clancy builds bad guys out of straw and shoots them in the head. Poor characterization, zero character development and a very predictable plot make _Rainbow_Six_ a tedious read. The bad guys are written as just plain evil and seem to be a punching bag for Clancy's political views. The good guys have no flaws, are super wonderful and never lose (or really even make mistakes). Only &quot;red-shirted&quot; ones we've never met get killed. They seem to solve all of their problems through lucky breaks and via direct revelation from the author. I'm expecting the next novel to be about evil, rabid, Ebola-infected kittens which the Rainbow team will spend the novel running over with steam rollers. Clancy has done well before so I thought that the awful _Executive_Orders_ might have been a fluke. This one was even worse. Maybe the problem is that Clancy is now so popular that he doesn't believe in editors anymore. _Rainbow_Six_ looks more like a draft than a published novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just completed Rainbow Six today and felt compelled to send out the message far and wide to my fellow Clancy fans that aliens have apparently abducted Mr. Clancy and left in his place an unemployed screen writer from Hollywood! How else can we explain Rainbow Six?As with all of the Clancy novels I picked up Rainbow Six the day it hit the streets. I trudged through the book wondering where had the Tom Clancy I have come to know and love gone? The story was uninspired, and lacked the depth of technical insight and action that has made Clancy such a fun read. Every previous Clancy novel has had an enjoyable balance between action and depth of story. Each page I expected that the plot would thicken or the action would pick up. I finally gave up on this expectation at page 700.There is no sense in going on about this book. It was ok, but, so far from the caliber of the novels we expect from Mr. Clancy. After Executive Orders and all of the wonderful stories he has given us I can forgive R6, but, please Mr. C come back and write a true Clancy novel. I don't know if I could stand another made for TV screen play reject."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good book, especially since it covers the inner workings of a counter-terrorist team. (Isn't one of the major fantasies of American Males to give the bad guys of the world what they deserve?) My only problem is the plot line too closely resembles that of &quot;Executive Orders.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading and enjoying every fiction work I was looking forward to get hold of this book ... and was badly disappointed.What I criticize most in this novel are the repeating descriptions of characters and their goals. It's really hard to reread something in only slightly different words what's been 100 pages above.The story: Good start but with every page more predictable. Reading this book you wait for something to happen all the time while reading repeating stuff. I used to be intriqued by his other books, not wanting to take a break but in this book I had to otherwise I wouldn't have finished it.Next point is the language: I understand that Mr. Clancy wants to make sure about the mental and emotional state of his characters, but I think that the style he used is not what I expect in a book but rather in some bad movie.Another and minor point: There are some words in german, or that's at least what I thought they should be - but most of those were spelled incorrect. Maybe they have been 'americanized' and thus have been altered, otherwise I would interpret this as being ignorant.Bottom line: if you don't know the author read one of his older works, if you know him - skip it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having never read Clancy before I really enjoyed this book and has encouraged me to go buy all other five that I am missing. I was a little intimidated by the size but once you start you just can't stop (kinda like those potato chips) congrats to Clancy for this amazing read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Shall we rate the Clancy books?1- Red Storm Rising; 2- The Hunt for Red October; 3- Clear and Present Danger; 4- Without Remorse; 5- The Sum of All Fears; 6- The Cardinal of the Kremlin.In the second division: 7- Patriot Games; 8- Debt of Honor; 9- Executive Orders; 10- Rainbow Six (Popov, at least, is an interesting character).A note about Clancy: I really wonder about some of his facts. I'm a geologist, and I've noticed how he gets geologic information wrong. In Rainbow Six, he has a geologist talking about how gold is found in a &quot;quartz formation&quot;. &quot;Formation&quot; has a specific meaning in geology, and no real geologist would speak of a gold/quartz occurrence in this way. By the same token, in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, he states that basalts have high background radioactivity, which is exactly wrong.This is not nitpicking. It makes me wonder how careful he is with the rest of his facts. I'd like to hear some comments on his accuracy from people who actually know military hardware and tactics."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a longtime fan of Clancy's earlier work (Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Sum of all Fears, etc.) I found myselfgreatly disappointed by this novel. An earlier reviewer noted that with the fall of the Soviet Union Clancy has been searching for a true villain. While the action throughout this book was fun and exciting...I had a hard time swallowing the plot. To think that extreme left-wing doctors and biochemists would plot the demise of the human race is absurd. With all that is going on in the world today, surely he could have found a more realistic terrorist plot to write about.Normally, Clancy is meticulous in his research. However I found his descriptions of the terrorist tree-huggers to be far from my experiences with people concerned about the environment. Come on...environmentalists don't drive hummers and vegans don't eat eggs! I never thought I would ask Tom Clancy to \\"Do more research!\\"The finally at the end was the last straw...I found myself reading it only because I had read the previous 850 pages. Not only were the antagonists' actions unbelievable, but they were simply out of character. To have a former FBI employee (Hendrikson) tell the group of untrained tree-huggers to make a stand against an elite fighting force that had proven its expertise, was simply ridiculous. And the final ending, the ultimate punishment for the terrorists, was like a scene from a bad hollywood movie.Sorry for the rip on this normally great author...but I really expect more from a Clancy novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like all of Clancy's books, it's a good read when you don't want to have to use your mind much. I own the hardback, and the Kindle version leaves stuff out, mainly the prologue. What's up with that, Amazon?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. After reading &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, I picked up this book and rarely put it down. I would recommend this book to any reader, especially those who enjoy the action portions of Clancy books more than the political."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having never read a tom clancy novel before, I originally began by playing the great series of rainbow six PC-CD ROM games and thoroughly enjoyed them. This is what motivated me to buy and read this book and I must say it is great, The story rips along at a good pace not dwelling on too much political junk which can be boring. It's main focus is Clancy's mysterious ex CIA/Navy seal character of John Clark/Rainbow six, originally named John Kelly.The plot explains so much that is is the games as well as being a great action novel but with a plotline which is a nice change. It pulls in an ex KGB agent gone mercenary, a team of bio weapons scientists doing nasty experiments on people as well as a good use or technology currently in use with the military.The team clark ocmmands is named rainbow and is a multi-national anti terrorist force combining the best people from different countries around the world including british american, german and french etc. Having seen all the tom clancy films and reading this book I was then prompted to read his many others and I must say I can never wait for the next novel to come out and especially look forward to the suggested rainbow six movie."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of the best Clancy books. Do not pay attention to the 1-star reviews where the reviewer never even finished the book... they obviously don't know what they are talking about. Also, Clancy is writing about environmentalist extremists, not any certain ones that actually exist. The 1-star reviews seem to think that Clancy did not do his homework. His story is quite possible under the right circumstances. This book is a must-read. However, if you want action in every page, try a different book. In real life action does not happen every second. Expect an action scene every 200 pages. The action scene will last probably 20 pages, maybe a little more. But they are awesome! The final battle is a piece of cake, however...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I listen to the audiotape/s read by David Duke and i must say that Duke did Clancy well. I first became familiar with Duke with the audiotape/s of Plum Island. I knew that I would love Clancy read by Duke. Thanks Duke for not disappointing me.Rainbow Six is a thrilling story about rescuing the good guys and retiring (killing) the bad guys. The Navy Seals come to mind when I think about the types of rescues that were featured in this book. I am glad that I did not have to read this book as 700 pages would have been a bit much. I hearby recommend to all the readers of books. if you feel as I do about good but lengthy books, get the audiotape/s instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It doesn't seem possible that Tom Clancy wrote this book. The characters have no depth (John Clark and Domingo Chavez don't even resemble the same characters from the Jack Ryan series), the socio-political elements are one-dimensional and the book is filled with jargon and idiomatic expressions that Clancy never uses.I've just finished reading non-stop 5 Clancy books, starting with the &quot;Bear &amp; the Dragon&quot;, and then reading in order from &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; through &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. Each of these books were addictive and provided insights on a wide variety of levels. You could get into the minds of the characters and understand their multi-dimensions.I'm having trouble finishing &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; as the characters and plot are so superficial.Hopefully &quot;Rainbox Six&quot; was written by a ghost writer!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read some of the reviews by some people and it seems like they have not read the book or just decided to trash it because tom clancy is not one of the run of the mill leftist authors. Its one of the best of his works and if you want to get more into the book you should pickup the PC game its a lot of fun also."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is excellent but if you want action on every page, you will be disappointed. Basically (not to spoil the book) there is one big action scene, then a hundred pages, another scene, a hundred pages, and then the same pattern two more times. Otherwise, an excellent read. It is also easy to read even if this is your first Clancy book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I like how the spies where those special Uniforms. the characters did many exiting stuff. I gave this book 1 star because it taught children bad stuff. This is the most wonderful book I have ever read. cheap too! I would recomend it for you."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While my expectations were much higher for this book, I did get a good laugh at the end. Other than that, I wrote the story about 100 pages in, the political rambling on various topics got old really quick, and the perfection of the Rainbow group was boring. Also, I felt that the characters were never really developed. I'd skip this one and read Without Remorse instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow 6 started well enough. The action and pace is typically Clancy, but after that, the book goes downhill. Characters are shallow, and we never feel for John Clark and Ding as we felt for Jack Ryan. The plot is not as believable as Clancy's Ryan novels and the bad guys even less so. As a Clancy fan, I felt a little cheated. From anyone else, this might have been a decent enough book, from Clancy, this is a let down indeed. I keep flipping the pages thinking it will get better, I was wrong."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"First of all I am a big fan of Mr. Clancy but his latest novel Rainbow Six was absolutely disappointing. It seemed like someone elso wrote this book or maybe Mr. Clancy finally burnt out (after all he is writing too much anyway!!). These are the main reasons why I was so disappointed: 1. The set-up of a NATO anti-terrorist unit - why were about 80% of the members US soldiers (so far I haven't heard of any successful military anti-terror operation by US forces). By the way there are 16 nations in NATO (soon to be 19). Why was there an Israeli operator - didn't know the Israelis are part of NATO yet? The French are only political members! 2. Why on earth would souvereign states like Austria, Swiss and Spain call in a NATO force and not use their own highly specialised anti-terror forces. 3. I've never heard of any SpecForce that went after the heads of terrorists rather than the body itself. Even with the emerge of body-armour there is no need for head-shots 4. The abuse of my native language (German). I've read many books in the English original but I never discovered anything like Rainbow Six 5. And finally there was no life in the characters of the story unlike in the Rest of Mr. Clancy's highly rocommendable work. This - my opinion - is of course open to discussion."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"First of all I am a big fan of Mr. Clancy but his latest novel Rainbow Six was absolutely disappointing.

I couldn't put the book down. At the end of the book you want it to keep going. A Masterpiece!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Nowhere is the decline of Western civilization more evident than in its art, and Mr. Clancy's latest attempt at a thriller is artless indeed. Poorly developed characters, a plot line written with aspirations for the silver screen (and not the page), and Mr. Clancy's nauseating platitudes to the gods of technology make Rainbow Six among his worst in recent memory. If he cannot be persuaded to take early retirement, then perhaps he might recall those early days of red storms rising when the desire to tell a great story superceded the need to placate a great and growing ego."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked this book a lot and I personally believe that Tom Clancy is a great author. This book had it's strong and weak points. On the strong side, the plot and story line were great with much detail throughout the book. On the weaker side, though, the book seemed to have too much time where nothing happened. Just training, more training, and waiting, and more waiting. When action came around, it was superb, but throughout the book it was too sparse. Overall, I liked the book and can't wait for the next Clancy book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, I was excited to read his new book, but was very quickly disappointed. His repeated phrases and tired plot of commandos against crazed environmentalists was awful."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Those poor trees"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Bottom line: if you like Clancy's previous works, you'll like this one as well. No, it isn't his best work, and yes it is a bit repetitive at times. And I'll leave the realism of the plot to others more technically qualified than I. But as a generally believable and suspenseful work of fiction, Rainbow Six succeeds. A good, if not quite great read. The only question remaining for Clancy fans may be: where can he take the series from here?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual, Tom Clancy seems to have tweeked a few &quot;Left Wingers&quot; with his drawing a definite line between right and wrong. People that are so offended by Clancy's portrayal of left wing fringe groups would be better off going to their &quot;candlelight vigils&quot; and reading John Grisham. Once again, Tom Clancy has written a thought provoking thriller that me turning pages so fast that I didn't have time to look for &quot;Spelling and/or Grammatical errors. As Clancy carefully weaves his plot and builds to a suspenseful climax, I'm taken to another place and time where there are real heroes. I highly recommend this to all REAL Clancy fans and I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It was easier for me to predict what was coming next than it has ever been when reading a Clancy novel. But it's not meant to be a mystery. It's a wake up call to those who want so desperately to believe that the fall of the Berlin wall was the end of megalomaniacs willing to hurt and kill humans for their own causes. I'm currently reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I recommend it to all those who think the Rainbow Six plot is paranoid and unrealistic. Between the two wars to end all wars the European leaders, led by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, did everything they could to APPEASE Hitler who didn't want to be appeased. Hitler just wanted it all, his way! The European leaders broke their treaties with one another and GAVE Hitler both Austria and Chechoslovakia when he demanded them. Did that stop him from killing, torturing, etc. millions and millions of humans in his attempt to cleanse the world of those humans he believed were POLLUTING the world? Did that stop Mengele from EXPERIMENTING ON HUMANS??? Remember - World War I was called &quot;The War To End All Wars&quot; and the world really believed a Hitler was not possible and/or that he could be negotiated with and appeased. &quot;Positive Thinking&quot; did not work then and it won't work now. Rainbow Six six is a realistic and hopeful book. It's saying that if we remember history and stay prepared we can prevent the terrorists of our time from escalating the world into a THIRD WORLD WAR!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy delivers again as only he, the great master of the techno-thriller, can."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read all of Clancy's major novels, and this one was boring. I finished it (simply to see how the story turned out), but it took me three weeks and wasn't very enjoyable.The armed services men are great, men are strong (but can't handle babies), corporations need to be watched very closely (the're so prone to evil), and environmentalists are the enemy. These themes are all laid on over and over again.This book and Cardinal of the Kremlin will go down as Clancy failures. My copy will be available at my library used book sale for a dollar."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In the spirit of classic Clancy novels, techno-talk that we all love, action scenes that Spielburg only wishes he could come up with, Rainbow Six is....not among them. Rainbow Six, in my humble opinion, having read all of his works, is his weakest to date. The story lines are elementary, the dialouge is forced, the action scenes, usually superb, are weak and the plot is something that could have been ghost-written by Pieznick or whoever in his bathtub. Clance; what happened, man? All that money boring you? Dulling the brain? Dishearted over the Orioles? You owe it to your loyal fans like myself; who own every one of your books and who are trying hard to not conceed #1 to Stephen Hunter. You're better than this. Don't rest on the laurels. This latest effort is stunningly mediocre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Quit on this book several times....finished it out of boredom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books except Rainbow Six. The plot was confusing, no idea of what the plot was supposed to be until better than halfway through the book. The book lacked direction, had no real character development. The length of the book could have been pared down and would have made for less boring reading. The commitment of the bad guys, their love of nature, was endlessly dribbled in most of the pages of the second half of the book, so that more pages of the book could be filled . The space should have been used for better plot development. Overall, this book was very dissatisfying for a major Clancy novel. I shall hesitate before venturing to purchase the next one. Get an editor and trim down the inconsequential garbage that seems to abound in the stories more and more. I give this book a zero star, even though the rating is one star. Amazon.com doesn't have a zero rating!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has been one of my &quot;must reads&quot; since I began with Jack Ryan's exploits however many years ago. In my opinion, Without Remorse - the novel Clancy used to explore the character of Clark - is probably his most exciting and darkest work. When I found out Rainbow Six was a &quot;Clark novel&quot; I bought it and read it immediately. I was disappointed by it. Perhaps that comes from the cautious nature of an anti-terrorist team. Perhaps that comes from a novel concerning a team that cannot lose no matter what the odds. There has always been a chance of something going wrong in Clancy's work. Here, the only reason you read on is to see how the bad guys will die in the next scene."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This latest book from Clancy is filled with suspense, not to mention his gift for technical explanation. He has always written books true to the times, and this is no exception. I recommend that everyone who loved his past works read Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy, Rainbow Six reviewClancy's tenth is not, sorry to say, a winner. MUCH too long, too MANY shallow &quot;events&quot; strung together by an awfully thin plotline. Giving such a central role to Ebola almost seems plagiaristic, and trying to tie in the Sydney Olympics a stretch too far. PASS! Actually the prologue is the best part of the book. Perhaps the idea is not so much a film, but a whole tv series... the set-up, three different European actions, then some anti &quot;tree hugger&quot; waffle set variously in NYC and Kansas, a defensive action in England, an action in Sydney, and then a final denouement in the Amazon jungle. Even then, nearly 800 pages is nearly four hundred too many."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and this is one of the best. Simply, one of the best. Not as much detail as his former books but it is good to see John Clark again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Not since The Hunt For Red October have I enjoyed a book so much. This is a must read for anyone who likes action, thrillers, or a very good book.I couldn't put it down,I wanted to see what happened next.

People sometimes complain that it was too long, but actually, when I finished, I found myself wishing it was longer. Tom Clancy did an amazingly excellent job of depicting the battle scenes, and the underlying plot regarding &quot;Shiva&quot; is an ingenious idea. Anyone who said this book wasn't good is either a LIAR, or someone who should immediately seek some psychiatric help. Go buy this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The end of the cold war has put many people out of work and one of them might just be Tom Clancy. History will record Rainbow Six as the book that caused many Clancy lovers to move on.Although the concept of an international anti-terrorism force has great potential, Clancy squanders the opportunity by taking on a plot that couldn't be handled even by this bloated 900 page effort. After suffering through page after page of dry character and plot develeopment, I was amazed at the lack of pay-off at the end.If you are the weekend paintball type, this book will probably still turn your crank. If you're like me and love Tom Clancy novels for their mix of real drama and high tech narrative, you will be sadly dissappointed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was probably the best book I've ever read. Honestly, as soon as I picked it up I knew I was about to read something special. My favourite characters were John Clark and Ding Chavez.

In one word, I would say this book is AWESOME!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a great book except for the plot being repeated over and over again.

The kidnapping of the millionaire in Austria is written good and the Austrian Police is described, how it really is. But the large middle part of the plot is not very exciting. Some pages are really boring. Just the last 10 pages are exciting in the book.Not a very good book at all..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The actions and training scenes are great and at times explosive.

This story is about Clancy's dark super-spook, John Clark, and his international counter-terrorism team. One plot line in this story portrays an effort to loose a deadly virus into the world.

The book just isn't up to the standard that I have come to expect from Clancy, and by the way I love the long-winded detail oriented expanations and descriptions typical of his novels. Clancy is the master of the genre, no doubt, in my opinion. I don't care for the &quot;team concept&quot; that Clancy uses here and in his recent co-authored works. I also didn't buy the attempted hijacking of the airliner. What are the chances that several members of a new, international anti-terrorist team would just happen to be on the only aircraft in recent times to be hijacked? There were other things that I felt were incongruous, which I certainly didn't expect from this author. There are many good parts in this book but not enough to save it from mediocrity. Well, at least I have Patriot Games and The Hunt for Red October left to read from this great author."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Personally, I thought that this was the second best of his books that I've read (I haven't read all of them, mind you). The only one better is The Sum of All Fears.

This book is much too long. Which is too bad, because the basic story is good and the action sequences are very good. However, it would have been a much better book if it had been boiled down to half its size, or even less. In order to get at the story, you have to wade through page after page of pointless introspection, needless description, and unnecessary dialog. As a long time fan of Clancy's work, I was disappointed. == Come on Tom, you can do much better than this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has written a hard cover version of his Op Center series. He uses his familiar characters but does not develop any new plot ideas. He borrows the Ebola virus from his previous book and sets Clark in an Op Center look alike. It looks like this genre may have run it's couse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't know what's going on these days, but several of the good thriller writers are beginning to let their personal political beliefs get in the way of creating great fiction. First it was Clive Cussler, whose latest book is a nutty paen to xenophobia, and now it's Clancy (a much better writer) who lets his extremist anti-environmentalist views screw up what could have been another solid book in the Ryan/Clark series.What's really a shame is that Clancy is such a good writer that you cringe when he comes up with a preposterous book like this one. While the action scenes are up to his usual snuff, the plotting, characters, misogyny, conservative rhetoric and even some of the technology are just awful [sigh].I've read all of Clancy's own books, and until now the works, while of somewhat variable quality, have generally been worthy of their length (unlike the godawful OpCenter and other series to which he lends his name just to make a buck.) Rainbow Six, however is the first Real Clancy from which I came away disappointed. Tom, PLEASE get an editor to go over the next book and go back to well-crafted thrillers...instead of this well-written but poorly crafted piece of polemic."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Geez, Everytime Clancy writes a new novel it seems things get more and more the same. He seems to take marvelous characters and cut the heart out of them. Then just to top everything off, he appears on the back of cover looking like a fighter jock ready to launch off the Eisenhower. Has he perhaps become a &quot;wannabe?&quot;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good reading, Rainbow Six draws the reader in nicely. However, the plot has some weaknesses, the ending is a bit on the ludicrous side, and Clancy's &quot;good guys&quot; seem to be saying that anybody who cares about the environment is a complete nut and to be a &quot;good guy&quot;, you've got to only want to exploit the environment.Clancy -- you should keep your politics out of your writing. It's a lot more interesting to read when you stick to what you know."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not the best from Clancy. Clark and Ding are good characters,I was looking for something like &quot;Without Remorse&quot;. The bad guys are a little thin. They are too ambitious in their evil plot. How they go about their Project is not too credible. I believe there are some fanatics out there who may dream about doing something similar, but they would not be able to control security as they have in this book. We can't keep governmental secrets in the highest places, as the book shows, what makes eco- terrorists better at security?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book Rainbow Six is a well crafted and very exciting thriller from Mr. Tom Clancy. I read it and couldn't put it down. It ranges from intelligence and espionage to an all out global biological threat. This is one of Clancy's best. Mr Clark and Chavez are very much so the people we would all like to be. If you like true thrillers Rainbow Six is for you."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have just finished reading Rainbow Six and Clancy has done it again. As an avid John Clark fan for years I couldn't wait for this one. And trust me it was worth it. The entire book very tactfully kept Jack ryan out and focused on Rainbow and its team members. The first chapter was a nice tease as what would come throught the rest of the pages. The only thing I thought was weak was the ending. Almost all of Clancy's books the ending is pretty believable. I don't really think the DCI would actually just let Clark do what he did(Idon't want to give it away for others.). But he did let Clark take care of the bad guys and in a very unique way only Snake could think of. Other than that little thing I was thoroughly pleased in this latest installment of Tom Clancy's books. I definately reccommend this book to anyone who likes to read Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I speed read this book - it is one of the most boring &quot;thrillers' I have had the misfotune of reading. This book is a rip off and yet another example when an author gets rich and forgets that which got him/her there in the first place and simply mass produces drivel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It kills me to say this, it really does, but Rainbow Six is a bit of a dud. I am afraid that TC did not have his full attention on this one. The pieces are all there, but they just don't connect in the inimitable Clancy fashion. There is a lack of focus both to machinations of the bad guys, and the heroics of our heroes, the plot meanders hither and yon, and the denouement I found totally completely predictable and therefore boring. Nonetheless, I did little but read it over the course of 2 days, however I fear that Rainbow Six will not be re-read and savored numerous times. If this had been a first effort, straight-to-paperback work from a new novelist, I would be satisfied, as with a Big Mac grabbed on the run.....but it is certainly not the multi-course, gourmet feast I would expect from the latest Tom Clancy yarn."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy as always gives us good solid action and the characterization of Clarke is good. (Warning I give a bit of the plot away here) Where this book falls down is one too many times to the same villanous technique using the same virus as in the last book. And his chacterization of ecologists as the bad guys left me with my belief unsuspended. As an action tour de force this is quite good so long as you do not stop and think about the premise. Hope the next Jack Ryan book is better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If your a die-hard Clancy fan, go for it, if your not, then skip it. This is just another tired killer virus novel, that has been done much better way too many times. Mr. Clark in &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and in the Jack Ryan series was always well done, in this novel he's not done at all. Talk about a let down, I was *very* disappointed... Poor Plot, really bad editing (mispelled words, poor grammer, etc.)Poor Character development, way too long, and an incredible mismanaged climax (finish) and to top it off we have to listen to Clancy's right wing rants and raves throughout the book. So much anticipation, so little satisfaction...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Certainly not up to the standards of originality found in HFRO or Cardinal of the Kremlin. Tom, you've already used a death virus against the world.On characters, Clark and company are not saints, the efforts to make the characters more &quot;real&quot; comes across as contrived. The only interesting character was Popov, because his greed and questioning were real. He (Popov) would have figured out the dastardly plot about 200 pages earlier. At least he got the gold in the end.One other note Mr. Clancy, I do not need to be told fifty times that all the dumb terrorists are either dead or in jail, I got it after the first five. Summary: I have the distinct feeling that this book was a &quot;vehicle&quot; for a best selling author to come out with another best seller. I wish the current reviews had been posted before I bought the book. Re-read Cardinal of the Kremlin for a good Clancy story. He knows how to do it, he needs to dig deeper next time.,"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's great to see Tom Clancy back in his old grove of writing those amazing 1000 page novels with detailed characters, plot, and action. Rainbow Six is by far an excellent example of Clancy's skill as a writer. He is able to bring the reader into his novelic world that contains even the most minute details. The premis of R6 is quite realistic, as are all Clancy novels, to the point that it began to bother me because this could really happen. Another great aspect of R6 are the action sequences that proliferate the book. At each turn, Clancy evokes his tour-de-force trademark writing style with suspence and action. The reader can feel the breaths of the doomed terrorists and can smell the spent rounds from the Rainbow MP-10s. However, the novel does hold some weaknesses that Clancy has not shown in his previous work. The book is relatively short as compared to his previous 1000 page tomes (R6 is only about 750 pages long) and follows a sterotypical &quot;Hollywood&quot; format. Or rather a stertotypical &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; format, as the book is the companion piece (and vice-versa) to the new computer game of the same title. At times it seemed like Clancy was writing a novel that would easily traslate into a video game or movie. This is upsetting becase Clancy previously has written in his own form, allowing a more hapazard but effective plot to delevop. Rainbow Six is slightly (and unfortunatly) similar to the &quot;fluf books&quot; (i.e. OP Center, Politika) that Clancy has penned for their apparent monetary value. Overall, Rainbow Six is an amazing read that is impossible to put down once you have started. The characters develop well and the plot is creative and refreshing. Tom Clancy has hit hard with another amazing novel, but his punch has noticeably weakened a little."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's interesting to note that most of the 'five-star' reviews below of this book are by people who have not yet finished it. Most of the negative reviews are by people who don't like his politics.I'm someone who loves his politics: I like his patriotism, his sense of justice, his take-no-prisoners concern that the bad guys fry. But Clancy over and over tends to write one really great book followed two years later by one he just &quot;phones in.&quot;This book doesn't get started until page 490. There is no attempt at characterization of either Clark or Chavez or Popov or anyone else. The terrorist events are repetitious. The combat situations are repetitious. Even the conversations are repeated over and over: Hey, Tom -- it's not groundhog day!Your &quot;Executive Orders&quot; only a year ago was a superb, brilliant, powerful, moving book. I was counting the months until this one.What happened, dude?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was quite a disappointment to die-hard Clancy fans like myself. All the plot twists that make Clancy superb were easily identified and figured out much too early. Another downer was the addition of too many &quot;super-heroes&quot;. Maybe a reader can believe Chavez and Clark can hit a man dressed in black in a dark room in the head with three shots out of three while running- but two groups of 10+ men, all infallible? My last criticism is of the transparency of Clancy's political beliefs. He let too much of his personal belief seep into the story, and though I AGREE with much of what he said, it makes it hard for the reader to concentrate on the meat of the story. I was severely disappointed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really didn't want to be disappointed with this one. Clancy's fame is well earned after penning such winners as Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. So, setting aside the multitude of grammatical and spelling errors, what's the explanation for the redundant descriptive phrases and shallow dialogue that riddle this story like rounds from an MP-10? Furthermore, I couldn't get past the basic fallacy of the plot, which was that no evil scheme of such cosmic proportions as this one could plausibly escape the notice of the general public. And how about the families of all those Project members? Finally, as if Clark's punishment of the environmentalists wasn't enough, Clancy wastes a good portion of our woodland resources in pages and pages of empty writing which don't provide the readers or the characters with anything useful. If this had been a movie, I would have waited for the VHS version...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have always been a HUGE fan of Tom Clancy's books and went out of my way to buy this one as soon as it hit the stores. I am really sorry I did not read some of the reviews here first. I could have saved myself a lot of time.The book is WAY too long - the eco-terrorists plan is outlined so often by so many characters that I was beginning to wonder if Clancy was being paid by the page. Also, the typos and syntax errors are worse than any I have ever seen in a book being released with this much advance press.Overall, I found the book extremely disappointing. Clancy has gotten lazy in using the same characters once again rather than taking the time to develop new ones - and I won't even mention his portrayal not only of female characters but the way in which is primary characters interact with them.As well, his personal views have colored what was at the core a good story line with lots of action-packed conflicts."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's books have always been strong on plot and weak on character and this book is no different. The problem with this book like many of his others is the lack of depth of emotion you feel for this characters.The other problem with the book is that from such cardboard characters comes card board dialogue. Too many times are the conversations self congratulatory mush. For example: &quot;Hey Ding, hell of a job out there.&quot; Ding: &quot;Thanks man, you're pretty damn good yourself.&quot; This will happen constantly as each character who comes in contact with the successful character must compliment him or her and he/she must respond in kind. The same thing happens when two characters talk about someone we haven't met yet or someone who is not in the room with them. Example: &quot;Clark is a hell of spook.&quot; &quot;Yeah, he is good people.&quot; In other words, everyone is great, perfect. It is a tad annoying.Couple this with the fact that every character speaks the same way. All characters fail to say the word &quot;doctor&quot; but rather call the person &quot;doc&quot; . Ding calls his wife &quot;doc&quot;, the secretary of treasury calls a professor &quot;doc&quot;. Too many characters use the phrase &quot;hell of a ...&quot;, i.e. hell of a job, hell of a guy, etc. etc. All characters love to describe each other as &quot;good people&quot;. So not only are they cardboard characters, they all sound the same.Clancy's plots are usually engaging and is the primary reason to read the books. Additionally, this one has the added bonus of not having Jack Ryan in it, the most unlikeable hero ever. He is really just refered to in the third person which is how I hope he remains. In fact, the main characters are the only Clancy heros worth following: Ding and Clark. As long as the book focusses on them and their exploits it is wonderful. When the non-combat dialogue shows up that is when you might want to skim. Overall, a good book, but if you are going to buy it wait for the paperback because it isn't worth 17.00."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy at his best! Rainbow Six was a classic techno-thriller, based on his heroes of Clark and Chavez. Don't think for moment that such bio-warfare is &quot;impossible&quot;. Clancy keeps you on the edge, what next kind of reading. Hard to put it down once the action begins, and that starts with the flight to England. I truly enjoyed Rainbow Six. What's next?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's 10 novels. I consider myself a fan of his work. Like many prolific authors, however, Clancy's later efforts do not measure up to the early ones. I recall being totally absorbed by &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was a good book, but not a great one. I found the story to be predictable and far too similar to his last book, &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. My favorite Clancy character, John Clark, has been reduced to a beaurecrat (albeit, one who kills his enemies). In &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, Jack Ryan has become the President after most of Washington's politicians are eliminated by an act of terrorism. Clark and his Son in Law-sidekick, Ding Chavez, are the instrument of revenge for the terrorist attack. I felt that there should have been more reference to Clark's relationship with President Ryan. In fact, it is not until the end of the book that the name &quot;Jack&quot;(refering to Ryan) is even used. The Clark-Ryan relationship of the past and present should have been more a part of this book. In short, save your money and look for another book to spend your time with."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a very good book, a Tom Clancy classic.

If you like books on spec ops this is the one for you. The book is a little long at 895 pgs for the paperback. Definately worth it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I rate all Tom Clancy's novels high, but this was one of the best. Great mixture of suspense, action and intrique blend nicely with our visceral hatred of terrorists around the world. As the author points out,just the fear of a highly trained multinational group like this would be a deterrent to many of the events that make our news - if not in 2005, then when this novel was written."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Before reading Rainbow Six, I had never read a Tom Clancy novel. I had a trip planned to Fiji and wanted an action-packed, entertaining read for lazy days on the beach. I had searced on the web for \\"best Clancy novels\\" and found that this was one of his most recommended books.That being said, I liked the book a lot. It was very entertaining and most releveant--given the global struggle against terrorism. I found that the last 150 pages of the book were a bit slow and repetitive, but all in all, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved the book. Clancy spends a lot of time setting up the story, but with action all throughout the story, you hardly notice it. This is definately my favorite of Clancy's books. I've played the video games and just can't get enough of either the book or the games."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"An inventive look at international anti-terrorism team led by John Clark and Dingo Chavez tasked to save the Olympics from disaster. More what if type scenarios that could doom the world. Welcomed diversion from the mainstream Ryan series. The game is addictive as well."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's a pretty good book, but definitely can't match 'Without Remorse', which I read a year ago and still feels like Clancy's best thriller. I've played the 'Rainbow Six' video games, so I have a pretty good feel for the license.Unfortunately, it's gotta be said, this book definitely suffers from recurrent bouts of 'super hero syndrome'. The enemies never really seem like credible threats. The book is great, the characters are pretty cool, but that is about it.It is a page turner, though. Well worth the money. The two flaws I named above are the biggest weaknesses this book has working against it, and the writing never really recovers. There is nothing wrong with being the best of the best, or elite. However, Clancy falls into the trap of cutting the characters very close to boring. We know they're good. But you have to repeatedly read passages of text showing how good the members of 'Rainbow' are.As I said before; not bad, but falls a bit flat after reading 'Without Remorse'. It's like a comic book; very satisfying, but despite being interesting, you won't be that affected by the story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Always like Tom Clancy and couldn't put this one down. Plot took a lot of twists and turns and was very scary. Everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Actually, I was being mildly facetious in my review title. Rainbox Six is the code name for John Clark (as the Six designation in military radio protocol indicates the leader of a given group) and the Rainbow group is an elite group of NATO special ops soldiers set up by order of President Jack Ryan. No sooner is this group set up that they get their first call - a bank robbery at a Swiss bank. Their takedown is executed perfectly, with no casualties to good guys or innocents. Well - you get the idea. Ding Chavez is head of Team Two (the Rainbows are split into two teams of eight men each) and each member of Team Two is profiled and fleshed out, giving the reader a chance to connect with them. Unfortunately, the Team One members are treated like cardboard cutouts, set up to be knocked down. Most are not named and the few that are are barely described. This plot point is so evident in the early going that it's clear Clancy wants to spare the reader the pain of reading about a well-liked character getting killed - which I thought was a bit irritating. He did no such sparing of feelings in \\"Without Remorse\\" and the novel was the better for it.The evil enemy in this one is a group of environmental extremists who plan to exterminate the entire human population of Earth - except of course, themselves and others they deem worthy. I thought it unseemly that Clancy's right-wing tendencies show through so clearly in this novel that he portrays environmentalists on the same plane as Islamic terrorists or Nazis. Certainly Clancy must be aware that even the far left has within its ranks people who are genuinely concerned for human life and would never contemplate such an act. The climax (or anti-climax as described by some reviewers) is deliciously ironic, and even though it isn't the flash-bang of a major battle with automatic weapons fire going in all directions, it was to me a very satisfying and enjoyable conclusion to the novel - it all makes for an entertaining, if somewhat implausible read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In reading many of Clancy's other books, he makes several references to things being too &quot;movie-like&quot; and very naive. Well, that is exactly what this story is. All the events that occur meaning the takedowns by the operative groups are all flawless, where none of the major characters get injured. Very boring.Also, Clancy seems to lack a sense of imagination when it comes to naming his characters. There are four people in this story alone that have the first name of John. Also, his other famous character, Jack Ryan, is named John, Jack being a nickname. In his other book, Patriot Games, John Clark (Kelly) is not present, but a man with the last name Clark is there also. Also in Patriot Games and Rainbow Six, both of the leading Irish terrorists are named Sean. A little repetitive, isn't it? One other is the name Ryan. In Without Remorse, there is a policeman with the last name Ryan (maybe Clancy missed his Jack Ryan and had to put in another one to remind himself of it, i don't know). Though it may not be that important, it still shows Clancy's lack of creativity."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a must read, and you will find the hardcover on almost anyone's shelf.

They are picked from the CIA, SAS and other such organisations.Formed in time for a wave of attacks, an unusual amount. Is it just coincidence, or is someone causing it? Then unfolds the larger plot. Towards the end it all gets very close and anything could happen, you just have to find out what'll happen and can't put the book down till you do. It is a really great book, though not for light readers, being about 1000 pages long!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once upon a time I really liked Jack Ryan, and in a way this might have colored my expectations as I picked up the new Tom Clancy novel. I put it down yesterday, having forced myself to skim through the last 200 pages. Needless to say, it was a major disappointment.I read nearly two hundred books a year, thrillers, fantasy, sci-fi - almost anything goes. And maybe once every third year or so I get a book I'd rather just put down than finish. This was one of them. While things might hold up at cursory glance, the shortcomings appear as you scratch the surface (sadly, by that time you've read quite a lot of the book). The characters are ridiculous and without depth (which is strange considering several have appeared in earlier works) and the storyline is like some cheap Marvel Comics rip-off. The god-like good guys are destined to wipe villainy ass (if the book mirrors the real world all bad guys would be better off committing collective suicide), and if all else fails Lady Luck inevitably comes down on the side of CINC-PINC-PONC, the stalwart defenders of God, Mom's applepie and the rest of the completely defenseless humanity. Of course, while the good guys are defending Society and it's Civilized Rules, they allow themselves things like shooting disarmed people, waving big knives around when interrogating prisoners and attacking and killing civilians in a neutral country.The storyline would like to propagate some sort of intellectual battle between a techno-military vs. earth-protectionist standpoint, but falls short in nearly every aspect. After all we all like to drive cars and watch the telly, don't we.I would have liked to point out several major logical or factual holes in the story, but in doing so I might spoil the fun for someone, and that, although merciful, wouldn't be nice. Those who wish to read the book will find that out for themselves, anyway. Or you could watch the movie which is sure to come, the 700 page book contains just enough material for a 90 minute pyrotechnic extravaganza.If you are interested in reading books by Clancy, pick up some earlier works if you haven't read them. Much better than this, some are even great stuff."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Other reviewers will tell you Tom Clancy knows his stuff. They'll tell you it's a masterpiece.Don't listen to them -- as for knowing his stuff, for a man obsessed with the most intricate of military details, Tom makes some bizarre errors; two examples include referring to CFB (Canadian Forces Base) Gander as RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force -- a defunct entity for decades) Gander and referring to the Heckler und Koch MP5 chambered in 10mm Auto as an MP-10 (the hyphen and number are both quite wrong). For the laymen who wouldn't know about Canadian forces restructuring or firearms details, this is no big deal. For somebody who's written about nuclear submarines, this is as goofy as nuclear physicist writing a paper on subatomic particles being held together with glue and bits of twine.The plot is plodding at times and bizarre. The Stukas ride in a Spanish theme park (right, like the A-Bomb flume in Japan), the injection of Clancy's right wing politics in various spots throughout the book, the almost sad need to reference his glory days as an Iron Curtain writer by repeatedly mentioning the Cold War and the Soviet Union, and the goofy plot that I won't spoil for you mar this otherwise decent yarn.Rainbow Six is good at what it is: military porn. Sure, the starlets may be a little old and they flub their lines, but they'll pass in a pinch. War & Peace it ain't."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is running out of bad guys and plausible situations. The book opens with a potential terrorist attack on a passenger jetliner in flight. Lo and behold, the world's top counter-terrorist team just happens to be there, in transit to their new headquarters in the United Kingdom.While Clancy is known for his intense action situations and eerily accurate military knowledge, I had to force myself to finish this book. Will Tom Clancy kill off the ENTIRE WORLD? Take a guess. Read on as a group of highly intelligent scientists and doctors hatch a wholly ridiculous plan. Count how many times the authors use the word 'niggardly' and wonder why (I counted six). You're better off reading Clancy's 'Cardinal of the Kremlin'. Strange to think that a video game would be better than the book it was based on."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I first started reading his books I thought they were going to be boring, but I found out that once you started reading I found myself right in the mix trying to figure out who the traitor is or capturing the killer right along with the good guys."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've made a few attempts at this book and finally got through it. Admit I'm a peripheral Clancy fan and was really pulled in to the great action sequences, but after a while found that there were too many side stories and got bogged down by the technical details. If you're a Clancy fan, though, I'd bet this would hit the mark."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you enjoy a solid military story this is a book you will enjoy reading. Personally not being a military person I found the story a bit dragging. The start is excellent with a terrorist attack on Russia's largest of oil and gasoline storage facilities which presents a major national problem for the country once it is destroyed. From there they work out a solution of how to capture another county's oil fields to allevite their own shortages and off to a military solution we go. The end of the book has some interesting twists as well which the reader will enjoy. Overall the book is a worth while piece of literature especially if you enjoy military tactics and battles being fought."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A classic by it's own virtue by a great author and a price making tactile books worth reading.

However they were many setbacks and take away from how colorful this couldve been. Like the stereotypical characters that are near Super-human. No traces of character flaws or conflict that actually help create suspense and thrill. Everyone is wealthy with Masters and Doctorate degrees living rather lavishly. The Big Bad is not classism or racism or the human condition, it is organized global terrorism, which only the \\"Westernized\\" nations can fully combat.The constant explanation and reiteration of things (i.e. weapons) and various jumping POVs take away from any momentum, making this novel move at a snail's pace. I don't understand why Clancy chose to narrate and devout an entire detailed , yawn stimulating paragraph to a character cleaning his rifle, when it can be summed into one sentence (i.e. Character thoughtful cleaned his expensive rifle.)The characters I found myself intrigued by were unfortunately not main characters, but were ripe with human characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses (outside of military combat). If Clancy could transfer on how well he introduced these minor characters to his protagonists, this novel would be ten times as better.I continued on through the novel, often skipping paragraphs that repeated the same detail (they practiced this way, they practiced that way, one is french, one is german, so on, so on). The suspenseful parts of the novel for me get lost and bogged down by Clancy's need to provide lengthy exposition."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a book that summarizes what all of us fear but none actually realizes that it can really happen. Tom Clancy has written a fabulous book. The technical descriptions of this book could make even a techno nerd go wild. Although there are some gory details, it is metered out through the rest of the book. The juxtaposition of the incongruous characters (those being the terrorists ans the rainbow team members) evoke a sense of irony also. This has to be one of Tom Clancy's best novels ever."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a awsome book. I am a huge Clancy fan and with a few exceptions love all of his works. This is easily one of his best. It has a wonderful plot and lots of action. The pace of the book just never lets up and it is very hard to put down. I suggest this book to any reader who loves books with lots of action. You won't regret buying it!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Fragments of my life were falling All around as you sat talking Not seeing me with your eyes Not hearing your own lies Not (567) knowing what you're doing To meThis was a great book. I particularly enjoyed the flying ballerinas."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six is the first Tom Clancy book that I've read. It was so good that now it is difficult to find another book to parallel its excellence. As the reader I wanted to become Ding Chavez and lead a team of first class soldiers into battle. I read this book in two days and it is about 900 pages long. I could not put it down! I wish the thing was 3000 pages of the same excitement and fantastic anti-terrorism sequences. If you are a fan of Clancy or thrillers it is your duty to own this book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I waited a long time for Clancy to releae his next novel after Executive Orders, and I'm afraid that Rainbow Six was a big let down.The plot of the book centers around John Kelly aka John Clark - who prior to this book is a complete badass in all of the other Clancy novels in which he appears. So, when I heard R6 would be centered around Clark, I thought it was fantastic.Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my high hopes. Clancy is an accurate writer, and because he sets this book even farther in the future than Executive Orders, he has to come to grips with the aging (or at least, no longer youthful) Clark - and so Clark himself, while certainly at the center of the plot, hardly deserves to be called a main character as his role, while central, is also minor in terms of the number of pages devoted to him and in terms of what he actually does in the story. Instead, the real main character is Ding Chavez, who is also a great Clancy character but doesn't hold the mystery and auora that Clark does.I also think the plotline that Clancy chose, that of Clark starting an elite anti-terrorist group, limitted the story outside the scope of what Clancy does best - set up, and then tell the tales of naval, air and land battles - not the sneaky covert stuff that permeates this book (in fairness, Kardinal of the Kremlin, which centers around exactly this, was a killer book).Finally, the antagonist in this book hatches a plan that is far too similar to the trials that confronted Jack Ryan in Executive Orders - that of an attempted biological attack. In fact, I think to a large degree this problem has haunted Clancy since the Sum of All Fears, where terrorists manage to nuke denver, to Debt of Honor, where the Japanese threaten the US with nuclear weapons, to Executive Orders, where Japan's cohorts in Debt of Honor show up with a new weapon of mass destruction, germ warfare, and now this book, where the exact same plot is repeated again.To sum up my feelings on this book, I would suggest checking out any of the aforementioned books by Clancy, or some of those that I did not mention, before spending money on this. If you're a die hard Clancy fan, you'll probably want to buy this book and you should, but for everyone else, its just not that good and probably not worth bothering with."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"That first novel I read by Tom Clancy and after the first pages I knew his books will soon dominate my private library for English books. They style he wrote is quite weird. Sometimes you think: &quot;hey, I could have been writing that&quot; But Clancy really has a feeling for details that makes &quot;R6&quot; become something very good to read even for people who's mother language ain't English (like me). The multi stranded way of telling many story that melt together into one big story is amazingly well done. At the beginnig it might a little hard to remember everybodies name and function. As soon as everything goes together the book ties you into your chair and doesn't let you go until you finished. By the way, don't let your self be scared away by those 897 pages because you will be through them even earlier as you actually want."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is Tom Clancy at his best.The plot continually develops itself in a logical and compelling way and the descriptions of action are extraordinary for realism and sequence.I truly believe that Tom Clancy has the writer gene in his DNA and he costantly proves this!5 stars!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was awesome. To come up with the &quot;Project&quot; and all its phases you would have to be a genius. The action seemed to always arrive at just the right time. The surprises that Clancy brought about only added to the great quality of this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think the title sums up my views here. It is a good book, but nothing spectacular. It's at it's best during the terrorist takedown scenes: these scenes are fascinating and exciting. Finding out about the men's training is also extremely interesting. When the book is doing this, it's a page-turner. However, the character aspect is kind of week, I never felt that Clancy wrote very good characters. But thats okay, because that's not what this book is about (i feel he goes way too deep into his characters in this.)The book is also bogged down by severalt pointless waste-of-time subplots. So, overall, a good read, but nothing special."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I finished reading this book I was only left with onethought; AWESOME! That, and when is Clancy's next book due out? Thiswas an incredible work of fiction and a great enjoyment to read. I love Clancy's other works but this is my favorite by far. He has really spun a great one here. The characters here think and act like real people, and while this can be boring in some novels( who wants to read about real people? just kidding) it is a treat in this one. The plot is great and the bad guys are bad. Great beginning, holds you the whole way, and the conclusion completes it all. (What else is a conclusion supposed to do?) A very good book that you must buy if you seek huge entertainment."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was full of suspence and over all a great book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"T. Clancy has been dissed for writing in too much detail. But in Rainbow Six, he has seemingly found a fine balance: He has been able to avoid too much technical minutae which led me to skip whole sections of other books (like The Sum of All Our Fears). At the same time, he has still included enough information to give the feel of authenticity. This combination makes for a very informative and still entertaining book. This cannot be read in a day, or on one plane trip. But it is great to take on a vacation, when one has several hours over several days to devote to it.The story has been discussed above. Suffice it to say that Clancy has put together a string of plausible ideas (save perchance the eco-terrorists overall grand design). Unfortunately, we are so used to terrorism these days that each of the other terrorists acts are things we have come to expect on the evening news.Like another reviewer, I find Domingo Chavez and John Clark to be a couple of engaging recurring characters. I wonder what will happen to them next, and worry that like John Ryan, they may get to the place where there is nothing left for them to conquer. We ain't there yet, though, and like thousands of others, I anxiously await their next adventure."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy is an exiting, thrilling book because there is a great deal of action, there are many thrilling fights and brawls, and there are many dangerous situations with bombs, guns, and firearms.One of the dangerous situations was when one of &quot;the banks glass doors opened and a man in civilian clothes dragged a body onto the sidewalk. It seemed to be a man but his head was a red mess.&quot; A place in the book that had action was when &quot;they heard a loud metallic crash that shook the whole world.&quot; A good fight was when &quot;the phisician reacted by dropping away from the gunman behind him with his hands over his head.&quot; In conclusion the book held my attention and was an action packed thrilling book with fights and many dangerous situations. The book also taught me all about terrorist attacks and how they are handled."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Excellent book, but not up to the usual quality of Mr. Clancy. Note the spelling error on p.516.. &quot;break&quot; not (as it should be) &quot;brake&quot;. This is disappointing given the usual exacting preparation of his books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a very good book. It is about a group of international anti-terrorists. They are known for saving high profile political heads. One of their members is an old man who is losing is edge. He has to deal with his loss without hurting the group. He is a man who is a war hero, but needs to settle down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of Clancy's best and should be read by all of his fans. Though it is long (Almost 900 pages) it does read fast and for the most part is interesting. Some parts drag but these are far and few. If you have read Clancy before or want to reading him than this is the book. If you really like it try the game titled likewise and the sequel Rogue Spear both of these while not having many of the same people or missions are just as good"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It seems as though this has been done before. The same ideas, format, novel progression, and hokey idealistic themes are present here that have been in the &quot;Op-Center&quot; drivel, only stretched out to 700 pages. The only thing that this book has to offer is Clancy's detailed explaination of some of today's newer gadgetry. In fact, if one were to review some of the earlier novels and compare it to this book, one would have to wonder if Clancy wrote this himself or if he hired a ghost writer to do it for him. If you must read this book because you have been a Clancy fan, like myself, be sure to buy the cheapest paperback that you can find so that your disappointment can be minimized."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is great. Tom Clancy yet again does a great job depicting the business of anti-terrorism and espionage.

This is the perfect book for someone inlove with NSA and DELTA agincies."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One of the most thrilling and action-packed books I have read so far.You will not be able to put this one down. Exciting from the beginning to the end. For me Tom Clancy reaches John Le Carr&eacute;'s level with this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy, king of action/suspense, has done it again with this New York Times best seller. In this book, you will experience the beginning of the anti-terrorist team &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, from training to be elite, to there last hurrah. If you enjoy Tom Clancy's amazing novels. You should definently take the time to read this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Overall I generally enjoyed this book. Anytime I had a chance to read it I did. However, this book does not stand up to the wonderful writing of his previous books. In general I feel this book suffers from two things. First, the egomaniac/eco-terrorist/billionaire criminal is clich&eacute;d at best and uninteresting at worst. The plot seemed formulaic at times and lacked any real credibility as a real threat to the world (Olympic Security Contract- the need to raise terrorism around the globe to force the hand of the Olympic Committee). Another issue is the \\"tree-hugger\\" as terrorist. This at best seems a little comic book-like and I found myself wishing for a more ruthless criminal. Regardless of whether I liked the character or his motivations, it just seemed that Clancy wasn't able to make me sympathize with him. And I especially felt the story was more than anticlimactic with the ending.The second problem I had with the book was the length. Although I enjoyed the variety of ongoing storylines, I did find myself becoming anxious to move on about 3/4 the way through. This may be an example of an overwritten novel that fails to deliver on the extra words.Again, I generally like this book and I'm glad I read it. I would recommend that anyone picking this novel be prepared for a less than stellar writing performance from Clancy but one that still engages the reader at times and builds anxiety, etc. in the storyline and character development. I would also be dishonest if I didn't think this book could be weaved into an interesting screenplay with characters like Clark."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I will keep this short and get the point acrosse. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. Once you start reading you can stop. There is great action from the first to the last page. I definately reccomend buying this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think this book was pretty entertaining in general. There were a few flaws in the book, but the action was what brought the rating up. One major flaw that really annoyed me was that the \\"good guys\\" would never make mistakes while the \\"bad guys\\" made their mistakes at the most crucial moments. As with almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, the Americans were the good guys. The good guys had to be completely \\"good\\" while the bad guys were really greedy and rather stupid. The action sequences that took place were the good parts of the story. It really is a page-tuner despite the flaw that the good guys were totally perfect while the bad guys made many crucial mistakes. I also think that the suspense in the book was pretty good. In my opinion, the theme of this novel is that not everything is as it seems. The reason to that is because of the conspiracy that goes on in the story.I would recommend this book to people who like to read some exciting action sequences and can live with the unrealistic character stereotype."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"i loved this book the way clancy made it sound almost like it was happening im my neighborhood. my love for clancy have been roused to a higher level. i love it how clancy uses characters from other books like john clark(clear and present danger) domingo chavez(clear and present danger)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual, the last 250 pages of this TC book race along, and I must say, what happens to the &quot;bad guys&quot; is what a great friend of mine said, poetic justice. BUT, the good guys, they're just too good, no flaws, (real people have flaws). I did enjoy the greedy Russian with a consciense, he was my favorite character of them all, Chavez my least favorite, too bad he didn't get knocked off in Clear And Present Danger. It's worth the read if you can get through the sappy family scenes scattered through out the book. My least favorite of his books is Clear And Present Danger, the best two, Sum Of All Fears and Without Remorse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Information overload fills the pages of this novel that never really seems to get on track. When it clicks, there are some enjoyable moments, but those moments are spread out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"i say that this book rocks over to the max wookie its so awesome it should be read to school children in reading class"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Since I got access to Tom Clancy's books back in 1992, I have been a big fan of his books and tried to read all new ones. While the general plot of the book is very good (as usual with Tom Clancy) it seems that he became too assured of his success and he does not pay attention to details that make the good fiction book. I did not like that there were so many places in the book where Tom Clancy repeats his lines over and over. It also appears that Clancy was tired by the end of his book and tried to finish it as soon as possible making the book crippled at the end. One more comment (that is just one more example of his failure to pay attention to the details) - all references to Russian words in the book do not make any sense (it looks like Tom Clancy just opened a bad English-Russian dictionary for pre-school and took the Russia words from there)."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, having read all of his Jack Ryan novels as well as his previous John Clark story, I was excited about reading his new book. But unfortunately, I finished it with a bitter taste in my mouth. The story, while well researched as always, and including all the technical detail Clancy novels are known for, was just too far-fetched. While one could easily imagine his other stories as really happening in the real world, this was just too much to grasp. The majority of the characters were very two-dimensional, leaving you wanting for more insight. Not to say that there weren't good parts...the terrorist takedowns were very exciting, and Popov's role was intriguing, but it didn't make up for the glaring weaknesses elsewhere...and the ending was very frivolous, with the superhuman team armed with everything going against people with next to nothing...he could have done it much better. Overall, quite disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was quite happy with Clancy's work on 'Rainbow Six'. The book had continuous action and Clancy is famous for keeping the stamina high."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't know what some of these people were smoking when they were writing these reviews. This is Clancy's best book yet. He has wonderful details, a great writing technique, and a storyline that even suprised me at the end. This is Clancy's best book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I graciously give Tom Clancy 3 stars for this effort only because he is Tom Clancy. This particular effort lacks his authenticity and believablitity so apparent in his other works. The story line has crisis after crisis always ending with the good guys killing the bad guys leaving the white hats with nary a scratch on them. Only one episode leaves any of our good guys with a hair on their head harmed. Mr. Clancy does his homework and usually packs a devastating punch with his reality and authenticity. I was disappointed with his work but still call him the master. I look forward to his next effort."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am puzzled by the lower reviews of this book. I rate it among his best, though never topping my favorite, &quot;Without Remorse&quot;. This World could use a &quot;Rainbox Six&quot;!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I love everything else Clancy has written, this book was a disappointment. The same Clancy technical knowledge is there, but the plot leaves you wanting more. It starts great, but by the end it becomes a bad spy novel of world domination.

Their mission is to rid the world of terrorists. They have several &quot;missions,&quot; or terrorist attack to take are of. The first mission is at a bank in Sweden. The second mission is in Austria and a group of terrorists took over Mr. Osterman's house. The third mission is in Spain at an amusement park called World Park. That was a truly exciting mission because of all the espionage and planning. The next mission is directly aimed at Rainbow Six.&quot;~ It even takes place at the hospital just down the road. The final mission is too important to tell too much about other than it involves the Olympics in Australia."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is about an antiterrorist group called Rainbow who gets caught up in the biggest terrorist plan ever. This thrilling novel lets you meet the best soldiers in the world. Tom Clancy is an ex navey seal so he knows what he's talking about. This action packed book is the best I have ever read. The story pulls you in from the start and keeps you reading till the end. If I were to rate this book from 1-5 I would give it a 6 if I could, but 5 will do. The only bad part of this book was having to finish it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What can one say about Tom Clancy? His writing may not live on throughout history with the likes of Shakespear, but it will hold a small niche in our society. Clancy is a brilliant man, whose plots are as complex as enjoyable to read. The review by &quot;A reader from Europe&quot; should be totally disregarded. S/he is simply angered by the fact that America has such a prolific author, who by the way has written a number of non-fiction books and is quite intelligent, and that that author tells the truth, which contradicts that readers own narrow perceptions of Europe being superior. Please, no one run from this book because of that one person, it is simply brilliant, and quite enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone with enough free time to get through it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is by far the worst of Tom Clancy's books. The story line is predictable, the characters are all one dimensional, and it is boring. Mr. Clancy had several opportunites to explore the contradictions in the &quot;good guys&quot; that kill for a living and the bad guys that want to kill everyone to restore earth to a &quot;pristine&quot; condition, but he never took them. His bad guys are just plain unbelievable. Even the most extreme environmentalist would believe that a small colony of 5000 people would survive without support from a much larger group. Where are they going to get their fuel? How about supplies for their research? Electricity? Spare Parts? The bad guys act like these things will magically appear. Totally unbelievable. One of the main tasks of an author is cause us to suspend our disbelief in favor of the story. Mr. Clancy failed miserably. If you are not a die hard Clancy fan, avoid this stink-a-roo at all costs."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Only after reading Rainbow Six did I look up the reviews. I must agree with what seems to be the majority opinion...Clancy's worst to date.I was annoyed by the repeated phrases, the unnatural inclusion of technical information, and what seemed like a lot of filler."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A Clancy as some of his readers want him. I am personally absolutly dissapointed. The writting is as usually good. But first the plot is thin. He could have shortend the book to 100 pages. The worst is the research. For example two out of three german words were misspelled. In school you would get an F- for that kind of spelling. Second Mr. Clancy interpretation of terrorists is laughable. Please Mr. Clancy do us all a favour, try harder next time. I might buy you again. A fan"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like many other reviewers, I loved Clancy's first novels. To date, the only novel of his I genuinely disliked was Debt of Honor, his other novel focusing on John Clark. Instead of focusing on his strengths, Clancy instead tried a character study - and transferred so much of his thinly-veiled right-wing paranoia onto Clark that it was a thoroughly unpleasant read.But with Executive Orders, I was again on Clancy's side. Though I found the black-and-white world (Jack Ryan &amp; friends: good; Everyone else in government not appointed by Jack Ryan: bad) somewhat difficult to swallow, the drama was wonderful, and more than anything else, Clancy could make you feel like you were there. And the climax was fantastic.I was very, very disappointed with Rainbow Six. The numerous editorial failures (typos, grammatical errors, dangling plot threads) were as distracting as I've ever read in a mass-market book. The lack of any attempt on Clancy's part to tell the story without preaching makes me wonder *why* Clancy's telling the story in the first place. Does he want to tell us a story? Or does he simply want us to recognize that believing in the conservative cause is the One True Way? It's probably somewhere between the latter and a multi-million dollar advance.Overall, the battle scenes with the terrorists are richly told. But Clancy's endless repetition of what good men Chavez and Clark are (do we really need to hear *one more time* how much they like Ding's new baby?) made me tire of both, and I really liked these characters in both Patriot Games and Executive Orders.All in all, this book is an example of lazy writing. No attempt was made to clean it up: and we're left with reading the same character descriptions over and over... just in case the last 15 times didn't make it abundantly clear.Others may disagree. But when the book ended, I was sorry I'd spent that much time wading through a sub-par novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is not one of Mr. Clancy's best works. He uses the same &quot;menace&quot; as the last book. In all his previous books the scenario had some credibility, this does not. The opening chapter action stretches credibility beyond the breaking point. Even the jacket photo of Mr. Clancy is sad. He has on a custom made flight suit with the blue silk scarf, bomber jacket, scrambled egg hat looking like some romantic hero in his own mind. His politics shine through all this by portraying the Sierra Club types as bumbling idiots, referring constantly to Reagan Airport as though he were reminding us of his hero and a general trashing of the enviourmental movement. This will be the last Clancy book I buy. His story line is tired and it would appear, so is he. I'm truly sorry because his early stuff was some of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Long, slow and not very interesting. I took the recommendation of other readers and also bought Joe Dalton's latest THE OMEGA MISSILE-- much better. Recommend you do the same."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Uggh, I never thought a Tom Clancy book would be so bad. A recycled plot line is only made worse in it's second try.One of the characters sums it up best when he learns of the sinister environmentalist plot against the world &quot;It's like something from a bad movie.&quot; Come on, Tom! Give us a break"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's most recent book is by far the best. If you don't like Tom Clancy's detail and techincal nature this book ISN'T for you, but for all you Tom Clancy fans out there this book IS! This book's marvelous descriptions put you right in the action. Tom Clancy knows how to write a good and highly addictive book. I read this book in a little under 3 days. I just wish Tom could write 'em faster than i could read 'em. Thats my dream. Bottom Line: Another outstanding book from my favorite writer, Tom ClancyP.S. I thought the cover picture on the back (Tom Clancy in a flight suit and a patriotic scarf tucked in the collar) was a little cheesy...but hey, no one is perfect."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have to admit that I am a Clancy fan. I have read every book he has written, my favorite being Executive Orders. Rainbow Six took a while to grab me but it did grab me. Clancy has a knack for capturing the real &quot;clear and present danger&quot;. The plot in Rainbow Six could have just come off of CNN or Fox News.It's a good read and I highly recommend it.Al Lachner"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was extremely disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest work. It falls short in all areas where he is normally praised.The dialogue in the book is poorly written. He frequently uses all the names a character has in one brief discussion. After the second or third time it became simply boring to read everyones name.The level of detail used in R6 is very substandard. Clancy only mildly describes weapons, scenarios and tactics. High intensity encounters are normally over in a few paragraphs.I can see a reason for this though. In real life these encounters would be over in a matter of seconds, in the best case. It seems awkward from a normally thorough writer.I also found the plot to be very predictable. Normally you get a general feel for what is going to happen and then are suprised at what takes place. Not in this book.Two stars may be generous."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Being an avid Clancy fan, I was looking forward to this newest effort. Liner notes sounded cool. I thought, &quot;Clancy ought to be able to put together a killer with this plot.&quot;Well, it was a killer all right. This is by far the worst novel Mr. Clancy has written. Now, with a writer of his caliber, this would normally mean that it was still better than most books out there. However, in this case, it doesn't. If fact, I can't remember a more awful novel I have read voluntarily.The characters, usually a strong point for Clancy, are complete cardboard cutouts. The plot is inane. And the ending is anti-climatic to be generous.Save the cash and borrow the book. You may need to read it only for reference later on when a conscious Tom Clancy writes another good book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I fear for Tom Clancy's future as a writer. This novel is terrible. Three weeks on the New York Times' best selling fiction list is a tribute to the loyal following that Clancy has developed, me included. But, this book squanders that asset and insults the reader.The book is overly long. Where was the editor? The same lugubrious pontifications are nauseatingly repeated over and over again. I found myself skimming over numerous paragraphs, finding them uninteresting, repetitive, and off the point.Except for the fact that I suspect Clancy is hoping for a Bruce Willis shoot 'em up to evolve from this one ton tome, the preliminary terrorist scenes are really off the point and a waste of plot time. Two paragraphs could set that stage.It is also clear from this book that Clancy has a thing about environmentalists. One can imagine that the basic hypothesis of this book came out of a dinner party argument that Clancy had with some environmental activist (&quot;limousine liberal&quot;), probably a woman who is the role model for the Presidential Science Advisor in the book, and this is his payback.After reading this book, (yes I did read the whole book), I will think three times before I buy the next Clancy opus. He's come a long way (down) from &quot;Red October&quot; which is one of the best of the genre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has lost his magic with Rainbow Six. It just plods along with limited thrill. It's a long read with no climax; it just runs out of gas. And why are there typos? Tom, go back to your roots and write more like Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. That's where your magic is."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What can I say? I bought the CD version, and the book was great. Hidden alligences, terrorist Special Operations.........and Clark&amp;chavez. This has it all. The reader is excellent; He Varies his tonality to match the people. I especially like Dimitri Arcardiovic Popov, and interesting character to say the least. Buy The Book; YOU WON&quot;T BE DISSAPOINTED."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Come on, what does Clancy do -- take his other books, put them in a blender, mix up the parts and pour out a new book. Wives getting kidnapped, IRA terrorists, Russian spies, tough husbands, wives involved in the medical profession, etc., etc. Haven't we read this same book about a half dozen other times -- all of them with Tom Clancy's name on the cover. Nearly every character in the book repeatedly utters Tom Clancy's favorite 4-letter vulgarity. And, of course, the dozens of graphic descriptions of bullets entering (and exiting) villan's heads add a charming touch to the book. If you can stomach all of this and then manage not to get bogged down in the huge loopholes, unsympathetic characters and implausible sequences of events, you just might have a fine read ahead of you."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I like Clancy's earlier books but I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. One dimensional characters, a predictable plot-- hey the good guys always win!-- and way too long. You want good action, check out Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE, Bob Mayer's CUT OUT or DRAGON SIM-13, or Bob McGuire's THE GATE."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a refreshing turn from Jack Ryan's character to Clark's less perfect but more human personality. He ain't perfect -- hey, he kills people for a living -- but we love him. Teamed up with Chavez, you know they're bound to find something fun to get into.All the environazi talk is irrelevant. Clancy is one of our best modern authors and this is a well spun tale with a great ending. Some of the details may be hard to believe -- but it's not real is it? This would make a great movie because there are no collosal enormous expensive scenes, other than the taking of human life, one crook at a time. I can't wait to see it.Glad you're back, Mr. C!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual, Clancy has outdone himself. It's about the continuing story of Mr. Clark, and is (this is hard for me to say) Clancy's best yet. I thought Ryan was good, until Clark came along. Wow. You won't put this one down, so get a lot of snacks and cokes ready."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has outdone himself this time. He has taken our worst fears and placed them in a real world scenario that should terrify all readers. His grasp of current events and technology are uncanny in their timeliness. By far the scariest, most plausible book he has written. Thanks for the nighmares!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read, Clancy again shows his stuff as master of the techno-thriller genre. In his latest book, Clancy explores the end game of the fanaticism of intellectual pride and arrogance. His protagonists provide contrast with strong character, honor, integrity and duty in defense of the defenseless. We could use more of these in today's world. Too bad we have to wait another 2 years for his next book. In the meantime, I will watch the news and see if the &quot;people-finder&quot; gadget is real or science fiction."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy obviously has different constraints nowadays like publishers to satisfy, etc. As a result he is having to move with the times especially with the end of the Cold War being witnessed. His usual attention to detail is obviously missing. Some may argue why worry about such trivialities (e.g. the VC.20B that Clark and Chavez use to fly from Canada to the U.K. is not a Gulfstream 4 but a G3!. In the U.K. we talk about a draw in Football - Soccer, not ties!) but things like this should be easily verified and was the thing that won him many fans in the first place. This is a good book and easy to read but when compared to the very high standards that he set early on this one falls well short. It will appeal to the masses who aren't quite so discriminating."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Anyone expecting the quality of &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; will be sorely disappointed. This book is repetitive, illogical and poorly researched. For example - the Sydney Olympics will be held next August while it's winter in Australia. Clancy's plot however, is built on the premise that it'll be so hot during the Olympics that an extensive cooling system will be relied on to help spectators and competitors cope with the 90 degree+ heat. His characters are also uniformly 2-dimensional - see how action man grandad John Clarke's repeatedly bemoans his role as a desk jockey while his macho Spanish son-in-law's (Ding!?) most gruelling experience seems to be a flight from England to Australia - my seventy year old mother complains less than this anti-terrorist superman ... And there is not a scrap of humour on any of the 800 odd pages (not intentional, anyway). Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy can be fun to read, but remember the guy was an insurance salesman, not a grunt, a SEAL, a Green Beret, Delta Force, etc. etc. He can shoot all the guns he wants in the range in his basement but until he steps off the tailgate of a MC-130 Combat Talon he's still a wanna-be. You want authors who've been there, did it, done it and got the t-shirt-- try Stephen Coonts, Harold Coyle, Bob Mayer, Andy McNabb, Joe Dalton, or Dick Marcinko. Just read CUT OUT about an SF guy based here at Bragg and it was good."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Experienced readers have learned to avoid anything titled &quot;Tom Clancy's...&quot;, as it is often inferior work written partially by others. So, with the hardback titled ''Tom Clancy - Rainbow Six'', I was looking forward to more of the REAL Clancy. Was I disappointed! The novel only barely reaches beyond the average X-Files serial book. Absent are Clancy's up-to-the-minute facts, figures and views on world - instead we have a formula-written tome which does not offer anything to the expectations of a usual Clancy fan. I used to buy Clancy in blind faith - I will check the reviews first from now on. Please Tom, unless you really need the money, can you sit down and put your heart and soul into another masterpiece please? Clancy fans will tolerate this book, as we are always hungry for more. But when you're expecting smoked salmon, fish and chips (French fries!) are definitely a bit of a shock. I've rated this book 2 out of 5 because Clancy can do better. As a book in general, it is still 4 out of 5. True Clancy fans will prefer to wait three years for another masterpiece. You set the standard Tom, please keep it up."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Yet again Clancy shows his ability to produce a topical and timely treatment of a 'big' issue in the Jack Ryan world. Despite the underlying theme, a number of errors and naive shallow characterizations mar this book. On reflection I've seen the same problems with characters in some of his other work and gotten over it so what went wrong here? Clancy has upped the ante so much in his recent Jack Ryan series that in seems every sequel must now attempt to construct a credible doomsday scenario. By attempting this in Rainbow Six the evil protagonists lack the credibility they need to be menacing.Clancy thinks he must save the world or more importantly, America from dire consequences to provide adequate entertainment for his readers. This time around unfortunately the high stakes game has worn a little thin. How many times can you threaten nuclear, biological or constitutional catastrophe before it becomes dull and before you run out of ideas? In Clancy's case the answer would seem to be &quot;This many.&quot;. It's never the high stakes alone which make his plots interesting. There was far less at stake in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; yet that book demonstrated Clancy's ability to tell a great story and tell it at just the right time.This won't be my last Clancy book, normally I enjoy his work. I just hope he rediscovers what he's best at. Not saving the world, but weaving a great plot embroidered with the speculation on new technology which he's famous for."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Its been a while since I read this book but I really loved it. I actually started reading it because I played the game \\"Rainbox Six 3\\" on xbox. The game actually holds very true to the characters introduced in the book and reading it actually made the game more fun. As for the book itself the characters are all very well developed and the settings are well described. The plot is very entertaining and your given perspective from both the protagonists and the antagonists. Normally I get bored with books this long but this one kept me interrested the whole way. If you're in need of a good read, this is it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have always been a fantasy buff, but decided I needed a change. I had been playing Tom Clany's Ghost Recon and decided I would try one of his books. I wasn't more than 5 pages into the book before I was hooked for life. Mr. Clancy is a true genius. The story line was excellent and the characters where so well formed.I must admit I was a little disappointed with the ending, but not in a way that would lower my rating of the book. The ending was excellent, I would have just liked to seen it done another way. But I don't want to ruin for anyone considering this book, so I will not go into detail."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having never really read a Tom Clancy novel before, I wasn't quite prepared for the impact that this book had on me. As a lover of books that are are fast paced, I was richly rewarded with 'Rainbow Six'The basic storyline is almost Bond-like in its appeal. Bunch of wierdos trying to wipe out the human population on the planet. Its very detailed and compelling though, with all of its sub storylines incredably addictive, leading up to the grand finale in the Amazon jungle. The action sequences are detailed and very, very tense and exciting.But the main drawcard for this book is the charactars. There is the boss, John Clark, who spearheads an elite group of special forces troops. It is these characters that make Rainbow Six magic. The main theme of this book is the bond between all the soldiers who have to battle their way around the globe to stop the forces of evil. There is a real feeling of friendship and trust in this book, which is what I think Tom Clancy was looking for.You really have to give credit to mister Clancy, he's been in this buisness for a while now, but he still has that hunger to give the reader a book to remember.Well done Tom, looking forward to meeting the Rainbow troops in another adrenilin pumped book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the second book of Tom Clancy's that I have read. This book is a real page turner. I could not put it down. I stayed up to five in the morning reading it sacrificing sleep to finish this awesome counter-terrorists book. This book starts with a bang right from the beginning. It is like a rollercoaster ride: buckle up folks. The only thing bad about this book is that it is only 897 pages. I wish it could have been longer. What a thrill! Some of the things I liked about the book were the characters. John Clark the spook turned bureacrat. Ding Chavez Cia agent turned squad leader. Former KGB agent Popov was a terrific. I really like his character and hope that Clancy would do a book on him or something. If you like in depth characters this book has it. This book really got me angry in a good sense. It stirred up my emotions the way a book should. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book. I have read a lot of reviews were people didn't like this book but I don't see how. I just purchased most of Clancy's other novels and I hope they are as good."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This one was a big disappointment. Missing are the believable military-political scenarios that characterized Clancy's earlier works; in their place, the author inserts a storyline that moves the book from the techno-thriller genre he pioneered into the realm of B-movie sci-fi. The ending takes the right-wing preaching that began to assert itself in _Executive Orders_ to a new zenith."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was one of the best books I have ever read. It had action, suspense, drama, and a lot more. I loved the novel and would recommend it to anyone. I would personally love to see it become more than just a novel and game. I'd really like to see it become a movie. However I do admit there might be a bit too much dialogue."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although I'd read the book several months ago, I still recall it as an exciting and uncomplicated read, compared to Clancy's other books, i.e Red October. It limits the amount of technical jargon and describes how an elite international strike force is recruited, trains and is deployed to various areas around the globe. I recommend it to any Clancy fan's summer reading list."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the only Clancy book that I've actually read, so I can't compare it to any other ones. I also can't make any comparison to other works with John Clark, because I've only seen movies with Jack Ryan. Although, Clark and Chavez appeared in the movie (and book as I'm told) Clear and Present Danger, but their characters were butchered. Anyway, the story goes that Clark and his son-in-law Ding Chavez have been comissioned to start Rainbow, an international anti-terrorist group. They go around the world stopping terrorist acts, while a secret organization is planning to release a poisoned gas at the Sydney Olympics. The terrorist battle scenes are great, but the non-action scenes, while necessary, are a little boring at the beginning, but they begin to gain excitement towards the end. That's another problem though. The book is almost 900 pages! It takes a long time to get to the end! If you love Clancy's other books, you'll probably like this, but if you don't like books that force you to use your brain, you may want to steer clear of this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This may sound wierd, but I played the game Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear which then motivated me to read this book. But I must admit, the book is more exciting than the game itself.What I admire most about this book is the way Clancy placed the character. How he describe each one. So it sort of displays a mini-biography of each character. Some the character's features aren't even related to their jobs. So I wouldn't say there is an EXACT main character. Each part of the story seem to tell a lot about them. Some humor, some action, and some tragic. This book was long enough to satisfiy this story. There was only one small thing that I didn't like (which doesn't really matter but I'll say anyways) is how he put a certian part of the story somewhere in the beginning, and let it out at the end. Sometimes I had to reread a part in order for it to make since.Overall, I recommend this book to anyone which will not be offended by certian words."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you ever feel board and have a few hours to spare, then get and read &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. I read this book when it first came out years ago, and reread it a few weeks ago, and the plot of this book will engulf you and make you want more. The book itself is massive, and so is the story. Granted there are a few dull moments in this book, but then again its action more than makes up for it. If you get excited over action movies or enjoy a good read then definitely pick up this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you are tired of Tom Clancy's later novels because he has lost his ability to keep his story moving due to excessive detail, then you will be pleasently surprised. RAINBOW SIX is a throwback to WITHOUT REMORSE, both books featuring John Clark as the principal character. I grade RAINBOW SIX four stars because it is a fast paced action adventure. I recommend that you read it-you won't be able to put it down.Notwithstanding my grade and recommendation, Tom Clancy has developed two problems which show themselves in RAINBOW SIX. First, this is the third Tom Clancy novel I have read in which the villains use germ warfare against mankind. Tom Clancy is running out of plots. Second, Tom Clancy hates environmentalists, as he has stated on numerous occasions in most of his writings. In RAINBOW SIX environmentalists are made the primary villains and equated with the Provisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army. Tom Clancy is running out of villains. Perhaps Tom Clancy should take a few years off to recharge his creative batteries."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was fairly good up until the ending. For about 600+ pages Clancy builds up a suspenseful plot about bioterrorism while keeping the reader entertained by including several anti-terrorist missions that the Rainbow team goes on. However, the ending is hugely dissapointing as it is a major anti-climax riddled with cop-out coincidences (which are becoming more common with Clancy) and shear stupidity. What could have been a great book was ruined by this.The computer games based on this book are fun however."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was amazing. The story is brilliant. If you like spies, government agencies, espionage, and good action, then READ THIS BOOK! I admit, however, that it does take time. The first half I read in maybe a year...as it was slow at times. I just fell out of my &quot;reading phase&quot;. But, when I boarded a plane for Minneapolis, MN last fall, I decided to open it back up. Starting with the &quot;WORLD PARK&quot; incident in the book, I could not put it down. All I did was read on my vacation. The first half took me a year to complete, but the second half took only days."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a great book! It's very interesting, and keeps you reading. I like the way part of it is told from the terrorists' POV. It gives you a good insight into what they were thinking, and their motives. It also reminds people that they are human beings, and that they are actually quite smart, even though Rainbow was smarter. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Cheers, Mr Clancy!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Im sorry for all you people that do not believe this book was excellent, but, you are undoubtably wrong. This was one of his best books ever. Talk about an awsome plot, it always leaves you to want to keep reading. If you like counter-terror action, this is the book for you.(ie: a paintball player would love this book!!!!!). I would read this book again. I wish they made it into a movie. It would be excellent!!! The missions are lifelike, and make you wonder if there really is a covert team like them. IT COULD BE POSSIBLE!!!!! Clark plays an outstanding role, along with Dimitry Popov. GOOD JOB TO CLANCY ON THIS ONE!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was ther first Tom Clancy book that I read and it was even better than I had expected by word of mouth. The characters were realistic and also very human, the plot was huge yet simple and the action was fast-paced and shocking. If you are looking for a good book to read then pick this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six gives the very inside details of what it's like to be behind-the-scenes FBI agent. If you have completely no interest in crime scene srategies I highly recommend you choose a different book.Rainbow Six takes a little while to get into, but once you hit the teams first climax point, you will be stuck to the plot. The relationships between the teams members also carry the plot to a true American genre.I can't quite agree with one of the quotes on the side covers as &quot;thrilling&quot;, but I can say there are points were you coerce yourself into reading passages again in disbelief."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"All the stereotypes are here: the big men with their big guns, the crazed terrorists with their slightly smaller guns and for good measure he throws in a bunch of mad enviromentalists ready to wipe out the entire population of the earth. It's clear that Clancy stopped doing research for his books years ago (his lack of knowlege is pretty glaring - he obviously doesn't know the difference between the Provos and the INLA) and this book proves that he could no longer bother to think up a plot either. The book is little more that a set of predictable action sequences strung together on the back of an absurd story which, thankfully, is little more than filler.If you enjoy a good thriller, read one of the masters like Forsyth or le Carrier. If you enjoy books written by a computer program, read Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Gives you a different perspective on counter-terrorism. Surprisingly not far from the actual truth although exagerated at times. WEST UP."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I could not put this book down. Rainbow Six had everything that I could wish for; action, suspence, gory details, terrorism, counter terrorism, EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was a great novel that kept me thinking and plotting through the whole book. It opens up with a great action segment and introduces readers tho the main characters. Throughout the book it unfolds a great storyline of espionage and terrorism. Its action-packed and full of suspense.It is about a team of awsome military perfectionists put together by the government in case of a world crisis.The team is called Rainbow Six and is headed by John Clark, an old war veteran/espionage expert. The team travels all around the world tending to terrorist acts that the local police cant control.All in all, this book was simply amazing and i recomend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys action/suspense novels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"or Executive Orders and Rainbow Six are almost the same? I mean, if you substitute Jack Ryan with John Kelly, add or substract a plot or two, it boils down to almost the same thing. Or it's me? I gave this book three stars - one for the effort, one for the lenght and one for the weight, as TC seems to be producing door-stoppers. Maybe he's paid by weight? Word count? He ain't getting paid for the plot, that's for sure.I think TC should take a deep breath and think long and hard whether he wants to write another monster (Executive Orders, Rainbow Six, The Bear and the Dragon). I love books, I love to read, I can read almost anything and I don't mind reading good books twice, but boy, I'm really not sure I want to add another TC to my book collection."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Normally, reading a novel by Tom Clancy has been fast-paced, exciting reading for me. This book, however plods along through what I feel is a rather simple, skimpy plot that has a lot of excess baggage draped all over it. An analogy that comes to mind would be &quot;Literary Obesity&quot;.There are, indeed, moments when the storyline speeds along like a runaway freight train, only to get bogged down in excessive detail and unnecessary rambling, much like being shunted off to a side spur. Trying to keep in mind all the various threads of the story as I continued turning page after page (five days and counting, and I'm still not finished, as of this review date) has been very tedious.It surprises me that Clancy's protagonists, with all the intelligence and security in place that they supposedly have should be so thick-headed not to piece together the puzzle of what is going on. They seem to be unable to connect the terrorist incidents as part of the big picture; they do not suspect the obvious; their lack of brain-power seems completely out of character for the level of intelligence officials they purportedly are. Finally, when revelations come, the information is not treated quite the way I would assume the &quot;good guys&quot; would handle it.I'm furiously reading as fast as I can, merely to get to the final page, to say that I'm FINISHED with this book. Clancy does a great disservice by foisting a book like this upon his readers and fans. Rainbow Six is nothing like Hunt for Red October, or Red Storm Rising, both of which were engaging and entertaining to read from Page 1.Quantity in this instance does NOT mean Quality. To me, Rainbow Six reaffirms why I haven't read a Tom Clancy novel in a long time. Every successive novel that revisits previously created characters like Jack Ryan, John Clark, or Ding Chavez become less interesting to read, even though I really like Clancy's character development.If you MUST read this book, don't pay good money for it. Check it out from the public library.Peace Out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As mentioned by others, this book does not have the most original of plots. In fact, I would submit that this is the least original of all of Clancy's work thus far. The Rainbow troopers are reminiscent of those in Clear and Present Danger, and the Ebola epidemic was in the last book!But it doesn't matter. This is a highly entertaining book, and it's easy to cheer for the good guys and boo the bad guys. The action is well written, and the pace continues through the whole book. We have nifty gizmos, a good body count, and all those other thing we've come to expect from Tom Clancy.As a scientist, there were a few minor points to which I took exception in his scientific explanations, but then the military is Clancy's strong point, so I don't hold these minor quibbles against him. So, I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Granted, the plot is out there at times, I thought the book was well balanced between plot and action. The Rainbow concept is easy to believe and Clancy has some great technical insight. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who likes counter-terrorist action. Good fun book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although I've read everything but those op-center books, the declining quality of his latest offerings caused me to buy Rainbow 6 with some trepidation. I now regret buying and reading this ridiculous book. There is no reason for this lightweight story to occupy 740 pages -- is Clancy getting paid by the word? Clancy should place more emphasis on tight plotting and omit the right wing paranoia. Also, subtlety is definitely not his strong suit. The ham-fisted superhero treatment of Clark, Chavez, and the rest of the Rainbow 6 team is straight out of a comic book. Finally, I won't spoil it by telling you who the villains are, but if you find them as scary as Clancy does, you are part of the lunatic fringe. What happened to the guy who wrote The Hunt for Red October?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a disappointment! For the first time Mr Clancy has filled his novel with cardboard characters and a turgid story. John Clark is portrayed as a bumbling and shortsighted leader whose constant shortcomings are highlighted by the intelligence and abilities of 'Super' Ding. Where has the John Clark from Without Remorse gone. Even Jack Ryan seems to be an incompetent president. It is left to Mr Clancy's newest hero, Ding to almost singlehandedly save the world.Normally I read Mr Clancy's books in one sitting - this one I had great difficulty even finishing.Please Mr Clancy revert to your old writing style, save your political philosphies for your non-fiction works"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and the thing just completely exhausted me ... it just kept you on the &quot;edge of your seat&quot; the entire time. Clancy has outdone himself with his new book. I found the openness of the Project members to be somewhat unrealistic as in a scheme such as this, information would have been on an &quot;as needed basis&quot;, however, there are some &quot;crazies&quot; out there. I found the plot to be very believable. I truly liked this book and I hope others will purchase it and find it as enjoyable as I did."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been reading Tom Clancy's fiction since &quot;Hunt for Red October,&quot; and have enjoyed every one of his books. But, truth be told, the pleasure decreases with each new one. Someone needs to rein in this man's excesses. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; would've been a great read about counter-terrorism, w/ all the wonderful stuff that has made Clancy rightly famous, including the great gadgets, the realities of coping with monomaniacal nutcakes, and the pleasure of seeing the bad guys bumped off by the good guys. Some IRA-types or Middle Eastern fanatics would've sufficed to set up all the requisite bad-guy stuff, and that would have been that. (Yes, I know he's already used the IRA and extremist Iranians, but you've still got to pick something remotely real.)But, for Clancy, who has seemingly been unchained from some modicum of editorial oversight since at least &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, this isn't enough. And so, in &quot;Rainbow Six,&quot; without an editor to tell him otherwise, Clancy is off on a truly ridiculous tangent that detracts mightily from an otherwise great story. The result is that instead of something at least remotely plausible, we've got some American eco-extremists who actually believe they can reduce the world's population -- the world's! -- to a million or so -- that's &quot;million&quot; -- and then start over with themselves as both the saviors and the new leaders, thus allowing Mother Earth to regenerate herself, with buffalo as far as the eye can see, etc., ad nauseum. This is preposterous fantasy. There may well be fruitcakes out there who believe such stuff, but the folks Clancy puts at the center of this nonsense would have to be smarter than that in order to to be as successful in the &quot;real&quot; world as they have to be for the rest of Clancy's plot to work. Put differently, is there one real scientist, as the chief bad guy here clearly is supposed to be, who believes you could fine tune his goal of reducing the world's population by over 99% and have that depopulation stop just before it got to him and his supporters? That you could remove over 99% of man and have everything work out just fine for the remaining 1% and everything else? What poppycock, and the worst part is that it detracts from the good story.Tom, pick one good story and stick with it. And trust me, if you had to choose and picked the counter-terrorism one, you'd continue your best-seller success. On the other hand if you only picked the eco-nuts part of this story, you'd still be selling insurance on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.Maxwell Perkins, phone Putnam."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid Clancy reader, it was with great anticipation that I opened Rainbow 6 for the first time. I found the first several hundred pages to be classic good Clancy but as soon as the primary plot began unfolding, the story began to unravel. In the end I was very upset with Clancy for revealing only his political views and not developing his characters and for stumbling along with a weak plot instead of keeping me dazzled, (see Hunt for Red October or Cardinal of the Kremlin or Red Storm Rising). Clancy's own flat, monosyballic right wing political beliefs led to the creation of flat, predictable, uncompassionate, tunnel-visioned characters, both the good and bad guys. It used to be in Clancy's early writings, you knew he was conservative in his political leanings but it didn't matter because the story and people were so interesting you couldn't put the book down. He has evolved into a soapbox stomping, radical, dogma spewing, screaming-in-your-ear crazy man. I hope he reverts to his old ways or his readers will go the way of the Dodo bird. This, by far, was his worst novel to date. And didn't anyone from Putnam edit this book? typpos, mis-spoillings and sin tax...shame shame shame..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished Rainbow Six last night, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with how it turned out. Clancy has written some pretty good books (and I've read them all) -- Hunt for Red October, Clear and Present Danger, and Debt of Honor being my favorites, but Rainbow Six definitely isn't one of them.Problems (in no particular order):** The length. Did we really need 740 pages to tell this story? I definitely agree with some of the other people here that a big chunk of it could have been cut. The 50 or so pages where Popov is trying to figure out the conspiracy are interminable. ** Clancy's portrayal of women. This is getting pretty insulting, and I can't be alone on this one. ** Implausible. There were some good isolated moments in the plot, but the way they added up was ludicrous -- particularly the whole purpose for the terrorist incidents in Europe. Let's be honest -- the whole point of that was so Clancy could write some pretty cool action sequences (which they were). ** The ending. As usual, Clancy tries to wrap up this huge gigantic plot in 30 or so pages -- and as usual, it doesn't work. He has people flying all over the damn world, back and forth, back and forth -- and it doesn't work well. And the ending definitely made me lose respect for Clark and Chavez, who I've liked up until this point. I mean, were they any better than the Project people when it comes down to it? I don't think so....In summation, the first 200-250 pages are really good, but things drag on after that point. The book still deserves three stars for it's high points -- the action sequences, which are expertly done in typical Clancy fashion. And the reason the first third of the book worked so well was because Clancy didn't waste time getting to the good stuff (like he usually does).I recommend this book to die-hard Clancy fans, but to those with just a passing interest, definitely skip it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read all of his books and let's just this one just hasn't grabbed me just yet. Unfortunately I dropped the book and damaged the corner so I &quot;have to keep it&quot;. Otherwise I would have returned it. What struck me as funny is the fact that both John and Ding are so happily married and that both have kids (or kids on the way). Very non-realistic. I've met a few Spec Ops people in my day and none of them are happily married if married at all. I know I'm nit picking but every single one of his characters are &quot;the best of the best&quot;. The story is kind of like watching one of those PrimeTime movies that the big channels puts on during re-run season. I guess if you can't find another book to read and you do like his style then you might as well pick it up. But don't buy the hardcover...wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six is a great book for a long flight because once you start you don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"John Clark is the ex-Nacy SEAL from the book &quot;Without Remorse&quot;. He continues his secret operational missions by creating the a group the governments of the world keep &quot;in the black&quot;. Few people know of its existence. John is head of RAINBOW SIX. They are better than the best! They combat terrorism mostly. They are called in when no one else can handle the job. To save the lives of hostages, they &quot;take down&quot; the terrorists. Forget prisoners! When Rainbow Six goes in it is eliminate! The hostages are their only concern. Of course, terrorism is not the only thing Rainbow Six combats, but it is the biggest. ***Tom Clancy brings it all to life! Not only are you riveted to your seat by the action and efficiency of the team (which is made up of several nationalities) but by the plot which slowly comes to a boil between it all. I highly recommend this one!***"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Compared to most contemporary novels, Clancy is still great! Accurate technical knowledge is a prime concern to me as a reader, and Clancy comes through. In his past novels the character development and actions are also accurate - they act in accord with their position and portrayed intelligence. In Rainbow Six however, main characters seem blind to obvious flaws in their planning. It it too far a stretch to believe that there are that many people who could keep such a project secret, let alone agree to carry it out in the first place."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think Mr Clancy has given in to pressure to produce or he had a ghost writer do this book from an outline. All my favorite characters were present but the book lacked his normal attention to detail and the story seemed to be aimless and not sure where it was trying to go. the bad guys were presented as a bunch of misguided militant vegetarians, (Vegans) and environmentalists who couldnt see the forest for the trees, the thought of killing every man woman and child on earth to advance the causes of enviromentalism and animal rights was just a little to much to swallow. I wish Mr Clancy would back up and re-group and write a story about Mr Clark during his hey day at the CIA. If you have a 10 hour flight and this book is all you have to read, then go for it. It will be better than staring at the walls!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read most of Mr. Clancy's books and I have generally enjoyed them. Rainbow Six, however, must rate as one of the worst. Part of this book was set in my country, and featured the Irish Republican Army. Though a nationalist and moderate republican, I do not support this organisation and am appalled and embarrassed by its actions. In this book, however, I found myself hoping they would win. I wonder if Mr. Clancy has ever visited this country? If so, he must not have spent very long here. I was utterly offended when he insinuated that the only differences between the Irish and British were their accents and the fact that we are of different religions. This is totally untrue, as the Irish language and culture are both ancient and unique. He also seems to think that all Irish people have a strong hatred for the British. This is also untrue. I am very critical of Britain due to its past and present actions, but i have nothing against its people and to say I hate the British is rediculous. I'm sure that the Irish were not the only nationality offended in this book. Along with 'Executive Orders' this must surely rank as Clancy's worst book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Gave up after about 280 pages - no research done at all. Mr Clancy should use some of his money to take a trip to some of the places he set the action. There is no ambassador in Geneva (Bern is the capital of Switzerland). Bern airport is a well mown field. BA do not fly to Bern. There is no highway from the airport to the town. There are no school near banks in the centre of Bern. Etc. (see review regarding Sydney also) In this day and age why does the guy have to smoke (a pipe) after operations. I echo other reviews about the length of the book - could have been written in half the number of words. Unless you think Clancy is the ONLY writer on the planet don't buy this book - if sales are low enough maybe he will try harder next time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I waited until Rainbow 6 came out in paperback and I'm glad I did, not just for the sake of my carpal tunnel but also for my wallet and sense of having my time wasted. Mr. Clancy should next try writing about Spanish galleons and clipper ships: his long-windedness and tortured writing would propel those ships along at great speed. In this latest epic macro-series, Mr. Clancy has the world being threatened by those liberal tree-hugging vegetarians who want to save the world by killing all but a few thousand of the planet's residents. Do you hear faint strains of something like &quot;we had to destroy the village in order to save it?&quot; The incredulous plot has a team of scientists working for a major biochemical company producing an ebola-based bioagent (does this sound familiar) that will kill everyone on the planet. We have the usual cast of FBI, CIA, KGB, MI6, MI5, SAS subjects and other assorted acronyms and numbers who are blissfully unaware of this menace until the very last minute when our heros rush to the rescue. I'm sure Mr. Clancy intended this book to be a thriller, but it's far more enjoyable reading it as a farce. No mas."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Only Clancy has the knack for making me wince in utter incredulity at the political agenda he puts forth. Never ashamed to wear his politics on his sleave (in blinding illumination) the plot of his latest effort is about as believable as me telling you I don't inhale. Opportunities abound for these supposed good guys to take prisoners and deal out justice through the court systems. Instead, we get hammered with very descriptive narratives of what happens when a hollow point bullet meets a human skull. Mashed potatoes. This is vigilanteism at it's apex. What concerns me more is his choice of villain. Anybody that shows a deep concern about any kind of environmental issue is called a &quot;tree hugger&quot; and shown to be a bumbling Oaf. I know it's hard when you're as conservative as Clancy to write objectively about issues you oppose but to be so blatently Republican is just very abusive and downright mean spirited. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this book and at an overlong 740 pages maybe you'll save a few trees in the process."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"John Clark, ex-Navy Seal and now a covert operative with a past that is best forgotten, is the commander of a newly formed elite international anti-terrorism group known as the Rainbow Team. As he takes his new assignment, the action begins faster than he could possibly have anticipated when the plane he and his longtime sidekick Domingo Chavez are riding in is hijacked over the Atlantic. The hijackers are overcome and this begins a sequence of terrorist acts that are brutal, yet seem to have no overall purpose. Disparate and dormant groups are suddenly active, yet there appears no reason for it.The reasons are far more deadly, an ex-KGB operative is behind the activity and he is the front for a deadly game where a group is plotting to unleash biological entities that would be by orders of magnitude the greatest mass murder of all time. If their biological weapons work as planned, they would kill nearly every person on Earth. The trail finally leads Clark's team to a major installation that the terrorists have created in the jungle.As is almost always the case with a Clancy novel, the descriptions of the action are what makes the novel such a dynamic read. For if you were to stop reading for a moment and ponder the events, the improbability of them occurring would no doubt overwhelm you. Once I started reading it, I found it very difficult to put down, losing a lot of sleep before turning the last page."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The idea for \\"Rainbow Six\\" was originally intended for a computer game rather than a novel, and it shows. Clancy's greatest strength is in tying several seemingly disconnected events together until they all collide in one massive conclusion--and in this case, he made only a meager attempt at doing this, and it happens with a third of the book still left to go.\\"Rainbow Six\\" focuses around an international anti-terrorist squad headed by John Clark (hero of \\"Without Remorse\\") dispatched to deal with three separate, and apparently disconnected, hostage situations in Europe. The reader knows from the start that all three of these events are instigated by a single American businessman working through a single former KGB agent, although his motive is not revealed until later. In fact, it is when this motive is revealed that the reader becomes aware of Clancy's uncharacteristically poor plot-building effort; it turns out that the sole purpose these terrorist events hold with regards to the ultimate conflict in this story is simply that they happened. The specific details do not come up later in the story; all the reader needs to know about them to understand the final outcome of the novel is that they happened."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One reviewer from the New York Daily News said Tom Clancy had \\"serious company\\" in Dale Brown, (from Brown's \\"Fatal Terrain\\"). I have only one word in response to that claim: garbage. While some may be excellent, Tom Clancy still reigns supreme and proves it once again in \\"Rainbow Six\\", (like Clancy ever needs to prove anything!).\\"Rainbow Six\\" takes you into the world of a new multinational anti-terrorism unit, with the missions and chasing down of an entirely new breed of terrorist. While there are the usual breed of idiot terrorists, this new breed is educated, well-funded and so dedicated that they make Al-Qaeda look like a bunch of half-hearted dweebs.Clancy heightens the tension in parts so well, that I actually found myself with an increased pulse-rate and trying not to skip paragraphs ahead to see what happens. The pacing and writing are simply superb and unmatched, in my opinion. This is all the more increased with Clancy tracing various parties involved in the action sequences via short, punchy paragraphs that keep you jumping from the Rainbow team to the \\"bad guys\\" and back again.Clancy writes this book with his usual high level of technical knowledge, and it simply amazes me the diverse knowledge the man has of different subjects. He knows his stuff and it comes through. This adds even more to the air and feel of authenticity.Clancy gives nothing away, and only slowly gives you information as to what the real bad guys are up to. This technique only kept my curiosity raging, so that kept me hooked into the story itself. It was good to have the mystery revealed a bit at a time, and be kept wondering just what they were going to do next.While reading, I did notice that Clancy has his pet phrases, such as characters not \\"adding\\" their thoughts to their dialogue. While the repetition is not a flaw, it was noticeable.For those into military style thrillers, Clancy has again maintained his place at the top of the genre. \\"Rainbow Six\\" is without doubt one of the best books I have read, and certainly the best thriller. A great book with depth and feel, as well as plenty of heart-stopping action and thrills."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is an excellent book, combining poltical drama and all out action, however there are a few things clancey has messed up on. For example, you'll somtimes read the british soldiers saying \\"chaps\\" and smoking pipes etc. Please remember, these are SAS, the toughest fighting force in the world, do u really think they'd be smoking pipes and speaking with posh RP accents, this isnt the 1930's! Also when its summer in the west, its winter in australia, big error. However despite a few problems it is a very good book, and I highly reccommend it, i'm still giving it 5stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was the first time I have ever read a Tom Clancy novel. I know some of you are probably asking why I chose this one to start with. Well the answer is simple. I didn't want to read a Jack Ryan book, and this one deals with John Clark. I'm sure I would have had a deeper understanding of some of the other characters who are in the book if I read some of Clancy's other books first, but I really enjoyed this novel.I put off reading Tom Clancy because I'm not usually a fan of the most popular authors (King, Grisham, Patterson, ect.). However after some prodding I broke down and read Rainbow Six. It was great. I am a big fan of action movies, and that is exactly how this book read. There are 5 big action sequences, with minor action scenes, like training, thrown in for good measure. And when bullets and testosterone are not flying, there are some pretty good character moments. Having never read a Clancy novel before I now feel that I know John Clark and Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez pretty well.Some people argue that the book doesn't really get going until the end, but I beg to differ. I like the lead up the climax. I liked the espionage that was going on.All in all I would highly recommend this book. It is well worth the time put into it. Plus it has an ending that I just was not expecting, and that is always a plus."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Despite its title, Rainbox Six is NOT a book about three Fire Island couples. It's page-turning, techno-terror, tried-and-true Clancy. John Clark and son-in-law Ding return as do several familiar situations: children and hospital-based spouses the targets of hostage takers...killer viruses...traitor plants in the White House...elite soldiers with awesome gizmos. Sound familiar? They worked before, I guess they work here to...kept me up reading a couple nights in a row. And isn't that the point of a Clancy book?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The 700-plus pages may be daunting to some, but to fans of John Clark, it's just a satisfying mouthful. This novel seemed to have less emphasis on the mechanics of the various tools of warfare, and more on the personalities of the characters. The usual multi-threaded plot comes together in a heart-stopping, page-turning climax that is Tom Clancy at his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I personally like &quot;Patriot Games&quot; the best of all. But, this one ranks right up there. I love the way that Tom has developed Clark, and I would like to see him further develope Domingo Chaves' charachter. Again, he is a master spinster, equipped with tremendous political foresight, and an unreal technological mind. Go Tom!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Somehow, Clancy has managed to top Executive Orders and Debt of Honor with this incredibly compelling story of international espionage. This time, John Clark takes over as Hero and Man of the Hour. I bought the book the day it arrived and finished it a day later. Hold on, and don't let go!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Okay, I finished the book in one sitting last night. I always read books at least twice, so this is a rough review.First impression- Good Clark, good Chavez writing. Old friends like Gus Werner and Ed Foley show up briefly. However, there is no mention of Ryan, Foleyeva, HRH, Jackson, or any of the Ryans for that matter. Considering the scope of the conspiracy that is dealt with, you'd think we'd run into a few of these people. Good tie in with Fielder, though.Action scenes are great, execution is great, but well, the underlying plot and ending just aren't all there. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the plot and ending were oddly unsatisfying.Kiss of death remark: I think Mr. Clancy has read one to many Clive Clusser novels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has proven, once again, why he is the foremost author of the military thriller. A book that focuses on Clark is a nice change of pace from Clancy's last work (Executive Orders), focusing on political intrigue. Clancy demonstrates that, despite his expertise in other fields, he still shines brightest when writing of espionage and counter-terrorism."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I reviewed this novel for the San Antonio Express-News The action sequences are first-rate, but the eco-terrorism argot starts to get weary after awhile. - Harry Thomas"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Thought it was ok. My only problem is the length --800pgs. Certain parts drag and even come across predictable, ultimately seeming omitable upon completion of the book. But then again it's Clancy and still works. Nice to have Clark back in action. I definately see a movie out of this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is, without any doubt, the best writer of the 20th century. I own all of his books. He keeps you on the edge of your seat, deeply engrossed in every word. There is no let up to the action or excitement. I'm a speed reader, and the only complaint I have is that he doesn't write more books per year. I'd buy every one of them. He's the only author I'd invest in hardcover copies of books. And I have every one of his!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The Hunt for Red October, Without Remorse, Executive Orders are some of Clancys best work. Rainbow Six, based on my reviews is Mr. Clark at his highest level. He's Jack Ryans alter ego. The Presidents thoughts is expressed in the actions of Mr. Clark. Another best seller. I hope you're not too tired to start another excellent thriller."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"You will not want to put this book down. Loved it. Filler words here until I get to the required twenty."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy really keeps you going on this one. Like inside Delta Force, this book takes you inside how these teams work and the stress they are under. Keep them coming."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In RAINBOW SIX, we see the return of John Clark as the lead character in a typical heavy, meaningful plot that Clancy has done on a level above any other author for many years. The theme of the book, and the video games that have followed, is a multinational counter-terrorism unit called Rainbow, with John Clark running the show. One reviewer stated that this is the typical &quot;Americans are the best...&quot; plot, but it's really not. Rainbow is formed by members of several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and Israel. It's not just a United States dominated unit.From the opening pages on, Clancy paints a brilliant picture of life on Earth in a post-9/11 world...and then you realize that this book was written and published in 1998! The ability that Clancy has shown to be ahead of his time in his plots is just another example of his brilliance. This is reflected again in an earlier Clancy novel, DEBT OF HONOR, from 1996, where in the climax we read through a scene frighteningly similar to the events of 9/11/01. RAINBOW SIX, while thick at 740 pages, is really a fast read. Clancy interweaves multiple storylines and more than a handful of characters into an overall story that truly has you thinking about the world around you by the time you finish. With action sequence after action sequence, the book rarely hits a lull and keeps you enthralled to the point that you're disappointed to set it down. One nice part of it all is that the book shows that there are left-wing extremist crazy people out there too...all the insane ones aren't right-wingers as most in the media will lead you to believe.Great books make you think. With that in mind, RAINBOW SIX is a great book by one of the greatest authors of our time. Now...let's get that movie into production."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I feel that Tom Clancy did a great job on this book, and it definetaly diserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This novel is filled with action. But unfortunantly that is because it is so long. There were too many dull points in the book, and it had a terrible anti-climax. The final battle was so boring! But still, Clancy writes a good scene, none the less."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the 2nd Tom Clancy book I read and well...I LOVE IT!!!It started off full of action....and though it died down it got started right back up.The action of how they take out the terrorist network is awesome, and how he makes it all come togethere is great.Highly recommended book...makes me want to read more."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I would have prefered to see a larger portion of the book describing more missions for Rainbow rather than pages of tripping through the amoral mind of eco-nuts.If there are two weaknesses in Clancy's writing style they are (1) long, monotonous sections describing technology in painful, excruciating detail, and (2) long, monotonous sections describing personal thoughts in painful, excruciating detail.If you're looking for anti-terrorism Marcinko style, stick with Dick. If you're looking for Marcinko meets The Sum of All Fears, this is your book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was awsome. It has lots of action. The only real bad part about it was the that the story ended."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One of the best books on the planet, Rainbow Six is action packed. This is one of Clancy's Best novels yet!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow 6 is the apitemy of Clancy books. It holds you spellbound from begining to end with its technical detail and flowing diologe. This book is a must read for all clancy fans"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't expect great literature when I read a thriller. I want good action, a smart plot, and some realistic characters. 0 for 3 in this book. Lots of action but since the good guys will always win there is no suspense. I recommend Bob Mayer's Special Forces series of books for those who want to read some excellent military thrillers. A friend of mine, retired from the CIA, told me Mayer's books are among the most realistic he's read about covert military special operations."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has clearly gotten full of himself over the last few years, and it shows in this book -- it seems hastily written, with many continuity errors and few attempts at creating the plot intricacies or action excitement that his first five books did. The characters in Rainbow Six are all one-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes. They even all think and speak the same way, with the same key phrases and idioms, which becomes intensely aggravating after a few chapters. The plot is thin, and depends on several chance occurrences or perfect deductive reasoning by the good guys to move along. I loved Clancy's early works, but they've been getting worse and worse. This one is just crap. I couldn't even make myself finish it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought this book was very good. I thought it was well written and continued in a long line of great Tom Clancy books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"At least the Op-Center books were not as long. I thought his last book was tedious, but this was far worse. This is nowhere near as good as my favorite - The Sum of all Fears. I usually finish his books in 2 days, but this one took 10 days. I wish he would give up trying to proselytize people to his ultra right wing views and get on with writing good thrillers, and I usually vote Republican!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was disappointing. On the positive side, the characters are familiar and comfortable. However, they've become so familiar, you know almost exactly what they will say before they say it. The villians were cardboard figures with no depth. I'll still read his next book. When he's on, he's great. {note: Editing was sloppy.}"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I suffered through this book, and now remember why I swore off Clancy after &quot;Patriot Games&quot;. PG was the FIRST time I ever recall a movie version being superior to the book. It got me wondering about who Clancy is and if he realy does his own writing. &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and &quot;...Red October&quot; had me by the jewels until the last page, but those two books Clancy gives a &quot;lot&quot; of credit to others. Is &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; an example of the &quot;real&quot; Clancy? It is boring, repetitive, and totally unbelieveable, plus it should have been half the length. The heroes are all sickly-sweet and the villians belong in comic books. Maybe this should be made into a movie, like &quot;PG&quot; it would probably improve it. I think I really will swear off Clancy now. I gave my copy to someone I don't like."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy must have been paid by the word for this book. Redundancies abound! Not to mention the plot was neither original nor were the charaters believable. I think I'll give up my rule of 30 yrs. to finishing one book before I start another."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was very disappointed and unfortuately wasted valuable time reading 740 pages that I would not suggest anyone else to repeat my error. Nice idea for the plot but it was too predictable. It seemed that the editor or Clancy had to wrap things up in one final chapter after writing and building the plot in over 700 pages... what a waste, and I was a Clancy fan!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Admittedly, I have been a Clancy fan since 'Red Storm Rising', and I was waiting with great anticipation for 'Rainbow Six'. However, I was quite disappointed with it. Upon reflection, I would have expected Clancy to cover more of the nuts and bolts of Counter-Terrorism (CT) Operations and the global approach towards Anti- and Counter-Terrorism, as he did for nuclear science in 'The Sum of All Fears', international finances in 'Debt of Honor', et cetera. It seems like Clancy did not put his renown effort and attention to detail into this book; as if he were checking the block, keeping the mill running just for the sake of keeping it running. Only if one were a true, incurable Clancy fan would I recommend this book but only for killing time on a flight. Otherwise, you would probably receive more entertainment value from Clancy's 'OpCenter' series."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've enjoyed Tom Clancy novels for so long. Without Remorse, Red Storm Rising, and Executive Orders are all very high on my favorite list. I KNOW Clancy has the ability to write good books, but he sure doesn't show it in this case. His super-invincible team of gi joes are completely unbelievable. I'm in the military, and I can tell you that even the best special forces teams couldn't come close to doing what Clancy's imagination dreamed up for his super team. So #1, the book is unrealistic. #2 The only character I felt Clancy was able to make &quot;real&quot; to me was Popov, everyone else was completely uninteresting. Half the characters in the book fall into the super-macho, 50's lingo spewing, and shallow category--which I didn't know existed until now. It really seemed like Clancy had other things going on in his life while trying to write this book, which clearly held more precedence for him than Rainbow Six did. I think Clancy should stop believing the hype that was created around him, he needs to deflate his ego (along with the egos of Chavez and the other characters in SIX) and realize he has to put some real effort forth to try and write a good book. I hope he knows how bad this most recent book of his was. He needs to stop trying to be a NFL team-owner and concentrate on what made famous in the first place, a writer. Its clear the quality of his writing has suffered from his over inflated ego, one that got too big, I guess, for him to keep his long time wife around. I saw him on the TODAY show and he came off as an arrogant bastard who didn't even want to talk about the book. I'll definately wait until I've read some honest reviews of his next book before blindly going out there and buying it. In closing, I know Clancy has talent, I just wish it he'd use it. I really feel like he's spread him self to thin with all the Op-center mini books and the cooperative books and games he's put out. Please Tom Clancy, stop all that crap and concentrate on writing books again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I first heard that there was a new Tom Clancy novel out, I was very excited. I have read all of Mr.Clancy's novels and have never been disappointed yet. Right from the start Rainbow grabs you and does not let go.

Bravo Mr.Clancy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been a Clancy Fan since Hunt hit paperback. My copies of Hunt, Red Storm and Patriot all fell apart from over-reading. All the other hard covers are on my shelf.That established, this book was mediocre at best. Most of the positive reviews seem to be from people who read Op-Center or this is their first Clancy. It really is like someone else took his notes and wrote it for him. The plot just isn't there and the character are weak. TC is capable of so much more. I may wait &lt;gasp&gt; for the next book to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is to long winded and has no poin"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of th best books if have ever read.

They were a few too many &quot;these men were in the fraternity or warriors&quot;-type comments rather than chapters which showed the depth of detail and research in earlier books. Althought there are some great passages, he book was definitely longer than it needed to be. I would reccommend Larry Bond (co-author of Red Storm Rising) as another author."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you disliked his Op Center series, you will really dislike this one. The slowest reading Clancy book to date, it'll put you to sleep. I've read everything written by Clancy and this is, by far, the most disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If I have nothing good to say, I don't say anyting so my review would have to be really short. As a former special operations soldier I'm a bit dismayed at the one-dimensional potrayal of both the good and bad guys in this book. There's other stuff out there as good, if not better than this. Stephen Coonts. The new book on the battle of Thermopylae is a good read. Bob Mayer's special forces series are fun."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I admit that Clancy has written another page-turner, as a German speaker I deplore his obviously shoddy research. Virtually every reference to Germany and German (of which the book abounds) is false or erroneous; he obviously neglected to take the elementary precaution of having a native speaker at least correct his spelling of words like &quot;Schreklichkeit&quot; (correct: &quot;Schrecklichkeit&quot;) or &quot;Burger Fuhrer&quot; (&quot;Bergf&uuml;hrer&quot; - his version sounds like something sold by McDonald's. This lack of writers' craftmanship may not distract from the power of the story, but it does induce skepticism towards other details of the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The definitive master of techno-thrillers combines ebola and terrorists in this outing (both captivating subjects). Its basically a series of terrorist encounters strung together within the master theme of terrorist kill off the human race cause-they-are-destroying-the-planet. Kind of an ecological statement- that aside, the details of the &quot;swat&quot; team vs. terrorists will fascinate the reader. There are a few major fallacies in the premise you can discover on your own, but you'll like the &quot;op&quot; details. More accomplished in some of his other works."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is at it again, but he takes a break from Jack Ryan and concentrates only on the team of Clark and Chavez. I loved these guys as a team in Debt of Honor. I think, however, it's better that they stay only part of the plot. Still, although different, Rainbow Six is a great novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I did enjoy reading this somewhat predictable book with a familiar plot. Why did this top secret, elite, counter terrorist combat team have to rely on a civilian British Airline to transport them to their terrorist targets. The ebola aerosol plot sounded really familier to me to. But it was fun to read in any case. Maybe in his next book he could have a president who's caught in a sex triangle in the oval office launch a cruise missile attack on an aspirin factory in Sudan!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's latest novel, brings the reader back to the &quot;alternate timeline&quot;, pseudo reality created by Mr. Clancy. Unfortunately for fans of Clancy's books, this weighty volume seems to abandon any attempt at depicting a &quot;what if&quot; scenario, which Clancy has proven himself adept at creating, and instead, reads like an indulgence to the author's apparent ample supply of testosterone. The macho, bravado ridden main characters walk through the pages, spouting lines one would expect to hear in a big budget action movie, and miss no opportunity to prove to the reader that they are, indeed, real men. Far from the spine tingling possibilities of Red Storm Rising, The Hunt for Red October, and Debt of Honour, Rainbow Six provides nothing but a quick adrenaline fix. The plot is convoluted and not particularly believable, a dilemma which is not improved by the addition of several almost farcical characters who play key roles in the resolution of the novel. Granted, Clancy does bring back fan favorites Mr. Clark, and Chavez (not to mention a &quot;surprise&quot; cameo character from &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;), but they seem to be walking through their roles, and not displaying much of their former intelligence. Overall, an eight-hundred page indulgence by Mr. Clancy, which is not representative of his former work, and unfortunately, will probably turn a goodly number of readers away from a very competent writer. Better luck next time, Tom! We're all rooting for you..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. The length of the book is a mystery as any amateur editor would have cut 35 to 50 percent of it out and thrown it in the trash can. It seems like he took pieces from his previous books and tried to change the plot and characters to fit. Not one of seven writers who reviewed the book liked it. I read the first 100 reviews and realize some fans would like reading Tom's grocery list and would give it 5 stars. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also The Notebook is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and Blood Work by Connelly. There is a reason this book went from number 1 to the 40s in under two months."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors.

Three separate characters in three different story lines from various professions all use the same &quot;special ops&quot; slang, like &quot;drilling in dry holes&quot;. The agents are constantly repeating the same dumb jargon -- &quot;whacking&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; that it becomes unrealistic. Take the time to make it more realistic, Tom! The real people killed by terrorists, and the terrorists themselves, are as one-dimensional and boring and unrealistic as the pretend targets the main characters practice on everyday. This is lazy writing. It's OK to have 16 story lines going, but you need to make the people believable not only with myriad technical detail, but the little human details of personality and behavior.The idealogues -- whether communists or environmental nuts -- are so wooden and one-dimensional in their thinking that they seem like virtual people in some sort of computer game. People are ready to destroy humankind because they like watching the Discovery Channel?!OK, we realize we're in for a male-oriented book when we buy Clancy, but must hatred of women shine through on so many pages? Women are either cold killers or long-suffering care-givers or sluttish bar hoppers -- when they achieve a career, like the science advisor, they must suffer the unhappiness of divorce, even from a loser like Brightley. It's sad that when authors and publishers have such a captive audience as us, vacation-goers looking for a big, fat book we'll inevitably buy and partly enjoy, that they feel they don't have to work very hard to make the quality higher, and therefore the book more lasting, to be re-read many times, like John Le Carre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a serious Clancy fanatic, having read most of his books ten or twenty times over. As such, I was slavering at the thought of a new novel in the &quot;Jack Ryan universe&quot;. Unfortunately, Clancy has done such a phenomenal job with his recent novels (&quot;Without Remorse&quot;, &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, &quot;Executive Orders&quot;)that he is not quite able to top them with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;.Both the book and the upcoming computer game &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; revolve around a NATO anti-terrorist force (think SAS/GSG-9/Delta Force on steriods) headed up by old friends Clark and Chavez, and as can be imagined, it's pretty cool. &quot;Rainbow&quot; comes from the multi-national membership and Clark himself is &quot;Six&quot;, the commander. The book is solid Clancy techno-thriller fare, with an emphasis less on military hardware and more on the characters involved. I very much enjoyed the action scenes and training descriptions. However, there are a few warts which left me less slightly less than satisfied with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;.The thing that really bugged me the whole time is that Jack Ryan is *never* mentioned in the book, not even once!! He is referred to occasionally as &quot;the President&quot;, but never even by name; it's as though he doesn't exist anymore. Jack Ryan has always (with the exception of the standalone &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and the earlier-timeline &quot;Without Remorse&quot;) been the central character of Clancy's books. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; takes place right after &quot;Exec&quot;, so it just feels *wrong* that Ryan isn't there. It's like watching Star Wars with Luke getting no screen time and Han just mentioning &quot;that Jedi Knight&quot; every once in a while. Maybe Clancy felt he couldn't top &quot;Exec&quot;, maybe he didn't want to treat Ryan as a bit player (since the focus is on Clark). Whatever the reason, it's a bummer.Other things that keep this from being a totally satisfying experience: the plot is a bit of a rehash from &quot;Exec&quot; (very unlike Clancy) and some terms like REMF, RIF, and &quot;hit them like a Kansas tornado&quot; were reused to the point of annoyance and, in the case of the acronyms, without explanation (editing felt a little weak). I know what REMF means, but that doesn't mean every reader will.I was also disappointed that Clark doesn't get much action, as he's now over 50 and thus not realistically able to compete with the 20-something members of Rainbow. Chavez, on the other hand, is in the forefront of everything, which is very cool. The plot is also very direct, with none of the characteristic multiple intertwining crises that make his recent works such masterpieces, and there's few *really* tense moments (when Pat O'Day double-tapped the kidnappers at the day care center in &quot;Exec&quot;, I physically yelled with relief). Still, even a slightly off-the-mark Clancy is a darn fine read, and it is only in contrast with his own stellar body of work that &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; appears flawed. Recommended for Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another great big thick book from everybody's favorite techno-thriller artist. Clancy shows his usual awkwardness with non-technical dialogue, keeping his characters as 2-D as possible. Conversations between loved ones are particularly hard to swallow. Dialogue between the various spooks, spies, and intelligence operators continues to be one of Clancy's strengths, and this book delivers plenty of that. Unfortunately, the plot is ludicrous - Clancy's tree-hugger antagonists concoct a scheme guaranteed to make a reader of average intelligence roll his/her eyes in bewilderment. Then they go around dropping hints to strangers in casual conversation - &quot;Well, the buffalo will all be back soon&quot; - stuff like that. This conspiracy wouldn't have lasted an hour in the real world. Clancy DOES provide some good, page-turning thrills when describing counter-terrorist operations - the kind of writing that hooks the reader and keeps Clancy on the short list of writ! ers whose every work hits the top of the bestseller list. Unfortunately Clancy chose to hinge the book's denouement on a product that actually exists, the &quot;Life-Guard&quot;, manufactured by DKL, a company plugged several times in the narrative. This is a device that supposedly homes in on the electrical pulse that triggers the human heartbeat - a tiny, 1.2 hertz blip. The Life-Guard was recently featured in Skeptic Magazine, where it was shown to be nothing more than a fancy dowsing rod with some non-powered electrical circuits inside to make it appear technologically based, while it actually employs the well-known ideomotor response to achieve its &quot;results&quot;. While the device appeared to work in uncontrolled experiments, it failed miserably in &quot;double-blind&quot; experiments, in which neither the operator of the device nor the experimenters knew the location of the human test subject. In the book the thing worked like a! charm, ruining Clancy's ending sequence for this reader. If you haven't already popped for the hardcover, I'd recommend waiting for the paperback. Not too bad, but not up to par with earlier offerings."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy is a great technical writer, his prose flows pretty smoothly and he's great in the way he paints with words. It's just his premises are getting more and more flawed. The idea of the real villains all being addicted NPR and Dicovery Channel nature shows just made me shudder. His good guys seem more and more psychopathic as time goes on. In most of his previous books, you could relate to his characters in a positive way, The &quot;good guys&quot; in Rainbow are 2 dimensional murderous thugs who would give my id nightmares. So much of the plot gets strung together by happenstance because good police work is precluded by killing all the bad guys (even when it is not neccesary, even contrary to mission objectives, like in the park).Of course the villains will come back in the sequel, look closely at the final chapter to find the hook.Oh well, Tom's run had to end someday..&lt;sigh&gt;Mike"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I usually enjoy reading Clancy's novels, but this must be his worst. I tried to finish the book, but it took me almost three months. The story is highly repetitious, with similar incidents throughout the first half of the book. The prose was too verbose. The book could have been half the length and would have been better. Worse yet, Clancy was offbase in his over-eagerness to introduce new technologies, and promoted the DKL Lifeguard (supposedly a human presence detector), which was proven in a later Department of Justice double-blind study to perform no better than random chance, and upon a physical engineering dissection by Sandia National Lab, found to contain a block of plastic with a human hair in it as the active sensing element! Shame to Mr. Clancy for falling for that. One would have thought that someone who had been exposed to so much hi-tech through all his research would have had better sense."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This heart-pounding book is about a newly formed elite counter-terrorist group known as Rainbow Six. The organization is \\"blacker than black\\", as only a few select hundred in Washington, D.C. even know about the organization. John Clark leads Rainbow Six, and there are two teams of counter-terrorists, all hand-picked and trained. Suddenly, terrorists strike all over the world, from Bern, Switzerland to Worldpark, Spain. Rainbow swiftly responds to these attacks with devastating speed, neutralizing the enemy forces with astonishing skill and minimal casualties. But there is something behind the numerous terrorist attacks, as the Sydney Olympics approach, and the terrorists will unleash something deadly, capable of eliminating all of mankind to simply save the environment...In this fast paced action novel, Clancy unweaves the mystery behind the motiveless terrorist attacks occurring in alarming frequency. The book is impossible to put down once you start reading, from the exciting introduction to the unexpected ending; all illustrated through lots of detail, making you want to read more."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The problems with this book have been noted by others reviewers-- over-noted by many-- while they've ignored the fact that you get a nice, long, fun read in the thriller genre with this book. It ain't brain surgery, folks. Other good thrillers-- Coonts latest is good; Joe Dalton's Omega Missile is pretty good; also found the last two Riley special forces series books I didn't have by Bob Mayer here on Amazon and completed my set. If you haven't read Mayer, check him out. Try Cut Out or Dragon Sim-13. Even Synbat which was pretty wild was good. Looking forward to Clancy's next and hope he gives a bit more depth to his characters which was what I enjoyed about his earlier work."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I actually prefer some of Clancy's earlier works, like &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;, but this is a great read nonetheless. Some people may be put off by characterizing radical environmentalists as the villians, but it wasn't too long ago that the Unabomber was trying to save the Earth no matter what the human cost. Clancy's heroes are so engaging because they are just that, heroes. They aren't spineless losers wallowing in self doubt like the dubious main characters in so much literature these days. Well done, Tom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked it as I do most of Tom Clancy's books. The story is spellbinding. I thought the dialog was repetitive. Characters made statements and 20 pages later the same thing was repeated verbatim. I think Mr. Clancy was either trying to make the book thick or needs a new editor."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished Rainbow Six and my wife is greatful. Most of the book is the intricate, high-tech, cerebral thriller one expects of Clancy. The ending, however, fizzles somewhat despite the nice twist on the last 2 pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid fan of Clancy, I was a little disappointed at this effort that could have used 350 pages to tell the story. I guess the irony against the tree-huggers is that he killed a heck of a lot of trees to use as wasted paper. Pretty good joke...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If this is the first book of Clancy that you are about to read, pick another one. This is the worst book he has written. The book has about 300 to 400 pages more that it should. Most of Clancey's books have enough exiting and intriguing areas to outweigh the slow areas, but not this time. I had to be very determined to finish this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read every one of Clancy's novels up until now. However, Rainbow Six and Executive Orders were mediocre at best. I sense that Tom may not have any more good ideas to use now that the Soviet Union is gone and he has taken his other hero Jack Ryan all the way to the White House. As for John Clark, well I think Clancy should have stopped at Without Remorse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy seems to have written several chapters, all independently of eachother. Then he put them all together in some order to create this book (screenplay?). He repeats over and over again the exact same words, phrases, and thoughts throughout the book. After you finish skipping half the book, as you go through it page-by-page, you will find yourself bored.This would be a good Clancy to skip!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"All the things that made Red October and Red Storm Rising great are missing here (feasability of the plot, attention to detail, exploring new areas). How long can an author get by on his past accomplishments ?Tom Clancy has become interested only in becoming a revenue machine, putting his name in a series of products of very debious quality. This is sad comming from a man who's main character stopped trading in stocks because he become bored with making money and wanted to do something meaningful with his life."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After Sum of All Fears one did not know whether Clancy would write another book about the Jack Ryan storyline. Then came Executive Orders, and at the end one was again asking the question if he could continue the storyline. In Rainbow Six Clancy decides to give the reader a well deserved break from Jack Ryan and focuses on Clark and Chavez. The anti terrorist storyline works very well, although a little similar to OpCenter. He is able to immerse you again into his universe and feel like you are in every situation. One of his best books and I can't wait to see where the series goes next."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I won't discuss the plot; the thousand other reviews cover that in sufficient detail. What doesn't seem to be mentioned to an appropriate extent is the extent to which the book's hamfisted politics undermine its several strengths.As someone reading from outside of the United States, it's painfully obvious to see that the book was written for those within the USA, by those within the USA. Clancy's knowledge of technical detail on weaponry is superb, except when those weapons are owned by countries outside of the US, his descriptions of Canadian weapons fraught with inaccuracies. His settings are often effective and easy to visualise, but when he ignores the difference in seasons between Australia and Britain, these visualisations are cheapened. Even the British characters, central to the book, say \\"chap\\" and smoke pipes. As an author, Clancy reinforces all of the stereotypes of the ignorant American that those Americans so resent.The antagonists in the novel, a radical environmentalist group, are a crude negative representation of the political left. The brute-force, gun blazing, America-rules-OK methods of dealing with them leave no questions as to Clancy's political convictions. His subtlety in discussing technology is great; the reader is forced to ask why the same intricacy isn't applied to politics.For anybody with moral or political insight, Rainbow Six is an often exciting book undermined by Clancy's crude political agenda, making it uncomfortable and embarassing to read. The fact that so few reviewers have highlighted this makes one wonder if the aforementioned resented stereotypes are more accurate than America would like to admit."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions, but become two dimensional when the action stops. The magic of a good book is that the characters come to life. Unfortunately, in Rainbow Six they never really do, and so I never really cared what happened to them. More disturbing is the amoral tone of the book. Tom Clancy takes the position that counter-terrorism teams have to crossover to the dark side in the service of the good. This seemed supportable until the final mission where I felt the \\"good guys\\" lost their humanity. If you give up the moral high ground and sink to the level of terrorists are you really any better then they are?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's book Rainbow Six is a GREAT book. It has a lot of action in it and really has a good plot. Part of the reason it is so good is because it really hits home that it is possible that it could happen in the world today. Also, the characters are very well thought up and you really get to know them. I think it is great how they solve the problem about the international laws at the end of the book. Overall, this was a great book that I just could not put down. So my suggestion is to read it as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy brings us to the edge of our seats again. With this thrilling novel he shows us our worst fears and our best line of defense to combat those fears. Another great one from one of the best all time authors."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I also haven't read the book. BUT, I have played the video game. Not too shaby. Not a Q2, but not a bomb either."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This story is toy-class. Written to promote software toys. I am not a gamer, but looks like the game is a brilliant piece. Old Tommy seems to let his good team of programmers down. He did a really bad novelization. Hope this lousy book wouldn't affect the sale of the game under the same title.Tommy is really an enviroment freak. I've been reading his books for about a decade. From the Red October. This book is, up to date, his best recycled job. These game programmers may have written a bot for Clancy to help him complete this book. In my opinion, a great part of this book was done by a computer from rearranging Mr. Clancy's prior works. Nice job, programmers! You gave techno-thriller a new meaning. Here we have the first book written by computers for computers. Not to mention this book is especially friendly to the LZW compressor. It's highly redundant, easy to compress!Dear O'Tommy, why don't you just let the computer do everything for you? I gave it one star, because you are involved in the making of this book. If you let your G3 computer finish this job, it will be a milestone for the artificial intelligence. With your help, I can only give you an F. No human writers should be so stupid to please the LZW algorithm instead of a regular reader.Can't wait for your next book, Tommy. Will you just let your G4/AltiVec computer to do it for you? You may ask your iMac to do your first draft, and let your G4 edit it. Just don't touch it with your hands. You may ruin it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"... but for the love of God, stay away from this one. You can do so much better than this, a book that reads as if one of his \\"Op-Center\\" co-authors wrote it. In the beginning, there was \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", a taut, intense action read. 300-some pages of absolutely gripping story, the sort you don't put down unless it's 5 in the morning and you've gotta work tomorrow. Then, other ones (great, good, all-right... but at least readable). But apparently the end of the Soviet Union as an antagonist has left Tom bereft of evildoers more realistic than Oddjob or Dr. Evil. So now we have 1,000-plus pages of the most ridiculous terrorist scenarios conceivable (see also \\"Executive Orders\\"-- just as bad), ones that seem all the more absurd when juxtaposed with the horror of September 11. I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say that if you're into Clancy, or want to be, start at the beginning (with \\"Red October\\", in my opinion his best), and read his work in chronological order. When you get to \\"Debt of Honor\\", read it (if only for the 'at-the-time-it-seemed-so-implausible' ending) then go back to the ones you liked before. Do. Not. Read. Any. Farther. You will only be disappointed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Extremely boring... The first Clancy book that was not a constant page turner for me. What happened Tom?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another great book by Clancy, a must read for all fans and a perfect book for everyone that likes action and speed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The greatest problem with this book is it's dire predictability. From the start, we are given a series of absurdly contrived 1970's style terrorist operations that are thwarted by Rainbow, an unbelievable counter terrorist group made up apparently of the toughest soldiers on the face of the planet.... Meanwhile, a bunch of loonie environmentalists have decided to kill of just about everyone on the planet with a hardened version of the Ebola virus.I could have put up with the sexism, ignorance and the complete stupidity if it had been written with any verve, style, humour, irony or, indeed, inventiveness. Instead, the story proceeds like a train. It starts, it progresses to obvious, well sign posted points along the way. And then comes to a sputtering halt. Throughout its 890 very ordinary pages, there is not a single digression, red herring, plot twist or surprise.And if Clancy is going to write about Sydney and Australians, the least he could have done is visit and talk to some of us. According to Clancy, we all talk like Englishmen. There is no more detail about Sydney than you could pick up from a travel agent - he could have at least looked up a Frommers, a Let's Go or a Rough Guide (well maybe not a Rough Guide - probably too left wing for him...). He also fails to mention any significant detail about the Australian SAS, in particular their recent tragic history.All in all this book is a failure. It's plot is ridiculous and predictible, the writing is barely functional, the characters and situations are shallow and cliched. The saving grace is that it was well manufactured - after a week of reading it there were no creases in the spine."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Let's start with a disclaimer - I am a huge Clancy fan. Debt of Honor was one of the best books I've ever read. I thought Cardinal of the Kremlin was the best espionage novel I'd ever seen.So, here's the new Clancy novel. It's huge, but that only makes me anticipate it more. More thrills, more great technology, etc.After finishing it, all I can say is - what a disappointment. The Prolouge is vintage Clancy - greatness! From there, it gets progressively slower and more implausible. The bad guys never seemed as horrifying as I think Mr. Clancy intended. The good guys are a little too super-human. And the last 150 pages made me feel completely ripped off. I could not believe the magnitude of Clancy's cop-out.Previous Clancy misfires (most notably, Sum of All Fears) were still pretty good, just not up to the usual Clancy standard. Rainbow Six is just bad. Please, Tom, take a few years off and come back with stories that live up to your earlier great works!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is my first time reading Tom Clancy. I really liked this book. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the length. I really liked the action and espionnage. Though some parts just seemed unnecesssary. I wanted to learn more about each of the Men's life at home, to make them seem less like supermen. Instead, they're always at work training! The characters were too one sided. I think this book could have been written in about 300-400 pages. 700+ is too long!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Now that Clancy has made a name for himself he seems to be happy to pump out total pulp garbage. This book is rife with political correctness and plot errors. Who honestly believes that the weather in Sydney is 100 degrees and dry during the Summer Olympics? Remember, this is winter in Australia. The entire plot hinges on this ill-conceived notion. To boot, Clancy continues to show his total blind spot in subjects such as small arms (don't even get me started on the subject of a supressed 10mm...), high-technology and small unit tactics. The book is entertaining from a pure adrenaline standpoint, however, if you're looking for literary fulfillment (or even a credible plot line), look elsewhere. Clancy's days as a credible author were over after he wrote &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and he continues to prove this with every new book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, Tom Clancy has outdone himself. In a brilliant novel, he successfully portrays a well thought through plot. Featuring excellent character development and a flair for writing that only Clancy can portray, I highly recommend this book to any and all."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books. And while Rainbow Six is not necessarily a bad read, it has some very lame aspects to it. The plot is so far fetched and downright offensive toward environemtalists it scares me. Also, Clancy's writing is incredibly repetitive at times. He uses the word &quot;niggardly&quot; 3 times in 20 pages. And he uses the analogy &quot;as regularly as he zips up his pants&quot; a couple of times. What the hell kind of writing is this? I was laughing at how bad some of the writing was. But on a side note some of the action sequences are cool, but again it kind of wears old after 700 pages. I wish Clancy would stop trying to showcase his extrememly conservative views through his novels. Tom, this is your readers here, WE DON'T CARE. You may be a good writer, but as a person you seem to be a total jerk. Get back to your old self and keep it real next time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy mixes true military genius with eccentric characters in this very imaginative book. The book may be a little too imaginative at some parts, yet the action is fantastic and exciting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read better Clancy. He needs to take some time off, find a suitable enemy, and come up with a realistic plot. R-6 was almost impossible for me to get through. I don't plan on buying any more Clancy novels on blind faith."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, I enjoyed following the familiar characters of Clark, Chavez, Dan Murray, ... . However, in this book the story did not do justice to the characters as I thought the storyline was mediocre and was only a rehash/reinvention of many of his plotlines in previous books. The book had the potential to be very good, but disappoints in many places. I wish Clancy would have let the reader uncover the plot of the story along with Popov and Clark, instead of spelling out the story to early and then forcing the reader to wait for the Popov and Clark to figure it out. I was frustrated by Clancy's repeated reference to &quot;the President&quot; when everyone knew it was Jack Ryan. You have a well developed/liked character from previous books in the White House, why not use that character to enhance the story. However, despite many posts to the contrary, Clancy did finally mention Jack's name once late in the book. The ending was only partially satisfying. The early parts of the book seemed to go into detail of some items of little importance at length, but at the end of the book I got the feeling that Clancy felt under a deadline and needed to wrap up the story as quickly as possible. Having Popov walk free and purchase a gold mine at the end of the story... Please! Also, I wish Clancy would have dealt more finally with the members of the Project. Hopefully, this is not just a setup for his next novel about Project 2."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"An excellant piece of work by the master himself, Mr. Clancy"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Raninbow 6 was by far my favorite. I am usually a slow reader but this book with its intimidating size was concquered in just 4 days. It left me wanting for more and more...I just had to finish. As a fan of the Spec Ops world this book was great. He took his time in developiong the plot which leaves the reading begging for more. Just a great book and can't wait for another."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It was going to be interesting to see how Mr Clancy could write a 740 page novel set in the Jack Ryan world but not utter his name once. It was only natural that this story was to be about Clark and Chavez. He could not develop the Ryan character anymore and it would have been a shame to end it all with great characters like Clark, waiting in the wings.The story has a bit of every one of his other novels in it. The covert Russians like his earlier novels. The Irish like Patriot Games. The trip to South America like Clear and Present Danger. The middle America setting like The Sum of all Fears and the Bio Warfare like his last book.However what makes it great is the whole Op-Center feel to it. When I first read Op-Center, I felt what a waste of a good idea that is on characters you don't really feel for. But a similar idea has now been developed in the Jack Ryan world, hopefully starting a new chapter in the techno thriller.Hopefully he writes more about Australia!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was truly surprised by how un-interesting the book was. Till now, I usually can't stop reading one of Tom Clancy's books but this one just seems too unrealistic. The conversation is awful and some of the slangs were really out there. In general, I think Clancy has gotten too much of a love for John Clark and made him this indestructible super human - for this kind of character, I could read just about every other action-thriller book. Also, his attack on environmentalists was just plain stupid - they are NOT murdering pscyopaths bent on eliminating humans and it was a very unfair characterization - shame on you Tom!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy goes once more into the world of espionage and intrigue in a way that only he can. Rainbow Six is an excellent follow-up to Executive Orders, resurrecting the character of John Clark for a fast packed adventure.

An absolute must for all Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really liked the Rainbow, but it bagan to get a little repetitive.

I could have done without the extra 200 pgs. other than that it was a great book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is about...400 pages too long. There are about 300 pages of good Clancy here, but someone has to tell him when he's repeating himself. I can only handle so much description of training exercises. Yes, Tom, I get it, these guys are really well trained, now can you get on with the story!I started skimming this sucker at page 280 or so; and that's never a good sign. I would have quit reading it completely, but I kept hoping something good would show up; and it did occassionally. I give it two stars just so that I'm not lumped in with the reviewers who just wanted to trash Clancy's political views, but this books is probably more of a one and a half star effort."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Previous TC books (not including his various Op-Center type &quot;franchises&quot;) have required at least some massaging to yield a feature film of varying quality. Rainbow Six is a prefab script, ready to be filmed as soon as the money appears. John Clark's mention of SPECTRE (the evil organization in some of the more dubious James Bond films) was less self-effacing humor than a recognition of what he has decended to: a pulp fiction writer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"-- and more realistic. The bad guys are just bad. The good guys are just good and they are judge, jury and executioner. Not my idea of good guys in America. As someone else said, read WEB Griffin for some good stories. Or Bob Mayer, Joe Dalton. Stephen Coonts."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Great realistic story on modern threats. Sometimes long on details...it gives a great story on the possible threats from the evironazis that want us to be &quot;one with the Earth.&quot; Clancy will make all the leftists mad with this book, but all the better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think this was a very good book, but you need a little more background on it to fully understand it. I played the game based on the book, and it was really vague on the plot. I read this book to get filled in on the plot and other factors of the game that I didn't understand.So, my advice is play the game and then try to knock this book.Have a nice day."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I left this book in a hotel room. That's how disappointed I was after reading Rainbow Six. The only reason I finished the book was that I have enjoyed Tom Clancy's other books and kept hoping that it would turn around. It didn't. It is a simplistic book about a highly trained counter-terrorist group that never fails to kill all the bad guys. Since there is never developed in the reader any real sense that the good guys might fail, the book seems to move from one self-serving win to another. At best, this book is long and boring. At a deeper level it paints a picture of covert operations agents as a group of psycopathic killers who have thinly sheathed their obsession in questionable purpose. The story would have been ever so much more interesting if Rainbow Six had to deal with the ramifications of a successful Dooms Day plot."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is too much like the Op-Center series: It's an easy read and fairly entertaining, but it lacks imagination, intrigue, or any great characters.Rainbow Six revisits many characters from the early Clancy novels, centering on John Clark and Domingo Chavez. While they were undeveloped in the earlier Clancy novels, they remain so here even though they are the main characters. Rainbow Six is an antiterrorism team led by Clark, which could be interesting as it takes a military operation into an urban setting. However, as the team emerges from all encounters victorious, it's boring.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that is a Tom Clancy fan. If Op-Center is your bag of tricks, you may enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been a Clancy fan since read his &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; But I regretfully found myself losing focus during reading this one. The whole book gave me an impression that I was reading a Leggo construction plan, how to add another block onto the old ones. Of course, all the blocks were linked tightly and wouldn't fall apart, but once the sucker was completed, it looked pretty cool by Leggo standard, but it's also a creation in a rigid dumb style, no beauty at all, man. I simply failed to get myself involved from Chapter One, and this book only made me go back and pick out his &quot;Without Remorse&quot; off my bookshelf and reread it again. Missing something, buddy?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Too long. Too little action. Too many wasted words preaching Clancy's views. Too boring."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am still speechless. I ripped through this book in three days and it is my humble opinion that it should be read by all those who love techno-thrillers, thrillers, et al. Clancy delivers once again with a great storyline that had me cringing at the thought of something like it hapenning it the real world, great characters -- I especially liked Popov and Alistair Stanley, aside from our old friends John Clark and Ding Chavez -- and his usual amount of technical detail. It is obviously a book intended to entertain, and Clancy, as always, does it incredibly well. Maybe someday we'll hear on CNN that UNICTT -- the United Nations Counter-Terrorist Team -- has been created."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another well crafted story about covert military operations and the struggle for the good guys to stay ahead of world class terrorists. This time it's an ecoterrorist's plot on the most sinister and grandest scale. Clancy's John Clark and Ding are forced into a deadly game to uncover the terrorist's plan and stop it before the destruction of the human race is brought about. The story is well timed and not unreasonable or farfetched.I've read all his books and have found this one to be as entertaining as the rest. If you are a Clancy fan I'm sure you will agree after you've read Rainbow 6."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again a classic Clancy novel, with all the usual ingredients that make him a popular author.However I am a little dissapointed in this his latest thriller since I think that Tom struggled with a credible plot.I frankly find the premise of the &quot;back to the caves&quot; zealot plotting the destruction of humanity a bit of a stretch, and the ending is LAME!!!...I harken back to the days of &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; for exemplarly Clancy tales ...Tom, if you are reading this, forget present, concentrate on the past."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is exquisite. He's done it again, with wonderfully interesting novel on terroism. At first the book was a little bit of a drag, but just like his past books it really pick up and ended with an unlikely ending. Clancy is phenomenal!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is not Clancy's best work. The last really great work was 'Executive Order.' Rainbow Six is slow moving, and the first third of the book could have been covered in about 20 pages. Overall, it was actually kind of boring. Just another terrorist attempt to use biological warfare to kill the world's population. This theme has appeared many, many times in other author's novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is about an essembled elite team of former Foreign Country Covert Military Operatives that are at an age where they are about to retire, or retired. The team is assembled from former S.A.S (Britain) and American Delta Force, Special Forces, etc. This book had some good incidents, but some of the parts about Kilgore and Popov were somewhat boring. This book is a good book however, and I'd advise you to read it. But I'd also advise you Rent this one from the library, really not worth buying unless you collect Clancy novels. As much As I like Tom Clancy books, this one can only get 3 stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This action packed adventure is a roller coaster ride through the harsh realities of terrorism and the almost untouchable secret counter-terrorism group, Rainbow Six. If you've never read Clancy before read this first. You'll love it, and you'll get a sense of Clancy's unique style. He creates 5 or 6 strands which he will tie together at the end; perhaps the most incredible Clancy finale ever. The end will leave you in awe. Also read Without Remorse, which is the Clancy book which developes the main character, John Kelley, who becomes CIA legend John Clark, one of the main characters in Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid Clancy reader I could not wait to read Rainbow Six. How could Mr. Clark was grow old with grace? But right from the start the story line seemed contrived. Clark and Domingo break up a airplane high-jacking while traveling to England with the intent to train a force for quick response to terrorist activities, really! Later when hot on the trail of a Professional Spy (from the old school) they are able to catch him when a janitor in an airport finds a wallet the spy discards with credit cards intact, credit cards that where used in a terrorist act!I was disappointed. Looks like Clancy's hurried this one to print."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"***** this is the book which every fiction lover should read,Jack Rayan is not there but john clark makes you forget him,RAINBOW SIX is highly recommeneded."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book show that Clancy still know how to shage a war.On body can descride an attack in such an intensive way. It keep you read on until the last page. However, to get to the better helf you must endrue the boring frist helf. If you can survive it, you will be reward with the best writing about low intensity warfare. The subject matter is dispointing. A lot of people has written about terrorism. I hope Mr.Clancy choose a theme that is unique &amp; insightful as before"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished this book and Tom did it again. He brings out bestseller after bestseller. Who cares if a C-140 can't land on that airport in where ever, the point is he made it fun to read. They made a great game out of this and now there starting a movie. If you say this book sucks then better go back and read it again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a must for Spy / Terrorism fans. A must read for Readers of Debt of Honor and Executive orders. Great Tension and suspense. Light on the Technical Mumbo Jumbo but packed with Acronyms. A little weak on the ending but neverthe less a great read"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The story has some stuff that Mr. Clancy wrote before ,like an attempt against wife and daugther ,the character of Mrs Carol is like Mrs Elliot, and big mistakes . A good geographical research would avoid some mistakes. Manaus is in North Brazil not in Central part . Brazilian Army and Security agencies looks with care all foreigners settlements in the Rain Forest. Manaus Airport is also a Brazilian Air Force Base .

I think in this instance he should fire his research assistant. Hereford was never visited during the writing of this novel, or so it seemed to me. I lived in Hereford for 3 years while serving with the Royal Air Force, where did he land the C130 ?? Apart from that, the storyline was average."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in this book and in Tom Clancy (I've read them all). It seems that he starting to repeat himself, and the story is VERY predictable. One of the things I really used to like about a Tom Cancy novel was that the story was always hard to figure out, and Mr Clancy always liked to stretch the reader's fantasy and imagination. I really hope that the next one will be better, otherwise I will have to look somewhere else (maybe he should concentrate less on the games, and prepare the novels more???)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well, he's nuked a football stadium, biowarred the United States, fought desert storm II, put japan back to warring against us and it is no wonder this book fails miserably - what can he do for an encore? Well, he tries to drag us into a biowar two theme, but it just doesnt fly. Evil enviromentalists plot for 10 years to kill everyone but themselves to save the world - it just didnt generate any excitement.It would have been far better had he just let the Rainbow operation work its way through it's missions and left out the end of the world stuff."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy was once my favorite author (Red Storm Rising is one of the best novels I've read). I have all his books.But ... I read this book for the military bits and the action sequences and actually skipped over much of the dialogue. Jack Ryan, John Clark and Ding Chavez are all mirror images of each other. They all think, talk and act the same. Clancy has a shocking lack of ability to create anything other than 1 dimensional, wooden leading characters. Popov was the only interesting guy.I ended up hoping that the bio-terrorists WOULD succeed. That would have been much more fun.Final point: why does every British character have to say 'Quite' or 'Quite so' in every conversation???I'll keep buying the books, but I'll be treating them more as magazine articles than novels. And I thought I saw light at the end of the tunnel when I read Exectuive Orders.By the way, I echo other comments about reading 'Blackhawk Down' - excellent."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewer and suggest as well that you read &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; instead of this new one from Clancy. It is stale, uninspired, and tedious."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Between trying to buy football teams and promoting games off his books and 'co-writing' numerous other books, Clancy has lost whatever he had at the beginning of his career. As far as those reviewers who think this is the 'real deal' on Special Operations-- not even close. Clancy never carried a ruck, jumped out of a plane in the pitch dark or been shot at. You want realism try BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story of the Rangers in Somalia. Or in fiction, try Bob Mayer's Special Forces books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A chillingly realistic main plot intertwind with breath taking action. If you're as big of a Clancy fan as I am this one is a must read.

I have been a tactical operator for almost 10 years and his descriptions, accounts, missions, and other aspects depicted are very realistic. Don't think that this sort of thing hasn't been thought about. I hope that a noted director makes a movie about this one..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six gives you action, mystery, and a whole lot more. Rainbow Six goes into detail about how rainbow six goes in and rescues hostages or how they take down terrorist even when the terrorist have a big advantage. You just don't read this book you get into it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is just going through the motions on this one. Until he comes up with a book that can equal his early stuff I'm going to read writer's who aren't going through the motions, like Steven Edwar Rustad, whose THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY was as spellbinding and powerful as THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. Remember THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, Mr. Clancy ? It was great!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't know if Clancy is burning out or if it's because I read Rainbow Six after enjoying competing war novel thrillers like War of the Rats and The Triumph and the Glory, but this new one from Tom falls far short of his best work. I hope the next one is better because I know I am not alone in being disappointed with his lackluster recent efforts."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, Tom Clancy delivers. This time, John Clark and son-in-law, Ding Chavez, lead an international counter-terrorism group made up of the best commandos NATO has to offer. The story starts out as many of Clancy's stories do. The difference here is that while the previous books set the pace in an almost even rhythm, this one draws you in and feeds you just enough to keep turning the page. The plot, and oh, yes there is one, unfolds perfectly. Not too fast, not dreadfully slow. The humor is vintage Clancy. If you enjoyed &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, you will love this one. Unlike some other authors of the current techno-thriller crop, the nuts and bolts explanations don't leave you rolling your eyes and skipping ahead. The characters seem well balanced and vivid. This is the ultimate ride for this genre. In past books by this author, the &quot;bad guys&quot; goal and/or strategy are revealed early on and much of the time is spent just connecting the set up to the final confrontation. In this story, you really don't know for sure until much later. Some will no doubt catch on quicker than others. For me, it was a real treat to just enjoy each scene and let my imagination go running-the way a good book is supposed to do. If you've never met real-life people similar to the characters in this book, then you will no doubt wonder at some of the character idiosyncracies of some of the good and bad guys and girls in this thriller. Having spent most of my life around the military and environmental groups, it struck me as odd how Clancy was able to capture the nuance of each and bring both together in a believable scenario. Don't know much about the computer game, but this book ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was way too gory and had no suspense at all. I didn't feel it was up to Clancy's usual standards."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was way too gory and had no suspense at all.

I loved the first john clark book Without Remorse and another book that has him as a main character has got to be good. I like this book a little better because in it Clancy starts of the action almost immediatly while in some of his other books it started off a little slow. overall i just really like this book alot"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's latest offering is yet another decline from his high level of excellence in the eighties. Hunt for Red October, Cardinal in the Kremlin and other similar works were well researched, had well developed characters and a pace of plot development that kept things moving and exciting. Rainbow Six depends more on heads being turned into pink meat than anything else to sustain interest. It also suffers from the drag it out write as many words as you possibly can to get your point across for absolutely no reason syndrome. This is one to avoid unless you are truly an avid fan or desperately need some beach reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;Rainbow six&quot;, by Tom Clancy,is a catchy, graphic thriller about a highly-trained group of anti-terrorists troops which is assigned to filter-out the world terrorism. While the special ops team,(Codename Rainbow), slowly filter out groups of terrorists, they stumble apon a worldwide conspiracy that involves a virus to destroy mankind.This book is very well written, the information comes at a good rate and dosen't feel overwelming although it was very technical. The author knows his facts; his style requires it, as he describes the situations that the rainbow team encounters. Clancy's knowledge in this book ranges from firearms to advanced government strategies and tactics. Clancy's style often involves many stories that intertwine in and out as needed in the plot. The only negative aspect of the story is that sometimes there was too much action and excitement for one page to contain."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's the first of clancys books that I have started, but it seems to be extreemly good so far. I will probably read another of his books after this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book catches your attention right in the beginning but towards the end it gets more and more predictable. Discribes actions and events really well and I think was worth the buy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy doesn't cut it with this overblown, politically motivated book. Check out Andy McNabb's, Bob Mayer's or even Dick Marcinko's books. Or James Webb's classics."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is very real and actually lets you see what a swat team does and the thoughts of the terrorists. The back-lying plot is so cool."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a great book. maybe a little detailed but not to bad. Three different terrorist attacks grab you from the begining. you get through one and go right into another, i like it. And then your hit by the &quot;Big One&quot;, wow. Nice job Clancy"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six goes into the detail of all the terrorist plans. He doesn't leave out any minor things that could affect a mission, yet he pulls it off to make the good guys win again. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is probably one of Clancy's worst novels. The plot is good but it is completely given away far too early. Add the relentlessly repetitive nature of what goes through each characters mind and I was tempted now and then to pass a few pages and find a place where the story would resume. The main characters long-winded thoughts about surviving in the &quot;new world order&quot; left me wondering if Clancy himself is going through a similar crisis. It seems to me that this fine novelist is going for the easy money this time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a future writer and is a big fan of the game &quot;Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6&quot; and just finish reading this book. I say this is a good book. All you readers who say &quot;oh too long&quot; or &quot;too much cussing and too much details.&quot; Well I say you are expecting too much from this guy. So what if details are too much, it just give you an idea of the scene and cussing is something the charecter do when they are pissed! If you are gonna give a bad review then don't leave it, cause I believe that people should read more often and Clancy is doing a great job of making people read, if ya give every book you think suck a bad review, kids will take that seriously and not read a really good book like this one. Even though this is an Adult book, but some kid want to read about action with guns and terrorist. Read this book for yourself and you will like it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I could not put this book down. My teachers yelled at me constantly for reading it in class. The action starts immediately in the prologue and does not stop until the unbelievably tense finale. It was very interesting because the bad guys had good intentions and Clancy made that clear. And not all the bad guys were really bad... (for you readers who have't read it yet). A must read for all Clancy fans and for those who aren't, you will be by the end."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is an action-packed thrill ride. The game was awsome, so I decided to try the book out. 900 pages! After I read the prolouge, I was addicted. This is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book begins with an airplane highjacking and ends with a stunning climax. A fascinating look into the anti-terrorist world, it is a must read for fans of Clancy and his John Clark thriller Without Remorse. At times, this book makes you want to grab a weapon and go at those looney &quot;tree-huggers&quot; along with the Rainbow team. At times, a little predictable, but an intersting look at the post Cold War situation of terrorism from within the U.S. Not his best work, but still very readable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Great book! It left me hungry for more. I usually shy away from Clancy's great length, but this one is absolutely worth it. If you like action and swat/special ops stuff, this is it!!! I agree with some reviewers who say the sinister plot is a little bit of a stretch. One of the later techno-gadgets is a REAL BIG stretch, but hey folks, this is fiction!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has written an EXELLENT novel with Rainbow Six. Although the book didn't have as many missions as the game did and didn't cover the areas of operation that the game did, the book was amazing. He accounts of the reponse teams and the action were amazing. A friend of mine in the Marine Corps said it was an excellent book save the itelligence for the team. I agree with him. Plus I think that security at the home base of the world's most elite, most covert, top secret strike force would be a little higher than for Popov to get in that easily, but it made for an excellent twist in the plot. Tom Clancy has done an excellent job on this novel and I hope he writes more books like this, maybe even make a Rainbow Six series like Op-Center or the tales of CIA man Jack Ryan. Excellent book. I would tell anyone to read this book as long as they could handle its size of 740 pages. Large, but fun. I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Thrilling book. One of Clancy's best book, I don't care about other reviews, this is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is not unusual for a Tom Clancy novel. It shows his usual command of character, plot and structure however Australians will be disappointed with his Australian characters and the Sydney setting. For example his Australian charaters talk like they are British (rather upperclass british) and Sydney airport lies outside of Sydney (rather than very near the city centre), showing that in regard to Australia, Clancy has not done his research. Aside from this Rainbow Six is a solid book with an interesting new use of some of his old characters (Clark and Chavez) in a new setting and addressing, as Clancty did in Executive Orders, biowarfare. This topic however, is not given much of a fresh look, which is disappointing, given that it is such a major issue."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of the most thrilling books I have read since, ever. So if your a type of person that always likerd the bad guys then this book will change your mind."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the last Clancy book I buy hot off the press in hardback. From now on, I'm going to check the Amazon reviews before risking my money.Rainbow Six looks like the result of a rush writing job with almost no editing. Certain peculiar phrases, while interesting on their own, show up two or three times. Made me think that Tom was trying them out in a few places and was too rushed to figure out the one best place.The pace was very non-Clancy like. The action dragged frequently and the good guy descriptions became routine and boring. This was my first Clancy novel I found easy to put down.Fortunately, I found sufficient satisfaction with the ending to somewhat make up for the unpleasantness of the read but overall, I still cannot recommend the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy delivers again. I was surprised, what others hated about this book, I enjoyed! I found this book fascinating, informative and a good all around read, and not boring whatsoever! It is not his best work, however. Tom Clancy successfully sets up creative plots , twists and turns, and characters. I have enjoyed nearly all of Tom Clancy's work and am pleased with this one. I will have to read the sequel to this. Tom Clancy passionately praises and supports the military and law enforcement agencies of the U.S., which should be highly commended. I highly suggest this book to anyone interested."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's amazing to read the reviews of this novel and see the polar opposites. What's even more amazing are the positive reviews from long time Clancy fans. Sorry folks, I have read all of his books and this is not his best stuff. At over 700 pages, it's at least 300 pages too long and unfortunately, it's the middle 300. The plot and characters are interesting enough, but the book suffers from too much setup and background that is unnecessary (particularly the personal lives of the anti-terrorist group). I forced myself to complete this book and if it hadn't been for an extended vacation this summer, I would still be reading this book seven months later. The books pacing sort of reminded me of my dad's description of the military, a lot of &quot;hurry up and wait&quot;. Clancy should have given this to a good editor to chop and it would have been much better. If you decide to read it, pretend you are on a long hike with no idea how far it is to your destination. That way you won't be disappointed by a real long forced march. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy really has excelled with Rainbow Six. It gives a very broad insight to the world of counter-terrorism.His characters are very well expressed, most notably Domingo Chavez Rainbows team two leader and Dmitry Popov the former KGB agent or &quot;spook.&quot; There is another side to the book however, a more sinister side perhaps closer to the truth than some governments would care to admit, sinister scientists planning to wipe out the earths population so as nature can breathe again. I think this book would make for an excellent film."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It started like most other Tom Clancy books and had the right caracters but after that it is quite different.....and I loved it. Although I liked Jack Ryan in his other novels I really enjoyed the focus and attention Tom Clancy gave to Ding and John. I am not sure I cared for the ending but I was thrilled with the book over all."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Being a great fan of Tom Clancy's writing, I believe that this is his best novel since The Hunt for Red October. I think this is a flourishing beginning to Tom Clancy's action packed books about Navy Seals."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was a predictable disappointment. Clancy got himself between a rock and a hard place with the Delta Force community and elected (correctly) not to give the company store away. With a good director i.e., Tarentino, and some gang members from LA... Rainbow will make for an entertaining movie."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I totally oppose the views of those who think this book is a waste of paper or time. On the contrary, this book has characters with real personalities and interactions. Its plot is intriguing - I couldn't put it down, even when I tried. I often stayed up for hours at night reading. Clancy does a great job of describing what goes on inside of a terrorist's head, as well as what goes on in a counter terrorism team's mind. There is plenty of suspensful action. Sure, I do admit that this book is rather large, but it is not a waste of paper! It is the best book I have ever read.The book starts with an attempted terrorist takeover of a jumbo jet. Luckily John CLark, former CIA and his collegues are on board, travelling to the Hereford military base outside of London to set up a multinational counter terrorism team. They apprehend the terrorists using their brains, tricking the terrorists into letting themselves be captured. Later, Rainbow stops other terrorist incidents that will eventually lead up to a very scary and very real possibility. I do not wish to divulge to much information or I would spoil the book for others.I recommend this book to everyone. Thank you for your time. I hope you found this helpful."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read this book about 7 years ago so forgive me for missing the details. Here is what I remember. This book blew me away so ferociously that the next week we went out of town and I stopped at a used bookstore and bought every hardcover Tom Clancy book they had on their shelves.The pace, intensity, and tension were so satisfyingly crafted that I just assumed that I would be as satisfied by the rest of his work, and for the most part I have been.This novel is about Rainbow, and international group of counter terrorist agents who are set against a group of environmentalist terrorists who see human life as the ultimate scourge on the planet and the human race must be destroyed ... i found the book to be fascinating."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Out of all the Clancy books I've read this isn't his best. I gave it a three because it doesn't excite me yet it's one of those that you feel good about reading.1. The story is mainly based around a need to be perfect and effective anti-terrorist team. They go on a few missions and win each without losing a single man until the third where they lose men and have to pull out.2. I wasn't terribly suprised by the book but it's still a good read.3. A good element that is represented is foreshadowing. Every mission or training course team Rainbow goes through is always an example of foreshadowing because team Rainbow has members who are military trained and they sense when a situation is about to go bad.4. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about special mission teams and anti-terrorism."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was a really good book. I would have given it a 5 but I think sometimes he puts in too many details and that takes away from the flow of the book. Otherwise, it was great. The book centers around a collective group of international special ops called Rainbox Six that take down terrorists and in particular one extremist organization. The book started off kinda slow but other than that was nice and clean. 4 Stars!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I will admit, I am more of a John Clark fan than a Jack Ryan fan and this accounts for a lot when I picked this book off of the shelf. Now...To begin, this book has it all: an unbelievable plot, the ultimate bad guys, great action sequences, and Jonh Clark and Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, as well as a string of new and old characters in the Ryan/Clark universe.Rather than give a synopsis, I will give the fine points of the book. To begin, it is obvious that Clancy did NOT want to mention Jack Ryan by name, and only refers to him as \\"The President\\" (which is a nice homeage to the presidents before Bob Fowler). This is somewhat like Without Remorse, but Clancy could not resist placing his star in that novel. Next, it is nice to see clark giving orders rather than taking them, though he has not severed his CIA ties, as mary Pat and Ed Foley are referred to a few times in the novel. Older characters appear in this book, such as Julio \\"Oso\\" Vega and Dan Murray. The plot is modern, and takes away from Clancy's old villians (the Soviets/Russians) and his nw villians (the Chinese). In truth, the villains in the first half of the novel are reminiscant to the IRA fundamentalists in Patriot Games. The star villains of the second half bring to light events like Oklahoma City and the Uni-Bomber by dealing with domestic terrorists, as well as reminding us of executive orders as many are supposed allies of the president.Low points in the book are few, but as with any novel, there are some. The fight scenes are not that dramatic, though elaborate. At points, the bad guys can do things that make a reader wonder if Clancy has some psychological repressions, but in true Clancy style, the wrong-doers do pay. As with other novels, all of the characters refer to doctors as \\"doc's.\\" Otherwise, it is difficult to spot lower aspects.This book is perfect for an action reader, and is designed for a younger generation of Clancy fans. It is a good way to enter the Clancy universe, as, though the past novels are heavily mentioned, you need not have read them to understand them, for Clancy explains the references fairly well.I hope you found this review useful, and I hope you buy the book. It is an excellent read, so enjoy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For years, Tom Clancy has been writing novels that tie into each other through certain characters. The linking character in Rainbow Six, John Clark, is seen in previous novels such as Clear and Present Danger and Without Remorse. John Clark is the head of a new international counter-terrorism unit designated as Rainbow. Domingo Chavez is Clark&#65533;s right hand man and son-in-law. Clark, charged with the task of running and maintaining all aspects of this Rainbow team, has Chavez as the leader of Team-2 of two teams. Over their first six months of operation, they respond to four seemingly unconnected incidents. The last of these occurs at the hospital at which Clark and Chavez&#65533;s wives work. A group of PIRA terrorists (Irish-Catholic) receive inside information on Rainbow, which is supposed to be &#65533;black&#65533;, or secret. They succeed in hurting Rainbow, but are all captured or killed in the process. Unbeknownst to Clark, these incidents have been secretly planned by John Brightling, the CEO of the pharmaceuticals company Horizon Corp. These attacks serve Brightling&#65533;s purpose by getting his right hand man the security contract for the 2001 Olympics so they may carry out a world-threatening plan to end life as we know it. From here the story takes twists and turns through the plot, always throwing in something different. An important part of the plot, the setting takes you around the world, from a Swiss bank to the jungles of Brazil; Clancy describes each location with vivid detail and great precision.Rainbow Six is a startling story of conspiracy of a large scale, covert international operations, and espionage. Tom Clancy incorporates all of these elements into an enthralling turn of events driven by strategic switches between characters&#65533; points of view that keep the story from stagnating. All aspects of the story are adequately detailed, from the operational procedures of the British MI5 to the workings of the H&K; MP10 sub-machinegun. I highly recommend the suspense/action novel Rainbow Six to those that like suspense, mystery, and action compressed into one book. For the Tom Clancy readers, this is one of his best yet."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Basically the book is about a team Mr. Clark has put together of the best-of-the-best counter terrorist specialists. Clancy's description and character building are exceptional along with the fact that this is an action novel (which rarely give you much in terms of character development). The book is long, but very enjoyable due to the story of the building of the team and their first operations. Just because this novel does not take place in the halls of politics or on a warship, his knack for technical and political story telling is not missed. This is a great addition not just to a Clancy library, but a military library as well, due to his knowledge of the subjects he writes about. I can't wait until the follow up to the Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I recently read this book while I was serving in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. Since there was not much in the way of television, I had to read on my spare time. I am a huge fan of Tom Clancy's work, and his Jack Ryan series, but I must say, that John Clark is by far the better hero. If one were to read \\"Without Remorse\\", it is clear why I think this. John Kelly is a real person with real demons, and his character fascinates me. I wish Tom Clancy would write more books with him in the title role. I must say that this book scared me to death. His tales of extremists in the \\"nature loving\\" world are very real. Nobody can deny this, with all the extremists in the world, it does not seem very far-fetched. In addition, the way Clark deals with these extremists in the end is the best kind of karma. Sheer perfection. The only disappointment I had was that, while Clark was the title character, he really was not a main character until the end. This book seemed to be more about Chavez than Clark. \\"Without Remorse\\" is still my favorite book, but Clark appears in a handful of other books by Clancy. The Amazon.com editor nails it with his \\"Clark is Ryan's shadow double\\" statement. He is an intense character, and I really hope that a movie is made about this book, or \\"Without Remorse\\" soon. However, I will not hold my breath"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Couldn't put this book down. Definately relates to todays world which made it all the more interesting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is just another thriller from the greatest author in the world. In Rainbow Six, Clancy goes for a different look. It may be one that some didn't like, but I thorughly enjoyed it. The novel contains his usual vivid action scenes and detailed descriptions, but never before have John Clark and Ding Chavez been the main characters of a Clancy novel, and that in itself gives a different flavor. He also has never gone after a plot this big. This is literally saving the world stuff here. Environmental extremists hatching a plan to wipe out humanity is not something I'd expect from him. A controversial novel to be sure, but a must read for all Tom Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Most of the time I look forward to reading and immersing myself in a Tom Clancy novel, but Rainbow Six the book doesn't fill the bill. The characters in this book do not come alive. In previous Tom Clancy books with Clark and Chavez, they had depth, you could understand what motivated them and they seemed like real people put into impossible situations. Rainbow Six didn't get the job done!? The personal dialogue between The Clark and The Chavez families was especially disappointing in its blandness. The emotional reactions of these two families to the &quot;jobs&quot; Rainbow Six has to do are almost non- existent. This is the first Tom Clancy novel or nonfiction book I have not recommended to my friends! I think Mr. Clancy needs to spend more time on his character development and less on &quot;Gadgets&quot;. I also wonder how much of this book was written to sell his new Computer game of the same name? At least in that game, 2-Dimesional characters are understanable due to technological limitations. What the excuse for this does Mr. Clancy have? I hope the next book Mr. Clancy writes will improve in this area. I am going to read reviews next time before I buy another of his books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is classic Tom Clancy, filled with a horrifying main plot, several sublots, lots of techno-jargon, and plenty of action. The main plot is not the most original, and the action is fairly boring, but there were some scary things suggested by the book. The book starts off well, with a revisit to John Clark, one of my personal favorites, and his son-in-law Ding Chavez, the hero of Clear and Present Danger. A multi-national tactical team is an interesting idea, allowing Clancy to write about the SAS and Delta Force in the same book, but hardly feasable. By far the most annoying part of the book was Clancy's repeated use of the word &quot;niggardly;&quot; using it once makes him sound literate, but using it eight times pisses you off. Clancy is an East Coast snob, and this book illustrated that more than any other. The ending was dull, with almost no suspense built up. The bad guys were caught too easily, making the whole book anticlimatic, although the punishment they got was pure John Clark, and a satisfying note to end the book on. All in all, a decent read, but he has some ground to make up with his next book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well Tom you finally did it..740 pages (hardcover) of slow reading, repetetive, predictible nothingness. John Clark the &quot;Dark Side of Jack Ryan&quot; is nothing but a suit and tie white collar whimp. Ding Chavez must have 240&quot; thighs from all of the working out he did. The Rainbow Commandos well, I hope that I can read more comic book stories to my 7 year old about virtually invicible heroes like these guys,the X-Men,and Sergeant Rock.I hear there is a new &quot;Techno-Thriller&quot; coming out called &quot;Tree Squad Six&quot;. They are an elite group of commandos who seek out and destroy authors who kill trees for the sake of wasting 740 pages of paper on...well..books that are just plain bad."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I took the recommendation of an earlier reader and bought EYES OF THE HAMMER for four bucks. Great book-- real special ops guys in action. Indeed, based on my military experience in the Rangers, its even more realistic than Clear And Present Danger. I plan on buying the rest of Bob Mayer's series in hardcover-- a better investment of my money than this book was. RANGERS LEAD THE WAY."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I found the book slow moving and over weight. There was too much detail and meaningless info. It felt like he was writing to fill pages rather than fill out the story. Once he got off the soap box, the action was typical Clancy; good. But there wasn't enough of it. This is by far his worst book. I was extremely disappointed, it took me 5 weeks to finish as it never really grabbed me by the throat."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a lay person Clancy reader, I am greatly disappointed by Rainbow Six. I say I am a lay person, because Clancy, who never met a weapons system he didn't like, spends entirely too much time giving technical stats, alphabet soup + numbers for simple descriptions of items. But, all of that is typical Clancy. I usually skip the sections of massive and tediously technical descriptions and stay with the dialogue of the main characters and do just fine. But, in this story, I began to wonder whether the defense industry has created new toys which Clancy read about, then structured a story so that those new hi-tech kill 'em toys could be show-cased?I am greatly disturbed by something ugly that seemed to rear its head in this book. There were repeated ignorant generalizations about Africa in the text of Rainbow Six.In one instance, He says: &quot; ...what African country has a proper air-defense network..&quot; Mr. Clanceyneeds to ask one of his airforce friends whether they want to overfly South Africa, Egypt, Angola or Lybia without warning.Later he says: &quot;..Africa was not yet a hot bed of international law and integrity...&quot; Wow.. what an unfair condemnation of all 53 African countries. I found that uninformed generalization about Africa to be highly insulting.Still later he says, &quot;.. Africa.. where countries lacked the infrastructure to do much of anything.&quot; Really? How uninformed can Clancy be? Just because it isn't on network news doesn't mean it doesn't happen. The infrastructure throughout southern Africa is more high tech and well developed than in areas of rural Mississippi or Lousinana or in the Applacians. Clancy, travel or read more about Africa so that you can make better statements.On top of all of that... Clancy chooses unfortunate adjectives. I counted five uses of the adjective &quot;niggardly&quot; and &quot;niggling.&quot; These are two words that get too close to the n-word for my tastes. In this era of trying to be politically correct whenever practicable, perhaps choosing another adjecitve for &quot;stingy&quot; would be better? Five usages of that adjective are a bit much don't you think?Then, Clancy's premise bothers me. God help us when an elite SWAT group sets itself up as judge, jury and executioner answerable to no elected body or official, yet with full ability to use equipment paid for by those very tax-payers cut out of the loop. Just the idea of this European/Anglo police force going across borders to implement their form of law and order is scary.But, this is only a story. In parts, a nice story. I like Ding and Clarke. I liked most of the characters, like Popov. But, so many of the events were predicable like the hostage taking of the two Clark women and the usage of all of the high tech toys that were on display.Clancy missed the mark by a mile this time. Rainbow Six is a dud."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's skill for technothrillers has not escaped him, but his plot (which to my mind is far too similar in its bio-technology content to Executive Orders) lacks the essential realism which makes a book of this kind a real winner. We have to be able to believe not only the characters but their actions, and Clancy's thinly-vieled sideswipe at ecological groups is at best crass and at worst a PR disaster. Portraying these groups as potential genocidal maniacs is not based in reality only in the vaguest, most bizarre &quot;what-if&quot; of one's imagination. Not something to write a 740 page novel about. The action is well done, and the characters are progressing well, though I would have preferred more on Ryan and how he handles the presidency, and less on Clark, whom we spent an entire novel with in &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, Clancy's best book, in my opinion. There was insufficient background to make the bio-war plot in any way believeable, and the background scenes that were included were virtually carbon-copies of the similar scenes in &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. A little more variety, please. And, one small point, as a Brit myself, I got a little tired of Clancy's over-egged Britishisms, which stretch realistic use of the language to breaking point, even the brand of English used in the armed forces. At the same time, the use of American English by Clark and Chavez is similarly unrealistic - does anyone have the mental capacity and dexterity to actually _speak_ like that? Not only does no-one even pause for breath before emitting these clever and witty utterances, they seem to form part of the everyday American language. Not so, in my experience! I look forward to more from Clancy, though the Op-Centre series is failing rapidly. We need more on Ryan and the presidency, and it does not have to be another global conspiracy, just a well-told story, sticking to the point and not trying to shoot down groups of the public with whom Clancy does not agree. Put all that stuff on the back burner and simply do what you are good at - entertain us."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom's book is large, leading one to imagine great plots and page-turning frenzy, but no. The book is just like cotton candy - you think there is something substantial to sink your teeth into, but there is nothing but fluff! A waste of my hard earned funds (I'll not send Tom anymore for future books) and waste of my time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am an avid reader of Clancy, but in his more recent novels he seems to have run out of material. They seem to be of the quality of the paperback &quot;Ops Center&quot; series he had produced with others, not very good but Ok for a paperback. Don't spend the $20 for the hardback and wait for it in paperback. Suggest Clancy reread Hunt for October and Red Storm Rising and recapture the realistic sense those had."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is not a worthy read for his fans. It is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his protagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book very little, but the best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I do not recommend this book to every Clancy fan. Tried to read it 3 times, no luck. Sorry Tom, you missed the mark by a mile."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's really a good story. But I like it when the end of a book is the best part. This is not the case with Rainbow Six. The best part is the first half. After that the story is a bit boring. The book would be the best if the syory was told in 600 pages instead of 800. But it's good to read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've enjoyed all of Clancy's other works, especially the concise way he changes venues and characters. This had very little of this. Muddy character descriptions, almost no plot, just vaguely interconnected scenes, (some that don't appear to connect until 2/3 through the book), and the worst villians I've read in a long time. His book reads like half political diatribe and half like the first draft of Executive Decision. This one should be missed completely and allow Mr. Clancy a chance to try again, this time without the political undertones."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Everything about Clancy's work is fanitasic. The characters, the story, sub plots, and more. I found it difficult to put down on many occaisions. A must Read!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Proof that Clancy is extremely stale. I was left with a feeling that he threw this one together on a whim without much, if any, forethought or research. This was stunning in that Clancy is THE master of research and detail. Having come to expect that bit of realism Clancy usually achieves by a mastery of technical detail, Rainbow Six was an utter disappointment and waste of time. The story was so incredibly farfetched as to be fantasy. This, in itself, would not be fatal but for his failure to develop that fantasy in anything but the most rudimentary way. Rainbow Six is simply shallow. Even in that puddle, Clancy waded in way over his head with Rainbow Six. Where his research and detail usually provide an ample life raft, this time he sunk like a hefty 700+ page bore."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and must agree with those who feel this is far from what we have come to expect. Almost the entire book was spent in story development, leading to one very predictable event. With Clancy's books I find myself unable to put them down. With Rainbow Six I found myself having a difficult time picking it up."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well, I must first say that I personally have never been directly involved with spec ops warfare. However, I have done extensive research on all groups of the special forces, and also know men who are currently or have been involved, and aspire to join them upon completion of college. My brief summary? Well, Carlos the Jackal was an entirely benine element that should have been eliminated before publishing. There were parts of the book that seemed to drag on forever. However, I did find the story intruiging. For those of you who were dissapointed in the combat scenes, you must first understand the purpose of special ops teams. They spend about ten times as much time planning a mission as they do executing it. They are hit and dissappeare rapid response groups. A typical mission should not be this long drawn out battle campaign. It should be bang bang bang, and in a minute it's over. Or at least this is what my friends who are in the biz have related to me. So I think those were depicted fairly accurately. Overall it's not Clancy's best effort, or worth the thirty dollars I spent. But it was not bad. My reccomendation, buy the video game, it's a lot cooler."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual for Clancy, a well written, exciting novel. I even had to skim through the World Park section, because I couldn't take it.That said, I wouldn't have minded a few less pages in the middle, and a few more at the end. I think it finished up (relatively speaking) a bit too quickly. And yes, a few sections were far-fetched. But I think that, for the most part, is nitpicking."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read most of the readers reviews, and i must say, what version of the book were you reading? I have read nearly ALL of Tom Clancy's books, and I can not believe some of the reviews i saw. First off, I noticed many of the people dont even bother to read the book. You buy the audio cd or cassette. READ THE BOOK! If there is one thing I learned is that the book is always the best. Not the movie, not the audio. The point is for YOUR imagination to work, not someone else reading it to you. A bedtime story? like a little child. Ranibow 6 was a very good book, and I personally didn't think it was too long, (how can you complain on length if you listen?) and the story kept me to the book for about 3 straight weeks. The charachters were very good, and the plot excellent. I personally like Clark, as a charachter, but from some of the reviews I read I seem to get the impression that if it is not Ryan, then it cant be good. WRONG. Go buy Rainbow 6, you will read it and enjoy it, if you like any of Clancy's other novels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The premise of the book was intriguing. That is something that you can depend on with Clancy. He tees up some interesting questions which make you think about the grey areas which surround the world of international relations. Maybe I am getting tired of the characters or maybe I felt that too much of the prose in this text was repetitious. Some editing of length would have benfitted the story. The other disappointment was the movement of the story to an inevitable conclusion. There were too many perfect shots and too many lucky breaks."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love Chavez,Clark MAlloy,Price and especially popov.

If I took every repeated sentence, that he used to describe the same tone for the character, and removed them the book would have been about 200 pages shorter.

Not CLancys best book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; the latest novel from Tom Clancy, is bette than some of his previous works, but his researchers and writing craft are getting sloppy. In the first two chapters the author (or more likely his researchers) makes a mistake regarding the Canadian Armed Forces that the most basic research should have caught. Errors like this raise the question, &quot;if he can't get something this basic right, what else is inaccurate?&quot; For me, the answer is the way Clancy's military characters talk and interact with each other; something he and his researchers never seem to get right. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but as my Russian instructors used to say, &quot;you can't understand the psychology without understanding the language&quot;. More importantly, I would like to see a high-tech prototype fail exactly when it's needed the most-something that has happened to me on more than one occasion. The writing craft doesn't seem equal to the length of the book (700 pages). Descriptions of characters and motivations are repeated when they are brought back into the plot-annoying to the reader. Also, continuity suffers as one key character changes his motivation from one description to the next. One almost gets the feeling that three people each wrote about a third of the book, and they were edited together. If you are a Clancy fan, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you arent', this book won't make you into one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's 10th novel and ninth in the Jack Ryan/John Clark series, once more focuses on the ex-CIA paramilitary field officer known in the Agency as Mr. Clark. This time, the focus once again turns to the challenges of fighting global terrorists and the menace from extremists determined not only to reshape society, but the entire planet's environment.Clark is close to retiring as a paramilitary officer in the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Operations when Agency executive directors Ed and Mary Pat Foley, with the tacit approval of the recently elected President John Patrick Ryan, ask him to run an elite team of antiterrorist Special Ops fighters from several NATO countries. Their mission: to act as an international 911 team in hostage and other terror-related situations deemed too high-risk for local law-enforcement agencies. Based in England, this so-called Rainbow Team will be deployed mainly in Europe, but with support from U.S. and other allied nations, can operate anywhere in the world. Clark, who was an enlisted member of a SEAL team in Vietnam, is given a rank equivalent to a full colonel and the call sign Rainbow Six. (In military parlance, the designator \\"six\\" after a unit's call sign is assigned to a commanding officer.)Rainbow Six opens with a tense incident high above the Atlantic as a small group of Basque terrorists attempts to hijack the plane carrying Clark, his wife, his protege and new son-in-law Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, and Alistair Stanley, his British second in command, to London. Using their wits and finely honed skills, the three Rainbow members overwhelm the hijackers and save the crew and their fellow passengers.With this introduction to the job, Clark then turns his attention to training the various members of the several Rainbow teams, not knowing that the airliner incident was simply one of many terrorist incidents being bankrolled by a mysterious and wealthy individual with a darker, more terrifying agenda. With the assistance of a former KGB officer and inspired by one of the most horrible aspects of the Iranian plot against the U.S. (as chronicled in Executive Orders), a group of environmental extremists is plotting to reverse centuries of man-made damage to the Earth's biosphere by committing the most horrible act of mass murder in history.Clancy's novel paints a troubling picture of what happens when a noble idea (such as promoting global conservation) is twisted and perverted by charismatic and cold-blooded individuals, and its action-oriented plot inspired an ongoing series of computer games."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's literary reverence for things military is overtly evident through his books from Hunt for Red October onwards. In Rainbow Six, he indulges in small unit tactics for a whole tome. In many ways typical Tom Clancy, the book is instructive at a layman level about anti-terrorist tactics as practiced by special forces units. I have little doubt that the usual level of research went into this book that Mr Clancy usually carries out. I admit to being an unabashed fan.So why not five stars?Well, to be honest, nothing ever goes wrong for these guys. The books continuously alludes to the virtual certainty of problems with operations, but then nothing really does. I kept waiting for the problem and the subsequent analysis, but it never happened. I realized that, among the other obvious things that I like about Clancy, the recognition of the failings that people have and the way these play out on a broad stage are much of what I enjoy about his books. This one doesn't really have that.Good Clancy, but not the best Clancy"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It seems that Tom Clancy's most recent novels don't measure up to his older stories. Unfortunately, Rainbow Six seems to continue that trend. The slow pace, pathetic character development, and silly main plot prevent this book from being on the same level as his earlier novels.Without a doubt, the biggest flaw in the story is the virtually non-existant character development. The best example of this is the Rainbow squad members. I know that it's hard to give individual personalities to twenty or so different characters, but that isn't a good enough excuse to explain their total lack of develoment. They are prety much typical military stereotypes, with next to no background or personal information given about them. At the very least, I would expect Clancy to pay some attention to Ding Chavez, seeing how important he is to the story, but he also doen't have much in the way of personality. John Clark fares slightly better in this department than the other members of the squad, retaining the same personality that Clancy fans have come to love. The best character in the book is Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, the cunning former Russian KGB agent, who is extremely greedy but still has something of a conscience. On the other side, the major villians of the story, like the Rainbow squad, suffer from lack of development, as they aren't even fully introduced until near the end of the book. For me to understantd their motivations and their ambitions, they needed to have a more deal of screen time. The end result was the shoddily developed villians you saw.The slow pace is another culprit. Most of the book's 897 page lengh is annoying filler material which should have been edited out. The pace picks up during last two hundred pages, but it's too late to sve the rest of the book. There aren't enough action sequence to fill the entire book. Also, the main plot is rather silly. A group of enviromentalists who want to save the world by killing the entire human population? I don't need to explain just how ridiculous that is...But the book isn't a total failure. The action parts were well-written, if a little bit predictable. There were alo some other parts of the book that held my interest, like many of the scenes with Popov. Altogether, the book has some nice action sequences and some interesting scenarios, but the book just wasn't as good as I've come to expect from Tom Clancy..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Let's face it. Shakespeares' pants, a load of plays copied straight from older storylines. But anyway, Tom Clancy is probably the best author in the world for this sort of book. However, he has fallen once again on his two main flaws to receive a perfect 5/5. These flaws are simple ones: 1. Americans are the best, superheros who are better than everyone, even the SAS, which I doubt. 2. Storylines leading to nowhere - very frustrating However, he still accumulates all the key elements for a brilliant read. In some of his books, particularly Executive Orders, I found myself sat reading for days before I read that a tiny US task force obliterated a steamroller style Iran/Iraq army defending its own ground. However, in Rainbow Six, the action comes at appropriate times so that my interest did not attenuate as I went along. Also, the action is simply fantastic, with suspense, careful planning and perfect takedowns that you would expect from such men in real life. The weapons used are awesome in power, particularly the sniper's rifles, and I was fascinated to read how such men trained. It's been made into an excellent computer game. Might we be getting a film just as good? I think we should."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In today's world, terrorism is rampant. The definition of terrorism is &quot;the calculated use of violence or the threat of violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.&quot; This means that there are people out there trying to inhibit our freedoms by any means possible. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six revolves around the world of terrorism. It is the story of John Clark, master of the Covert and Black Operations world. Clark also stars in many other Clancy novels such as &quot;The Bear and The Dragon.&quot;The novel is about an international Counter-Terrorist team, named Rainbow due to its multi-national make up. Different members are recruited from the world's best Counter-Terrorist teams around the world such as Seal Team 6/DEVGRU (Naval Special Warfare Development Group), SAS (Special Air Service), HRT (Hostage Rescue Team), and GSG-9 (Grenshutzgruppe 9). The team's mission is to effectively resolve terrorist situations world-wide.The setting is modern day. Although Clancy wrote this novel in the late 90's, the equipment that Rainbow uses is still currently used in real Counter-Terrorism teams today, except the Heart Beat Sensor, which is purely theoretical. However their equipment which includes H&amp;K MP-10s, flash bangs, NVG (Night Vision), infrared, Primacord explosive, and tactical radios are all very real and all used today.In the novel, Clancy uses a plain, straight-forward style of writing. He also is very descriptive. His descriptions include thoughts and feelings of both Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. He offers an insight on our recent tragedy by letting us into the minds of the terrorists within his novel. Of all the descriptions, most memorable are his bullet impacts. For example, he details how a headshot from a sniper's 7mm bullet leaves a bloody mess. I believe he uses these descriptions to symbolize the horror that terrorism aims to create, and in many cases succeeds in doing so.I am not an avid reader; however I felt that I could not put this book down. I am very interested in the area of Counter-Terrorism and have done personal studies on the subject, so naturally this book appealed to me. However, if you enjoy reading books or novels full of action, excitement, suspense, and emotion, read Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, and I guarantee you will like it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Besides the length, I like to think of this as a sort of action movie in a book...it's worth reading because of a series of sequences that make it fun, but if you're looking for good literature, &quot;Rainbow&quot; has no hidden pot of gold. Clancy gives us almost no sense of his characters, presenting them as all-powerful, invincible human beings, just like a modern-day Bond thriller.Of course, you could argue, who cares? That's what I said. This thick mother of a book is replete with 007-styled shoot-em-up sequences, where the pages turn a mile a minute.So how is this book 800+ pages? Come on. It's Clancy. He gives us his usual military specifics and detailed descriptions of obsolete or unusual devices, used as filler space between his truly well-written action scenes.Another thing. This book has no plot. What plot there is, however, nicely serves as a device to bring on Clancy's thrilling terrorist take-downs. I think he should simply exclude all &quot;plot,&quot; simply write a series of random exciting action scenes, because this book's attempt at plot is surprisingly pitiful. Makes you feel sorry for poor Tom.Now, I've heard folks tease him for &quot;getting paid by the word&quot; but...seriously, no one really cares, this book still made the top spot on The NY Times, because it's Clancy, and everyone loves him. This book might be too verbose; so what? At the very least just skim over the boring stuff, or simply skip it entirely. The rest is too good to miss.By the way, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; the game is even better..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What can I say? Wow! Right from the start, that most excellent of storytellers, Tom Clancy, throws us into action with a detailed yet gripping account of a hijacking. In some of his previous books (most notably Patriot Games, Executive Orders and The Sum of All Fears) the story dies for a hundred pages or more as Clancy explains the story (and regrettably, this has resulted in many readers stopping reading mid-way through a book...But no more. Rainbow Six keeps up the heart pumping action right the way through as though there is no tomorrow - and there may well not be! Long as it is, Clancy has once again kept my full attention resulting in late nights, staying up far too late turning page by page to find out WHAT HAPPENS!I was worried that Clancy was beginning to dull in his stories, having read Executive Orders which was explosively exciting in the last pages but, I felt, took too long to get there. And having read the co-authored Op-Centers, I was very worried as they all lacked the quick pace and exciting realism common to many Clancy books.However, I felt that singling out environmentalists as the bad guys was not a good marketing move (if not resulting in an excellent book!) and that their methods and ideals were not credible enough to bring a true sense of realism. I did enjoy the fantastic end to the story and hope that, true to Clancy style, Dmitry Popov will appear in another book in the near furture!And for the second time, Clancy has focused the book on John Kelly (otherwise known as Clark). Clark has definitely changed since the torture days portrayed in Without Remorse, become more mature, even mellowed in age. I missed good old Jack Ryan however although Clancy referred to Clark's good relationship with &quot;The President&quot;. I felt that Jack deserved more place although, I think Clancy may have brought an end to Jack Ryan as a major role in Executive Orders. Keen followers of Clancy will note how Jack gradually rose through the ranks - ordinary history teacher and a lucky stock investor, then working at CIA, eventually becoming, DDO, DDI and eventually head of the CIA (which I believe is DCI, right?). Then going on to National Security Advisor, Vice-President (albeit for a short time) and finally President. I can think of no higher occupation for Ryan and this leads me to believe Clancy has decided to leave him out of future novels. I hope I am wrong...Is Clancy, in his usual portrayal of realistic events (as opposed to fantasy ones) going to let John Clark and Jack Ryan simply die of old age? Whilst this would be true to form, they would be sorely missed, and only Ding seems to be able to replace either of them. Are future books to hold only Domingo Chavez and not the beloved Clark-Chavez team? Will Jack retire?We can't tell. Clancy has shrouded us in a black cloak of curiosity until he chooses to reveal antoher piece of the unending story he weaves. And even then, we surely will not get the last piece of the puzzle. We will be left again to wait until it is time...This excerpt was written by Chris Kreft. I am an avid Clancy fan (in case you couldn't tell) and have nearly all the books he has written from &quot;Red October&quot; to &quot;Executive Orders&quot; (I'm only missing &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;) as well as all the Op Center books. I have also read some of Clancy's other books such as SSN and regard myself as a well-informed reveiwer of his books.Thanks for reading, and Happy New Year!Chris Kreft (ckinusa3712@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Through Tom Clancy's various books, he has used present day environments to set the stage for his characters to do what they do best. In &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, Clancy takes the reader into the world where spies are for hire, America is blind to bio warfare and old CIA agents are looking for new tricks.Clancy once again resumes the tale of John Clark who was made popular in the film &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;. As a CIA Agent looking at the new world and seeing all the changes that have happened since his first exploits in the Vietnam war, Clark creates an ultra black project known as Rainbow Six.Based in England a with a free hand to combat terrorism on a global scale, Clancy pens a very exciting drama that is tough to put down.Ofcourse this wouldn't be a good Clancy book without plently of storylines linked together. There is a greedy former KGB agent stirring up terrorists around the world, a drug company CEO who cares more for the environment than his fellow man and a close Presidental advisor who is instrumental in exposing Rainbow Six.Remarkably Clancy brings it all together in the final pages and leaves us wanting more."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read many of Tom Clancy's novels (The bear and The Dragon, Executive Orders, The Hunt For Red October, and Patriot Games to name a few), but none of them even compare to this book. I usually like to watch the moive rather than the book, but as there was no movie out for this book, I sat down to read it. This was one of only 4 books I've ever read in my life thatr I literally couldn't put down. The others being 1984, The Outsider, and Animal Farm. And while Rainbow Six doesn't strike out against society as the previously mentioned books do, it is still a very entertaing and exhilerating book. Personally, I believe it is the best Clancy novel I've read to date."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I didn't realize for years that Mr. Clancy had written other books in the Ryan universe besides _The Hunt for Red October,_ and I kicked myself when I found out what I had been missing: lots of big fat good books with equal portions brain and heart. This one took some getting into, though, because I am a granola treehugging eagles-belong-downtown envirofeminist myself. (Belong downtown? In my little Alaskan town, they crap on the cars. Everybody in the U.S. should have the privilege of wiping bald eagle crap off of their own automobile.) But on rereading, I got a chill down my spine.Any deeply held belief system can be coopted by the taint in the human soul and turned into a Cause, as in Anything For The. Clancy's genius shows in the way he created a believable charismatic human monster in the historic tradition, but gave him a Cause for the 21st century. It made me reexamine my dismissal of the wackaloons of the environmental movement. All they need is a demagogue.The lesser monsters who cluster around John Brightling have their finely drawn individual freakishness as well. They remind me of Hitler's supporting cast, and I suspect that that was the author's model. You have the man who scarcely blinks at human death but flinches at the deaths of small animals; the self-indulgent brute who murders rather than restrain his appetite; the enthusiastic planners who are so in love with the big picture that they find it easy to ignore its horrible scaffolding; the dreamers who really believe that their personal obsessions justify the bloody overthrow of civilization. I entertained myself on a hot afternoon by imagining life in the Kansas facility in a plotline where the Project succeeded. Then I shuddered and went out into the sunlight.The musings of various Project members are some of Clancy's finest bits of irony to date. I liked the media room for the use of the grandchildren of the Anointed--as if fresh videotapes would spring up next to the strawberries. And the idea that the most important thing to consider, when trying to feed several thousand people on local resources, would be recipes. And the ark built by radical environmentalists that requires petroleum to keep out the deadly Kansas winter. And so on.But Clancy is scrupulously fair. There is the brown smudge. There was the Exxon Valdez disaster. (The way a denizen of the Wonderland Beyond the Beltway drastically underestimates its scale and severity even while using it as an excuse for murder is another fine bit of irony.) There is the inescapable legacy of nuclear waste. There is the way mine tailings put arsenic in drinking water. It is human nature to use hard facts in the service of convenient lies. Clancy uses them instead to tell a whacking good story that leaves you thinking about the contradictions of humanity. He does this a lot. Go buy. Go read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was very pleased to see that Mr. C is getting more page space. He is the hidden figure of other Clancy novels. Mr. C is at his best when the pressure is on and in this case he is put into a postion that best fits him. A shadow figure who is in command of a group of shadows. Their mission is to deal with people the most effective way possible, make the consequences dire others will think twice before trying terrorism. Rainbow Six in a nut shell. A must read for Clancy fans and an entertaining book for everyone else. He does not get as technical as in some books. It is a good way to while away a few hours or weeks (700+ pages). The book has good pace and a belivable (a bit outlandish) story line. Would not want to meet up with a &quot;Shiva&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I won't go into deep detail, because you've already read the reviews and you know--by now--the plot of the story. Well, I think the story could have been better, but it was a fun read, and it appeared to me Clancy wanted to broaden his imagination abit, taking us on a ride where the threat is real but--like a good comic book adventure, as done in the Batman series last year, I think--the execution of a super virus is exaggerated. Mr. Clark (Rainbow Six) would be better in comics and the movies than in this form. At least great artists would make it better off.Well, send any comments. I'm sure I could challenge them!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book reads like play it again Sam. Ebola threat but not as much hero or terror as last Ebola threat. Too long and too much time on the firing line. I love the quality of the heros like those in &quot;Lonesone Dove&quot;. No doubt who is good or bad but the villians and plot requires too much of a conspiracy to be believeable. Hope TC does a better job all the way around if he does another Ryan-Clark-Domingo-character in a book. His poorest effect!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"How horrible was this book? To begin, the main character dies in the end, only to be brought back by the terroists? How lame! Avoid this if you have spare time. There are so many great books out there, and this is not nearly one of them!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I agree with the reader from Fort Bragg-- time to start checking out other thriller writers whose work you might not have seen. Bob Mayer's special forces series is a good starting point. Loved CUT OUT, ETERNITY BASE and the other books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is the least compelling of all of Clancy's novels. On the bright side, the character development is very good; the reader does end up caring about the good guys.But the main premise of the novel that a bunch of U.S. eco-nazis could conspire to wipe out most of humanity is absurd. A nation-state might be able to pull it off but there's no way 100 to 200 eco-freaks in the U.S. could do it without there being a leak that would bring the whole thing down like a house of cards: someone would talk, someone would get suspicious, they'd call the cops, and that would be that.Also, it would not take the eco-nazis a long time to figure out how to get out of the predicament Clancy leaves them in at the end of the story. Clancy wants us to believe they will all die but the fact is most could survive if they just stay calm and work together. All they need to get out is a canoe. The ending is thus very unsatisfactory and way below Clancy's usual high standard."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's too bad that Clancy has become so powerful that he could tell his publisher's editor to f*** off. If there was one thing this overlong book needed was good editing and about five more re-writes. The result is a boring, predictable, cartoonish tech manual. It was as if he wrote his first draft as a story outline and went with it. Character development? Forget it. There are no interesting characters in the book except maybe the ex-KGB agent, who's too dull to figure out the obvious until just in the nick of time. And, by the way, the &quot;nick of time&quot; ending is obvious and unexciting. The heroes are mere vectors of action and have no interest to the reader as human beings. I feel used by Mr. Clancy who must have figured his reputation would sell a lot of books without really working too hard. I doubt I will buy any more of his books if this is where he is headed in his career."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am really not the type that would appear to like Tom Clancy or suspense novels, but when I read the flap inside the book, it sparked my interest, so I bought it. From day one I could not put the book down. It took two weeks to read it, and it was worth it. It was the first book I had ever read from this author and I just have to have more. So, I am now reading Executive Orders. It is proving to be really good. The way Tom Clancy writes is suspenseful and brilliant."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;It's like something from a bad movie&quot; says one of the main characters, Domingo Chavez, when he finds out what the bad guys are up to. I started saying that a lot earlier.I've read all of Clancy's novels so I would say that I'm a fan. He's never been even a good writer when it comes to depth of character, dialog, etc., but he always tells a good story. With world events as they are Clancy has lost his evil empire. There's simply no one we'd even want to steal a submarine from left now. Clancy has not adapted well. His main character, Jack Ryan, became President two books ago and served part of his term in the most recent book. Three books ago, arabs blew up the superbowl with a nuclear bomb. Two books ago, Japan declared war on the United States over a faulty muffler. In the last one, Jack Ryan presided over the United States and looked to win re-election. The plot here is that much less realistic.In case you decide to read this book, I won't give away too much of the plot. But the book concerns John Clark and Chavez who start a multi-national anti-terrorist group called Rainbow (Clark, the commander, is called Rainbow Six). So far so good. But then we get two plot lines we've seen in previous books: bad guys test ebola on human subjects before unleashing it on the world in an effort to kill as many people as possible, and secondly, IRA terrorists attack the pregnant wife of the main character.The book stays interesting while the counter-terrorists do their business in five separate incidents. But the main story line is ridiculous and serves only to tell us that Clancy apparently hates the environment (when mentioning a tree 12 feet in diameter, a &quot;good guy&quot; thinks to himself what a nice house it would make) and anyone who supports the environment is a kook bent on destroying humankind. Much of the book repeats its mantra of how good the good guys are (I don't know how many times we hear how well prepared and professional the counter-terrorist group is) and how bad the bad guys are. There is so much filler that, even though I've gotten good at skipping Clancy's filler in the past, that I would have wound up skipping 60% of the book. And the other 40% is no picnic.Final verdict: there are only a few good parts of this book. If you must read it because you've read all the others, then be my guest. But if Clancy has been getting tired for you lately, just do yourself a favor and avoid this book. If you've never read Clancy before don't start with this book. He has done better in the past.One final note. Apparently the book was released with a video game tie-in. Never a good sign. I think Clancy has just been looking to milk his series of novels to get more capital so he can finally buy a football team. Don't throw your money away on Tom's football team."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy keeps the action going from the very beginning of the book. It was enjoyable to see him develop Clark and Chavez into &quot;real people&quot;. While the good guys win easily, would we expect it to be any other way? Mr. Clancy seems to have a way of taking actual world events and weaving them into a piece of fiction that makes you set back and wonder how close the world has come to this scenario."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Mostly because I don't read that much, but still it's a great book. Tom Clancy does a great job showing how counter-terrorists try and stop terrorists around globe. Even showing their emotions is a great touch for this military thriller....Zach"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is one of the best books I have read in a long time. This was my first book by Clancy, and I have already bought more of his books. Clancy captures the current situations in the book and explains, sometimes in gruesome detail, how it was handled by the new CT team made up of American, British, Israeli, and German troops. Rainbow Six is a must read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Though not a Clancy fan, it's definitely one of his best for action. I found howeverm the action sequences a bit repetitive. An Internationally sanctioned hit squad that is transported to terrorist situations where hostages lives are in the balance. This International S.W.A.T. Team, made up of the best of U.S., U.K. German, and a few other countries, goes in, and kills the perpetrators of these crimes. Not a bad idea, so far as I'm concerned.Only two things making this international hit squad a total fantasy; with the &quot;Liberal&quot; politicians feeling sorry for the criminals these days, it would take days, if not weeks for them to agree to kill off their criminally bent friends, unless, of course, one of their own family members was being held hostage.The second is; most major cities around the world already have militarily trained Swat teams to deal with this sort of problem.Still, all in all, I'd have to say one of his more interesting, and exciting books to read.My favorite Clancy Novel to this day, is still &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; which he wrote with Larry Bond, whom I consider a far better writer of war, and anti-terrorist novels than Clancy is."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I first started reading this book I felt kind of query because the first scene starts out in an airplane while the narrator (main character) Jack is nervous. As predicted and led up to there are terrorists on the plane that attempt to hijack it. (9-11??) Kind of ironic but Clancy is known for writing scenes and the in some way, shape, or form they come true. This book so far is very good and I can't put it down. Once you get hooked on Clancy books you will always be a fan. The best part is the detail Clancy puts in evaluating each agent (CIA, SEALS) it is as if the book wasn't fiction. I rate this book high and recommend it to anyone who enjoys military related books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a great book in my opinion. I liked it because Tom Clancy makes parts with lots of action, which is what I like. This book opens in Hereford, England where John Clark has setup a black-op organization called Rainbow Six which is an anti-terrorist organization that reacts against terrorist attacks. John Clark makes two different teams in this organization which are lead by Peter Covington and Domingo Chavez. Chavez and Clark are the most talked about characters and in this book their wives are involved. Most of the characters in the Rainbow Six group are from Tom Clancy's other books. Tom Clancy explains the terrorist attacks very well and how the characters would feel if this event really happened. Most of the events are very surprising and exciting. The ending is very surprising."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book gives a real life sense of modern warfare and the world's continuing struggle with terrorism. It shows how family and war can affect a person. It deals with the growing horror of bio-war and what an extremist can really do with it. It lets us all know how much special forces people sacrifice to keep us safe and the invisible heroes who can never tell their stories.John Clark starts the black counterterror group known as Rainbow. Made of the world's best special forces people, Rainbow is able to deploy anywhere at any time to take out the worst of the worst terrorists. But now an extremist group, who believes in their idea so strongly that they're willing to go to mad ends to complete it, are on the scene using the new horrifying weapon of bio-war. Is there enough time and enough information for rainbow to stop these lunatics?If you've read the other Clancy books then you'll recognize the mysterious John Clark and the head strong Domingo Chavez. They're both great characters and Clancy continues their originality throughout the book. He also brings some new characters to the scene all with the ingenuous design that Clancy offers.I most definitely recommend this book. It is heart pumping, realistic action from start to finish. With an interesting plot to keep you reading. It has enough action to keep you interested and enough side story to let you know the detail.I recommend this book to people who already love Clancy's other work. It is also a good book for action lovers. I personally think everyone should read it. Tom Clancy is a talented writer and he shows it in this book. If you played the game you should read the book to know about the whole thing because the book is totally different."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I stopped reading Clancy after about his fourth or fifth book (all enjoyable reads) just for a break as I stopped reading Grisham after about the same number of good reads. I got this for my birthday and was reluctant to read it......but after a severe quad muscle strain that left me imobilized for 4-5 weeks, I dove in! Glad I did! This is a long (900 pages) but outstanding page turner! Classic Clancy that goes after environmental nazis! And what they do to them in the end is a classic twist of the unexpected! Get through the first 200-250 pages of introductions of characters, sub plots, and themes and away you go into the world of international terrorism, counterterrorism, technological equipment with cool applications, etc......a pot of gold awaits at the end of this rainbow!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This reads more like a screenplay than a novel. The book opens up with a James Bond-type scene, where the main heroes are established by defusing a hijacking that has no bearing on the rest of the book. Clark seems to have developed telepathy, as he figured out that the pilot was ex-USAF instead of ex-USN just by the expression in his eyes. Yeah, right, it felt like Clancy was just trying to atone for dissing the USAF in all his other novels.The plot develops just like a movie. The Rainbow team is established and trains for a while. Then they get called to respond to some terrorist situations. Three, if I recall, and no good guys went down. Everybody's happy. So at this point, we should expect their next mission to go all wrong. And sure enough, it does. What a surprise. Then on the climactic mission, the bad guys seem to have the upper hand until our intrepid heroes summon their Rocky-like strength and defeat the bad guys. Movie over. Whoops, I mean &quot;book over.&quot;I expect this book to be adapted for the big screen, since Clancy clearly wrote it like a typical movie where nothing surprises you. Having said all this, it's filled with the usual Clancy goodies, which makes it enjoyable. But the Hollywood plotline is so disappointing. Having read all of his novels, I'd say that Rainbow Six is the book that jumped the shark. Clancy is simply becoming a lazy writer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"You've heard of books that one simply &quot;can't put down&quot;, well that was how this one was with me! After reading other books with small parts for John Clark and his side kick, this one was spectacular and awesome.Rates right up there with Richard Marcinko and his Seal Teams adventures."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm new to the Tom Clancy scene, but after picking up and reading Rainbow Six, I know I'll be looking around for more of his works.I thought nearly every aspect of this book was well written and entertaining. His style of writing makes even the most lacking parts as entertaining as the gunfights. His brilliant use of imagery in the action sequences really brought up the standard of what I'm looking for in a action novel.As soon as you pick up the book, and read the first few pages, you're hooked. I didn't think it was possible to intrest me in a book that quickly, but Clancy seemed to make it easy. After the prologue in which Clark, Chavez and Stanley apprhend the 3 hijackers, I knew the rest of the novel wasn't going to let me down. And, sure enough, it didn't.The rest of the book was full of suspense that kept my eyes glued to the pages long after the sun had set. From the bank robbery in Bern, to the hostage situation at Worldpark, I was entranced at the plot and never put the book down.This book will appeal to many differant types of people, except &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, who will have a few bad things to say about their protrayl in this book.In the end, this book never let down and made me a Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is ingenious. I give this book a good rating, because of the concept and the action. This book is by far the most thrilling book I have ever read. Rainbow Six had me on the edge of my seat. This book also got made into a video game, and for that it would have to be a great book. Another reason I think this book is good is because of the characters are believable. This book has a great sequel. So I give this a 10 out of 10. Read this book and feel the action."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Love Tom Clancy's works!Loved Rainbow Six!Sequel, please!!!!

Decent plot, great ending, but took too long to get to it. I would try another of his books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although it was somewhat predictable it made you want to keep on reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved the book. Thought it was great reading, and enjoyed the fact that I didn't finish it in one day."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I finished this book for the first time I was ready to give it 5 stars. But 5 stars is probably too much.This book excels in its action scenes. There is nothing else I liked more about this book than reading each encounter with a terrorist threat and how they used psychology, negotiation, and planning to clear a room full of terrorists in as little as 10 seconds.The visuals he gets into your head are amazingly true to life but not enough to make you turn away in disgust. As is usual with all Clancy novels, there are brief, but constant reminders of the sex lives of all of his main characters.Like many other readers, I was also let down a bit by the ending. But if you can appreciate the super-secret nature of the counter-terrorist organization and if you can for just a few moments imagine the terrorists as being truly evil, then you will be better able to enjoy this book.Unlike his newer novels, Clancy remains more true and fair to politics in this novel. He does not ramble on about his views. Instead he focuses a lot more on the ideology of terrorists, which I loved reading. It's basically the way that hostage rescue teams classify terrorists and calculate what their best course of action is, and it is compelling to read just to be informed.There's really no way you can not be drawn into the action scenes in this book. This is what he excels at. The vivid descriptions of military ops and personnel will definitely be easy to visualize and follow, but be prepared for several moments in between the action where things slow down a lot. You may also be a bit confused about the constant changing of points of view. It will switch from John Clark (one of the main characters) to the terrorists to some strange people you've never read about until 200 pages into the book, and will swing around yet again. I had to go back and read several parts over again just to make sense of things that happened later on in the book. There's also a little bit of humor if you'll allow that. The Russian character in this book is as usual depicted in almost a comical fashion of clumsy cold war spies and people who will shift loyalties at a moment's notice."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read (or will ever read). The plot is gradually revealed, but not too gradually. People often criticize Tom Clancy for using too much detail, but I think that the detail is what make his books so unique. He has just the right amount to keep you going. He describes all situations well and you know exactly what he's talking about with the words he uses. Almost all types of readers can get something out of this book. There's something about the life of soldiers, terrorists, an ex-KGB agent, and a facility in Kansas. But I don't want to reveal too much. Uncovering the plot is one of the joys of reading Clancy's books. It is a bit long, but the content is definitely worth it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is one of the best ever created. Starts out fast and doesn't stop till the very last page. It takes you to the minds of both terriost and the counter ops. It has made me become very intrested in all of clancy's work and if you really like this book i would recommend Tom Clancys and Gen Carl Stiner Shadow Warriors which was just published and is about going inside special forces. Tom Clancy imagination is amazing and you will fall in love with all of his material whether you like the armed forces or not."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was not Tom Clancy's best effort, in my opinion. However, it was thoroughly enjoyable. It has typical Clancy technical detail, suspense and a realistic, &quot;could happen today&quot; scenario. Executive Orders was better, Debt of Honor had a more surprising ending. Solid Clancy -- worth every minute I spent reading it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Starting with Debt of Honor, Tom Clancy's books seem to have been getting weak. Though the idea of a future war with Japan or a united Iraq-Iran is a bit hard to swallow, the premise of Rainbow Six is virtually implausible: radical environmentalists genetically engineer doomsday virus and engage in terrorist activity! World is saved by elite international CT unit!Well, there may be some nature-loving psychos out there somewhere, but the environmentalists I know seem rather peaceful, not exactly frightening terrorist material--they don't make very menacing bad guys. The book's extreme anti-environmentalist tone is so pervasive that it distracts one from the story--as with Executive Orders (and, I've heard, the Bear and the Dragon), I got the feeling that I was not only reading a military thriller (which Clancy writes well) but also a political thesis paper (which he does not).The Counter-Terrorism element of the book is much more interesting, but it's not up to the quality of his earlier works. Its fun to see the Rainbow guys waste tangos in close-quarters battle, but doesn't quite reach the level of &quot;excitement.&quot; We know Clark and Chavez are invincible, and most of the new characters come out unscathed as well. It tends to rob the action scenes of suspense. In fact, I might have given this a 2-star, rather than 3-star, rating if it were not for a scene in which there is a duel between a terrorist and a theme-park guard suited up as a Roman legionary, complete with sword; it's the only battle scene in the book with any sort of tension. Clancy's much-lauded detail and accuracy are starting to slip as well, it seems; there are some minor errors (getting the name of the Rainbow submachine gun wrong, for instance) and one big one (in Australia, July is winter).The biggest problem, of course, is: how does he top this? He's moved from the defection of a lone submarine, cold war espionage, and the war on drugs to nuclear terrorism, major international wars, and now an attempt to destroy humanity itself. What's next? Alien invasion? His plots have been moving farther and farther from reality anyway. Hopefully he'll correct his current slump and start writing real military techno-thrillers again. It's not looking good so far, though."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm through with Tom Clancy. I've had some good times, but his latest book is so bad that I won't ever waste my time by reading another. he repeats himself endlessly. The content is negligible, the thrills minimal, the moral preaching nauseating, the politics fascist, offensive and ignorant in the extreme.As a physician I can speak to the treatment of medicine in this book. You'd think that Clancy, with all his millions, could afford at least to hire a consultant when he writes about things he knows nothing about. But no, we have a &quot;cancer virus&quot; that attacks the &quot;upper GI&quot; by invading the liver and kidney, transmitted both by respiratory droplets and sexual contact, spreading its &quot;antibodies&quot; throughout the body in 4-6 weeks (sic), not treatable with antibiotics (sic) and deliverable as an injectable &quot;vaccine&quot; to the entire third world. Excuse me? This is so stupid as to defy comparison, except perhaps to Clancy's ultra-right-wing world view in general.I am particularly repelled by his characterization of the Sierra Club, Earth First, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and (by extension) other environmental groups. Usually when you get rich and famous your mind relaxes and opens up a little. Clancy's appears to have atrophied. His blind hatred of these groups speaks eloquently of a little man in a little space, a coward afraid to face the real world.I'm sorry I read this book. Not only did it waste my time, it spoiled the other Tom Clancy novels for me. I was looking forward to rereading some of his classics, but how can I enjoy them now, For me this was the last Tom Clancy novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"You know its going to be a tough book to get through when two of the female characters introduced in the book both hate men. I guess the divorce isn't going so well, huh?The supposedly complex plot was extremely predictable... perhaps because of the one dimensional nature of the characters. The good guys are extremely good perfect people. The bad guys are evil and of course dumb because their point of view conflicts with Clancy.The technical merits of the book are suspect as well. A 100 line program that disables a cell site and happens to work in any cell site? The lifesigns finder has been debunked in every analysis I've seen.The most troubling thing about the book is that Clancy is still of the notion that the only people who want privacy on the Internet and in other telecommuncations are people who have something to hide like affairs or child pornography. Very disturbing.Starting with Cardinal of the Kremlin and after coming to a head in Executive Orders, Clancy's books have become a soapbox for his extremist, narrow opinions.On an amusing note, somebody must have bought him a Word a Day calendar or something while he was writing the book. He used the word &quot;niggardly&quot; three times in the span of few pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has gone over the edge with this book. He clearly lives in a fantasy world where all the military guys are &quot;eagle scouts&quot; and never have a selfish thought. All the bad guys are evil and there is no gray. And the good guys do no wrong. (Note the military has just paid out millions in settlement for a Marine killing a civilian in the USA during a drug interdiction action. They made a mistake. This is why the military is prevented from police action in this country.)Clancy also comes down hard on the environmental movement taking the reactionary's spin on the Unibomber to bizzare lengths. It is clear that Clancy is singing to his choir, the rabid right and those profiting from military and security funding. He further foments the terrorism fears, justifying a near complete elimination of the Bill of Rights. This kind of propoganda is pure silliness, except many will alter their world view to conform with it, and ignore the real world. Clancy's books are deeply lacking in depth: everyone is either heroic or evil and all problems get solved with technology (which is never abused) and bullets (which never make mistakes). It is sad and unfortunate that this kind of fantasy is not put where it belongs: nailed to a Texas outhouse wall.Three thumbs down, way down!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid Clancy fan, this book was a below the belt blow. Bad plot, horrible character development, nothing of great interest, leaves you short of breath and reeling in pain over the $16.95 (+ shipping) that could have been wisely spent else where.Clancy's personal beliefs come crashing like a frieght train throughout this book. The Author shows his non-concern about the environment, by wasting over 800 pages to deliver this book. The rah!rah! jingoist crowd would love this book and it's extermly far fetched plot (even for Clancy's standards) and the action sequences that are tepid and take to much space in the book. Unlike the previous books, Clancy does not manage to draw a connection between the hero(s) and the villain(s). Each appear to be operating in different planets till the so called climactic end. There are to many laughable, boring ideas in this book, least of which is the back cover pseudo-military photo of the author, to list and discuss all of them. My next Calncy purchase will be made with great hesitation and after reading a few reviews."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I will likely always be a Clancy fan based on the strength of his early work like &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;Red Storm Rising.&quot; Unfortunately, his recent work is horrible in comparison and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is no exception. I found the plot to be alternately painfully obvious and incoherent. Clancy has never been a master of character development and I find that he's at his worst when he relies heavily on established characters. John Clark and Domingo Chavez were interesting when they were introduced in Clancy's work but, by now, they are tired caricatures of themselves. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; drove me to root for the terrorists in short order. I might not consider character development (or even plot integrity) so important if Clancy would only concentrate on action sequences which is what he does best. It is a cruel fate indeed to be forced to endure over 700 pages of ham handed sanctimony in order to enjoy a small handful of action se! quences. If you enjoyed his most recent novels like &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, you will undoubtedly enjoy &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; However, if you long for Clancy's early years and find his recent work all too easy to put down, you will be as profoundly disappointed in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; as I was."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Okay, my capsule review......Piece-of-crap. &quot;Do I like Jack Clark or Ryan better? Does this one have more techno stuff in it? Is there a lot of action? Dddddddd.......you're no longer able to percieve correctly. Just take a deep breath and read the book again.....&quot;Hey, it's a piece-of-crap!&quot; I know. &quot;Hey, it doesn't share any insight into the human experience, Clancy, that hack, is just trying to get my fat dirty dollar and there's no heart in this piece-of-crap book!&quot; You're absolutly right."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When, many years ago, I read my first Clancy work (The Hunt for Red October) I was thrilled. I expected, as the author developed his writing skills, that his natural storytelling abilities would make for utterly fabulous books. For a time, this seemed to be occurring. But then Clancy's books began to get fatter while his characters became thinner. In the middle of one book I realized that every person spoke exactly the same way (why does everyone in his stories call doctors &quot;Doc&quot;?). Likewise, other than basic motivation (some are good, others are bad) the supposed people in the Clancy universe all act the same way.As a result, I stopped reading Clancy about five years ago. While not exactly personally insulted by him, I felt he didn't respect me very much. Am I dumb enough to spend $20+ per volume and the value of the time it takes to wade through 700+ pages when he can't be bothered to envision and create unique (read: real) characters to people those books? I decided there were better writers (even within Clancy's genre) and I would focus my time and money on them. Ever read Gabriel Garcia Marquez? A little light on the gadgets, but he doesn't repeat his sentences and the characters lead complex lives that motivate them to do strange and human things.Which leads me to &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; I have a sister who works for a book club. She got a copy of this book for next to nothing and gave it to me for Christmas. So I read it.Clearly Clancy hasn't lost a step when it comes to story concept, gadgets and scripting action sequences. During some passages of the book his natural gift in these areas overcomes the actuarial nature of his prose. But I kept wondering what motivated the men of that elite team (all of whom, despite their varied ethnic backgrounds talk the same way). All seemed to be just supermen, dying for the opportunity to serve king and country. They didn't seem to think about the whys of their jobs or have any emotion (other than post-conflict elation) regarding the results of the triggers they pulled. Can you really kill men, even really bad men, on a regular basis without the least bit of moral stress? But Clancy doesn't write those kind of books, I told myself. If you want self-examination, read Camus.So I fought my way through the whole book. Amazed when Clancy gave a glimpse of the skills I once thought would become as much a strength as his techno-fetish. More frequently I was dismayed at the many examples of careless writing, poor proof-reading, and discontinuity.But what put me off Clancy forever was his handling of the fate of the Rainbow team. I hope I am not giving away too much when I say that toward the end there is an ambush and several members of the team are killed. Not a single member of the force shows an iota of emotion over the loss of their comrades in arms. In fact, none of them ever mention it. They barely seem to notice despite months of living, training and nearly dying together.Maybe that is the kind of men they are, you might say. I don't know, Clancy has given us no glimpse of their psyche. But I think he gives every reader a glimpse of his own when he fails to even name the team members who die. It is apparent that these men were not characters, just cardboard cutouts to be trashed after being used for target practice. And if Clancy doesn't care about his people, why should I?Clancy has huge potential as a writer and a storyteller. He continues to squander his abilities because he earns tens of millions for the slipshod work he does now. He gets that money because people continue to buy his books. And that is probably why each book he writes reads more like an exercise in commerce than in creativity.As a footnote, I would bet the audiobook of &quot;Rainbox Six&quot; is better than the unabridged &quot;dead tree&quot; version. First of all, the script for the tape has been edited (which probably can't be said for the book manuscript) and any half-decent actor could add more personality to Clancy's characters with an accent than Clancy has attempted with his writing. With a decent director, screenwriter and cast, &quot;Rainbox Six&quot; (like most Clancy works) would easily make a better movie than book.Bottom-line: If you like Clancy or aren't discerning in your reading habits (take my mother, she'll read anything available at the used book store) &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; may suit you just fine. If you like books that make you think and feel, or are just well crafted then spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first, and surely the last, book written by Tom Clancy that I read. The book is realy predictable and boring. And even worst, it seems that we, the Europeans, are so dumb and incompetent that we need a superman called John Clark (a USA citizen of course), leading a suposed international team (essencialy a USA team), to solve our terrorism problems. I don't see the reality when an European country needs a US-controled team to solve their problems on their territory. Austria does have an elite police team, Spain also, but in this book seems that this teams are completly useless. And in the case that an EU country needs police aid, they surely would ask to the EU members, not to a US controled team. This makes the book completly ridiculous, but there are also a lot of research mistakes. One of the terrorist actions take place in Port Aventura, in Spain. The Port Aventura that Tom Clancy describes is absolutly imaginary, stupid, and realy insulting for the Europeans, including the ridiculous attraction &quot;The Stuka&quot;. Also the image of Basques is insulting, it seems that all Basques are terrorists, but Tom Clancy perhaps don't know that only a few Basques are terrorists, and this terrorists are not stupid(despicable of course, but not stupid). In the book the Basque terrorists have Spanish names, not Basque ones. And the Basque terrorists never make terrorist actions outside Spain and South of France. In resume, a total waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's books have gone steadily downhill. Hopefully, this is rock bottom. I received this book as a gift, but I have never been able to get past the first 200 pages in two attempts to read it. This is from someone who was a huge Clancy fan after his first four or five books.The problem with the book for me is that I just cannot get interested in the characters or the story line. Summary of the first 200 pages. There is a new super-duper top secret multi-national anti-terrorist outfit headed up by Mr. Clark. They effortlessly blow away a bunch of terrorists in a couple of incidents that were set up by the real bad guys to fail. Meanwhile, some other real bad guys (or perhaps the same ones) are working on a really nasty biological weapon with the goal of wiping out most of the people on the face of the planet except for themselves of course. They appear to be environmentally motivated. Bet you can fill in the rest of the story from here.Summary of character development in the first 200 pages: The bad guys are bad. The anti-terrorist unit trains really hard and worries about losing its edge.If you are new to Clancy start with Red October or Red Storm Rising. The Cold War setting is now dated, but they are riveting stories that show Clancy at his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a gagger!Clancy's 1-dimensional characters get more and more boring, and here they're in a plotline that's improbable at best. His treatment of women is condescending, to say the least (one wife, a doctor, says to her spec ops operator husband, &quot;You kill people? I'm not sure I like that...&quot;)The story, albeit interesting, goes on altogether too long. I found myself reading the last 200 pages or so just to find out what happened.The more detail Clancy goes into, the more he gets wrong. He's descending into Mack Bolan territory, it seems. It takes more than several heads &quot;exploding like a ripe melon&quot; to make a decent novel. If you're already a fan, you'll love it-- it's the same crap he's been pumping out since &quot;Sum of All Fears.&quot; If you're not a fan, grab &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; or &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;-- 2 really good ones by Clancy; before he started believing his own press releases."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy doesn't know what \\"bad guys\\" think, so he writes what good guys think bad guys think. His black and white view of the world works best when he minimizes character development and maximizes action. Unfortunately this book is loaded with the interior thoughts of his characters. Chop 200 pages off this book and it would be a passable thriller. For Clancy's next book, the most important \\"good guy\\" would be a competent editor."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have long been a Tom Clancy fan. I have read all of his books, except for the OP-Center series. Executive Orders was and is a personal favorite. Rainbow Six is a disappointment. There is a formula feel to the book along with a manipulation of the reader to Clancy's political point of view. It is all quite obvious. The characters lack depth. The plot is contrived. Finally, at a time when we could do with some reasoned discussion of serious environmental issues, couldn't Tom have found other villians than &quot;tree huggers&quot; bent on killing off the human population to save the planet? Instead, Mr. Clancy has chosen to polarize the debate in a poorly written book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Poor Tom Clancy. The Evil Empire is no more, and he has to go looking for villains elsewhere. First Japan, then Iran, with plots becoming less and less believable. And now something that reeks of James Bond's standard &quot;saving the earth from the evil madmen&quot; scenario. I have read, re-read, and re-re-read pretty much all of Clancy's work, I own it all, and I dearly love most of it, but it's going seriously downhill. I will continue to buy his books, I guess, because I like the characters (even though I did miss Ryan in this one) and I like his writing style. I guess I'm a sucker for really thick bricks when it comes to books. But this one was the least enjoyable so far."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I would consider Tom Clancy one of my favorite authors and will probably buy his next book, I was pretty disappointed in Rainbow Six. I've heard that it is tying in to a computer game with the same name, and I'll be darned if it didn't unfold just like some adventure game. You have your &quot;easy&quot; levels (i.e., the bank, the mansion), &quot;medium&quot; levels (the amusement park, the hospital), and &quot;hard&quot; levels (the Olympics, the Project in Brazil and the mother of 'em all, Project Kansas!). I've loved all of his previous books, and consider myself an unabashed Tom Clancy fan, but the shallowness of this one left me somewhat disappointed. Still a page-turner, but not Clancy at his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you can believe that super intellectual Earth Firster's can be bested by even more intellectual military ranger's....this book is for you.Poor character development, ridiculous plot, and paid by the ounce writing style.Do yourself a favor. Forget this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy used to be my favorite writer. However, from now on I will be more careful before I by his books. This book is not that different from Executive Orders....though not as well written. The characters don't seem real, and the plot doesn't sound all the real either. Eco-terrorism is probably a problem of the future. But this book will not be the blue print of some dastardly plan. The Rainbow anti-terrorist story isn't all the believable either. Chavez and Clark need to go back to the world of spooks. It was totally un-necessary to leave Jack Ryan out of the story. Actually the book may have been better with Ryan providing direction. It's obvious Clancy is too distracted these days. Now that he's washed his hands with the NFL, and as soon as he puts whatever type of closure to his marital problems, he should be able to bring us the caliber of story we have all come to expect over the years. The fact that this book has managed to reach number one on the best-seller list is a true testament to the loyalty of Clancy's fans. Let's hope his next book justifies this type of devotion."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like his other Clark book, _Without Remorse_, _Rainbow Six_ falls short of the high standards Clancy set with his Jack Ryan novels. _Executive Orders_ kept me up night after night with its 900 pages, small type and tiny margins. But with _Rainbow Six_, I felt rushed along through the plot. The detailed subplots and technical minutiae which characterize Clancy's best stuff are in shorter supply than I had hoped.As usual, characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts -- fine for Clancy's usual shoot-'em-up fare, but less satisfactory when he tries (as in _Without Remorse_) to handle complex moral issues. I still think Cardinal is the only one of Clancy's characters which might be accepted into the cast of a John Le Carre novel.However, the saying still holds: when Clancy's good, he's superb; when he's bad, he's still pretty darn good. The ending saved this one from 3 stars -- as elegant as anything involving that much destruction could be."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It seems that the demise of Russia as a superpower has left Clancy, with little grist for his mill. Rainbow Six simply does not live up to his previous novels. I certainly don't mind a long book but this is more like a collection of short stories. By the time you get to the main point of the book it is 85% over. It also seems as though the bad guys have become a little to black-and-white evil leaving for some slim characterizations. Perhaps the days of large scale conflicts are behind us and terrorism will be the 'new' modus operandi but this book just doesn't sell it very well."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six, while definitely being easier to read than some of Clancy's more recent works, is more boring and predictable than just about any of his other works. Plus it seems that he is running out of things to right about with the plot being one of the most hokey of all. I don't want to give anything away but I surely find it hard to believe that so many people would agree to mass murder on such a scale. Every revolutionary movement has leaks and informers and people who lose interest in the goal so I find it rather unlikely that such a plot would remain a secret for so long. Come on Tom. I loved your earlier stuff. Plus most of the book deals with the uninteresting trials and tribulations of the counterterrorist group that is headed by clark. It would have been so much more interesting had clark been directly involved in their exploits and not just the new admiral greer type character. One of the main problems is probably that Clancy's two main characters, Ryan and Clark are now so high up the food chain that clancy has written himself into a box. He should definitely start new characters and make them the focus. Im not such a big fan of ding."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A couple of satirical twists right at the very end. If you are into Clancy, you won't be disappointed. Warning - not recommended for tree-huggers!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm new to the Tom Clancy scene, but after picking up and reading Rainbow Six, I know I'll be looking around for more of his works.I thought nearly every aspect of this book was well written and entertaining. His style of writing makes even the lacking parts as entertaining as the gunfights. His brilliant use of imagery in the action sequences really brought up the standard of what I'm looking for in a action novel.As soon as you pick up the book, and read the first few pages, you're hooked. I didn't think it was possible to interest me in a book that quickly, but Clancy seemed to make it easy. After the prologue in which Clark, Chavez and Stanley apprehend the 3 hijackers, I knew the rest of the novel wasn't going to let me down. And, sure enough, it didn't.The rest of the book was full of suspense that kept my eyes glued to the pages long after the sun had set. From the bank robbery in Bern, to the hostage situation at Worldpark, I was entranced at the plot and never put the book down.This book will appeal to many differant types of people, except &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, who will have a few bad things to say about their protrayal in this book.In the end, this book never let down and made me a Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If your looking for a good book to read Rainbow six is it! Rainbow six has pleanty of action it with a great plot. I think this book will entertain you a lot if your into Tom Clancy's type of stories. I liked the book a lot because this book isnt boring as some of his other books. Sometimes Tom Clancy will go on and on with some people's thoughts but thats about the only bad part. Tom Clancy made a book that makes perfect sence for a possible futer terrorist attack. If you dont like Jack Ryan thats ok because he's hardly ever mentioned in this book. I can give you what the book is about but I dont want to give the story away either. This book is about a bunch of genuis terrorist trying to kill all humans on earth. These terrorist try to do it with an KGB. They make a bunch of terrorist attacks in Europe so the Rainbow team will focus mainly on those kind of attacks for the olympics in Sydney. Rainbow is like the SAS but they fight agains terrorism. There base is in England. Anyways when the Olympics arrive the terrorist try to kill the people by puting a deadly chemical called Shivia in a mist system to help cool off the people in the Olympic stadium. Of course you know the bad guys wont win but how they get caught is awesome.

His books have always dripped of his political and ideological biases, but this book was quite unrefined amonst its siblings.I agree with another reviewer; the book does feel very James Bondish, but that is not a good thing IMHO. 007 is an exercise in absurdity, while Tom Clacy's works has historical been masterpieces of research and detail.Mr. Clancy already touched on idea of chemical/biological terrorism in \\"Executive Orders\\" which was a far better story, in addition to being a much better political vehicle. The characters in RB6 are very shallow and their commitment to their ideals far too blind to suit their (supposed) intellect. Furthermore, the coincidences, which all Clancy novels tend have, were far tackier than usual.I guessed the whole ending by about the halfway mark, skimmed the rest, and felt the hours were a waste of my time. I recommend reading older Clancy's -- for example Sum of All Fears -- instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was very interesting to read.

This kind of sloppy work has not been part of a Clancy novel in the past. If I had to guess I would say that the people who usually read his books before publishing did not do it this time. This looks like hot off the press without editing. Not a good move. I have read, and reread every previous Clancy novel in hardback.

With many unexpected plot twists and a very original story, I am sure this book will be a #1 top-seller. Rainbow Six has lots of action throughout the book and it starts out early on, getting you hooked before you even know anything about the story at all. And all the battle scenes are so well described I had a very clear picture in my mind what was happening. So I recommend this book, definently worth the money.DarkStrife"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am only 200 pages into it but TC has made another book I can't put down!! I have to say that I only give it 4 stars so far because I so far have not seen anything of Jack Ryan and even though he is not a major character They won't even say his name and only small references to \\"The President\\". I am only 200 pages into it though so maybe I will see a Cameo by Jack Ryan but so far that is the only complaint I have."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While this is not a poorly written book it has perhaps the most ridiculous plot of any of his books. I don't want to give away the story but suffice to say that I have seen this in several James Bond movies. The anti-terrorist scenes are well written (although I could do without the repeated descriptions of what a 50 cal bullet does to the human head) and keep the reader interested. All in all I am waiting for the computer game, which is what much of the book is written like. This is much better than those Op-Center books and Politika at least."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is amazing how Clancy continues to get by on the reputation of &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;, (his only really &quot;good&quot; book.) Rainbox Six is just another inarticulate, long, snooze.

About one third of the way through the whole idea became absurd. I felt like tossing it but stuck with it hoping the plots would come together but it never happened. I am usually sorry to see Clancy's novels end. When I finished this Rainbow Six I sighed with relief and wondered why I had finished it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancey's latest is an engaging read. It pushes all the right buttons and you find yourself cheering the heros and hissing the villains. Yet, in many ways it is a disappointment when compared to his earlier works.Since Clancy has made enough money to be a convinced Republican, his views are reflected in the plot. The villains are plausible eco-terrorists, and the heros, conservative tough guys willing to bend the rules for a higher cause. Tho a Liberal Democrat, I have no problems with the assignment of hero/villain roles, I've met wacko eco-freaks, but the real world is not so black and white. This would have been a better book had Clancy pointed this out.This is a formula book. It is well crafted, but ultimately in the same league as the Doc Savage series. Clancy's commercial interests are apparent in the brand name plugs scattered thruout the work. Product placement is old hat in the movies. Now it seems to be invading the literary scene.Jerome A. Schroeder Seattle, WA"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'd say this is a jolly ripping read. I was frightfully caught up in it. To some reviewers below who bemoan the right wing attitude in the book: The vast majority of writers of all stripes are left wing. So when a right winger gains an audience, I don't think one should knock him for using it to his advantage. So indulge the old chap, because Clancy more than fulfills his part of the page-turning bargain; it's the best page turning read since Michael Crichton's AIRFRAME and Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE, and RAINBOW SIX has quite a bit of facts of the world in it, so one learns while being entertained. I am curious, since Willem Defoe played John Clark in the movie version of &quot;Clear and Present Danger,&quot; will he play Clark should a movie be made of RAINBOW SIX (or NO REMORSE, for that matter, another one where he was the lead character rather than Jack Ryan)? I hope so. Any movie producers reading this, cast Defoe as Clark again. He was great in C.A.P.D."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although everyone at the alt.books.tom-clancy newsgroup seems to be tearing the book apart in their evaluations.....

Yes.Just don't take the book too seriously."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Just finished it. I couldn't put it down! I found the ending very satisfying."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is one of Clancy's finest, most exciting stories. It's the culmination of his previous writings, bringing together and referencing past elements and characters from stories such as The Cardinal of the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears and Without Remorse. This journey takes hero John Clark (John Kelly) and his comrades of counter-terrorist team Rainbow Six, formed by NATO, across the globe in a series of connected events leading to perhaps the greatest of Clancy's threats ever envisioned. It makes for a fantastic novel-- several sub-plots come together and are fully decrypted in all their mysterious motives-- however, with such great expanse of material to cover and a wide menagerie of characters to explore, some of R6's focus and depth is lost in its own complexity.Plot is the name of the game in R6. This is where the story succeeds most, and the reason why I can call the novel a page-turner. Not one moment of the story was I not making connections, asking questions, and wondering what was going to be the ramification of each event or a character's actions. If you've read any of Clancy's novels, you know that he crafts ingeniously realistic scenarios and characters. This is a characteristic of R6. R6 presents many diverse people and asks many questions of life, but doesn't step back enough to further analyze each character, and doesn't provide enough perspective and opinion on some of the many moral topics brought up. Though Clancy doesn't directly answer questions to themes he brought up, one is able to see his personal views on scenarios, morals and beliefs through the guiding voice he puts in his main characters. John Clark, Ding Chavez, Patsy Chavez, Sandy Clark, and Popov/Dmitriy Arkadeyevich are well rounded, dynamic players in the story. As for the many side characters of several organizations with separate and sometimes clashing ideas and motives, they seem somewhat stereotypical, predictable in action, and shallow in belief. For a story on the verge of 900 pages, Clancy definitely devoted many sections to build up the characters of most importance, but it would have been complementary of him to go further with more of the side characters, since there are so many to keep track of and follow.Aside from its smaller flaws, R6 is a wild roller-coaster of a read; it would be unwise for readers not to pick up a copy. Clancy developed a gripping, action-packed thriller that hasn't been matched by many other authors, and is one of his most exciting entries yet. It's quite the steal at $9.00, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone up for an engrossing story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This novel was a good reference for Jack Ryan Story characters and related actions referenced in other novels. I had not read this novel prior to Executive Order and Locked On. Because of references to the Rainbow Six group I read this novel. It had the typical Clancy writing but not as good as his other novels. The begining with the terrorists on the airplane seemed a bit forced to introduce action. It was unnecessary."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good read, but very frustrating how the 2 parts to the story are just so far apart throughout the book. It's not uncommon to have multiple themes running through a book, but these two in this book were so wildly different and diverse that it was really hard to see how they could ever come together, and therefore difficult to really want to see how they did.The individual action sequences were very well described, and very exciting to read, but I have to say that having waited so long for the themes to come together for the climax I was a little disappointed.It's got some really excellent stuff in it, and I'm glad I have read it and did enjoy it in the main, but not a book I am likely to pick up again, and I'm not sure I would really want to recommend it to someone else"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"GREAT ORDER PROCESSING AND DELIVERY.

This book tied in somehings that had me wondering about in his later novels. It is well paced with attention to characters classic of Tom Clancy. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.A great read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is proof against those who argued that entertainment can only be found in the eletronic transmission. The pen is being said to have been mightier than the sword. Let me add to this dictum a little further; nothing can be afoot without outlining everything first on paper. The delight for being entertained by a book is different from the thrilling of a movie or video game. Rainbow Six has been criticised as a typical Tom Clancy book that English professors would scoff at. I beg to differ as the key to good writing is not about the coining of brilliant proverbs; Mr. Clancy was not trying to make his Rainbow troopers gun-totting poets. It takes skillful weaving to stitch together a complicated plot and still hang on solidly as one piece as a whole. Mr. Clancy certainly has a flawless gift in the interaction of his characters. It is not easy to sound natural and genuine in a profession that you are not affiliated with. In short, to sound military when you are in actuality a civilian, it certainly is challenging to come off ordinary. The author has triumphed in this. One can watch a movie and be mesmerized by its cinematic beauty, or play a video game and be ecstatic about its brilliant graphics and intensed gameplay. But all being said, reading is simply enthralling. There is absolutely no substitute, in whatever medium, for a good book. Earlier this year I had the pleasure of giving a Chuck Pfarrer book to a video game addict. He was blown away by this gift, hard cover quality and all, and gobbled up a few chapters within a night. By the time he finished reading it, he hungered for more the literature of this genre. He saw a copy of my Rainbow Six and begged for it. I refused and said that it is my bible. This novel is truly canon to its successful franchise."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For Clancy,,, the only problem is the verbage in the first third of the book gets in the way of what should be an exciting story. Names are introduced in quantity, and the action takes a backseat to unexciting background. A great writer, but down the list from some of his other writings. Like he squeezed a 400 page book into 800 pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As per usual Tom Clancy does not let you down. He grabs your interest and propels you right into the action. Once the reader starts to read you can not put down the book. Prepare to be transported into a world of unknown adventure and pure adrenalin rush. Reading right through the night and forgetting to stop for breakfast is the norm when I read a Tom Clancy book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If u only like books that are plausible, don 't read this book.

It's a welcome change from being knee deep in espionage to talking small team tactics. Highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Though a bit long winded, the book was still enjoyable throughout. I never found myself wishing that it would end, in fact I'm unhappy now that it has. Clancy proves with this book that he is one of the best story tellers of our time. He used his usual form of many seemingly unconnected twists that in the end all came together and made perfect sense. That is why all 900 pages were fun to read. As for the plot, it was the BEST I've read this year."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, the master has produced a simply awesome book. You can't read it fast enough, it keeps you wanting to know what happens next. A &quot;can't put down&quot; book that is full of suspense, thrill, action, you name it, it's here.

The story concept is interesting, but horrendously and repetitively told--editors must be in short supply these days. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is not up to the standards of previous Tom Clancy novels. The technical research is not nearly up to the standard of Hunt for Red October and his other novels. In addition there are several references that suggest that not only is gun control good, but illeagal activity by government agencies is necessary and acceptable. The end of the book glorifies a government agency violating the territory of another nation, and murdering United States citizens. Considering what our government has done on its own the past few years I do not enjoy reading books that claim the end justifies the means. I had come to expect more from Clancy's books, but do not intend to waste my money on another one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Will whoever kidnapped Tom Clancy please return him! Some mediocre hack with trite, cartoonish political views has stolen and replaced one of my favorite authors. Where are the intricately crafted and interesting subplots, the believable villains, the heroes who, far from perfect, have the conviction and inner strength to carry the day? Where is the wealth of meticulous research and studied, balanced points of view that, while leaving no doubt that there are situations the require extraordinary acts of violence to counter the evils of modern times, so graphically show that there is a cost to this violence, deep moral searching that precedes its use, checks and balances to its exercise that keep it a tool of last resort, and, most of all, heroes who understand that its exercise is best used when used rarely? Replaced, by a world where the most passing thought that some vague concern for the environment is a clear sign of moral decay and an unmistakable indicator of one's suitability to be recruited to mass with high tech ebola virus (I'm sure our friends in Duck's Unlimited and the Audubon Society will find this to be confusing news). Replaced, by action sequences which would bore the average Saturday morning cartoon audience, much less the thoughtful and intelligent readers drawn to &quot;Rainbow 6&quot; by the high quality of Clancy's previous work ( 1: Bad guys take hostages, 2: Good guys arrive and talk about what nasty critters the bad guys are, 3: Good guys use technology and superior firepower to burst in and kill all the nasty bad guys, somehow managing to avoid any hostage suffering so much as a hangnail --dispite the fact that the these are ostensibly the worlds elite terrorist operatives, 4: A grateful (whatever) bestows its thanks on the victors, who humbly note that one or two of the million bullets they shot actually missed a bad guy's head, 5: repeat until the reader is bored to tears, in my case, about 300 pages). I understand that all glory is a fleeting thing and certainly the resounding mediocrity of the Tom Clancy Brand Net Force and Ops Center novels should have been fair warning of low quality to come. I guess I still retained enough respect for the man and his previous work that I expected better of a book he ostensibly authored himself. I will not make that mistake in the future."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I can take a lot of faults in Clancy _ wooden dialogue, stick-figure heroes like Jack Ryan _ even when I can't tolerate his politics (Has there ever been a drunk, a racist or a psycopath in the U.S. military?) But this one's too much. complete with Rush Limbaugh fantasy villains _ murderous environmentalists. Worse, IT'S BORING. The only reason I've read Clancy is for a quick, interesting read and a little information. But this kept putting me to sleep. Keep trying, Tom, you hit on a few _ you even made John Clark into a real person once. In this one, he's as simple-minded as Jack Ryan and he only puts in a cameo appearance anyway."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'd recommend this book to a recycling center, but I'd probably have to pay them to take it. The whole plotline of this book is based on a terrorist act using the public outdoor cooling system for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Did anyone forget that the summer games in 2000 are going to be held in WHAT IS WINTER FOR THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE? There goes the whole plot, eh? The characters are bland and all use the same fake Clancy LA slang &quot;y'know&quot; that is then passed off, in a sweet racist tone, as 'the pre-educated language of'. This is a novel that, in my not-so-humble opinion, got rejected before Clancy was big and has been repackaged with the characters we are familiar with (J. Ryan, Clark, etc...) and is being passed off as 'new'. Do yourself a big favor if you want to stay a Clancy fan: Don't read this pile of refuse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although the action sequences ripped along, there was little in between to latch onto. Rainbow Six lacked the scope and grand feeling that usually characterizes his books. But then again, he was probably aiming more towards interpersonal conflicts, rather than trying to bring together a hugely complex plot. Also, this book was wrongly positioned as a John Clark piece. The focus was much more on Chavez, and his rise as a capable leader. He lacks the savvy and dark persona, though, of a Ryan or Clark, so I hope that Chavez isn't the future of Clancy's books. I'd also suggest to wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Now and then, a good writer writes a bad book. This is one such. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is Clancy's second book about John Clark, an unromantic CIA agent with a license to kill. His first, &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, built the character of Clark, and was perhaps Clancy's best writing. &quot;Without Remorse&quot; wasn't a techno-thriller, but more of a classic character novel. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is more a classic Clancy gadget story, but unlike his Jack Ryan novels, this time he can't pull the threads of unlikely events together into a believable whole. The book revolves around a succession of terrorist plots executed for no visible reason, and when the reason finally becomes clear, it doesn't make sense, especially since the bad guys aren't portrayed as dumb.I wonder if Clancy even wrote this turkey. It reads more like the &quot;Op-Center&quot; books, on which he puts his name but doesn't write."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read nearly every Clancy novel. Over the years I've detected a gradual diminishment in the quality of plot, character depth, subplot integration, and richness in wording when comparing his first series of works to this. It's quite possible to skip entire sections in the book-and I did through sheer boredom-yet stay connected with the main plot. I'm disappointed with how unidimensional the novel is with its sophomoric approach to both &quot;global/environmental&quot; terrorism and special operations units and tactics. A 300 page novel crammed into 700 pages. Too bad, Tom, you could have done much better....you did before."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's recent novels have been much too wordy. Nearly all would have been improved by being a few hundred pages shorter. Someone must have gotten the message to Clancy (or he figured it out himself), because this book is just a little over 700 pages -- brief by recent Clancy standards. And the novel's pacing and general tone do benefit from this brevity. That's the good news.The bad news is that there's not much here that's new. The central characters are people we know well from previous novels (John Clark and Domingo Chavez), and we don't learn anything new about them here. The sides of their personalities that we see are those we already know well. Familiar and comfortable, yes; revealing or enlightening, no.The plot elements are mostly recycled, too. The main threat to Life As We Know It is the Ebola virus that was used in Executive Orders. It's been beefed up in a bio-lab to make it easier to spread, but it's not really new. There is also a personal vengeance subplot involving Clark that is similar to the one in Without Remorse, with a similar resolution -- Clark takes the law into his own hands in a mildly creative way. There's more, but nearly all of it fits the pattern: Clancy is reworking materials he's already used.Another problem with this novel is that the character development of the primary villains is unusually weak, which takes much of the starch out of the good-vs.-evil struggle. These people -- based on the little we learn of them -- are very shallow, even by the normal standards of the Clancy actiontechnothriller genre. Their motivations have minimal credibility, because we just don't know them well enough to find the outlandish things they do very believable.So, bottom line, this is a pleasant and diverting read but does not engage and satisfy the way the earlier novels do. It's vintage Clancy, but not very original within its genre. All of Clancy's novels make for enjoyable reading, but if you have to skip one, this is the one you'll miss the least."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Has the timing of the &quot;Summer&quot; Olympics moved to January? Only that way could the outdoor temperatures in SE Australia be in the 90s.It read like several separate novellas, strung together. Poor continuity.

We get to see the action that Clark and Chavez do so well--rescuing innocent people and taking out the bad guys--alive when necesary. Dr. Bellows and the British staff are great addtions to the cast of characters. My only beef--no Jack and Cathy Ryan. Maybe next time?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an amateur novelist, I look to seasoned writers as examples for my own aspiring work. However, it seems that many of the writers I have come to admire, have fallen short of their former expertise. ROBERT LUDLUM is one example. In this instance, it is Tom Clancy. What in the world was he thinking about when he wrote this book? Another payday from the studios? While the story itself could have been interesting, it was crippled by shallow characters, villainous conspiracies that lacked believability, and Tom Clancy's enduring curse, TOO MANY SUBPLOTS. Why is Tom Clancy so hell-bent on writing long drawn out stories? I think he should go back to some of his earlier works. Tom Clancy needs to go home, and find his origins."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a reader of Mr.Clacy I love how complex and realistic his plots are but something about Rainbow Six doesn't feel like his older work. The plot line however good seems more like a Science Fiction then tech-no. Another problem with the book is that it is too long(740. I mean the book at some part just dragged. I really didn't like the sub plot with the Jackel.The action that takes place during the book are absolutly fantastic and breath taking. The amusment park raid was the best.In conclusions the book is good but just not classic Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This Tom Clancey book is about John Clark and Ding (from Clear and Present Danger) setting up an new international task force. Concerned mainly with anti-terrorism. Various scenarios ensue, building up their image of competence, and gradually introducing the main plot elements. It starts pretty well, but the last 200-odd pages, out of 897 in my softback, start to drag and annoy. I am not sure if he decided he had to wrap things up, or got sick etc, but the effort just doesn't seem the same.I like Clancey, really I do. But Rainbow Six suffers in too many departments. I can accept the plot, it might be _possible_ for a private corp to develop a virus secretly. I can accept the formation of a NATO anti-terrorist group. But what really bugs me is the way the &quot;bad-guys&quot;, who are obviously smart from their setup plans, loose their brains once the ball gets rolling.Other people have mentioned inconsistencies, Clancey's right-wing views, and technical faults. This I can accept, but not the unreasonable reasoning of supposedly smart characters.Buy the computer game instead, it's a little old now, but is a brutal and more entertaining education on anti-terrorist units."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While reading the book I noticed technical errors, unlike Red October.

A good author prints a couple of really good books and for whatever reason ends up regurgitating poor books with little plot but guaranteed to generate revenue at a phenomenal rate. This book had very little of substance in it. The plot was weak and predictable and the writing marginal. With this book I will have to add Tom Clancy to the list which includes Steven King and John Grisham of authors that generated a few great books and now can't seem to write anything worth reading.Truly a shame"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well, after the 866 reviews, there are other things to say.

Here's a uestion to all you readers: Has mister clancy ever been shot at before? Better yet has he ever shot at any one before? With real bullets? Well boys and girls if he has, he's badder than rambo. If he has not he's a wanna be meat head. Having seen things in real life like the counter terror crap depicted in the book we can honestly say it is not all that &quot;hurrah lets go kill some bad guys master cheif shit.&quot; it is about human life and someone's remains on a concrete wall, not a pretty thing. It smells bad, it's messy and it is hard to forget about. Little bits of teeth brains, you name it all that was once a living thinking human being who happened to be in the way of &quot;state policy.&quot; Where I grew up, people disapeared all the time and demonstrators were killed on a regular basis. Ever seen a body after something like that? Clancy makes it sound it's WWF followed by a Dorito's comercial and monday night football. &quot;With a handy dandy squeeze of the trigger of his berretta...&quot;- NOTICE a Berretta. For all you who didn't know, these pistols suck, the slides break all the time and they jam, but here we go with a classic Clancy sell out- he was paid by the beretta corporation to market their 45 acp pistols. (like Marcinko and HK in his books)It's sad how clancy uses Berretas for his macho meat head ultra badass I eat cornflakes out of your skull frosted with government grade PCP GIJoes on crack charecters) &quot;The FBI guy splattered his brains out maaaan like it was so cool master cheif&quot; -pathetic. If he ever saw something like that for REAL he'd be horrified.

I bought this book after the 9/11 incident, so I felt a little strange reading it (deja vu?), especially since the first scene starts out aboard an airliner which, unfortunately for the bad guys, John Clark was on board.In this book, John Clark's wife and daughter are involved in the story and their characters are somewhat developed - calm, successful career women who also took care of the family. Being a female reader (I don't know how many of his readers are, but none of my female friends read his books), that's a plus, just keep it a little more interesting. John's character is very likeable and endearing, especially right now in our (at least my) need for strong heros. I also celebrated because they were, in general, successful with their fight against the terrorists - a good overcoming evil incident every couple of hundred pages - which kept me going.I was anticipating something bigger to happen when the bad guy was going to use the chemical agent in the fogging system, but I remember thinking, &quot;That was it? It was too easy!&quot; Also, the ending was sort of abrupt. I wasn't sure EXACTLY what happened to the bad guys in the end, so I feel like I'm left in suspense."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Over the years I have read numerous Clancy books, and I must say that I have enjoyed almost all of them, yet I have noticed that the quality has gone down-hill since Red October. So, when Rainbow Six came out, I decided to borrow it from the library rather than buy it. This proved to be a wise decision.Firstly, the plot is utterly implauseable and could have been thought up by a ten year-old child, consisting as it does of back-to-back action sequences connected by a thin and highly improbable thread. Secondly, the characters lack any individuality, all sounding the same and falling into predictable cliches according to their nationality. No wonder so many people have been insulted. In my case, I was particularly annoyed by the portrayal of the IRA (or perhaps a break-away faction of the IRA, we are never told which organisation the terrorists actually belong to.) All the Irish characters are mere stereotypes, little more than Leapreachauns with AK-47s.Furthermore, the author seems to have little grasp of the political reality of present-day Europe. Does he actually belive that Germany, or especially France, would agree to the setting up of a US-led swat-team and allow them free reign throughout Europe. Does he think that Austria, Switzerland and Spain (which has far more experience in dealing with terrorism than the US) would immediately come running to the USA for help when faced with a domestic terrorist incident. Dream on Tom, remember, you're writing thrillers, not fantasy.My advice is - don't buy this book, spend your money on a novel written by somebody who has bothered to do his research and hired a competent editor."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Now, we all know that Tom's not the greatest at building three-dimensional people for his novels. In the past, I would have answered that criticism with a cheery &quot;Who cares?&quot; In &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot;, the protagonists weren't exactly what I'd call fleshed out, but who gave a hoot? The suspense and plot twists just kept on coming, and I'll take a solid plot over elegant characters any day if I'm in the market for a thriller.Alas, the suspense I've come to enjoy never surfaces in Rainbow Six. The climax of the book - a guy gets busted in a utility access closet? But even after ending the story, Tom can't muster the decency to euthanize the project. Instead, he just dribbles on for another hundred-odd pages so the evil environmentalists can get their comeuppance.Which brings me to my second beef with the book. Let's see, if you are concerned with complex environmental problems, you are . . . an environmentalist? No! You are a homicidal maniac with ambitions that would make Stalin blush.This is especially ironic given Clancy's wealth of military knowledge. Two recent military interventions (Haiti and Somalia) were responses to social collapse in those countries. The cause of social collapse? Environmental problems - deforestation, topsoil loss and crop failure in Haiti, droughts, floods and crop failure in Somalia. Throughout the book, Clancy maintains his anti-green rant in a tone which suggests Rush Limbaugh with a toothache; unlike Rush, though, he's not even funny.Ah yes, almost forgot - characters. Women (provided they're gestating) are saints straight out of Dickens; otherwise they're bitchy zealots; ze German Kommando ist big und muscular, and the whole cast is just wooden enough for employment on the nearest chessboard. In short, an eminently forgettable entry, contrived, shrill and unforgivably dull. If you want the real thing from authors who can write (or at least plot), try John LeCarre or Fredrick Forsyth."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a big fan of Tom Clancy's earlier work. But as Jon's review noted: much of this book must have been written by someone else, and written poorly. Tom Clancy is the acknowledged master of military detail. How could he refer to Clark's legendary Vietnam-era unit (SOG) by the wrong name (\\"Special Operations Group\\")? Any armchair special ops fan knows the correct name (\\"Studies and Observations Group\\"). Likewise, the book wrongly refers to the MH-6/AH-6 helicopter as \\"the Nightstalker.\\" In fact, \\"Night Stalkers\\" is the nickname for the pilots and crew of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (motto: \\"Night Stalkers Don't Quit\\") portrayed so vividly in \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" The MH-6/AH-6 chopper is known as the \\"Little Bird.\\" I think Tom Clancy knows these details -- it's too bad he didn't read the book that was published under his name.The book also was never read by a copy editor. Bits of dialogue between the same characters are repeated verbatim just a few paragraphs apart. Popov states that Sean Grady is \\"quite ruthless,\\" and Henricksen agrees. On the next page, Henricksen asks Popov if Grady \\"has a reputation for ruthlessness.\\" Short term memory loss? These simple, silly errors recurred too often to list. Either Clancy's editors are too cowed to correct simple errors in his work, or he really is paid by the word (and refuses to cut obvious repetition in order to pad his word count).Even if the reader is able to suspend disbelief and swallow the major premise, there are obvious holes in the bad guys' plot. How did a fanatical tree-hugger become the CEO of a major corporation (or a Presidential advisor) without ever revealing at least some of his/her wacko beliefs? Doesn't ring true. How did the Project bring in at least 50 conspirators, without a single leak or compromise of security? Efforts to maintain secrecy could have been an interesting part of the tale, but the issue is never mentioned. Finally, after the Project was kept in secrecy for years, why was Popov sent to wander around the facilities unsupervised? Makes no sense.It should be clear to Clancy fans that this book was commissioned as a set-up for the computer game of the same name. I've heard the game is pretty good. It's too bad the book is such a shoddy piece of work. I'm going to try out the game myself -- all the shooting might help me work out some frustration from wasting my time reading Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I get a bit of a chuckle seeing the previous reviews that claim Rainbow Six as Tom Clancy's best novel ever. In fact, he has never equalled his first novel, The Hunt for Red October, although Patriot Games and Cardinal of the Kremlin were quite good.To summarize briefly, Rainbow Six is Clancy's ninth novel in what I call the Ryanverse. Jack Ryan is not a character in this novel, although he is alluded to. The plot centers around longtime CIA agent John Clark, the hero of Without Remorse and a major character in other novels. In this novel, Clark becomes the head of Rainbow, an elite, multinational antiterrorist unit. A group of radical environmentalists plot to unleash a deadly virus and kill off all human life, and the Rainbow team must uncover their plan and stop them. There are lots of set-piece action scenes along the way.Rainbow Six represents an improvement over Clancy's last novel, Executive Orders, in a couple of respects. First, Jack Ryan is offstage. Ryan's possibilities as a plausible character were pretty much exhausted by the end of The Sum of All Fears, and since then the Ryan novels have become less and less believable. Second, the plot is more focused around a single story, rather than the multiple plot-lines of the last novel. Unfortunately, these plusses are more than offset by several serious weaknesses.The strength of Clancy's best novels was in their combination of seat-clutching suspense and technical realism (or at least the apearance thereof). In Rainbow Six, however, there are signs that Clancy's techincal mastery is slipping. His unawareness that the seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere is laughable, and other reviewers here have noted several technical details that Clancy gets wrong.Rainbow Six also displays many of the other weaknesses that have increasingly plagued the Ryan novels. Once again, we get a tiresome dose of Clancy's right-wing political views. In this book we she what he thinks of environmentalists--to a man, they are portrayed as wackos who subscribe to views that sound like a wild caricature of the deep ecology movement. Clancy simply has no idea of what real environmentalists believe or of the diversity of beliefs across the environmental movement.We also see Clancy's continuing tendency to recycle plot elements from previous novels. The bioterrorism plot in Rainbow Six is just a rehash of the almost identical caper from Executive Orders. We also get at least the fourth rehash of the &quot;terrorist threat to loved ones of the heroes&quot; scenario. When Clancy first used this storyline, in Patriot Games, it made sense within the development of the story. Now it's just a way to slip another action scene in.In short, Rainbow Six is for diehard Clancy fans only."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy continues to come up with topics that are not the &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot;. He has set such high expectations for his work that I expect a masterpiece everytime. This book comes off as close to his other strong books. I would recommend this to any other Clancy Fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is the most action packed and exciting book Clancy has ever written. When I read Clear and Present Danger I didn't think Clancy could possibly write a book that good again, but he came extremely close with Rainbow Six. What makes Rainbow so great. First, it contain some of the greatest action sequences of the entire series. Second, we see John Clark enter a new role as an administrator and we see how he struggles with the change. Also, with this book coming so soon after Without Remorse we are startled and intrigued with the contrast between the young and old Clark. Third, we get to see Ding Chavez come into his own as a leader. Fourth, we are introduced to a group of new and intriging characters. Last, but not least, we are treated to one of the finest storylines Clancy has ever written."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was the first book of its genre that I have read. In fact, the book had been sitting on the shelf for nearly eight months before I even touched it (which I did only at a moment of great boredom). However, after getting to page 300 or so, I devoured the rest in 2 days! The complex plot branches off in amazing, mostly unforeseen ways, and Tom Clancy spares no details - Graphic or otherwise - and that is guaranteed to make this book as close to a roller-coaster as a book can get... The closest thing to a flaw I could point at is Clancy's stereotypical characterisation - All characters are stereotyped - The &quot;All-American G.I. Joe&quot;, the sly, conniving Russian spy, the German &quot;Arnold Schwartzenegger&quot; ironman soldier, etc. However, rather than look at this as a flaw, I found it rather amusing - It gives the plot a slight comical aspect. All in all - A good read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't know how this book got an average og 3 stars. It deserves 5. None less. If you only like Clancy books with Ryan in it, this isn't a book for you. Out in Great Britain they made a camp for Rainbow, an ant-terrorist group. This book has Clark (leader of Rainbow) and Chavez mainly. There are also many other people on the team, including Oso Vega (the biggest weight lifter). If you don't like this book, you don't have taste. I'm sorry. Nothing beats pure realism with explosive non-stop action. It also has an awesome plot. This book should have 5 stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another good book from Tom Clancy, but unlike his other books the ending left me wanting more. At almost 900 pages I tore through the book then put it down and asked, &quot;is this it... it was to easy.&quot; I was disapointed and have to wonder what Tom Clancy was thinking."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A fast paced Clancy novel with such detail and realism it seems as if it had already happened, and Clancy was merely recounting the events so ingeniously concieved in this four-star book. Reccomended to anyone with a good imagination and a taste for danger and suspense."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was a fun read for me mostly because of the commandos in it. The scenes were the Rainbow team tosses their flash-bang grenades at the hostage takers and save the good guys are very nice. So nice that most of the books other flaws didn't annoy me too much. Some of those flaws are the lame dialogue (EVERY person in the book says &quot;...y'know?...&quot; at least six thousand times...), somewhat undeveloped characters, and a somewhat unbelivable plot. Despite all these, odd plot and all, I still liked it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I enjoyed the topic of this book: terrorism and counterterrorism. It seemed that Mr. Clancy developed the plot....ever so slowly...and then became bored with it and just wanted to end it. The end of the book....the last 100 pages or so....seemed rushed and haphazardly put together. This book could have easily become a 1500 pager or the same could have been accomplished in 400 pages. Overall, I enjoyed it but sometimes it just seemed to drag on."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a Tom Clancy fan for a long time, ever since the release of &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; which was by far the all-time best of Tom Clancy (as well as the movie! ) I was sadly disappointed in Rainbow Six for more reasons than I can list here. The book is entirely too long for such a limited storyline. The details strayed far from the well researched &quot;techno-babble&quot; that I'm used to from Mr. Clancy; who cares about every little movement the character makes, or breathes or sighs? Well I don't, it gets VERY boring. I read the hardcover...and it was hard! Hard to hold...darn heavy and I'm no weakling it's just bulky, but it's great for the collection and in the event I need a large prop. I have a feeling this book was written to compliment the computer game... not the other way around. Come on Tom, you can do better than this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For all those reviewers who say this book gives a good idea what it's like to be a special operations soldier-- wrong! I spent twenty years in spec-ops and these charicatures are a disgrace to the men I served with. Clancy is an ex-insurance salesman who has no clue either a) what it's like to serve and b) what combat is like. Having said that, I accept this is fiction and needs to be looked at in that like. As far as that goes, how about bad guys who aren't stupid and good guys who believe in the American way-- such as posse comitatus, trial by jury, etc.? If I wanted to go live in a police state there are plenty of countries I could move to. You want real? Try Andy McNabb's SAS books, or James Webb's Fields of Fire, or Stephen Coonts for air combat or Bob Mayer's special forces books. All those others walked the walk."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I received my copy on Friday, and finished it on Saturday. I have read most of Tom Clancy's books, but I must say that Rainbow Six was a disappointment...the action was good, and that is about it. The plot and the characters could have used a little more work. Overall, I was left unsatisfied. Not to say I won't buy his next book, but I hope it turns out better than this one did."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love a new Clancy book, and this one is no exception. But two things bothered me. One: I found this one's plot less of a surprise, maybe I've just gotten into the characters. The second thing- the one that really bothered me- was that I caught a research MISTAKE (pg. 640) on Clancy's part -all be it in an area totally out of his field. Mr Clancy, a blanket Appaloosa is the following &quot;Blanket - refers to a horse which has a solid white area normally over, but not limited to, the hip area with a contrasting base color. &quot; (Quoted from the Appaloosa Horse Club registration page). Most people won't notice, but anyone who knows App's will be dissappointed that Mr Clancy didn't do better research on this excellent breed of horse I give the book 4 stars but suggest he stick to the military stuff and leave the mammals to Michner!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Rainbow Six because John Clark and Ding Chavez are &quot;let's get the job done&quot; operatives who have already proven their abilities in previous books. They do so again in Rainbow Six. Also, Clancy successfully weaves the lives of Mrs. Clark and Dr. Chavez into the plot. From the opening chapter to the last, I couldn't put the book down because of non-stop action. Once again Clancy is ahead of the curve in analyzing current trends in world politics. This book focuses on an anti-terrorist response team led by John Clark and &quot;spooky&quot; enough, two violent acts of terrorism were recently committed in Africa against U.S. embassies. Hopefully the larger implications in the book regarding worldwide germ warfare will not become reality although Clancy makes it seems just too easy. In addition, Rainbow Six tackles the different viewpoints regarding environmental issues and although no solutions are presented to the political debates, it bec! omes clear that terrorism is not the path to better days. Rainbow Six is a thriller and one of Clancy's best works!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Top Notch. Once again Mr Clancy proves he is the master of his genre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having read all of Clancy's novels to date I must admit this is a great story. If you liked, &quot;Patriot Games,&quot; I think you will really enjoy &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; My big problem with this latest Clancy fancy isn't the story! It is the POOR proofreading. Alas, they have become complacent. Spelling errors abound, important story line foul-ups and yes, folks, grammatical errors. I am most aghast that Mr. Clancy would let this document go to press with his name on it!! The title should be &quot;Needed: Proofreader.&quot; Please advise your publisher to get on the ball and hire some English-capable people."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"RAINBOW SIX is a nicely crafted work. Tom Clancy has made, John Clark and his protoge (now son-in-law) Domingo Chavez, the central figures attempting to save society from the depredations of terrorists. The terrorists are unleashed upon Europe as part of a greater plan by a group intending to save the planet from man, by exterminating him, except for selected members of &quot;The Project&quot;.The story flows well from beginning to end, with the reader getting the feel of being in a an anti-terrorist group. Most of the time any such unit is training or watching its target, striking quickly and leaving before the last echo fades. The mindsets &quot;The Project&quot; are explored as well, with the reader being left with the clear message that those who play God may be judged by him sooner rather than later.BRAVO ZULU, Tom!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am only about 75 pages into this novel, but based on my past readings of Tom Clancy's works, this book is right up there among the best. I can't wait to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is not known for his ability to write prose but at least he usually writes an engaging techno thriller.(Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising). This time his characters aren't substantial enough to qualify as cardboard. The plot is not so original or well written to even be a cliche and is about as exciting as a glass of cold spit. Half-way through the book you may start hoping the terrorists win. A world-wide plague couldn't possibly be more miserable than trying to finish this book If you are a die-hard Clancy Fan and MUST have anything he has written, at least wait a week for it to show up on the bargain table. Better, wait for the paper-back and buy it used."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I heard that Tom Clancy was coming out with a new John Clark opus, I immediately read the first chapter online, revised my birthday wishes, and asked my wife, daughter, and others to forget about all the golf balls and ties and concentrate on ferreting out a copy of Rainbow Six. Birthday and book arrived on August 5, and I'm happy with both so far! Have my sights set now on S. King's upcoming Bag o' Bones. If Grisham's got anew legal tingler in the hopper, I can start my second half-century with a book-reader's trifecta!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is yet more proof that nobody writes about suspense, political intrigue or military operations with the skill of Tom Clancy. Jack Ryan is a great character, but John T. Clark has a bit more &quot;every man&quot; in him. He's a slightly flawed person who does what he thinks is right and I think most of us would agree with his conclusions. I was very excited to learn that Clancy was doing a another book with Clark as the primary character. When I heard that Ding Chavez was to be included as well, I was thrilled. Much to my reading pleasure, Clancy delivers yet again. Now I can't wait until he teams up Ryan, Clark, Chavez and Dan Murray again. I know he's started the next Ryan novel, I just hope I can make it till that release date."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Yuck. Double yuck. And a big yawn. Biggest problems were: (a) too long by at least 40%; (b) characters didn't keep you engaged, except perhaps for Popov; (c) Tom's political views were way too evident; (d) did I say it was too long? Found myself skimming the last half. Much of it seems to be meaningless filler - like he had a page count he was shooting for, and that's further reflected in how incredibly fast the ending was wrapped up; (e) good guys are perfect, bad guys are idiots, how's that for a recipe for boredom. Basically, just an overall bad book. Doubly tragic because he _can_ be a very good writer when he wants to be. Do yourself the favor - go reread Hunt for Red October before picking this one up."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Let me explain why this is the worst book ever:1. All the characters are macho sharpshooters who never make mistakes. All they do is kill people and train. Why don't we see them with their families? Do they do anything on their days off besides training? All we learn about them is their name and military background. What music do they listen to? What t.v. shows or movies do they watch? What are their hobbies? Clancy never tells us. I've never seen such minamalistic characterization in my life. Ding is the only member who is fleshed out. We learn nothing about the other characters.How can we care about them? 2. The book is way too long. It could have been much shorter. 3. Awful dialouge. Every character speaks the same. Everyone uses the same words: &quot;Doc&quot;, &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, &quot;Double-Tap&quot;... 4. Unrealistic: No one in Team 1 dies. No one is even wounded. We know they'll survive, so wheres the suspense? Sure, someone on group 2 is killed, but we never find out his name? So who cares? 5. Clancy's biased world view: Clancy thinks all tree-huggers are bad. If a women is independent or a feminist, she must be evil. If a woman is subserviant to her husband and has babies, she's an angel. Hey, Clancy, how come there are no female team members? Are you trying to tell us women can't handle terrorists? This book is very misogynistic. I agree with the military guy who said this book was only written to further Clancy's jingoistic world view. (Yes, I am a liberal). 6. No real main character. Sure, Clark is supposed to be the main character, but he does nothing! Popov and Ding have more page time. Clark does not face down any demons. 7. The computer game is better then the book. 8. That ridiculous photo on the back jacket. Clancy, face facts: You have never served, and never will serve, in the military. Stop pretending. RAINBOW SIX is the worst book ever written. Don't waste your money. Buy Elmore Leonard instead. At least he takes the time to flesh out his characters, (His books are way shorter then Clancy's, too!) I hate this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom, Tom, Tom, whatever happened to you? I thought that it could get no worse than Executive Whatever, but this book is a complete load of junk, and seemed to be even more like a vehicle for Mr. Clancy's rather paranoid, narrow minded, self righteous view of the world and America's place in it than the previous one. Serious issues such as enviornmentalism and vegetarianism are reduced to activities for abnormal, doped up sixties rejects. Whilst he considers himself a great expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict and can expound to us at great lengths on it (not in this one, admittedly, but in several of his others) he can think of nothing better than to label the enviorenmental movement simplistically as a bunch of deranged tree huggers. (Speaking of Mr. Clancy's expertise on international relations and America's place in the world, I notice that pressing issues such as Bosnia and the role and participation of the USA in some of the recent important global movements like the eradication of landmines and the establishment of an international war crimes tribunal are conspicuously absent from his work. Nothing to say on them? Perhaps they don't fit in to his image of the world.) When I think back to his great books like Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and Clear and Present Danger, this one bears no comparison. With regard to those books, another thing that has seriously suffered is his character depiction and dialogue, the latter being truly abominable in this book. About the only thing that this one has going for it are the action scenes. There are still few people in the business who can pace and write action like he can. By the way, Mr. Clancy, a vegan, as you denote vegetarians throughout your book, are people who touch neither meat, fish or dairy products. A vegetarian is someone who, according to their choice, may eat fish and will often eat eggs and cheese, and drink milk. There is a huge difference between the two (as least on this side of the Atlantic). Better luck next time (though I'll never know, as I'll never buy another Clancy book in my life, and that's a fact!)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have had been a real fan of Tom Clancy until I read this book years ago. First problem with this book as that whole paragraphs are repeated throughout the book. Tom seemed to be adding his own padding to make it a \\"Clancy\\" length book. but by far in the most way I find this book awful is his view of the Irish and the Irish troubles. \\"They are basically English anyway\\" is his view of Ireland. Tom in a world of slack jawed yokels militias all over the USA, maybe you should write about them as you seem to have digressed to this level over the years."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first Tom Clancy book I've ever read and I was totally blown away. He has a very deft touch when it comes to keeping the intrigue going and the story really kept me guessing as to the 'bad guys' real motivations."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I believe that in many ways this book defines Tom Clancy's career. The story glistens with Clancy's political savvy balanced with action. It appropriately spawned a whole video game line. It was one of the most fun Clancy books to read and it would make for an awesome movie even though it takes place during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book sticks with you, every now and then, a segment of this book will flash in my mind and I have to stop and think where did i read that from and sometimes it comes from Rainbow Six.What makes this such a good book is the games that followed it. Rainbow Six Las Vegas is one of my favorite games, and one of the reasons for that is because Rainbow Six was such a good book.This book is led by John Clark and not by Jack Ryan and Clark delivers this book. The opening of this book is one of the best openers of the Clancy novels. The opening tells and sets the setting of the rest of the book.John Clark and Ding Chavez are in an airplane that is about to be taken over by terrorist and these two take out the terrorist very easily. It sets the pace of the entire book, one of non-stop action and rescue.Clancy shows that such people as Clark and Chavez are needed in this world to stop terrorist and terrorism. Clancy's books tend to tell a story that reflects modern day life and in the age of terrorism and before 9/11 this book was somewhat prophetic on what was/is needed to deal with terrorism.Clancy delivers in this novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first Clancy book I've read. I really like it. Great story with great attention to detail and knowledge of military specifics.Though I enjoyed reading it, I knew that in the end the good guys would win but I was hoping that it would have been a little more substantive than it was. I guess, taking out the eco-terrorists was all just a little too easy for my liking. Still, very fun to read. Despite its length, the read is also very fast."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you've read any of Tom's books, you would know that he can sure write a good thriller. In fact, he's considered one of the best thriller novelists in the modern era, often mentioned alongside names such as John Grisham and Michael Crichton.Rainbow Six is a great testament to that.Rarely did I stop turning the pages in this one. The prose was flowing, the action was fast and the plot was engaging. Being someone who had served in the army before, I was attracted by the details of the mechanics surrounding the anti-terrorist team named RAINBOW. It's clear Tom knows his stuff. All the facts on the weapons were spot on, and the plot was very believable; with the US government being a part of a bio-terrorism scheme to exterminate the world's population, holocaust style. The multi-national team RAINBOW takes center stage, and for much of the book we learn about their members, their individual roles in the team and their many characteristics. Which is good; having the members of RAINBOW drive the book was a good move by Clancy.The plot moves on in many threads, much like Ted Bell's SPY where we see many threads moving on in a chronological sequence. It has a very gradual build-up that many thrillers typically employ. RAINBOW started off being formed in the first few chapters to being a serious threat to the main problem (the bio-terrorism problem) in the end. The book moves in and out between the team, the bad guys (Popov and the terrorists), the US government and the many external forces influencing the situation itself. And the plot threads move at a very fast pace, making it very enagaging and urgent.All in all, I found it a very exciting read. And I recommend it to all looking for a good thriller to plunge into."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Fans of Clancy know his novels vary a great deal in quality. Rainbow six is not one of the best. A lot of action? Sure. Suspensful conclusion? Of course. But the book overall has the feeling of a summertime blockbuster with more action than substance. Often there is interesting character growth and philosophical quandaries in his novels. However, this novel is not very political and attempts at human drama come off as sappy, sentimental, and unrealistic."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While the story line kept me reading and reading, the fact that Clancy takes 740 pages to write what could have been written in 500 pages meant that I did a lot of speed reading. He tends to try and get too deep into the minds, backgrounds, and feelings of many of the characters rather than getting on with the story line."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"By far one of Clancy's worst novels. Is it me or has Clancy fallen into a formulaic style now? It's not even the formula of the book that is disheartening -- it's the grammatical, spelling, and general mistakes that makes this book bad. My general feeling was that this book was rushed to the press and not enough edits were done to it.Aside for the glowing errors in the book, the book is too fluffy. The ending is too neat. And there is just too much &quot;stuff&quot; added in the book to make it longer. The &quot;bad guys&quot; in the book are way too crazy and the &quot;good guys&quot; are way too good.Stock characters, stock story, and bad writing. Shame on you Tom.I hope Clancy's next book is better than this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The last time I will pre-order a release.

Rainbow Six is yet another must-read for any Clancy fan, and is easily picked up as a first Clancy by any casual reader. The plot is full of action and starts early (contrary to most of his books, where it builds up very slowly) and examines one of contemporary society's greatest fears: a doomsday virus.The only major drawbacks to this book are the lack of technical information usually present in his books and the extremely poor editing received by the novel. He repeats himself many times, particularly on the mentality of the team technical wizard, and a simile about &quot;as normal as zipping his fly&quot; which is used three times in less than ten pages, and twice on one page.Tom, you write well, and with the aid of a halfway competent editor, this one could have been a classic!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This will be the last Clancy book I buy. Now, Tom's been heading downhill since Clear and Present Danger, but this is by far his worst work and perhaps the worst novel I have ever read. The plot is thin and repititive. The supposed &quot;climax&quot; of the book seems almost an afterthought. The dialogue is pathetic and the characters fill typical racial and ethnic stereotypes. Just try saying a few lines of dialogue out loud and you'll realize how silly you sound. No one talks like this. Ever since Debt of Honor, Clancy's right-wing political views have kidnapped his writing (with the exception of Without Remorse). In fact, I was very much looking forward to the next novel featuring John Clark -- Clancy did an admirable job in developing Jack Ryan's alter ego in Without Remorse.

At one point, I counted the exact same dialog three times in a row from the same character. That was disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels and I am a fan of his - but. With Rainbow six, the plot is big but has flaws that cannot be justified. The ending does not fit with our present day society. After the FBI/CIA reads a person his rights, they do not allow them to be carted off and left to die in the jungle without severe repercussions. Also a group of people that are able to put together a multi-billion dollar company and put together this plot over time against multiple governments would not make so many foolish mistakes or only have one delivery system. Not believable. Good reading but a C grade for a usual A writer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"good plot it kept me reading. i like recurring characters. the ending in some respects was not like his usual. before you always wondered what's going to happen next."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A masterpiece!

Truly scary, too real, too believable!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom clancy brought out all the twists in this one. I've never read a better book! I just wish he would make another Rainbow six. I think know that Tom Clancy knowshow to really write well there will be another great thriller."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Summary:Rainbow Six is about an anti-terrorist military group (Rainbow) lead by John Clark. The Rainbow team is called to resolve various terrorist situations throughout the book. It is revealed to the team that a group of very dedicated environmentalists are behind the attacks and are trying to destroy the whole world population with a strengthened version of the ebola virus. The Rainbow team then has to find a way to stop the destruction of the world's population and a way to punnish the environmentalists for their actions.Evaluation:This was the first Tom Clancy novel I read and I was not dissapointed. The book is action-packed and does not leave the reader bored. The last 200 pages of my paperback were a little slow, but the ending was worth the reading. It did seem that Clancy was trying to wrap things up a bit in the end, but the ending was good and the rest of the book was so excellent that the hurriedness of the ending can definitely be overlooked.The characters were very good in this novel. The description of the anti-terrorist teams gave an inside look into the thoughts of anti-terrorists and made you really root for the good guys. The book is also good for people who want a break from Jack Ryan (I like John Clark much better). The Russian character Popov was excellent. I can't say much about him without giving the story away, but I really enjoyed his involvement in the novel.All in all this is one of the best books that I have ever read. It has me hooked on Tom Clancy. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action and is interrested in anti-terrorism."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is about a secret multinational task force set up to combat terrorism around the world. The team's code name is Rainbow (which describes their multinational composition) and their leader is an ex-Navy Seal by the name of John Clark, also known as Rainbow Six.The book starts by seizing your attention with an exciting plane hijacking, and coincidentally, some of the team members were on board to handle the situation with great professionalism. Just as the team is settling into its new base in London, they get called up to stop a bank robbery in Switzerland. An attempted kidnapping is the next plan they have to foil. And to top things off for the team, they have to face a group of terrorists that have kidnapped a large group of children and are threatening to kill them one at a time unless their demands are met.Their next assignment will be a challenge so great that most people wouldn't have even thought someone would do such a thing. They must take on a group of people so extreme in their ideologies that... well, you'll just have to read the book yourself to find out what happens.

The largest mission is to try and stop the spreading of a deadly plague chemical at the Sydney Olympics.Author Bio:Tom Clancy is a well-established man of a very high character. The man writes books about those topics that most interest himself but that are very important in partial to the protection of our nation. Tom Clancy goes into deep detail in his books because of his extensive research of all military and political issues at hand. Tom Clancy has clearance to be aboard most military vessels and areas to be able to research those areas of the individuals of the area and the happenings of any event. Tom Clancy makes it his mark to study so in depth of every detail to be able to create his works of art.Evaluation:Tom Clancy's books are books written that go into very descriptive detail. Tom Clancy has a very well groomed way of leading a reader into his chapters and keeping them there with every intricate detail. I felt that Rainbow Six was the best book that I have ever read. Special ops and military work are very intriguing to me and this book includes every aspect of special ops teams down to the firing of rounds from a gun, to the computer satellite systems used as surveillance techniques by the ops teams. Military has always been a passion of my family. I have been able to be brought up in a family with two officers of the U.S. military. One NAVY and one Army. One also being an officer of the law. I have learned a lot about war and the military system. This book made me appreciate my knowledge of the military even more. The book was a very good read and I enjoyed the book very much. I have read a few of Clancy's books and plan to read as many as possible. So far the best of the Clancy books I have read is Rainbow Six. I have also read The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, and The Sum Of All Fears. I felt the climatic events throughout the book were exactly what they needed to be to lead the reader through every chapter. Rainbow was such an attacking group that I expected them to stop at nothing to get the job done. I felt that the ending was a bit too forgiving. Throughout the whole book, even up to the ending, the whole idea was to kill and finish anyone in the path of Rainbow who was not rightfully in that path. The ending of letting nature take care of itself just seemed too forgiving. I know the idea behind the idea was supposed to be poetic justice, but for the attack the Horizon group was planning against the world a more horrifying death should have been what the Horizon group should have faced. As I said I felt the book was the best that I have ever read but I felt the ending could have been handled in a different fashion.

I have to admit this book was a little slow but, nevertheless awsome. This book will carry you through 4 action-packed missions and slowly reveal a catostrophic plot. Overall, one of the best books I've ever read. And the game is also very fun."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is another competent effort by Clancy. I was excited that he was going back into the Jack Clark story line. For me, this is one of his better characters becuase he is such a man's man. This book probably could have done with some of the uncut pages left out, it does go on and drags a few places. It must be the power he has gotten over this editors that each of his books that is driving them to be increasingly longer. With that said I am a big fan of Clancy and I thought the book moves along and is never dull. Let me add that you always get a lot of detail and fact with a Clancy book, this is one of he reasons I really like the books and the reason some of my friends are getting turned off. The extra pages on the detail and weapons bring extra value to me. Becuase of the believability of his role in the story, with the back ground we know about him, I completely trust the character. This believability of the role and character are the main reason I can give this story some slack. I was hard pressed to believe the story line at first, but through out the book you come to believe in it. If you like Clancy you will love this book and probably do not need these reviews to prompt you to buy one. If you are just curious then give it a try or grab one of his earlier books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Some people may have problems with the politics and Clancy's obviously conservative leanings, both of which are on display in this book. To those (and to those who are offended by a predominantly American point of view) I say tough. It's just a work of fiction, regardless of how &quot;real&quot; it's supposed to be. And it's written by an American writer, so why are you shocked by the American point-of-view? I don't read Ian Fleming novels expecting to see an American point of view. Grow up. There are plenty of books which have offended me on various levels and with the exception of those I had to read for college, I always have the option of not reading them if I choose to.Overall, I enjoyed this book although I did think the character development was noticeably weaker than in some of Clancy's other novels. And what makes that stand out even more is there was PLENTY of room for character development since the story only focused on a few groups (not dozens like his novels sometimes do.) A lot of the soldiers were never really fully developed and the &quot;bad guys&quot; were painted with a broad brush showing only one side (granted, the crime they plan to commit makes it hard to identify with them.) The best character in the entire novel is not Clark or any of the soldiers, but turns out to be the Russian agent. I enjoyed following his storyline the most. Not so much because it was the central thread tying everything together, but because his character was literally a throwback to all the old classic Cold War spies we came to love in earlier novels. Unfortunately, I don't know if they'll really draw upon his character again in future books.If you're looking for Clancy books and want extensive character development and a more tightly-defined plot, read &quot;Without Remorse&quot; or &quot;Patriot Games.&quot; If you want a massive storyline intricately weaving numerous plot lines, try &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; or &quot;The Sum of All Fears.&quot; If you just want an easy-to-read, entertaining thriller, try &quot;Executive Orders.&quot; This book assumes you already know the primary characters and throws you pretty much headfirst into their latest developments. I still enjoyed it, but that's because I knew the character's history and sort of knew what to expect from Clancy at this point."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One of the things that made Clancy's best novels great was the way he kept 20 interlinked stories going at once in descriptive, but not excessive detail that kept your heart racing. He had an amazing ability to protray each group from their viewpoint without judgement, and with some accuracy. He did the best and the worst of society with equal fairness. Though I often thought he was a little blind in many areas, most of his books were reasonable protrayals of people in the groups involved. He latest books have gotten more political, and less well done.Apparent his hate of even the mildest of Environmentalists is too great to allow this type of protrayal, or he just didn't have time to do any research on Environmentalist any place other the National Review. His protrayals of the groups involved is shallow and unbelievable, and he has conpensated for only involving a few groups by increasing detail about things he clearly doesn't understand. This book is so bad it goes on the very short list of Books that I can't finish and plan to throw in the garbage to avoid punishing others with its poorly written drivel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A review by BrianThis book is about the fictional story of international terrorism, by Tom Clancy. This book is about the quiet CIA legend, John Terrence, Kelly, or otherwise known as the famous Mr. Clark, who founded Rainbow, an elite group of counter-terrorist specialists selected from the best organizations from around the world, and put into one unit serving as a secret Counter-Terrorist unit. The team undergoes many vigorous missions, including an Amusement Park takeover, and massive scheme involving a nerve gas agent distributed during the Sydney Olympic Summer Games, resulting in the death of over half the population on the planet...The plot of this story is amazing, and is far-stretched, and this book is has so many characters, and tells about this character from his or her point of view. In the beginning of the book, it starts off with a bang of excitement and an adrenaline rush-but then settles down in the middle of the book, but is very interesting anyway, of the different things happening, that will soon all come together in the very end of the book, where all the character's situations will wrap up in one huge explosion, it seems the end of all books by Tom Clancy are very exciting. Tom Clancy seems to tell this story rather fast paced, moving from character to character, which all speeds up in the very end of the book. Personally, I didn't want the book to end, and would have liked it if the book was a little bit longer. It was somewhere around 800 pages long, but I went through it real fast. I was very surprised when and how the story ended, and was surprised that John Brightling didn't go to court or had a trial. I somewhat liked the way the story ended, it was creative, and a little funny, when John Clark left Mr. Brightling and his men in the jungle, alone. Overall, I think it is a good story that is well put together and well thought out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked the book. It was long with only a few breaks in the action. This was my 1st read in the ongoing saga. Not the way to read Clancy but I saw Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger as movies so I knew the storyline. Clark and Chavez have come a long way. Action in this one starts with the initial plane trip to England. If you like stories of Super elite teams of good guys beating the daylights out of terrorists, this ones for you. Alot of interesting stuff and some good action."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to love reading Clancy's books - Red Storm Rising was a real technothriller. After reading Executive Orders, and now this piece of junk, I'll have to go back to lawyer novels. Briefly, the plot revolves around environmental extremists who have found a way to rid Earth of humanity (except them, of course). These extremists instigate a number of terrorist incidents to allow them to put their plan into action. That brings them up against John Clark and Ding. Well, you know who's going to win. The book is poorly written and poorly researched. The dialogue is atrocious (when was the last time you heard Ph.D.'s in biochemistry and biology calling everyone they meet &quot;pal&quot; - when was the last time you heard ANYONE address relative strangers as &quot;pal&quot;?) and unrealistic. Put yourself in the position of any of Clancy's characters and imagine yourself saying the things he has them say. Never happen, G.I. And did you know that when it's summer in Australia, it's also summer in Kansas? Environmental warfare is certainly a topic worth some imaginative fiction (witness the Gulf War, for example), but Clancy's imagination and his writing &quot;skills&quot; aren't up to the task. Beyond that, he has once again let his own political views get in the way of the story. A much more likely scenario of environmental war is nation-states competing for access to dwindling resources. There's a good idea for some techno-writer - I just hope Clancy doesn't try it.."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This his book is arguably his best work. It has very interesting and deep story once you pick it up you'll never put it down again. It is also extremely well written, the story is portrade in the best way I would recommend this book to any one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first Clancy book that I read, and I was quite impressed. The action sequences were fantastic, and really grabbed my attention. The ending was a bit lagging, but overall, I thought this book was awesome. A lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is developed around John Clark and his son-in-law Chavez. Clark is head of a SAS type international team to counter terrorist. Book as usual is well written. The ultimate threat, beyond normal reaason and grand in scale. But fully plausable. Though enjoyable and action packed, I miss Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a 14 years old boy from Norway! I have never read any books before this. I tried to read a book on Norwegian, but the book was to boring. But in this book its exciting almost all the time. Its a hijacking starting already at the end on page 4, an that\`s great! After the hijacking there\`s 5 missions for Rainbow.I recommend this book to all who likes action! Buy this book if you want some excitement! Its worth the money!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Based upon some of the more luke-warm reviews this book has been given here at Amazon.com, I figure I must be quite easy to please because I really enjoyed this read. While I agree with other reviewers that many of the characters were dimensionless, the storytelling and suspense in this work kept me interested enough to read through the 740 pages. Usually, if a book turns me in the wrong direction within the first 100 pages, I rarely finish it. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; on the other hand did the exact oposite and kept me coming back. The &quot;action scenes&quot; are well written and the plot in general is quite good but most importantly, this book entertained me and that's why I feel it earned it's four star rating even though there were a few issues with this story. For instance, if you've never been to the UK, after reading this you'd probably think that everyone in the UK or Ireland drank Guiness and drove Jaguars. While Guiness is quite popular, not everyone drinks it, like Clancy portrayed. Another thing that bothered me: could that plumber guy that let Popov onto the base be that stupid. I mean, c'mon! I don't really think he would have allowed the Russian to tag along with him after hardly meeting him. These items and a few others kept it from beening a five-star read, but the work is still excellent and definitely worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has chosen a good topic for &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. The basic plot, Shiva a genetically engineered strain is interesting and the book is a page turner. Initially the conversation among the rainbow six team is too much which may loose the interest of the reader. Apart from this, one can read this book"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The story itself brings readers a positive mind to continue reading. It provides good Vocab as well as good structures. However, some parts in the story is too long winded which make the reader gets bored easily, especially the part where killgore made the medical experiment on the girl. On the other hand, there are some events which are pretty intresting and thrilling. FOr example, the terroists' incidence which provides plenty of detaills. To summarise, this book is suitable for all ages and i definately want to recommand this to everyone."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a very unique concept. Bringing all of the special ops people together to fight terrorism This book had a very good plot. Raising a villain from the KGB to spearhead the plans of the evil billionaire was a very good idea on Clancy's part. John Clark proved himself very competant playing the lead role in this book. The Rainbow Six groups confrontations with the Terrorist factions (including the IRA) made for exciting reading. A very good book. I certainly hope he does a sequel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read numerous Clancy books, and this one is phenominal. I just finished reading several reviews. Those of you who didn't like this book because of its size, go read RL Stine. This book deserved its thickness, because of the plot! Duh! What's wrong with you people? This book was fascinating in the characters. Someone in the reviews griped about Clancy getting too deep with the characters, major and minor. Well, it's called &quot;character devlopment!&quot; Go back to grade school.Clancy put out a definite winner. His plot is up-to-date, and present. Terrorism needs to be battled. This story tells of one man who's smart enough to gather a group of soldiers across the oceans to combat some of the most evil enemies of our time. The dialogue is great! Every time you turn around, you're heading to fight evil. It's packed with suspense. It even has some comedy, and somewhat romantics in parts. It has several genres in one, and it's unpredictable.Those of you who say it's bad because you listened to it...YOU made the mistake. This book was written to be READ not LISTENED to! I highly, highly, highly recommend this book. The characters demonstrate courage, dedication, and unfailing persistence to find out who's behind the rising line of terrorists that threaten to undo mankind. I could go on and on, but I want you to read the book. Fantastic, phenominal, his best yet, and it'll be hard to top in the future, but I'm sure Tom can pull it off!Great job, Clancy, great job.Five stars, without hesitation, and without remorse!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"There are a number of things to dislike about this book:* the female characters;* the less than tight writing in many spots; and,* the underlying plot (which to me seems outlandish).Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it. It was entertaining and part of the reason that I read is to entertained.I have found trend in Clancy's books over the last fifteen years to be interesting. More and more of his politics have shown through. For example, Jack Ryan's leanings in Debt of Honor and Executive Orders. Clancy has used his popularity as an author to push some of his politic beliefs.Additionally, as the cold war collapsed, he has definitely grapped on to terrorism on a central theme; this is also notable in the Op-Center books.My greatest hope is that Clancy will take the time to write a tighter book next time out. This book just feels like it was hammered out too quickly in spots."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"early in the book it was easy to see that tom clancy was wriiting for TVdom.....I liked some of the accurate details of the weaponry and the security sequences but it wrote itself........It was apredictable plot...non of the superheroes would be hindered in their goals........traitors and spies were identified early in the plot.

The details and the plot makes this book a must read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I enjoy Mr. Clancy's books, enjoy all of them. This was extentsion of Clancy's now famous plot line and in this purpose it carried on gracefully, no zip, no shoose, no excitement. I enjoyed the book for the technical aspects and the response team training and practices descriptions. Perhaps beinga law enforcement firearms instructor and qualified for the MP-5 gave a personal insight into Clancy's research, he should be commended at least for this aspect of his book. Yeah the story in itself is interesting but remained flat through out the book. Mr. Clancy is a terrific writer and he doesn't have to prove that to any of us, but perhaps a little bit of excitement like Red Storm Rising, or the Hunt would boost interest in his next novel. No matter though I'll by it anyway"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is not a worthy read for his fans. It is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his protagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book very little, but the best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I do not recommend this book to every Clancy fan. Tried to read it 3 times, no luck. Sorry Tom, you missed the mark by a mile."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Starts slow, with Clancyesque jumps from subject to previously unintroducted subject. Then, about the time you've figured out who's up to what it takes you on a wonderful roller-coaster ride of suspense with all the proper twists and turns of a great novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a writer, Tom Clancy hasn't totally lost his touch,although in many respects this interminable tome ranges from tediousto downright boring. However, when one is overpaid by the word or by the pound, editing doesn't seem to carry a very high priority. While his love for paramilitary organization is abundant, his villains are couched in terms of tree hugging loonies, and he tars everyone who might entertain environmental concerns with the same brush. He sneers at the term &quot;El Nino&quot;, apparently refusing to acknowledge that some human and public benefit might actually flow from being able to forecast weather patterns from sea temperature irrespective of what the phenomenon is called. He sneers at adverse impacts on the ozone layer, seemingly espousing more and more power plants, more and more consumption of fossil fuels, and suggests that only some sort of fruitcake would dare contend that maybe, just maybe, we have a problem worthy of some concern. He sneers at global warming, and admires strip mining. He decries the concept of mass murder advanced by his group of environmental terrorists, but adopts with enthusiasm mass murder (or execution, as he would portray it) by his paramilitary cadre for whom even the slightest hint of due process is anathema."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am glad Mr. Clancy has brought back John (Kelly) Clark and his main hero. Clark is an introspective tough guy cut from the John Wayne cloth. Clancy's world is truly a dangerous place. If it's not some rag head nuking the Super Bowl (Sum of All Fears,) it's some crazy, left-wing, liberal scientist trying to kill humanity in order to &quot;save the planet.&quot; Some people do not like Clancy's political leanings but who really cares? Clancy is dead on target with his descriptions of the enviromental wacko movement. I'm sure Al Gore will be whining about Clancy's work. He'll just have to hug another tree and cry."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This Clancy novel outshines his last two. I like Jack Ryan and the essance of his charactor, but John Terrance Kelly/Clark is awesome. Once again we are delighted to see Clark in center stage. The only grievance of the whole book was it was too predictable. Especially in the hospital scenario, it just could not happen to Clark again. Other than a few items like this it is overall my second favorite of Clancy next to Without Remorse. Clancy knows how to tell a tightly woven plot and keep you interested all the way through. I have yet to read a Clancy novel I couldn't put down until finished. Keep it up Tom I'm still a great fan!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six on my Clancy scale was a 7 out of 10. Reviewing a novel is better understood by comparing it to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. So I would say that Rainbow Six could be best described as a spellbinding novel of suspense and intrigue, it has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, the behind the scenes military realism that is Clancy's trademark, the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain, and the style and flavor of John LeCarre at his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The first Tom Clancy book I ever read was Patriot Games. After reading it I instantly chose him as my favorite author. Then I read some more books of his like The Cardinal of the Kremlin and Red Storm Rising, and I was dissapointed to say the least. He seemed to be writing manuals with little, if any, action in them at all. This book has totally restored my faith in him. It carries along at a breakneck speed and you can barely put it down. It may not be the most realistic book in the world, but it is certainly one of the most entertaining books I've read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was quite long, but i liked it alot overall. After i read this book i went and read &quot;Without Remorse&quot; (which i think is Clancy's best). People may not like how things happen in Rainbow, but Clancy definitely stays within character for John Clark----especially at the end. At first the ending disturbed me, both because of what happened and the fact that i thought that it was a little anticlimactic. But actually now i'm glad that it turned out that way...I mean, this isn't a frickin' James Bond movie.I think people might have missed the irony in the book. During the course of the book, Dr. Bellows (or whatever his name is) gives advice to the Rainbow members regarding terrorist psychology. He repeatedly says that certain people/groups have their own morals or consider themselves above morals/ethics that the rest of the world adheres to(playing by a different set of rules, or something to that effect anyways)---especially the groups that Rainbow confronts. The irony is, He's also really describing John Clark---i mean just look at the ending. That is WHY the book is titled &quot;RAINBOW SIX&quot;.Call it unrealistic or over the top if you like, but in my opinion, this is a great book---second to WR."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was amazing! The best I ever read!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Anyone who thinks Rainbow six is a bad book, they can go to hell! Rainbow Six is a book that keeps you reading, reading, reading, did I mention it keeps you reading. &quot;Why does it keep you reading&quot;, you ask.

I strongly suggest you read it, even though it is about 750 pages. *Solid Snake over and out*"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Couldn't keep myself from the book but thought the author made the characters a little too pro American. Being pro American isnt too bad, but he portraid them as being very sterotypical military gun-ho type people. The details Tom Clancy provided were so vivid i got a headache. It is a very well writen book and i would recommend it to most."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Greatly great. If you like top-secret, swat government stuff, you'll love this instant classic.

Second, in response to 'gregarins' message, many people that haven't already read it would appreciate it if you wouldn't give away the whole plot. And the coolest gadget in the book was not the radio as you sarcastically implied. What about the heartbeat sensor? I don't know about any of you, but I was impressed by the idea.

LOOK AT HOW MANY MOVIES AND BOOKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON THESE TWO SUBJECTS.

THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOUR ATTENTION FOR HOURS AT THE TIME!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What was once fresh and interesting about Clancy (red October/sum of all fears) has become stale and hackneyed. There were so many typos and repetitive passages, I am left with the sense that he bypassed the editing stage due to a tight deadline. The technological insights I enjoyed in the past were exaggerated in this tome with out the benefit of a trully riviting storyline to balance it. Lastly, his descriptive treatment of women leads me to conclude that he's been frustrated in his attempts at relationships with them. This book has convinced a longtime Clancy fan (I've read'em all) to seek out greener pastures."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What happened w/ R6??? What a bummer...I bought the book the day it was released and frankly had a tough time finishing it. I'm a Huge Clancy fan but am really disappointed with this one...a couple of things irked me, one was the repetition of descriptive words (can someone say...&quot;niggardly&quot;). And the plot had a Huge hole...without spoiling it...Why, if you spend billions on your &quot;plan&quot;, would you send ONE guy to carry it out (to the olympics)...where's the backup...STUPID, STUPID. I don't know...I'm just very disappointed with this book"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read many of Clancy's book and enjoyed them but this one is just stupid. There was no page turning. I didn't care what happened. I read about half way through and still didn't care. I won't waste the money on his next hardcover!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Why use one word when three can fill up space. I agree with the reviewer who was chagrined that a single tree was cut down to publish this thing. I also agree with the reviewer who recommended Bob Mayer's special forces books.

Try CUT OUT, DRAGON SIM-13, ETERNITY BASE, hell, read anything but this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Have read all of Clancy's novels, and agree with the usual comments so won't go into them. Enjoyed Rainbow Six despite the usual quirks. However, regarding Carol Brightling's cat....aren't calicos almost, if not always, female? Isn't a male calico a biological improbability? Maybe, since Brightling is a scientist, &quot;Jiggs&quot; is one of her experiments. Or maybe Clancy was just too busy researching other things to realize this!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Before I begin, I would like to state that I am (or was) a Tom Clancy fan. I loved his early books (Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October) and I have a copy of all of his published non-fiction works (Marine, Airborne, Armoured Warfare, Airwing, and Submarine). I also happen to be an veteran Ranger NCO and have a pretty good understanding of the technical details Clancy writes about.This book comes across like a poorly-scripted made-for-TV movie (like the abysmal Ops Center). As a Ranger, its nice to have folks glorifying us as good guys, but does everything have to black-and-white? The good guys are incredibly good, and the bad guys incredibly evil (and stupid, i might add). In addition, the unbelievable plot stretches realism a little thin and does nothing for the book.If terrorists were really that dumb and make so many critical errors, we wouldn't need spec ops units to deal with them. We would just spank them and send them to bed without supper.Counter terrorism is a high-risk business and casualties are to be expected when engaging heavily armed and fanatical people, regardless of how well a unit is trained. For a unit to be so unbelievably lucky (as depicted in the book), all of the time sends the plot into comic-book territory."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I come away from Clancy's books expecting two things:(1) to be entertained, and (2) to learn something. In this case, neither of the expectations was fullfilled. The plot is too predicable and a bit campy. And unlike most of his previous books, I did not learn a thing about how a machine works, how a system operates, or the effect of one form of political thought on another. His characters are at best, weak. And of the very few &quot;snake eaters&quot; that I have met, his characters are completely unlike the real thing. This book was almost as useless as Patriot Games-hence it will probably be a smash hit in the mass media movie arena."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really wanted to like the book. At first it held some promise but lacking the necessary research and understanding of even the basics like; what a vegan is or what a vegan eats among hundreds of other improbable components made it impossible to reach any rational ending. The length was partially a result of poor writing, poor continuity and redundancy. Characters deteriorated in believable personality and events had obvious plausable alternatives that made the course taken by the plot naive. Terrible wasted effort."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really loved this book. I stopped reading many of Clancy's works, because he often beats around the bush for four hundred pages or so, then finally gets the action rolling. Rainbow Six is quite different. As the main plot (admittedly a slightly over-zealous characterization of environmentalists) slowly unfolds, Clancy does a nice job of entertaining you with the some of the preliminary outings of the elite anti-terrorism outfit for whom the book is named. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the movie is doubtlessly already in the works.....not the greatest novel ever writtem but certainly one of the more entertaining in my recent memory."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel. All I have to say is that I LOVE it! I can't put it down because I have to read what is comming next. Tom Clancy knows military and weapons. He does not mistake F/18's for F/15's like other novelists. Everything just leads up into one big BANG!!."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A lot of people find themselves drawn to the character of John Ryan, and found themselves disapointed with Rainbow Six. I actually found this a relief as the Ryan myth has become a little much. Frankly I think the character is starting to crumble. From basically reeling in a Russian Sub to taking on Irish Terrorists then going on to be the President. I think Clancy is taking a step in the right direction by changing focus.I personally would like to see a book about Clark's time in Vietnam, to clear up all the mysterys about Plastic Flower etc.As for Rainbow Six, a good mix of action, gadgets, SF tactics and writers liscense. An improvement on Executive Orders"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Get a grip people. Thank God for Tom Clancy and his verbose writing style. I am seriously getting sick of the &quot;new&quot; authors who write a measly 300 pages that consist of never-ending action and a paper thin plot mixed in with a lttle sex. Tom Clancy writes an intricate plot with extremely fleshed out and believeable characters. I love that fact that he descibes in minute detail the surroundings and situations. Without that kind of detail, all you get is a two dimensional pot-boiler.For those people who cannot handle description or two minutes that pass where someone doesn't get killed, I would not suggest this book or any Tom Clancy novel. If you want a well written, well designed story, READ THIS BOOK! (And any other Tom Clancy novel)... (except for maybe Red Storm Rising... good book, but he was still honing his writing skills...)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not up to some of his best but better than most. Pretty straightforward tale of good guys versus bad guys. Some insight into the way special operations operates but I would recommend a couple of other books if you want more accurate views: Andy MCNABB's books about his time in the SAS; Bob MAYER's Special Forces series-- both were in the units they write about. Check out BRAVO TWO ZERO or CUT OUT, ETERNITY BASE"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Ok, I'm just reading this book and it's just awesome. Actually I had to make an essay in school about a book I had read then. So I took the rainbow six and was looking for some stuff about it. Then I got so excited about it, that I bought it and now I'm reading it. It's just action, action, action...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is my first Clancy book, and I have to say it is one of my all-time favorites so far. I love the action parts, but the other stuff gets kinda boring and confusing for me. All in all though, I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to see what would happen next."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was hoping for a follow-up to Executive Order, which left us hanging, wondering about the future of the US government. What Clancy gave us was a change of direction. Rather than terrorists after the US, they are after the world as we know it. The ultimate of idealistic cleansing.While the characters were familiar and the book was thoroughly enjoyable, I hope Clancy takes a step back and fills in the gap between Executive Order and Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom's finally hit bottom...all those million dollar advances have made him soft. The plodding, downright boring pace of this latest incarnation of the Jack Ryan series..(John Clark) has watered down the thrills of the first three books in this series and made this a not-read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I began to suspect something when I'd find my nose smeared in dried blood every morning. The shear weight of this monstrosity falliing on my face as I fell to sleep reading it may have caused permanent damage. But every night I plodded on, waiting for the big event. It came with only 40 of the 740 pages to go and I thought the most interesting plot aspect was an opportunity missed. I'm glad I read it. I think it has ruined the movie for me though. I'm still the Clancy fan...but fading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was probably the pinical of Tom Clancy's writing career. Though I don't doubt that he could write a better book, I think that this book will never be rivaled by other writers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is perfect for you if you like action and adventure. This book reminds me of Richard Marcinko's &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; series and I highly reccomend them both."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy is an excellent writer and he continues to put out great books like Rainbow 6. His writing style makes you feel like you are with the team on their missions. I highly recommend this book to anyone! Buy it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another great book from Mr Clancy. Very much enjoyed the visit with Mr Clark &amp; company. Since I remember only one reference to &quot;Jack&quot; (as President), could this omission be a subtle hint about our own current mess in Washington? I especially liked the ending of this book and look forward to seeing Mr Popov in a future novel. Interesting character."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book lacks depth of either plot or characterisation that can be found in some other of his novels but this did not spoil it for me. Although simple and a bit predictable in places the plot moves quickly and I found myself caught up in its momentum to such an extent that I did not want to put the book down. Candy for the brain it may be but I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This Book defines writing. It is the most intelegent and most detailed book I have ever read. It is a must have in every colection of books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I spent a lot of $$ on this thinking itwould be good, but it is filled with cardboard characters, a plot taken from a Duke Nukem clone, and a whole bunch of tree hugging. Nevertheless, Clancy manages to entertain up to the last 200 pages, where he loses it. Worth the first 500, though."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Interesting that several readers were disappointed in this roller coaster read. I couldn't disagree more. A lot of very bad people meet instant, violent death. How could you not be entertained? I've been waiting for Clancy to thrill me the way he did in &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; delivers thrills by the truckload. Tense, and (for Clancy), sparse prose makes for a capivating read. The only gripes I had were it's not yet in paperback and my President isn't the calibre of a Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr Clancy has become more and more commercialised and his work has suffered. The clear and present example is &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;-a book he wrote to make yet more money. It does not come near to his earlier works. Mr Clancy's immense success will prove to be his undoing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has to be the best action writer of our time. And Rainbow is his best work yet. The book focuses on the anti-terrorist actions of a new secret organization named Rainbow, and headed up by John Clark. A string of seemingly unrelated terrorist attacks places Rainbow and it's two elite, international teams of soldiers on the trale of a radical environmental group with a truely unimaginable goal. A recommended read for anyone. And if you loved Op-Center and Cardinal of the Kremlin also by Clancy, or if you're a Bond fan, this is a MUST READ!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six largely follows the classic Tom Clancy formula. He weaves together several different characters and sub-plots (at least 5 or 6). At the start, you have no clue as to how he's going to bring them to a common climactic point. But he does, in his classic style - and to a typically gripping conclusion. I loved it. I would add that each book he writes seems to take longer to really get into....this one was about 200 (out of 700) pages. Once you get past that point....it's tough to put down!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"There's nothing better than kicking back and reading a good war novel or techno-thriller. RAINBOW SIX was suspenseful and well done, but Clancy is starting to get in a rut. He needs some new fields to plow. I just wish he would do a WWII book once, this year's crop--THE THIN RED LINE, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and WAR OF THE RATS are all pretty good, but no one can touch Clancy when it comes to military thrillers. Come on, Tom, write something about the stand at Moscow, or the Battle of Midway or something, it would be great!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read this book straight through that is how much I enjoyed it. From the start to the end it is completely action packed. Not to give anything away but you know the bad guys are in for trouble when they start messing with Clark and Chavez's families. If there is anything we learn in a Clancy novel it is not to screw with Ryan's family or Clark's family. This was an excellent book written in Clancy's best form. I would advise anyone to read this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"this book as everything you want in a clancy book. mystery,suspense,action, bady guys and good guys. I LOVE THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another Tom Clancy success! I love this book- even the technical parts. It was great! I had no idea it was possible to fall in love with fictional characters, but I love Ding!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Buy it and enjoy the non-stop action of an amazingly creative book. You won't put it down. Read the book and see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked this book so much, I've read it twice! Clancy does an amazing job depicting the lives of a counter-terrorist group. His information on weapons and such was given in a manner that you didn't think you were reading a label. Most of all I loved the take-downs, they were full of non-stop action! And RedStorm Entertainment did another awe-inspiring job creating Rainbow Six the computer game!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not all people who believe there are good guys and bad guys are &quot;jingoists&quot;. Most are, but Clancy isn't one of them. He gives us more characters to like than to hate. Like Dr. Cathy Ryan, for example. To me, she's a composite of every woman I've ever known and respected. Like Robby Jackson, one hell of a solid dude. As for Jack, who ever heard of a multi-book hero who's President? The last hero I got into as much as Ryan was James Bond--while Fleming was still alive. But Jack has now been relegated to a supporting role, with Cathy at his side. Robby's an admiral--too senior and too old to be a hero. So now we have Clark and son-in-law Ding. Clark's a very human tough-guy who prevails despite the dues he's paid (maybe BECAUSE of them). Ding's an ex gang kid who's gone straight--actually, he's turned out better than he himself might have predicted when he was still on the streets of LA. When we first met Jack in &quot;Red October&quot;, he was only an obscure academic who dabbled in intelligence. Captain Ramius was the real hero of that book. So give Clark and Ding a chance, willya? In the words of JFK (a liberal who was tough when he needed to be); &quot;The torch has now been passed&quot;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I could not put this book down. The moment one major event occured, another was automatically brewing. The story's characters were realistic and the plot was, unfortunately, believable. I highly enjoyed the way Clancy spun so many people and activities at the same time and then threw them together at the end in one major ending, complete with guns and explosives and a happy ending! The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it ended so suddenly..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"...A computer game. Coincidence? Hardly. Let's face it, this is a sad piece of work from someone who brought us &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin.&quot; You've made a quick buck Clancy, now go back and write a real novel. -A Big Clancy Fan (or was...)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not one of his best. Some of the characters were not fully developed, others not introduced at all. The ones that we were allowed to meet were done excellently which probably whetted my appetite to meet the others. The diabolical plan/plot is plausible but the conclusion is anti-climactic."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you don't like this book you are insane"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In &quot;Rainbow Six,&quot; Tom Clancy delivers exactly what we hoped and expected he'd deliver, a page-turner filled, but not crammed, with technology and testosterone. The story focuses on John Clark and Domingo Chavez, characters that Clancy fans have known for years (although one need not have any Clancy background in order to thoroughly understand and enjoy this book).Clark is the title character, commanding a top-secret international squad of special forces troops trained as counter-terrorists. Chavez, now 31 and married to Clark's very pregnant daughter, is the leader of one of the group's two tactical teams. Interestingly, the name &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; is absent from the pages, the now-President existing in this novel only as a nameless background player.The bad guys in this installment are extremely radical back-to-nature folks who are plotting to end most human life on the planet in order to save the planet. Clancy deftly describes this group's noble intentions doomed by their philosopical contradictions.Some may complain that there are relatively few new gadgets in this book, but this was actually a refreshing change. I am glad that Clancy is not turning his franchise into an American James Bond series, where the gadgetry is often more intersting than the characters and the drama.This book has my highest recommendation. The only problem with the book, in my opinion, may be blamed on the publisher rather than the author. Unfortunately, there was a high number of typographical errors; although I did not make an actual tally, I estimate there were approximately 15 such errors. The proofreaders were perhaps lazy, relying on a computer's spell checker rather than reading the text line-by-line. Every word in the book is a properly spelled word or name, but, for example, at least once the name &quot;Tim&quot; was printed as &quot;Tom,&quot; or the word &quot;tomb&quot; was printed as &quot;tome.&quot; I do not mean to pick nits, but when these examples show themselves they are disappointingly distracting.Do not let that trifling problem stop you from buying this book. It was an excellent read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have enjoyed most of Clancy's books, especially liking his characters Jack Ryan &amp; John Clark. Normally, I would give a Clancy novel 3 to 5 stars. This one, however, doesn't deserve that many.In order to showcase elite anti-terrorist training, he invents a bunch of eco-terrorists, modeled after the Red Brigades of decades past. Clancy uses this vehicle to preach the anti-environmentalist rhetoric that our current &quot;president&quot; espouses. While I have not come to expect a progressive, or even a &quot;Liberal&quot; viewpoint from Clancy, it surprises me that he stooped to illegitimate smear tactics. Had he bothered to do even a little bit of research, he would have found that eco-terrorism is a construct perpetrated only by those who wish to marginalize the environmentally concerned. Congratulations, Mr. Clancy, you have continued the smear campaign. Your Corporate Masters must be quite proud of you.The novel is too long--I got the impression he was getting paid by the word. The action scenes continue to be dramatic although formulaic. This will probably be the last Clancy book I read--he isn't producing anything really new, but I can return to Patriot Games, Hunt for Red October, and Without Remorse; although perhaps Mr. Bush will make Red Storm Rising relevant again.Three stars for story, none for character development, negative stars for becoming a propoganda instrument. If I could give fewer than one star, I would. Buy something else--you deserve value for your money.(If you have strong feelings about this review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to love Clancy but the man has become seriously addled and now only puts out formulaic trash. This book had a huge flaw than unbelievably got past all of the editors. Without giving too much away, the bad guys decide to release a deadly biological agent during the Summer Olympics in Sydney by releasing it in a special cooling system designed for the very hot weather in September. How could that moron not know that September is WINTER in Austrailia? It's COLD then. Super-brains that want to take over the world usually don't miss details like that. To slog through hundreds of pages to come to that glaring error was irritating to say the least. Clancy should retire before he embarrases himself any further."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The emotions I felt when I got to the last line of this book can only be summed up as follows: amazed, moved, and wanting more of John Clark and Ding Chavez. Ever since its release, this book has topped my personal charts as the greatest book I have ever read, without a doubt in my mind. Thank you, Mr. Clancy, for giving the world such a riveting and exciting adventure to embark upon, and such rich characters to guide us through it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"First, I enjoyed this novel. It's garden variety Tom Clancy, including stereotyped characters that are all Overachievers, Republican, hold at least a Master's Degree in Something, and are Paragons of Physical Fitness...the story development and pacing, again, are typical Clancy.All of that said...I wish one of his editors, preferably three or four novels back, would've had the temerity to say, \\"You know, Tom...that's the third time in as many sentences your character has clipped a pronoun or article in his speech...\\" Here's a typical exchange between two of his characters ( pick any one of his novels ):\\"Hey, Bud; how's it hanging?\\"\\"Good. You?\\"\\"Been worse. Getting reassigned in May.\\"\\"Going where?\\"\\"Pentagon. Driving a desk. Could be worse.\\"It would be so simple! Just insert the pronoun 'I' about one hundred times throughout the typical, thousand-plus page book, along with a few articles such as 'the'...I served in the U.S. Army for more than a few years, and can personally attest to very few guys who actually talk that way, and ZERO females. This may come across as cheap nit-picking to some avid fans, but it is my biggest pet peeve: after two or three pages of \\"sociology block\\" narrative, you long for that \\"oasis\\" of conversation, and when it finally shows up, it's invariably two \\"Ranger Ricks\\" waxing macho!I guess it struck me as a little ridiculous, too, when Clark's protege Ding Chavez, who early in this novel is depicted as running somewhere on the order of twenty miles a week is chided by his wife for eating a decadent breakfast of eggs, bacon and grits (!) Tom, you don't do women particularly well...especially one who's apparently oblivious to her husband's exercise routine. Stay away from domestic/bedroom scenes, just as Stephen King should stay away from UFOs and the military. That advice, while certainly unsolicited, is free, since you've apparently long since cowed your editors into submission.If the above criticisms don't get you wrapped around the axle, this one is a good read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a great book. Not only is it Tom Clancy's best work, it is the best book I've ever read. Its worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is no doubt Tom Clancy's worst book. I can't believe he didn't do his homework like in all his other books. And since when do Britons call each other &quot;chaps?&quot; My dad has been to England and said they always address each other as &quot;mates.&quot; I don't know about the plot either. It just sounds a bit silly. How can tree-huggers be so smart and yet so sloppy? The Russian ex-KGB man Popov seemed pretty slick and smart. He was the only convincing character in the book. Ding doesn't strike me as a military man. He seems totally in control on the battlefield and yet, acts like a gangster when interrogating an IRA suspect with a knife. Most of the characters seem so unreal, and since when do terror suspects crack in less than a second under interrogation? And the book is just not reality. In today's world, we can't get even France to stop arguing and look at the big picture. So how can there be a multinational coalition of SWAT people from countries like the US, France and Germany working together? Never going to happen, even if the world is coming to an end. And the ending was so silly and such a letdown. I've read books that ran at 400 pages several times. This is the first 400-page book I've read and felt bitterly disappointed with. Do not even think about reading it. Ironic that there is a huge coalition of military supermen against tree huggers and this book turns out to be a mere waste of paper and money. Try Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Very illustrative book. As usual the characters are very well described; The weaponry the team uses are adequate and modern; the tactics are accurate. The book doesn't leave any loose details. The story line is awesome.

Clancy waists lines and lines of the book in situations that are not necessary. At some point you feel like the book is a little bit too &quot;heavy&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is not one of Tom Clancy's better efforts. The reader is taken through an escalading series of contrived terrorist crises driven a most implausible antagonist. The book reads so much like a video game, that I was not the least bit surprised to see the video game on store shelves shortly thereafter. To me the book seems like an afterthought of the software development.My advice is buy the game (if that's your sort of thing) and skip to The Bear and the Dragon if you're a Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"well,i found some of the book insulting.like some of technical terms,or the many slurrs against european or irish people.and the the charaters arnt very developed,it is usually the same with most clancy books,but the pc game is enjoyable"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"To give this book any score that is not 5 is totally unjustified. I read this book from cover to cover and I was captivated from start to finish. The characters are well rounded and try to explain the &quot;superhuman&quot; like qualities of the Rainbow Men. Some reviews have talked about the lack of emotion show by the characters after the ambush but these men have been trained to keep back all emotion and get the job done. Maybe Tom Clancy wanted to perserve thier &quot;macho&quot; image for the readers. I can just hope that his next book will live up to the standards of This one. 5/5."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having worked in industry among real-life environmentalists, I would say there probably really are people as nutty, self righteous, dangerous AND well-connected as the sinister group described in TC's Rainbow Six. The antagonists' plot to wipe out all humans, except the environmental elite who &quot;get it&quot; (themselves) -- and thereby provide an opportunity to repopulate earth -- is plausible enough to make you worry at night. With its typical TC focus on techno-weapons, action, anti-terrorist military tactics and world-class danger, the book was as compelling as it was unique. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you haven't read any of Tom Clancy's books yet then this one will probaly draw you in and you will want to know what happens next.

The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. The length of the book is a mystery as any amateur editor would have cut 35 to 50 percent of it out and thrown it in the trash can. It seems like he took pieces from his previous books and tried to change the plot and characters to fit. Not one of seven writers who reviewed the book liked it. I read the first 100 reviews and realize some fans would like reading Tom's grocery list and would give it 5 stars. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also 'Cobra Event' is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and Blood Work by Connelly. There is a reason this book went from number 1 to the 60s in under three months."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is without a doubt the greatest action/thriller book that I have ever read. After reading &quot;Op-Center&quot; I really started liking Clancey, but after readin Rainbow Six I found out that Op-Center was nothing compared to it. People might say it's too long but every single part of the book matters because he's (Clancey) buliding up the plot with every word. A must read, especially if you got the game, if you dont go get because it's just as good."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"a reasonably written book, it certainly had me turning the pages. unfortunately, it closed off quite poorly.*slight spoiler*i just can't believe the ending - the &quot;bad guys&quot; (actually, i have far more sympathy for them than for the rainbow crew) just gave up. just like that. ten years, billions of dollars, and they just threw it all in the incinerator. no plan &quot;b&quot;. no recovery attempt. nothing.no - that is quite unrealistic..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was an immediate buy for me because of past Clancy novels which I really enjoyed. The first 200 or so pages were what I have come to expect and like about Clancy novels. Then it became subtly noticeable that the plot or really the build-up to action sequences was to become increasingly drawn-out. I began to lose interest, but regardless I kept picking up the book to finish it. The desciptions were true Clancy as was the interesting attention to detail. Bottom line - pretty good from an author who can produce pretty great!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For some reaon I feel compelled to add my voice to the resounding call of disappointment found in the preceding reviews. I have loved Clancy's work from the start. However, this lengthy novel seems contrived at best. I got the impression that Clancy has run out of new ideas (using biological warfare a second time in as many books) and character development. Given the choice, I'd rather re-read &quot;Wtihout Remorse&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a Clancy fan and impatiently await each novels arrival in the bookstore window. Rainbow Six was my first Clancy novel on CD. I have been so enthralled with the novel via this medium that I have missed my exit on the expressway twice this week. David Dukes commands each character with a unique voice and compelling individuality via use of accents and inflections. Listening to this book as given it a dimensionalilty I have never experienced before. It is filled with the rich detail I seek in a Clancy novel. No one else can narrate a bullets journey in slow motion from barrel to head piercing and make me savour every moment. I recommend the novel, but for those of you fans who have never listened to one, I recommend letting David Dukes be your first. I have actually begun to look forward and enjoy my commute to work!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I would have to give Clancy the thumbs-up on this one--even though I agree with several of the above reviewers in that there are several editorial errors, and many repetitions. Come on, though--why do we read rather than watch TV? In order to leave a bit to our imaginations. The theme presented in this novel is staggering, and presents anyone with a shred of imagination with a riveting read. On one hand, it is easy to commiserate with the tree-huggers who want to wipe out the entire human population and start from scratch (albeit I'm not a tree-hugger), but one must also side with Clark's Rainbow team in their endeavors to stop Brightling and his Horizon Corporation. In addition to all this, Clancy makes the bio-war hazard seem quite plausible. Again, thumbs-up, and it'll probably be even better once we get to the second and third printings, sans errors."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What has happened to the man who wrote &quot;Hunt For Red October&quot; and &quot;Red Storm Rising?&quot; This unbelievable plot about enviormentalists trying to rule the whole strain credulity. With all this militia stuff happenings all over how could Tom ever believe that anyone why find this story interesting. Unfortunately, this is the last Clancy book for me."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six, while it had a strong beginning, simply failed to carry through on its seeming promise of a well plotted story. As usual, Tom Clancy gives us a well crafted and intricate beginning, planting questions in our minds and setting the stage for what could be a truly exciting story. Instead, it turns into stagy, set-piece sequences that develop and unfold with a plodding similarity and degree of interchangabilty that leaves the reader cold.One of the biggest problems with this story is that when you establish a group of characters as being the best in the world at what they do, then there isn't going to be any situation that they get into that they won't be able to handle and then overcome. Also, aside from a few key individuals, you never get a feel for the rest of the Rainbow team as little more than interchangable, faceless good guys. It seems to me that writing about such a team needs to define any and all members who are in the story.Sadly, even the main good guy characters themselves are not that interesting. I found that I was more interested in the character development of Popov, the Russian in the employ of the antagonists, than with any of the real Protagonists.But I did give three stars, and that is because Tom Clancy, as always, writes great, heart-stopping action scenes, which lend themselves well to this story. I was just disappointed because this time the story in between wasn't as good as I have come to expect."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a fan of TC for several years. I thought the introduction of Clark as a main character was great. Clark is definitely not one of today's perfumed warriors. The reading was a bit slow but still kept me interested. The ending does show that even dark warriors have to obey some of the political correctness of todays modern world. If not all technically factual it does have plausibility and gives us something to think about. Looking forward to his next."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Reasonable first chapter, then an incredibly repetitive remainder, not least of all copying vast chunks of Executive Orders (also not one of his best !)High time he abandoned this cast of characters, and tried something new !"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Slogged through this one; too many hours of my life I'll never get back. I used to be a fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy does it again. If you have liked any of his other books, then you must read this book. Rainbow Six was a great book which I could not put down. Read it!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy, but Mr. Clancy...This book definitely lacks the all around quality of his other works. Although it weaves an interesting yarn that takes unexpected turns and beckons the reader to read more, I couldn't help but to notice the lack of refinement that I expect out of a Clancy novel. The dialogue was poorly written, the first half was far too predictable, the characters desperately flat. The use of stereotypes was greatly disturbing and he aught to have paid more attention to making the book a well refined piece of writing.Moreover, as a student of the German language I couldn't help but to notice the many mistakes in Clancy's use of German. To me that definitely detracted from the effectiveness of the story. At least he could have looked up his words in an English-German/German-English dictionary to make sure the German words are spelled correctly! I had counted over 14 seperate errors by the time I was on chapter 10, my conclusion can only be that he failed to proof-read his writing. My recommendation is that Mr. Clancy gets off his high horse and starts to write quality books instead of useless garbage.In conclusion, this book is worth little more than the paper its written on."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also The Notebook is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and Blood Work by Connelly. There is a reason this book went from number 1 to the 40s on the NYT Best Seller list in under two months."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book read like a John Grisham movie...same plot. The book's was a combination of &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders.&quot; Eg. A nuclear device at the super bowl...and a chemical weapon device at the Olympics. A plague that gets spread across the U.S., ...and a disease that will spread across the world. How boring the second time around. 1 bad book out of 10, he still has an &quot;A&quot; average..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was exciting. Straight from the begining to the end. I never wanted to put it down. I cant wait for the next Clancy book. The book really made me think about how much governments accually hide from their people. It's a discrace to the american people to not know what projects the government is doing. Not only is it the american government, but all governments all over the world. If the people of this great land cant trust their own government than who can we trust."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has pulled off another great book. But not as good as Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October. This is because usually an author can only make only one or two exceptional books. There are exceptions and to date Clancy is not one of them. Yet this book was a good read that was a little long but hey, a few all nighters never hurt anyone. In all it is a great book with a good plot, detail and charecter development."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What happened with my favorite american writer. I like the idea about Clark building this team of black-ops soldiers and the first couple of stunts they pull are thrilling reading, with lots of information about antiterror hard-ware and tactics. Then something goes wrong. Too fast we are told who the bad guys are and what they are planning. Too fast and too easy they are destroyed in the jungles of Brazil. It could look like the author has run out of ideas and then decides to recycle the Ebola-plot. But I do sincerely hope that is not true. If it is, mr. C should take a break from the techno-thrillers. And could somebody please tell me what happened to Jack Ryan, or is it not allowed to speak out his name in public anymore? N.B At least it made a great computergame!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six stands apart from most of Clancy's works in that you get action up front instead of waiting the usual 200 pages of character and situation development. Seeing Clark and Chavez grow and mature, exploring possibilities which are tenable for the future, create an absorbing story. I enjoyed it greatly, and look forward to Clancy's next work."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Though I very much admired his earlier books, I'm afraid this last book in the Ryan / Clark series is rather the result of a money-driven writer and dito publisher than the product of an inspired artist.The scenario is very unrealistic; in fact it seems that Clancy must have had some trouble finding a new &quot;enemy&quot;, deadlier and more dangerous than in every previous book.Let's hope Clancy will be able to regain the original quality level of his earlier books; if not, he'd better stop the Ryan/Clark series."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read them all, and in order, I've always bought the Hardbacks. However, the quality of the stories and the writing has been deteriorating. Tom, it's not quantity (op center series that you didn't write, I hope) its quality!!! R-6 so far has just barely kept my interest, but because I'm a big fan I will read the rest and post a more complete review. Until then Take your time, stories about simple yet interesting plots and simple people can be just as captivating as crashing a 747 into the state of the union speech, or some billionaire trying to wipe out the world."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"From what I've seen, this hasn't gotten the best of reviews in some places. Why a lot of people didn't like it is obvious to me: Clancy deals with very complex issues and writes very complex books. Many people don't like complex because they think it's confusing. But if that is the case, don't knock it. This is the best book of the year."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book could have benefitted from some serious editing. The repetitive passages of environmental talk really got boring. Some exciting action made it worth the time to read, but I found the ending very unsatisfying with many loose ends not properly resolved. Tom needs a really tough editor!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Wait for the paperback folks. The Clancy well is going dry. Old Tom should read other works like Lady President, Blind Mans Bluff or Fortunes or War."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST OF FAST PACE READING. CLANCY HAS BEEN ABLE TO WRITE A BOOK THAT IS HARD TO PUT DOWN AND IS GOOD ON FACTUAL INFORMATION. THIS IS A 5 STAR BOOK IF I HAVE EVER SEEN ONE."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book should not be read unless you have read ALL of the others first(not includining OP CENTER). Failure to take this advise will cause you to miss out on some truly fantastic writing. This book should only be used for kindling to start a fire, it is truly horrible! The story line begins slow, as with most Tom Clancy. The characters are well known to those who have read the other books, so interest is kept in this regard. The story never gains momentum to keep the reader interested, it is truly an effort to finish. In my humble opinion the climax of the story is about 2/3 of the way into the book. The ending is totally unexciting. Where is Jack Ryan?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While John Clark and Ding Chavez are two of my favorite charactors in the Clancy stable, the story of Rainbow Six was among the slowest, most laborious books I have ever read. I have read all of Clancy's novels (including the Ops Center series) and concluded that this story was more a rip off of the Ebola-scare plot in Executive Orders than the fresh storyline each of his other novels have been. Even the sequel nature of Debt of Honor/Executive Orders was fresher and more interesting than Rainbow Six. I have normally finished each of his other novels in one or two weeks because the stories grab you and you can't put the book down. I took me months to finish this one. The only reason I did finish the book was out of loyalty to Clancy.I will buy and read his next one, but I hope it's much better!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read six or seven Tom Clancy novels, and this was by far the worst of the lot. I could barely finish it, and when I had, I donated my copy of the book to my local library. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" was great - moderately plausible plot, interesting characters, shades between good and evil, enough technical detail to keep one's interest. This book had a totally implausible plot, a collection of cardboard characters (GOOD/BAD), an absurd ending filled with shooting fish in a barrel... It is hard to imagine that this would have been published if it had been written by an unknown author. Very disappointing!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels and have enjoyed most of them. This book features a completely illogical plat - poor character definition - inane dialoque. If this had been Clancy's first novel - he would not have had a second - don't waste your time or the money."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As much as I have been a Tom Clancy fan over the past 10-plus years (I've read every one of his books at least twice, and my personal favorites of his are &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, and &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;), this was probably not his best novel. That's not to say it wasn't good: it was definitely vintage Clancy, but not with as much depth as we're used to.One problem I had with it is that he neither portrayed Peter Covington's team as much as Ding's, nor did he develop Peter's character effectively enough. Yes, we know who Peter Covington is, but we know very little about him. I understand that this was a story centered around Ding and Mr. C, but we could have (and should have) seen more development both of Peter and of his other team characters.On the other hand, however, the premise for the story, I thought, was frightening, to say the least. In describing the virus the way he did, how it was developed, the delivery system, etc., he turned that part of the story up quite effectively, in my opinion. I was impressed by that aspect of the novel, and it had me on the edge of my seat. The only thing that I would probably take issue with was that he portrayed the people involved with this (the Brightling's, Popov, et al.) as one-dimensional characters; not enough development there, either. I suppose he'll just have to work on that next time around.Despite the flaws, I found it overall to be a solid Clancy novel and I would still recommend it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"He believes we will buy any schlock with his name on it.Unfortunately, it appears true. But not for me anymore.I have a very short list of authors who I will buy in hardback, rather than wait the usual year for the paperback. Clancy has been dropped from his list as of Rainbow Six. I should have dropped him as a result of the Operations Center series. A friend of mine, a retired Marine officer, and myself made a list of factual errors (we stopped at six pages adn they were easy-to-find and correct for the most part)from that novel and concluded that either Clancy didn't do his research or simply allowed his name to be put on the book for money. I don't think he ever read at least the first two books; he just sold his name to make a buck.Reading an interview with him on the Internet several months prior to the publication of Rainbow Six, it seemed evident that the book's draft was being provided to the publishers with way too little time to do a decent edit. He even seemed to take some delight in this fact. It also seemed that the book title should paraphrase the title of an album put out some time ago by a rock band: &quot;The Contracturally Required Album.&quot; This looks like &quot;The Contracturally Required Book.&quot;His right-wing rant is revved up full speed in this one as his hit list turns from political terrorists into environmental extremists, so-called &quot;tree huggers.&quot; Whatsamatter, Tom? Did someone stop your from building a heli-pad at your Maryland redoubt?Clancy needs a strong editor big time. His books are becoming increasing turgid and even boring in places. Lack of precision, repetitive phrases and situations, and lack of cohesion abound. Rainbow Six (and Debt of Honor) were about 300 pages too long.IMHO, Clancy has made his big bucks and is now taking us, the readers, for granted. While his narrative skills still exist, as shown by many good pieces in even these books, he's riding his ego hard in not letting an editor make it a good read all the way through.BTW: did anyone else notice that Jack Ryan is (apparently) not mentioned by name anywhere in Rainbow Six? he is always &quot;the President.&quot; understand his soon to be ex-wife is asking for a share of the &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; intellectual property rights as part of her divorce settlement. This is the same ploy the USNI attempted to use when Clancy took his books to another publisher. They lost; will his wife?Want a consistently good read with a huge backlist? Go over to W.E.B. Griffin."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having followed Clancy through every single book published, I'd have to say that Rainbow Six is definitely not on par with the top three: Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising and Executive Orders. Talked to several people who thought it was too long, but R6 doesn't even compare to RSR and EO.Predictable in many places. Still has the Techno down to a &quot;T&quot;. Overall a decent read. Definitely not his best effort. I'd recommend to Mr. Clancy to quit with the small stuff and do the extra work and spend more time and effort to create the classics of before."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book was a bit long, and could have been edited by a couple of hundred pages. It was, though, very entertaining and a great story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was clearly Clancy's most dissapointing. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it gave me something to do on two plane rides. I was initially excited because it was focused on Clark and Ding (Without Remorse was one of my favorite Clancy's Books). I agree whole heartedly with some of the other reviewers, the plot development and resolution left me wondering if Clancy actually wrote this one. Definitely not one of his best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't believe Tom Clancy wrote this. I've read two of his books, and each page of each one taught me something. The only factoid that I learned in this book was that people with licenses to carry guns on airplanes have to meet each other and the pilot before getting on board. Tom probably gave that factoid to his ghostwriter on this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have mixed feelings about this latest monolith put out by Tom Clancy. I liked the ideal of a NATO based anti-terror team. It made sense because terror will most likely be the biggest threat now that the Soviet Union is no longer. I also agree with most of the others that the Rainbow team did seem a bit invincible and too movie-starish for my liking. Onther thing I had trouble with was Horizon. Who could actually believe that a group that big would be willing to do what they were planning? Come on. It's just a little rediculous, and unfortunatly it just happened to be the main plot of the story. Oh well, better luck next time, eh?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Definitely not Clancy's best effort. I've read all of his books to date. How many times does he need to describe the &quot;tree huggers&quot; warped sense of right and wrong? How many head shots need to be described in technicolor detail? How many times does Popov need to ask what's going on? This book could have been done in 40% less pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I couldn't wait for this book as I love Clancy. But I have to say, this is THE single most disappointing book I've read with the possible exception of Lost World. I rank it last of all Clancy's novels. The sad thing is that it focuses on my two favorite Clancy characters, John Clark and Ding Chavez. But this book doesn't &quot;grow&quot; them as characters in my mind. The action sequences don't integrate into the total plot as they have done in Clancy's other efforts - in Rainbow, we have a lot of shoot-em-up action simply for action's sake. When I want action for action's sake, I'll get it from a book that has fewer than 700 pages! Sorry, Tom - I own all your other books in hardback and have re-read each of them at least 3 times - I'll never read Rainbow again. If you're not a die-hard Clancy fan, don't bother with this one (and even die-hards won't get much entertainment our of it). Instead, pick up Stephen Hunter's Bob the Nailer series - Point of Impact, Black Light, and the new hardback Time To Hunt."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has hit a new low. I would have given this book no stars if I was allowed to. Good seemed to overcome evil all to easily in this weak plot. The book became boring at about the second sentence. Sorry, but it appears that Tom Clancy has used up all the orginal material he once had and is now producing mass print like this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I must say, Tom Clancy has gone from story writing to preaching from the pulpit in the last two books. His first books gave the reader plot twists which were unexpected. Now, we have a storyline about Ebola and terrorists reused from Executive Orders and Sum of All Fears. In Executive Orders, Mr Clancy preached his political-economic views. In Rainbow Six, Mr Clancy is pounding us with his anti-environmentalist attitudes. I am not an envrionmentalist, but he exudes such an attitude towards them that a naif would come away from the book thinking that environmentalists were all nazis worthy of the worst form of death.However, all this asside, I must still give the book four stars because frankly, I couldn't put it down...I just had to skip the political diatribe, which, if edited out, would have brought the book down to a trim 300 pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love Clancy, an Irishman after my own heart. This book took me months (plus reading other books in between) to finish simply because I felt like I was slogging through the first two thirds of it. But it was worth it! What happens in the very end to the eco-terrorists makes it all worthwhile. It had an ending I didn't expect, and frankly, a plot I had never considered. All in all, it was quite entertaining. Clancy is a master!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I enjoyed reading this one, I did have some problems with this book. First, Clancey goes way out of his way to avoid bringing Jack Ryan (clearly still the President of the U. S. in his fictional world) into the novel. Why? Second, I agree that Clark, who is a character I enjoy (?Without Remorse? was a great character study) seemed boring in this one. Third, the whole plot relating to the virus is a retread of the virus plot from the last novel, with meglomaniacal overtones. Finally, I wish Clancey would avoid having his characters say and think things like ?is this some kind of movie plot I am living through??, because it was pretty obvious that this one was written with a movie deal in mind to me, a trap that Michael Crichton falls into often as well. In any event, I enjoyed the book but hope that before the next outing Clancey goes back and reads his own ?Hunt for Red October? and maybe remembers what it was like to write without worrys about a later movie! deal."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy is right on the mark with his depiction of the risk of biological warfare. Although delivery systems remain problematic, and virilance of the organisms have not proved consistant, it is only a matter of time before we will experience a biological attack. This was a wonderful story. It was technologically accurate, spell binding with its story line. If only we would get the national will to actually have the protagonists go out and kick some butt as the story line suggests!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has done it again. Since Jack Ryan has reached what could only be the pinnacle of his career, Clancy lets us take another peek at his friends and assocaites from past novels. Once again, it's a story you can't put down. True to form, you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Sort of, but not really, a follow up to Executive Orders as Ryan's name is never mentioned. Current time frame w/John Clark's new multinational anti-terror squad. Don't confuse this w/the Op-Center series--this is Clancy at his best. Seven hundred forty pages of &quot;what comes next?&quot; intrigue. Must read for any Clancy fan!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm only on page 275, but as usual, this book has me hooked. I can barely close it and go to sleep! I am, however, very surprised by the amount of errors in it. What gives with the editor? The story is still great, so far. Clancy has not lost his touch."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy is perhaps best known for his ability to tell stories that his readers cannot tear themselves away from. Rainbow Six is no different, however, the end seemed a little lacking and anti-climactic. While the super-terrorists recieve a very &quot;Clark-ish&quot; demise (as expected), the immediate events leading up to that do not challenge the Rainbow team or the reader.My advice would be to finish the book, and then re-read the amusement park chapters, or those set in Austria for a good final kick."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy has bored the world in his recent novels (in which it takes about a thousand pages for nothing to happen.) Finally, he has written a book where something happens, it starts happening at the beggining, and it is truly engaging. Plus a hell of a lot of action. His characters are less than two-dimensional , but who cares? This is a techno-thriller, not Wuthering Heights. Mr. Clancy, it's good to have you back."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom lets a little more than usual of his political views dominate the tone of this book, in which Mr. Clark leads a multi-national (ergo the code name &quot;Rainbow&quot;) anti-terrorist squad who are dispatched to a rash of incidents.Tom does his usual fine job of entertainingly detailing the technical aspects without becoming pedantic, and the plot is well-woven as it spans continents, governments, ideologies, and big business.Maybe Tom was worried that we might feel some sympathy for the main villains in this novel, because he goes overboard to paint them and their cause so one-dimensionally.Likewise, the Rainbow team seems to contain straight-shooting John Wayne clones who know no doubt or fear. Perhaps to combat this stereotype, Tom goes out of his (and the plot's) way to detail the rich educational background of several of the soldiers.I was never concerned for the good guys' safety, or worried that a bad guy would get away with anything.Without re! vealing any details of the plot, I think that it hinged on some pretty unlikely situations. Good fiction doesn't ask for too much suspension of disbelief, and in the past, Tom has required almost none from his readers. Now, it seems he is starting to write for ditto-heads who'll swallow anything on the way to the shoot-out scene where Gun Control (i.e., Hitting Your Target) is practiced.I have to fault Putnam and Sons for the sloppy proofing done on the copy. Some embarrassing typos stick out, and Tom is guilty of overused similes that also distract the reader.Loyal TC fans (I'm one) will enjoy Rainbow Six nonetheless (I did), but if they are like me, they will derive more enjoyment by re-reading his other works and begin counting the days until his next offering."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy takes an interesting new approach in Rainbow Six by having his main characters Clark and Chavez leading a sanctioned counter-terrorist agency. This, I think, is a pretty clever way for Clancy to differentiate the settings, showcase his knowledge of international terrorism, and write what he's best at: action sequences from several points of view. The idea of biological based terrorism, while not new, appears here with a few different twists than, say, in the work of Robin Cook or Michael Crichton. The Shiva folks are almost humorous in their pathetic excuses for genocide. The overarching plot has a lot of appeal, and for anyone who is into Clancy, this will probably be good fun.However, I'm bothered by two aspects of characterization. The first is with John Clark himself. Part of what made him *so* interesting, especially compared to the eternal Boy Scout Jack Ryan, is that Clark is a study in contrasts and shades of gray. Back in Without Remorse, what made hi! m so memorable was the fact that he was doing terrible things (for pretty good reasons) and that he *struggled* with his conscience. He was all too human, and he appealed to me. Now, poor John's getting to be pretty black and white. I can understand this on one level: he's older and has different responsibilities, for starters. But if this is the case, I think the development should have been more gradual. Scanning back over some other books feeaturing Clark, I don't really see this happening. Yet suddenly in Rainbow Six, he's rather dull, much to my disappointment.The other problem of characterization is with women characters. When is Clancy going to start creating some females who are different than his basic two archetypes, the Superwoman who can bear young, stitch eyeballs and yank out bullets, cook perfect potroast, and be demure or strong depending on what the man needs; and the Real Stinker, whose goals include cruelly using uninformed and helpless human test subject! s and manipulating anyone and everyone with her devious min! d and lucious body? Sure, there are some precious past exceptions, but I was truly disappointed not to see any change in the way Clancy writes women. Having children is certainly an admirable goal, but Clancy needs to realize it isn't the #1 desire of all women, whether they have alphabet soup after their names or not. One last nitpick, and this could be an editing error: see p. 584, line 15: meat from the offspring of a buffalo and a bovine is commonly known as &quot;beefalo.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has moved from an adventure novelist to a right-wing loonie standing on soapbox spouting his views. His book lampoons the Constitution, the environmental movement, individual rights, the press, non-smokers and gun laws. In between shot outs, he tries to rewrite history and show off his &quot;technical knowledge&quot;. I wish he would have left his political agenda at home and gotten an editor, who would have trimmed the book by a couple hundred pages."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you liked this book as much as i did you should buy the Rainbow Six computer game too!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have psychic powers. I predict this thrilling new novel by Tom Clancy will be a bestseller. It will feature international intrigue as well a display that unique Clancy knowledge of modern warfare and espionage."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"OK, so I haven't read all the nearly 1000 reviews, but in the first 100 or so, I saw nothing about this, so I'll make my point. So, there's a big international conspiracy involving bio-war with several key incidents around the world connected to a horrific genocidal plan aimed at drastically (perhaps cataclysmically?) re-ordering world power, and all of it is stopped at the last minute by a series of heroic actions by the stars of the story. Along the way, there is maybe a cheap shot attack on the hero's wife and children, and even a top level traitor inside the White House. Have we seen a plot like this anywhere before?I was anxious to read this book after Debt of Honor and Executive Orders, but was disappointed to find that the above plot line fits both Executive Orders and Rainbow Six almost perfectly. The similarities between the books could be even greater, though since it has been over two years since I read EO, I can't point out more. While I realize that sometimes it is necessary for an author to re-use a plot device, I didn't expect such a fullscale copycat job from Clancy. I only gave the book 2 stars because of the way Clancy can tell a story, but I'll be very disappointed if the next book is the same as the last two."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy fans should enjoy this counter-terrorism novel that's inspired a line of video games. And the doomsday scenario that's the heart of the book is interesting and exciting (until the very end). Some problems:1) The terrorists are aggressively stupid. I could take down most of Rainbow Six's bad guys with a pop gun and a half-empty packet of Kool-Aid. The supposedly brilliant villains are hired by a former KGB agent. The villians then proceed to a) Lock themselves in a building, b) leave all doors and entrances unbarred, c) walk out of the buildings expecting transportation waiting for them and d) get gunned down. You would have expected the Russian to pull one of his hires aside and say, \\"We might need to change our thinking -- locking ourselves in the bathroom hasn't sparked the revolution.\\"2) The characters (save for Popov) are thin, and often serve as mouthpieces for Clancy's views on the media, the environment, military life, and the government. The main villains, in particular, talk at academic-paper length. I thought a Brookings seminar would erupt during a few battles.3) The ending is lame. Clancy's strength has always been his action sequences, and the battles, even noting the stupidity of the terrorists, are exciting. The doomsday scenario is great, if implausible and dependent on things working perfectly at one location in the entire world (The stock market must have affected EvilCo's travel budget). But Clancy's heroes save the world in 100 pages of the worst payoff in his career. I won't spoil the ending, but it's hard to spoil a climax that doesn't come off.Still, if you can tune out Clancy's editorializing, and accept the stupidity of the terrorists, Rainbow Six chugs along at a decent pace. It will help you pass time in the airport, at least."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It seems Clancy is getting into his slump period, unless this book is written by his ghost writters. Clancy has written theose wonderful stories in his earlier books like &quot;red storm rising&quot;, &quot;cardinal of ....&quot; and etc... This &quot;Rainbow 6&quot; makes Clancy fan ,like myself, wonder if this is the time to wander away from his new writings.This book is like a Elton John's &quot;Blue Moves&quot; album.Ater those series of shining brilliant works, this book was giving signals that the talent of the writter is finally start showing the sign of waning. My hunger and thirst to Clancuy's new books is drying up as well. Unlike before, unfortunatly, the time has come that grabing his new books without consideration could be a total dissapointment. I hope this is just a temporaly set back, and expect his come back with books with edges."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If Clancy had cut about 300 pages of repetitious internal monologues it might have been at least readable. He didn't. Clancy thinks quantity makes a good book. He proves that wrong. The plot was unbeliveable. The characters flat and poorly motivated. Clancy is obviously not a student of human nature--not even to the extent of creating believable villans. The premises in the book are completely implausible. Thousands of people banding together to kill off humankind--with almost perfect security? Right. He doesn't even bother to check the tempertures in Sidney in July. It's winter there, John. It's cold. It's not 97 degrees F. He proves that all it takes is a big name to sell a book. I'll never buy another one of Clancy's peices of trash. I've been burned once. I won't be a fool and be burned again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"First let me tell you that I've always been a Clancy fan and have read most of his books. From &quot;Red Dawn&quot; to &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; I always enjoyed his attention to technical detail.I'm sorry to say that this book has none of that. It's as if a different person wrote it. The characters are shallow, boring and not very believable. The story line is almost a repetition of his prior work. I found myself skipping through pages in order to make it to the excruciating end.This is the last Clancy book I'll read. I consider my money wasted."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I own, and have read, every Clancy novel; with the exception of possibly &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, this is his worst. I didn't mind the length so much, as I like to &quot;savor&quot; my Clancy novels, but there wasn't anything in the story that gripped me and kept me up reading at nights. The ending happened too fast and was wrapped up a little too neatly. I agree with other reviews who compared this novel to a comic book where the good guys can do nothing wrong and the bad guys are all inept. The good guys in this book never miss their target (unless it's intentional); and the bad guys, who are suppose to be smart enough to plot the destruction of mankind, don't have any backup plans and can't seem to keep their mouths shut. It's a little far-fetched. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was too much like the Op Center books, which were awful. (I realize Clancy didn't actually write those books, but his name is still on them.) I look forward to the return of Jack Ryan ... or perhaps to the creation of another major character for Clancy to center a book around. I will still buy the next Clancy novel, but this book was strike two -- one more and I will spend my money on a different author.And as far as the criticisms of Clancy's &quot;right-wing&quot; leanings, frankly, I find it refreshing to read a conservative author. Most other novels I read tend to portray conservatives as evil, greedy, uncaring, people who only look out for themselves. Whereas, liberals are shown as caring, compassionate, defenders of truth. It's nice to read a Clancy novel where conservatives aren't the villans and aren't bashed on every other page."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a fan of Clancy's early efforts but stopped reading after the Debt of Honor fiasco. I sympathize with the author in that the end of the cold war has led to a dearth of good material. However, Clancy doesn't need my sympathy in that plenty of people who read Red October and loved it, keep buying these stupid books (like me). Put it this way, when you start to suspect that this is going to be the worst novel you have ever read, stop reading. You'll be doing yourself a favor because I can promise you that your suspicions are correct."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was a very exciting Tom Clancy Novel. A great book about counter-terrorism. It was nice to have a break from Jack Ryan, whom I do love, and focus on Mr. Clark and company. Its a long book, but it reads fast. A good read indeed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an old fan of Clancy's I was eager to read his latest. I found however that the book, while riviting and absorbing in places, become long-winded and drawn out, causing me to actually put the book down, and come back to it about 2 months later. What really got me is how easily the whole plan to spread the virus was foiled. One would expect some dramatics; guns firing, the canaster being dropped and nearly being broken or anything along those lines, but no....it was more like,Ding : &quot;Hey you with the Virus canaster, hand it over.&quot; ; Bad Guy : &quot;Um...ok...here.&quot;I mean the story was like a train hitting a mountain and stopping dead.I wouldn't recommend this book, save your money. You'll read it and realise that the last 400 or so boring pages could be summed up into about 50."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been an avid Tom Clancy fan for years now, ever since reading Red October; my personally library contains all of his books, and in all the time I've read his work, I've never been disappointed. Until now.Sorry folks, some of you may disagree, but Rainbow Six is not even close to being up to par with any of Mr. Clancy's previous works. I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I'd venture to say that this book was simply shoved out the door in an effort to create, and take advantage of, the publicity surrounding the release of the software game of the same name.Let me point out that I have -never- been disappointed by a Clancy novel before. Even the germ warfare plot of Executive Orders, while already overdone in the media, was handled well enough that I thoroughly enjoyed that book. Rainbow Six comes across as so weak that I have serious reservations about whether Clancy actually wrote this book himself. (No offense, Mr. Clancy, but honestly it just isn't up to your normally high standards.) This is the first time I've ever read a Clancy book, then wanted to get my money back. Here's hoping the next title will be back on track."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The first half of this novel will not disappoint fans of Mr Clancy's previous thrillers. The prose is tightly written (as usual) and the plot intriguing. As expected after Executive Orders, Jack Ryan has reached his \`use-by' date. He's the President. He's saved the world from devastation (nuclear, biological and financial). Tom can't really wring much more out of the character because he's already \`been-there done-that' -and come out the other side, still the cool, smart, moral man's man. He's got nowhere left to go, except to fade into obscure statesmanhood. So the main characters in this novel are John Clark and Ding Chavez. For that reason, I approached this novel with caution, wondering if they were really broad enough to bear the weight of the book on their own. They are.It is not the characterization, or action that kills this novel. It is not the controversial plotline of environmentalists so radical as to threaten the survival of the human race. I've read far more bizarre things than this, and still been happy to go along for the ride.The problem here was research, or perhaps a lack of it. It stopped the novel dead, particularly when the action moved to Sydney for the Olympics. The Australian setting could have been any large city in any English-speaking country. The only reason we knew it was Sydney was because Tom told us. (I've got a vague memory that he even refers to Melbourne instead earlier in the book) The one or two small details he drops into the story, like the road the Rainbow team takes from the airport, are incorrect. The Olympic site could have been nearly any large sporting arena, but not the real one at Homebush bay. The few Australians we meet are washed-out photocopies of British army officers, with dialog to match I've heard of Australians calling men \`blokes', and \`guys', but never \`chaps'! Similar errors of detail occur earlier in the book, with mistakes on the location of Hereford, and the speed limit in the UK.These are not major criticisms of the novel, whose prime focus centers on John Clark and his Rainbow organization, but whenever I read a Clancy novel now, even when I re-read the earlier ones, I will be wondering just how much is well researched, and just which details he couldn't be bothered to find out, so made up instead..It's hard to believe that a writer of Mr Clancy's obvious experience and talent, would let such a poorly researched book loose in a genre so preoccupied with detail."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Tom Clancy's fiction so far and have been rarely dissappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed this entry as well, although it seems to be written at a level one notch below his usual standards. There is lots of action and lots of insights into the world of anti-terrorism but I felt one element was missing. I never found myself fearful of danger. All of the Rainbow organization are supermen with little chance of being bested. You knew they were going to win out every time; the interest was in how they would accomplish each mission. The only time I was concerned for the safety of the characters was when a different group of guys was brought into the main action. I expected some to die there, and they did. It was like watching one of the original Star Trek TV shows where the one guy you've never seen before that beams down to to the planet was the guy you knew was going to get eaten by the slime monster. I expect a lot from Clancy so I am being very critical here. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was an easy read, despite the number of pages, and the whole thing flowed together nicely. Read it for the action, read it for the familiar characters, read it for the &quot;Good guys win&quot; feeling, but just read it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a great book. From the opening hostage situation with the Spanish Ambassador's wife on the 767, to the whole great plot to kill everyone in the world, Clancy clearly knows how to write a great thriller. It was a great idea of his to write another book with John Clark, and it was good that he brought back Oso Vega and Domingo Chavez to work together. Between the bank robbery, the rollerpark incident, and the Brazil invasion, Clancy has written a masterpart."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was outstanding! I loved every single page of this incredible story. I read this book the summer it came out during that time the embassies in Africa were bombed, Rainbow was looking very good about then. This book has one of the best storylines i have ever seen! It makes you think if we really have a group like this out there i think it would be a good idea. They aree probably operating right now......and we would never know. If one of them is reading this keep up the good work....."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was absolutely amazing! I cant believe that some of you people thought it was too long, or that the ending was too rushed. This book combined everything from terrorist standoffs to a fatal viral disease. Trust me, read this book, you wont be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is the best. I've never read a better action book in my life. I play the game Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and the game really helps me imagine myself in the book. I reccomend this book to anyone that enjoys terrorist and mystery books. I expect Clancy to make a movie out of this book because it is so good. I've read it about 4 times and I haven't gotten sick of it yet. I have bought this book for many people and they loved it just as much as I do. BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED IF YOU DON'T!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I like Tom Clancy Novels. I like the detailed military and operational information. I think he comes up with intriguingly possible plots. Rainbow Six, unfortunately, has neither of these traits. The major plot is that this eco-maniacal corporation plans to purge the world of the human race using an ebola variant. WIthout going into too much detail their delivery mechanism is totally unrealistic. As if the USAMRID and the CDC could not recognize an engineered virus, and wouldn't be a bit suspicious if a biotech company just happened to have a mass quantity of the vaccine needed to combat it? Well the virus never gets loose thanks to our hero, the domesticated new Daddy Ding Chavez who Clancy has developed into a totally uninteresting vanilla since Clear and Present Danger, shows up and arrests the viral delivery man in an anti-climatic showdown. It would have been much more interesting novel if the virus had gotten loose. The whole novel build towards the release of the super virus and then ... Ding arrests the delivery man. How exciting.The military tech in this book is light weight compared to Clancy's other books. I came away from Red October knowing alot about nuclear subs. The coolest gadget in this book is encrypted multi -channel radios for spec ops. WooHoo!Anyway it was a miracle i finished this book. I kept thinking &quot;Its gotta get good sometime&quot;. It didn't."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Unfortunately I am one of those people who crave the release of a new Tom Clancy novel, however, being so few and far between, I have found myself passing time reading non-fiction books and research on specialized warfare. It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research. He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism. His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book starts by introducing John Clark who has left the CIA to create an England-based organization code-named &quot;Rainbow.&quot; Its mission: establish an elite squad of American operatives combined with handpicked British, French, and German agents to fight terrorism whenever it is required. Rainbow's emergence could not be more timely: in quick succession, the force solves three attempted terrorist problem such as an alleged bank robbery in Switzerland or an attack on a theme park in Spain. But Clark becomes suspicious when Russian agents suddenly show interest in Rainbow's work. Later on in the book these Russians become more and more important as, in a narrative that simultaneously traces the Rainbow team, a former KGB agent named Popov is introduced. Following these two places of action the reader gets small pieces of information of a great puzzle that finally is revealed as a great conspiracy concerning the Australian Olympic security team and a strange group of American scientists. Bit by bit Tom Clancy is able to reveal artfully the mystery of &quot;Shiva&quot; [...]The Rainbow Six-novel satisfies all the levels that Clancy like (A very famous book of this author is also \\"Hunt for Red October\\"). In the thrilling action of the book the Rainbow soldiers, from Navy troops to German fighters, are created to impress the reader by describing their physical and mental power such as \\"typical heroes\\". The book is infatuated with the latest developments and inventions in the technical sector. Therefore there are plenty of words to describe e.g. the operation instructions given to the Rainbow-Team besides the detailed descriptions of the weapons used. Clancy fans are used to this fact and are not annoyed by the unknown words that hardly anybody could know all at once - except a real soldier in the US-Army or the author himself who is visible in typical military clothing on the back cover of the book (At least when you study the \\"Berkley international edition / May 1999\\"). But besides this stereotype of hero-novels there's a fact that evoked deeper thoughts in me because of the postulate that humanity should be punished for their rape of nature although it can be a reason to destroy mankind. In my opinion this novel is a very good piece of literature and I am convinced that also many people who have never read a book of this author will agree to me after studying it. In retrospect the book has been very successful until nowadays because there's also a PC-Game in which you can become a member of the elite-force and lots of famous magazines and newspapers praise \\"Rainbow Six\\" e.g. the Dallas Morning news writes \\"When the door blows and the shooting starts, nobody does it better\\".Johannes Wei&szlig;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just have to say this: If you like realistic action, and not a lot of pages that go off into irrelevant detail, GET THIS BOOK. It is my all time favorite book, a must-read, and an awesome plot. Get it and have fun!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six had me captured in it from the first few pages. Tom Clancy has written what I feel to be one of the best novels I have ever read. I thought his use other cultures and psycology were brilliant, never have a read a novel that uses so much detail without losing the interest of the reader. It is easy to be immersed in the character's emotions, for example Chavez's long wait before rainbow's first mission. I could identify with most of the characters (probably Weber the most). I highly recommend anyone reading this to purchase this novel, you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I had only read one other book by Clancy (SSN), when I decided to pick this one up. I expected something action-packed, but what action there was, was dull and repetitive. It's the same &quot;aamericans are better than everyone else in the world&quot; plot, and it seemed that the terrorists never really stood a chance during any of their missions. This book also should be clipped down to about 500 pages, and it probably would be much more effective."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Ever since I was little, I've had to be completely swept away by a book. If it didn't manage to grab my attention within the first few chapters, I am sad to admit, that I couldn't force myself to finish the book. This was part of the reason I loved books that had multiple sub-plots. In Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy does an excellent job of keeping my attention while developing the characters with each mission. The problem comes when Clancy tries to tie everything together. Although the sub-plots are marvelous, this novel lacks substance and believability when it comes to the major plot.Through the minor plots, Clancy displays his knack for story telling and development. As with his previous novels, Clancy writes in a way in which the reader feels like they actually know the characters and can sense their emotions. By the end of the book, these fictional characters are like close friends or confidants. This leads me to my first problem with this book. Just when readers know the good guys, they are ambushed and several of them die. This is fine in the development of the plot, but Clancy fails to expand upon any emotion relating to this incident. He spent most of the book letting the readers get to know them and then once they have a bullet shatter their skull, it is time to move on. No grief. No emotions. While military personnel may be able to accept the fact that they are gone and move on quickly without a second thought, most readers, myself included, would like to see at least some reaction. By failing to acknowledge that the characters were people, Clancy leaves the readers with the impression that everyone in his book is expendable and their death would be and is completely inconsequential.The sub-plots are the highlight of this book. As Clancy's successful attempt at keeping readers on the edge of their seat, they are well thought out and action packed. While the main plot is highly predictable, anything can and will happen in the minor missions and plots. The transitions are made very smoothly from one to the next and aid in at least a little believability of the major plot. They help ease us into wondering if it is possible for some psycho tree-hugger to destroy the human race and the world as we know it. If nothing else, the book is thought provoking enough to be entertaining.Although engaging, the one primary flaw, or rather let down, in this book is the conclusion. Clancy spends the entire book building and building, but to what? The climax had no climax. I was able to predict (correctly) everything that happened in the last 200 pages. Even the bad guys, who were intelligent enough to create a virus that would slowly and painfully kill every human, were not smart enough to carry out a simple plan. Also, while the ending in South America was amusing, the true climax should have been in Sydney. It was as if Clancy planned on ending the story in Sydney, but that didn't quite tie up all the loose ends, so he dragged the book on further. With a story over 700 pages, quantity does not necessarily equal quality. Clancy could probably have written his conclusion more effectively in fifty pages. That is how simple the ending is. The conclusion almost destroys the positive aspects this book has to offer.The anticlimactic conclusion was the final straw to make this book merely mediocre. While many points in this book are engaging and enthralling, there are several passages that could have been written by a 10-year old. All the child would need is a vivid imagination and a desire to draw out a plot. This is a shame. Clancy is a good writer who seems to have been caught by a deadline. The majority of the book is expertly written. If the conclusion had been more entertaining, other minor flaws could easily be over looked. But, even with the pathetic ending, my prediction for this book is generally enjoyable with some exceptionally entertaining parts."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is my second Clancy book I have read, and yet again I find myself wanting to read more of him. Being the teenager that I am, this book taught me a lot of useless information, which is always good to know. I have not yet fininshed the book ( I am on 720 give or take) but I find this book very interesting and entertaining. These 50 page action scenes keep you hooked on the book, and the plot all finally started to fit together around page 500.

Usually it takes a hundred pages for me to &quot;get into&quot; a Clancy novel. This book starts out OK, but gets more and more boring as the lengthy pages progress. What I really wished for was a decent editing job that would have cut the pages in half, focused the plot, and cut out the unnecessary diatribes against the environmental movement, entertainment industry (Disney), and so forth. I wondered what Newt was doing these days - he was secretly collaborating with Clancy on this book! On the plus side, Clancy has put more focus on the characters; however, it will be a long time before characterization alone can carry his books. If you really need to read every Clancy novel, at least wait for the paperback or, better yet, an abridged audiotape."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is simply bad. Apparently Mr. Clancy feels he had it made and doesn't have to really put much effort into plot, characters or setting. I took the advice of earlier reviewers and read THE OMEGA MISSILE by Joe Dalton. A very good thriller. You also might want to check out Bob Mayer's special forces series of books, like DRAGON SIM-13 or CUT OUT. At least Mayer wore the green beret and knows what he's talking about. And his books are damn good."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was very, very disappointed in the novel as a whole. I had to make sure it was written by the same Tom Clancy that wrote all the rest. It seems more of an attempt by someone else to write in Clancy's style. And why the special pains to exclude Jack Ryan? He is after all still the President in the novel, but everyone seemed to be acting without his authority and to act in ways which anyone in such positions would never be allowed to assume. As a whole the bad guys were just plain ridiculous and unbelievable. The opening sequence was especially not believable in the slightest. I would have believed Superman flying in to save the day more. After the build up with Debt of Honor and then seemlessly moving into Executive Orders what a let down!!! The key to all of the other books have been great characters that you could either really love of really hate. You wanted to be like Jack Ryan or like John Clark. To take action like they would. I just don't feel that here. Even the bad guys are not even very despicable, just idiots. I'm sure no writer can always produce consistant first rate material but this should have been stopped by his editor. I'll probably get his next novel right away again but if its of this calibre then I doubt if I'll keep reading Clancy. A Thumbs Down. Come on Tom, you're WAY BETTER than this! Try again and go back to your old style of great characters and even greater plots."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Really disappointed in this book. Love the characters Clark and Chavez but this story was packaged and tied with a bow. I figure they could do it in a two night mini-series on NBC. Loved the gadgets but don't any of the bad guy have access to these?? How come Clancy never mentions Jack Ryan and always refers to him as the president? Is he trying to distance Clark from that series and if so why does he mention all the other peripheral characters like Murray, Mary Pat and Ed Foley etc?? I think he needs a good editor to give him some feedback unless he reads these critiques. And while I'm at it did anyone else notice that he repeated himself so many times with phrases and comparisons. I thought I was reading the same pages over again sometimes. Pleeeaaassee!! Cut some of fat next time and give us a good story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a real third rate book - implausible plot, improbably perfect good guys, and unbelievably evil bad guys. The political intrigue, careful attention to technical details, and suspenseful plots of some of Clancy's earlier books don't appear in this volume. Suspense in the story is soon quashed because the good guys are absolutely perfect and flawless - nothing they attempt ever fails in any respect. Have a serious hostage situations? No problem - sneak in, shoot all the bad guys, save all the hostages - repeat, rinse. There is no attempt to keep the bad guys in character. Need to kill off a mild mannered laboratory researcher in order to tie up some lose ends in your store? - its easy, just have him grab a rifle and charge out to shoot at the good guys. I think I've read my last Clancy novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is a worthy read for his fans, but it is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his portagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book, but it was a hard read. Not fun. The best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I recommend this book to every Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After Executive Orders I told myself that I would give him one more chance. He had his chance with R6 and blew it.

Hopefully he'll reread Hunt for Red October and re-realize what it takes to make a good book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a let-down. I have followed Jack Ryan's life through many of Clancy's books and this latest pales in comparison. It left many questions such as: 1) Why was it necessary for the villians to research into Clark - contributing to the exposure of the Russian agent? 2) Why was it necessary to keep the agent alive if the objective is near? 3) Why the need to use the method of delivery? Why was there only one delivery? Why wait until the end of the event? All said, the villians are made to be unrealistically stupid. And the ending is a real disappointment."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has written his best thriller to date, and it is a chilling book with a plausible plot that scares the hell out of any knowledgeable reader. As a practicing physician, I found that the viability of the terrorist consipiracy described in the book is too close for comfort. As our politically correct world moves closer and closer to having more respect for the rights of animals over those of humans, this book chronicles an excellent plot where environmental terrorists take aim at the human population. Dismissing humans as parasites on the planet, the terrorists seek to eleminate all but the elect which is composed of their little group of environmental wackos. They have the tools to accomplish the task, and only John Clark and his Rainbow Six unit save the world. What a wonderful read for people who demand plots that are plausible and frightening in their potential reality. This is the best Clancy book in recent memory."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished reading Rainbow Six by John Clancy. It is a GREAT read! I could barely put it down. It had action from the very first page to the epilogue.Clancy did a wonderful job of developing the characters and bringing characters from the past back in this novel. You got to see John Clark become a granfather and Ding Chaves become a father.I would highly recommend this book to everyone who likes the techno/political/thrillers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has improved. His other books like &quot;Red October&quot; for an example. It tells you alot of how the submarine works, who cares! But when I read this book, I started loving him again. He was very descriptive on the killing actions and the plot was good. Rainbow Six is the best action books I had ever read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After having the game and playing it for a few months, the book Rainbow Six came out and I grabbed it right away. The book adds a new dimension to the game and it was nice to be able to read a story instead of play the game all the time. Playing the game actually makes the book a whole lot better because you are put into scenarios that are very much like the ones in the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Timely in view of the threat of terrorism today. The scene with the little girl in the wheel chair is heartbreaking. Clancy makes us aware of those who put their lives on the line to circumvent thugs like these terrorists."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I started off playing the Rainbow Six game online which really gave me an interest for anti-terrorism and such. I decided to get the book and I am not much of a reader which probably explains why I gave it 5 stars. I usually grow tired of books after a few chapters and leave them in a box some where, but with Rainbow Six, this was NOT the case!! At exciting times I could not stop reading and a blazing 80 pages a day is alot for me (concidering I usually never finish books with even 250 pages). If you like action, detail, suspence, mind exercise, counter terrorism - this is a great book to read! I highly recommend it, along with the game and the sequel: Rogue Spear! (and it is not far fetched at all as someone above mentioned, it is highly realistic with todays society)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Exciting story, packed with slanders to Discovery Channel buffs. I only found this one offensive: he used twice as much &quot;tree&quot; as he needed to with this adventure. Clancy takes much, much too long to develop his plot. Read this book only if you have an unhealthy amount of spare time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy accurately depicts military life and potenital real-life scenarios. Rainbow Six returns Ding Chavez and John Clark to Clancy novels. Chavez and Clark are two agents, Navy and Army respectively, who should never be messes with. Descriptions were gory, but that is how it is. The soldiers kill without compunction and die without complaint. Clancy should continue to include Chavez, Clark, and Ryan in his novels. A good find for any military lover, a little nerve wrecking considering I began reading it on an airplane and the first scene involves a hijack."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a well written book full of plot twists and exciting action sequences, although it lacks the ending that the beginning of the book promises. For those of you who didn't know, the book is about an anti-terrorist organization constructed by the UN to act in all countries against terrorist threats. As it unfolds, you find out about a group that is out to purify the world from the so-called parasitic human race that destroys her by means of biological warfare. For those of you who hate reading long, detailed books, you definitely would not get into this 800+ page monster. But for the ones out there, though, like myself, who enjoy a detailed book, this is for you. Throughout the book, the Rainbow team (the anti-terrorist group) completes many different, difficult missions that, while taking up a good portion of the book, will be fasinating to those interested in miltary strategy. Some of these will seem familiar for those of you who have played the game. Some of the creative twists in the story include an assault on the home base of the Rainbow group, specifically targeting the wives and children of the group. Other twists in the plot include the sudden change of heart from an ex-KGB agent who, after finding out the nature of the terrorist attacks he organized, hands himself over to Rainbow, the men whose wives the ex-KGB had targeted and attempted to kill. Rainbow Six is almost perfect until the end of the book. For some reason, the ending just doesn't give off all the thrill and suspense that was built up by the previous 700 pages. It is just too predictable. All that happens in the ending is what you would expect to happen. A good ending should be unexpected and unpredictable. By no means is the ending terrible, however, but somehow I expected more as an avid reader of Clancy. If an ending is that important to you, I still recommend this book highly to any Tom Clancy fan, even if you just put down the book at the end and make up your own ending."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy did a magnifiscant job on Rainbow 6. I've read some of his books before, and I found they tended to drag on a bit in the middle. Rainbow 6 was far from boring. It had a masterfully done plot and very good description of combat and what it's like to be a soldier in a special ops force. I am not a soldier, but after reading this book, I think that I have a pretty good understanding of what it would be like. This book was a melting pot of several genre's. It had elements of spy, action, and, dare I say, evan some sci-fi. All in all, this book is excellent and a must have."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a somewhat nice book but falls in a lot of nonsense and political babbling. Clancy centers more in the paranoid extreme political views of heroes and antiheroes characters using sci fi tech rather than giving attention to the special operations area. He centers very much in Clark but leaves outside other potentially interesting characters. There is also a lack of a well defined, really exciting climax point in the plot."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom clancy has struck again with Rainbow 6. A twisting book with plenty of action and suspense! John Clark, the leader of Rainbow, a England based counter-terrorist strike team, believes in nothing more than strike first and strike to kill. Throughout the story his decisions against the terrorists will leave you up all night trying to finish the book. Although 4 hours of non-stop reading will only get you partially through this long epic. I could have stayed with it longer. But for all you action-suspense kind of guys and you know who you are! This is a definite addition to your late night reading collection. That is if you don't ever want to fall asleep!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This IS a TC book, but it just doesn't have everything that the previous ones did. I had just finished rereading Clear and Present Danger which is one of his best in my mind, and R6 just didn't have what CPD did. This book was simply thrown together, almost as if to go along with the release of the game. Definatly a great book, but a poor one as Clancy books go. Being subjected to some of his extreme views didn't help, either."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well, Mr. Clancy has published another offering to his legions of fans (myself included). I read the book in about 3 days. Basically, I liked it, but found parts of it to be repetitive. I must confess that I was disappointed in not seeing more of Jack Ryan. Clancy left him out in Without Remorse (an excellent novel that is one of my favorites), but there seems no real reason to do so given the plotline he chose. Certainly the President would be involved in the international terrorist problems discussed by the book. I must also say that i found the ending to be a bit unsettling. However, being a practical person i believe i might have done something similar. I have virtually no tolerance for those that commit violent or heinous crimes and offer some lame justification to the rest of humanity. I guess, if you play by the rules, you should be accorded common courtesies. If you choose to abandon civilization, then society's niceties need not be extended to you. Beware.I look forward to Mr. Clancy's next book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has built a reputation for impeccable research and gripping plot lines. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; fails in both regards. While I consider &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; to be the archetypal &quot;technothriller&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; reads like one of his mass-produced &quot;Op Center&quot; books with a couple of familiar characters. Mr. Clancy has trouble differentiating between the strategic, operational and the tactical levels of warfare -- and although the basic plot lines of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; are astute (growing threat of terrorism; danger of biowar; ascension of the multinational corporation as a mechanism of political power), he drops the ball by giving us shallow characters with only a thin veneer of credibility. I think Mr. Clancy does his reputation a grave injustice by pawning this dime store piece of pulp fiction in the guise of his far-better written Jack Ryan sagas."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I finished reading Rainbow 6 yesterday. Always up for Clancey, I really looked forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was only an OK read. Like so many others, I was quite disappointed.Clark, Chavez and their respective spouses were given all the dimension and depth of matched set of Ken and Barbie dolls. Perfect, cutesy, predictable. Make-believe dialog. The men of Rainbow were equally perfect and perfectly flat - like a box of toy soldiers. When they weren't splattering the brains of bad guys, these gents were like something out of Mr. Rogers neighborhood. The bad guys suffered from equally thin character development. The terrorists in Europe were like so many three stooges. The Environmentally inclined terrorists characters were like hallucinations of a right-wing zealot.It bothered me that Clancey is letting a lot more of his political views (agenda?) creep into the narrative. While I don't exactly line up with him politically, I could always look past that and get lost in the narrative. In this book clancey's politics kept slapping me in the face. It was embarrassing!The novel suffered from poor editing (or no editing), flat characters, repetitive and predictable dialog, predictable plot lines.What ever you do, do not buy this book. If you spend money on this book you will probably regret it. Then to feel better, you'll want to give it to someone you know. Only then you'll feel bad because it's such a bad read. Check it out of a library if you have to read it. There will be a lot of copies available."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Weak characters, poor plot, doom this book to mediocrity. You want some good thrillers that you might not have read, check out the following titles: DRAGON SIM-13, CUT OUT, SYNBAT, EYES OF THE HAMMER, ETERNITY BASE. I've read every one and loved them. They're about Special Forces operations written by someone who obviously knows what the hell he's talking about. I'm retired Special Forces so I know! Great reads."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Maybe it's time for the dean of technothrillers to retire and let someone take his place. If this was a first novel by an unknown writer it wouldn't have been published. An outlandish plot, a political agenda by the author, distasteful characters-- what more can I say? I recommend getting Coonts latest book, FINAL FLIGHT or one of Bob Mayer's Special Forces books: CUT OUT, ETERNITY BASE, DRAGON SIM-13."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I recommend this book to everyone that likes great action. Not many author can give you the feeling of intensity as Clancy did. I'm a first time reader of his novels, and it really got me into his other books as well. This is a must read book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's first 3 or 4 offerings were thrillers. His latest is a predictable, flight of ideas, stream of consciousness. He has run out of technobabble with which to wow his readers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"John Clark finally enters the spotlight in this taut, exciting novel. As the head of the counter-terrorist organization Rainbow Six, Clark and his force must eradicate terrorist threats which seem to be linked. The novel is a real nail biter right up to the end."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy knows how to tell a story. He uses one of the most underused characters in the Ryan series of novels, John Clark. This book flat out reads like a real life newscast.AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book, featuring Clark and Ding running an anti-terroist unit, takes on the environmental wacko extremists. It is also a primer on how we should be taking on the other extremist groups that are blowing up our embassies and threatening our citizens."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to be a big Clancy fan, but this book just turned me off. It was poorly written, far too long, full of technical mistakes, and obviously just a forum for Clancy's right wing extremist views. The good guys are always perfect, and the bad guys are always inept; maybe in a comic book. His portrayal of environmnentalists was so inaccurate and misleading that I question his motives on this one. This was one of the worst books I've read in years. I wish I could get my money back on this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was very disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest John Clark novel. The plot was somewhat predictable, devoid of most of the technological wizardry present in his other books, and simply just not that exciting.I hate giving away the ending of the book, so don't read further if you don't want to know how it ends. This is, however, crucial to my review.How can we like a book where all of the good guys win all of the time? In previous books, unexpected villians have committed unspeakable acts of war, terrorism, and crime. In Rainbow Six, the &quot;unspeakable act&quot; never gets off the ground.Those of us who find Clancy's novels to be a guilty pleasure won't stop reading his books because of Rainbow Six. However, I for one am anxiously awaiting the next Jack Ryan novel, hoping for a return to the qualities that have been here to fore a consistant hallmark of his craft."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"as the reader from Ft Bragg recommended and enjoyed that even more. Clancy can over-describe things to the point of slowing the action down. However he is good at painting a world-wide canvas. Check out OMEGA MISSILE. Also recommend THE ACADEMY and THE LINE if you are interested in West Point, especially the latter if you like action."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Again, Clancy brings current hi-tech gadets to bear to assist Clark and Ding on a mulinational anti terrorist team. Rainbow provides added depth to both Clark and Chavez characters, shows a more humane side of both. At times the story boggs down in detail, typically Clancy. Also, I found myself wondering about situations that were far too long in explanation, the story fragments. However, overall, one of Clancy's best and a great read!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I don't expect literary perfection in a tecno/spy/military thiller, Clancy's work in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is poor enough to insult the itelligence of even his most die hard fans. While the over the top portrayals of the environmentalist-wackos were entertaining, they were overshadowed by the weak develpment of a shallow and repetitive plot. The poor quality of the book's editing make it clear that this book was rushed to market to satisfy the expected ( and,no doubt, realized ) demand. It appears,( to use a metaphor that is repeated three times in the first half of the book ) that Clancy gave no more thought to the crafting of this book than to &quot;zipping his fly&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a novel, this book is poorly written. As a Tom Clancy book, this is criminal negligence. It seems like whole sections of irrelevant material are stuck in just to make the book longer. This book bears no resemblance to any previous Tom Clancy novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I looked forward to Clancy's latest novel with real anticipation. After being bored to tears with the OpsCenter drivel, I was hoping for another Red Storm Rising, or even Executive Orders. I had gotten used to the twists and turns of his plots, and his black and white characters, and even enjoyed them, but even that seems to pale to gray and gray in the book after the first 350 pages, or so. To be honest, I missed Jack Ryan, and missed characters with the latitude to make decisions that did not impact the events of the world, just their own little secion of it. Though overly long, this was an okay read, but had none of the technological &quot;bells and whistles&quot; that I so much look forward to in Clancy novels. Also, when you make as much money as Clancy, you would think that he could afford a better editor, or are normal people not allowed to edit Clancy books? I am sure that I will buy the next one, but the eagerness will be a lot more tempered, and the expectations will be a lot lower. Next, maybe we will have a &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; character traveling all over the world and injecting each and every person with some monsterously addictive drug so that he/she can control the world through their addictions. The plan of the bad guys in this one made about as much sense."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved this book as much if not more than Red October. John Clark and Ding Chavez are 2 badasses in a world fulluv terroism and war and they're ready to kick ass and take names. great book i loved it"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book not only ties in many of the characters from Clancy's past books, but also engulfs the reader in the nonstop action. There are many sub plots going on at the same time to keep the reader interested. MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading this book i am a commited clancy fan. Rainbow six was the first of clancy's books I read and I now know that it is a large step away from his other books and in particular, his series. The book still clings closely to the Tried and True Clancy Formula, with character profiles taking up a good third of the book. However, once I finished reading the full 900 pages.... which i agree, to some may seem extravagent and unforfilling, to me it represented a brilliantly crafted diplay of writing and storytelling excellence and it has succeeded in making me a fan of the legendary writer, Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Best book i have ever read.... i havnt read very many books but hey..It was very enjoyable reccomended !"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book re-teamed many of the characters we have grown to appreciate over the years of reading Tom Clancy's works. However, as in Without Remorse, this one focuses not so much on Jack Ryan, but on supporting actor John Clark. It also shows more of growing favorite Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez. The plot of terrorists being targeted by an elite international anti-terrorist unit is superb, and unfortunately, not a reality. Clark and Chavez work together establishing the organization, and taking it through its initial actions as it reaches its lethal maturity. Clancy does a fantastic job in this novel, and it appears he spent much more time allowing the characters' personalities and shadowy roles to more fully develop than when Jack Ryan is on the scene. Ryan's leading roles have become tiring of late, but the two efforts thus far on Clark and now Chavez leave me re-invigorated and looking forward to the next story. This book was very entertaining, and was not put down for three days except when I absolutlely had to. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read alot of these other people's and some i agree with and others i don't. I too regognized the mistake with the summers but i thought to myself he's only human and we make mistakes. It started off great and kept it up never really lettin it settle down, only in a few parts, but when it was time for a mission it got really intense. Not my favourite Clancy book (that would be Red Storm Rising) but up there. A good read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid (mu husband would say fanatical) fan of Clancy, I do believe this one fell a little short. I do agree with another reviewer who said it appeared that the editor must have gotten involved in the process somewhere and told clancy to keep the number of pages down because this was left somewhat hanging -- but not in a sequel kind of way. Would like to have seen Clark maybe trying to reconcile John Clark with John Kelly (after getting his identity back in Excutive Orders). I love John Clark. He is more like a lot of us - want to do the right thing and will do some &quot;wrong&quot; things to accomplish those right things. Great read, but not the best. Tom, write for us -- not your publishers!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Contrary to some of the reviews I have read, the book started with a bang but instead of building up suspense (as claimed), it dragged on a few moments. It took me a while to connect the sub-stories into the major plot.Well, the novel ended quite funny. Apparently,Tom Clancy has humnor underneath all that espionage thing :-)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"OK, we all know how verbose Mr. Tom Clancy can be, let's not talk about it anymore. Rainbow six is fun to read, and you should read it if you've come this far, since Hunt for Read October, passing through Cardinal of the Kremlin, Executive Orders, etc etc. OK, this book is interesting, though the premise is a little bit ethereous. If I was John Brightling (he's one of the central characters), had all of his money, I would try to do something nicer to the world, instead of... oh, but let's not spoil things for the eventual reader. The plot(s) is (are) good(s), even though I've seen Clancy do better: it's his usual stuff, but, as Austin Powers would say, he lost some of his MOJO. But the ending... I can Imagine this conversation between Clancy and his editor: TC \\"Look, editor I'm in the middle of the book, and see how MANY pages I managed to write this far! \\" ED \\"Mr. C., are you nuts? Can't you see your usual reader can't stand books two thousand pages long anymore, and the infinite plots that don't have ending... I think you should finish it as it is.\\" TC \\"OK, I'll do that.\\" And the book is over, with an almost comic ending, that should be taken by Roberto Benigni as a start line for a new comedy.Grade 6.0/10"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is filled with action from the beginning to the end. From my opinion, this is definitely one of Clancy's best work. Even though this is a fairly thick book, the action and suspense kept me going and I finished this book within a week."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read this book a couple of days ago (after I could get it off my sister) and it only took me about two days to read because I could not put it down. It is probably one of the best books Tom Clancy has ever written. And that's saying something, because Clancy has written a heap of excellent books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"WOW!!!!!! is the best description of this book. There is so much action on every single page. There is no book with more action than Rainbow Six. It is my favorite book of all time!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy once again shows he's the &quot;master' of adventure thrillers. This is scary stuff, luckily &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is up to the task. May be not quite as good as Clancy's &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; books, but Mr. Clark and Mr. Chavez handle the situation, barely in the nick of time. A fine novel with a fitting ending."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This lengthy action-packed novel by Tom Clancy is a must have in everyone's library. Greatly detailed, with many great characters, and with many little sub-plots that all come together at the end to form the main plot, this book will have the reader into the book constantly. If you need a great book with a little bit of everything-espionage, sniping, terrorism, and plain good guy versus bad guy, than this book shall not disappoint."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought that this book was just about one of the best action books that I have ever read. It was full of action and was very, very life-like. I thought the details that Tom Clancy included were spectacular. And once again he used a great writing style that made you feel like you were one of the members of the \\"Rainbow Team.\\" The plots that we interwoven throughout the book were some of the best that Tom Clancy had ever written. They never got boring and were full of facts. This book even inspired me to go out and buy the computer game that was based off the book. Overall I give the book a perfect 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have always loved Tom Clancy's writing but 'Rainbow Six' was absouletly brilliant! I didn't want it to end! Since finishing it, I have not been able to find anything else that satisfying? Can anyone recommend anything?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked the plot and the characters. It's a good premise with fascinating possibilities. Clark and Ding Chavez are two of Clancy's best creations. But the book is just way too long. It would be a solid hard-to-put-down read if Clancy could be a little more concise and spare us having to read every single little detail about each character, weapon, locale, building, vehicle, thought, device, action etc. Puh-leeeease! I like the techno-babble, but he's losing control! Clancy is getting to be like a person who loves the sound of his own voice. He should take a lesson from Elmore Leonard and keep the story moving. Or better yet, think back to the books that made him famous such as The Hunt For Red October and The Cardinal Of The Kremlin - Both less than 600 pages. This one has too many words!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My opinion of the book is that is was a great one. All of the characters in the book are the best the world has to offer. This includes the best troops from the US Navy SEALs, US Army Rangers, US Delta Force, The highly trained British SAS, French Special Forces, US Special Ops. Aviation Unit, and the German GSG-9. This book also brings the return of two of my favorite Clancy characters, Domingo Chavez and John Kelley a.k.a. John Clark. The book also brought in the newest arsenal of counter-terrorist weaponry and technology. I could hear the gun shots from the H&amp;K MP-10's. The new 10mm version of the MP-5. By far I think this is the best Clancy novel and suggest you read it. I loved this book so much I even purchased the game, and hopefully there is a movie in the works."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy gives so much detail in the story that you almost believe you are there. You can practically hear the gunshots, the orders, the helicopter overhead, etc. Tom Clancy puts you there and allows you to almost perfectly understand the life of a secret anti-terrorist group and the life of terrorists."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"all in all a great read. I felt that some parts lagged but other parts had non stop action and I coudnt put it down. I would reccomend this book. Also I would recommend BLACKHAWK DOWN. it tells a more realistic tale of war in somalia in 1993."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was not very good Clancy. For one thing, everything worked just too well. The action scenes and the way the good guys always won were too pat. I didn't think he did anything particular with the characters. Of course, as a long-time Clancy reader, I have a pretty good idea of Clark and Chavez. They weren't very interesting in this one. I read a library copy. I don't think I'll bother with buying a copy of my own, even in a couple of years at the used book store."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy starts this one off very fast. In Debt of Honor, the beginning drags, but readers will notice an immediate difference in this one. The plot takes you on a ride to the forshadowed end, sidetracking you with these exciting distractions. Overall the book is great, but he does seem to go into too much detail of irrelevancies. Maybe these irrelevancies are really his idea of probing into the mind, but read up on Clancy's background. Normally it wouldn't matter, but to appreciate this book, you must know where he's coming from, his perspective on things. So, overall, it was a great book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The characters in this book were great as was the plot"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Here are some lyrics from a Randy Newman song that probably wasn't about this book (but they sure do fit!)I have nothing left to say But I'm gonna say it anyway I have a family to support But surely, that is no excuse I've nothing further to report Time you spend with me Is time you lose Why do I go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For anyone else, this would be a pretty decent techno- and action thriller. From Clancy, I expect more. _Rainbow Six_ is flawed but OK and enjoyable on the first read, but it has almost NO &quot;re-read&quot; value whatsoever, and that's a first for this particular author (at least in the Ryan and Clark series).You know, there are two things that particularly disappoint me about this book. Until reading this, I used to compare Clancy to Charles Dickens for the way in which he developed the minor characters in his works, and I got laughed at by a lot of people for doing so. If the characterization in _Rainbow Six_ is going to be par for the course for Clancy, I might just start laughing at myself very soon for making such a dumb statement. The characters in _Rainbow Six_, aside from Ding Chavez, are extremely shallow and unbelievable. Clancy has somehow managed to turn what was once an overwhelming strength into an obvious weakness. And, Tom, while you're at it, could you perhaps come up a form of central disaster other than an Ebola or &quot;Shiva&quot; epidemic? If Clancy's next Ryan or Clark book contains any reference, except in passing, to biological warfare or bioterrorism, he's going to have one less reader.While _Rainbow Six_ is preferable to any of Clancy's non-Ryan/Clark oeuvre (other than _Red Storm Rising_), it ranks dead last in that series. One can only hope that his forthcoming continuation in the Ryan series is a return to the previous and recent high standards he set with _Executive Orders_ and _Debt of Honor_.For Clancy completists only."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Anyone that has had contact with Special Forces operations will love this book. It hits very close to the real thing. The characters are likable but, unfortunetly, only a couple get very developed. The most developed character starts off as one of the bad guys and ends as something else. The driving force in this book is the plot, not the characters and the action carries it along at a fast pace. This may not be Clancy's best novel but If you are looking for an exciting read with lots of realistic action, this is for you."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Keeped me on the edge of my seat the whole time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I prefer war novels like The Thin Red Line or The Triumph and the Glory, or Alleys of Eden to techno-thrillers, but Tom Clancy has been such a master of the genre that I've read every one of his fine books. But Rainbow Six was a pretty mediocre effort for someone of Clancy's stature. Forget the NFK and your divorce, Tom, concentrate on your BOOKS."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Originally I did not want to buy the hardback edition, but I just could not resist it. I am very happy with the book. I was a little surprised that Jack Ryan was not the main character but I believe this led to better development of the characters. The overall plot was very interesting and kept me turning pages for 2 days, I could not put it down. I am very glad that Clark and Chavez are doing new and interesting things. I highly recommend Rainbow Six to everyone. Good story line, good characters and good ending. Rainbow Six may not be to everyone's liking, (see other reviews), but I thought it was great. Anyone with the slightest shred of imagination will like this book as Mr Clancy puts you RIGHT there with the men of Rainbow Six. I have read Coonts, Griffen and several other techno-thriller authors and I still find Tom Clancy at the head of the pack. Mr Clancy is THE MASTER of the techno-thriller. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! Signed, a VERY SATISFIED READER."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a very important novel. Although it is fictional, it tackles a very important issue, terrorism. The book was suspensful, action packed, and had many very good characters. It was hard for me to put down. An outstanding book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think RAINBOW SIX was a wonderful book.I realy think that the weapons they used were the best for the job,Hekler&amp;Koch MP10 10m.m..I realy liked the situations also,like &quot;WORLDPARK&quot;,or C.I.A. v.s. the I.R.A. .It realy was a great book,although a few rather repulsive parts which didn't realy mess with the story that much.I think everyone should read this book to learn how the government works these days,and how hard these situations can be."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Again Clancy amazed me also with his Net Force series. Rainbow 6 in my opinion is his best book yet! His writing makes you feel like you are there in this EXCITING Action/Adventure"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow 6 is pleasant to read and interesting. The military are too idolized and idealized but we've come to expect that from Clancy. However, although he strains for a pretend objectivism, his distate and contempt for ecologists is a little too obvious. The suspense goes nicely up but you lose interest after the hospital crisis and the ending is disappointing. And there is something definitely spooky about the young hero already planning to make a Soldier/killing machine out of his just newly born son, wether you're pro-military or not."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I really like the realism of this book. Clancy really isn't reaching to far in his story. This book is a great action-packed thriller. The characters aren't developed massively but I think the pages he invests in a few of the characters makes it worth while. This is a book that people who want a action-packed thriller but don't want to get cought up in a massive web of deception should read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book kicks hard-core ass!!! The elite group executes every mission perfectly. I'm an ex-Navy SEAL and I think that John Clark is a perfect example of what I used to be. This elite force will knock you right off your feet. I read the other reviews and it seems like they didn't even bother to read the whole book. Take it from a SEAL and read this title."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book kicks hard-core ass!!!

Rainbow 6 brings realism in alternative world organizations once again. If you need a story to get you interested, go buy Rainbow 6 today at amazon.com (or your local bookstore)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read alot of Tom Clancey books but this is byfar the best book he has written. I have one word for those who said this book wasent all that great: I would like to see you write a better book. If u have not read this book yet READ IT."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Don\`t read this book, it isn\`t worth the time and money! No real characters in this book, just killing machines on both sides of the law trying to look at least a little human, but failing. Lots of stereotype impressions. The only good thing is the tension during the counter-terrorist attacks but everything is over soon and you have to wait for the next terrorist happening because the story between the action is so boring."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This novel continues Clancy's great writing style and finesse in his &quot;real book&quot; series, as I like to say. I have read some of the Net Force and Op Center series and they seem to be cheap attempts just to make a few bucks, but the Clancy &quot;super-novels&quot; are still his best works and will continue to be. Keep writing these &quot;super-novels,&quot; they are GRRRREAT! RB6 grabs you and DOESN'T let you go! INCREDIBLE!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Please don't listen to the negative reviews posted. This book is not a spy novel so don't treat it like one. It is about a anti-terrorist &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; team. It is exciting, action packed, and detailed. Give it a chance please, I loved it ! If you like the game Rainbow Six, this is the book where it all started."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"THE GOOD:Realistic Plot-I could see something like what was being planned happening.Good Cast- This book could be made into an excellent movie IMHO, the characters are plausible(I myself liked the 'Techie', probably since I'm a CS major).Good &quot;Writing&quot;(Since this is a book on tape)- The action scenes were tightly written and the planning scenes framed the action well.Good Reader-I wanna know how Dukes did all of those voices!THE BAD:The Language- A bit raw--I think I see where the phrase&quot;A mouth like a sailor&quot; originated.The Ending- This book kinda petered out a bit at the end(I was hoping for a dramatic gun battle at the Syndey Airport).The Sides- This book bears the stamp of a man who grew up in teh chill of the cold war. The bad guys were a &quot;Radical Environmentalist&quot; group with ties to various radical groups. Why not have them take on a militia or a white supremacist groups(You reading this Mr. Clancy).THE REST:A FILM?--Clancy hasn't had a book made into a movie for awhile, why not this one!THE GAME--I can't wait to get my hands on the Computer Game(Either for a PC or a Game Boy Color!)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Clancy book, and it is now one of my favorite books. Since it was my first, that may be why I liked it better than some of the other people who reviewed (I may not know what to compare it with), but I thought it was good. Since Rainbow Six, I have begun to read The Hunt for Red October, and, frankly, I like Rainbow Six more. In my opinion, it had the right amount of action but was able to stay intelligent. As I said, I loved it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, Clancy does his homework and comes out with something that is technically believable, although I have to admit the plot is stretching the envelope of believability. I have but one bone to grind with Clancy, who made his mark by being technically accurate (yes - this is nit-picking). Re the Schloss sequence, infra-red goggles cannot see through closed windows. They will reflect the temperature of the glass, and a person behind the window will remain hidden, unless he presses himself against the glass. Sorry Tom, you messed up there.But that's the only fault I can find. Good job."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Definately the best of all of Clancy's novels. This book is action packed all the way through. Also, a very suprising ending. They've made a game from Rainbow Six, now its time for a movie!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This, whilst not being Clancy's finest hour has a superbly constructed plot with the now familiar formula - but by no means is it &quot;Just another Clancy&quot;. The plot is fast-paced throughout the book's entirity, and combines many different human issues with the currently popular terrorist theme - all in all a thoroughly enjoyable read which I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In china i only can read this book in chinese but i want to read the orginal one so that is why I go to thie web to search this book ."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A re-reading of Tom Clancy's initially disappointing &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; would suggest that the best-selling author needs to take a sabbatical. The plot, to use the term loosely, is reminiscent of a series of scripts for a television series. The book is formulaic and, much as it pains a Clancy fan who has read all his previous work, having purchased them in hardback, the characters are wooden."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The prelude starts the book rocketing off with a nice dose of action, with a plane being hijacked. The book then slows down for the next 50 pages or so, but then goes right back up to lightspeed pace with at least 3, I think, different terrorist situations! Afterwards, the book slows down and then, like a fuse to a bomb, sets it off and the plot ends with a satisfying BANG! The length of the book seems long when you start, but begins to seem reasonable as you see the real depth to this story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"...how about asking Michael Ironside to play the lead? Every time Clark has appeared in Clancy's books, it's Ironside's voice I mentally &quot;hear&quot; as I read. Seriously, though, Clancy had to come up with another hero after Jack Ryan moved into the White House. I mean, what if James Bond had been elected Prime Minister? Maybe I'm reactionary, but I like a hard-as-nails &quot;good guy&quot;--someone who isn't so busy trying to &quot;understand&quot; the lowlifes that he never gets around to fighting them. As Herman Wouk says through the lips of his character Pug Henry, the most important thing to understand about an enemy is how to defeat him. And Tom Clancy has built himself a hero who knows this in John Clark. We see that through many of the &quot;Ryan&quot; books, and Clancy gave us a view of the man's roots in the earlier &quot;Without Remorse&quot;. He's human enough to have real feelings, but tough enough to deal with the world's human predators. It may be a cliche, but &quot;somebody's gotta do it&quot;. Here's hoping Tom Clancy keeps Mr. Clark on the job."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Take the usual Clancy team, add a few terrorists, viruses, egomaniacs and a splash of KGB - shake hard. - Garnish with a stick of global techno globedegock - and viola - you have Rainbow Six !!The book lacks the punch and the grip that one is used to from a Clancy thriller. The plot has promise but the deliverable is not upto the mark. Pages can be skipped without missing anything."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of Clancy's slower paced books, but still packed with with Clancy's traditional stunning imagry. If you are a fan of the &quot;elite forces&quot; this will definatly be a book you won't put down. It would have been even better in a condensed format... but is still a must read for all Clancy fans and military fans alike."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The only book I have not read by TC is Red Storm Rising. I could not put this book down. It amazes me how detailed and informative all Clancy books are and this is no exception. Departing from 'spy' novels unlike before, each character in the book I can easily imagine seeing. The depth of each scene is suspenseful. Just by reading a chapter's title I can tell the progression each paragraph takes the reader throughout. It's almost as if Tom Clancy himself is a spy with the details involved in each sentence. If you haven't read this book then your not prepared for the future of technology."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Repitious, boring, techno-babble that makes you want to skip pages. If I read the word &quot;double-tap&quot; (Dings' favorite word) I thought I might puke. Plot was too anticipated. It always seemed that I knew what was going to happen a chapter before it actually did. And by the way Tom, since your Rainbow Six warriors had had four or five missions in row, in a three month period, don't you think they'd be a little suspicious about the Olympics? I could think of a better way to release an airborne contagion than that. Australia is a little too isolated from the rest of the world to let loose a plague that is going to wipe out humanity."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy wrote today's news yesterday. Clancy has an uncanny ability to look ahead and identify tomarrows issues and to write a novel based on the inteligence he has gathered. As with Clear and Present Danger, Sum of All Fears and many other of his books. He writes a very plausible novel on issues that could be tomarrows headlines. He takes many subplots and blends them into one story. Rainbow Six while not one of his best books is still a must read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy, yet again, brings out a masterfully written piece of literature. From beginning to end it screams adventure, but that's about it. The characters lack depth (along with the plot), and the book is way too long, even for an espionage story. All in all, Rainbow Six is a great book to read when you have exactly nothing to do."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I only give this book 3 stars because, although it is a good read, it still follows the Tom Clancy formula. For the first 200-300 pages, the read does not know what is going on. The next 300-350 pages shows the reader what is going on. In the final 50-150 pages the good guys learn what the bad guys are doing and save the day."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Have read all of Clancy's solo fiction works, and this is very good, but not best ever. Could call it 4-1/2 stars.The plot is realistic enough to make you ask &quot;Could this really happen?&quot;Typical Clancy in its clever use of the latest hi-tech gadgets, only a few pages after the good guys get their hands on the new stuff.The story line gets off to a very fast start, and keeps up a good pace from there. I really like to get &quot;hooked&quot; in the first 10 pages of a book, and he did this masterfully.Eco- and other terrorists/crazies are clearly the greatest threat to the world today, and he paints an extremely scary scenario that makes you see how vulnerable the world can be.Can't wait for the next novel... keep up the good work Mr. C!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a long, drawn out, way too wordy, lousy clancy book. The plot is intriguing, but the book could have been written within 200 pages instead of 700+ pages. I have read all of Clancy's first 8 or so novels, and they were great. Then the next few I read, it seemed as though he had others writing for him, because the style, and especially the content, changed. I would not recommend buying this book. It is not worthy of the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have allways loved Tom Clansys books expecially Ruthless.com and Op-Center but they are nothing compared to Rainbow Six. The book is amazingly realistic in all ways and the plot is also very exiting. I read the book in about 4 weeks and couldnt stop until i was at the end. I recomend this book to all Tom Clancy &quot;lovers&quot; but also everyone who is interested of those Tom Clancys fantastic future visions."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This must be Clancy's worst book ever. He is rumored to have herds of researchers working for him - if so, they all should be fired. There are so many factual errors in this book from an author that is supposed to be extremely accurate in presenting the workings of special military operations. It starts with the supposedly German language bits (I am German) that are mangling the language to the extreme - you should only do this if you know what your doing. It goes on with the absurd misconceptions in virology and epidimiology - no, you can't help infected people with symptoms showing by vaccinating them, just to give one example. It goes on with all sorts of operational errors connected with aircraft - one of them is that no British Airways 737 will make it across the Atlantic. And then there are all those editorial errors in the form of &quot;I want to meet you at one p.m.... so I'll be there at eleven... Ok, eleven it is.&quot; From a Tom Clancy we have come to expect accuracy - and that's why I'm dissappointed not to get it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It's no surprise that the Rainbow 6 computer game came out around the same time as the book. The book seems to have been written to make a computer game of it really easy, sacrificing a good deal of suspense once you realized his formula. Also, the book was too easy. No surprise that good defeats evil here... pretty boring read. Oh, the editing was lousy too. For all the eco-conscious verbiage in the novel, Clancy could have easily pared 100 pages off the final length w/o the reader noticing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A great book full of action and full modern day situations"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I bought this book the day it came out and withing 150 I was thoroughly upset at having made the purchase. I read somewhere that Clancy cranked out Rainbow Six in just a few months and it shows. Thin plot, repetitive text and no mystery. It is no coincidence that a PC game quickly followed its releasse. I suggest Clancy fans re-read Patriot Games."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"don't listen to the lousy reviews of this book (unless of course, you don't like books that have more than just a bunch of people sitting around talking. The plot was a bit implausable, but since when has plausibility been the mark of a great story? Most of the best books ever written have been founded on implausibility, but no one seems to complain there. If you enjoyed some Clancy novels like THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and WITHOUT REMORSE, don't miss RAINBOW SIX"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Unfortunately, you can't always have a winner. This latest effort by Tom Clancy was a major disappointment. It could pass for a tupical commuter junk book. If this was a movie it would be considered a B-Movie. The plot was just a rehash of his last novel. There was little suspense and you can figure out who the hero was very early on. It was too predictable. Frankly his op-center novels have been better than Rainbow Six"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm not sure Clancy could go any more right wing than he does in this book. Success seems to have gone to his head and he's slapping his name on anything and everything to get a buck. I won't read any more of his books. Instead I'll support writers who actually served our country and can write fast-paced, well-researched action. I recommend Harold Coyle, Stephen Coonts, Bob Mayer, and Joe Dalton. Take a look at their books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A friend loaned me this book and I won't be adding it to my &quot;Clancy Collection&quot;. I found it interesting enough to finish and did spend a few late nights when I just &quot;couldn't put it down&quot;. However, the repetition got very annoying as the author continued to explain how the bad guys planned to take over the world. There must be something in the Clancy cookbook that says it has to be thick or it isn't a novel. I don't think so. I liked the ending and thought it original. I anticipate a surprise at the end of a Clancy novel after the JAL flight at the conclusion of &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;. Still a Clancy fan, but, a little disappointed in this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading all of Tom Clancy's books through the years, I would rate this one as one of his best. Actually number three out of all of them. A disturbing look into the future of terrorism and the unseen world of espionage. I can only hope the wrong person with alot of money and genious does not write their own version of this book into history."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This novel was still unmistakably Clancy (good enough for devout Clancy fans, but not good enough to convert non-believers), but it definitely did not give me the same pleasure as some of his other novels. I found the storyline weak in places, sometimes bordering on the realms of science fiction. This was quite dissapointing as I've always enjoyed Clancy's ability to totally absorb me in the sometimes highly technical dimension of his novels (Red Storm Rising is an excellent example of how technical descriptions can add to the story and tension.)I got the impresssion at times that I am reading a first draft. If you have an editor MR Clancy, fire him, otherwise get one please.Another suggestion, take a year or two off, stay away from Op-Centre, Net Force and the like (they are just bad for your image) and hit us with another series similar to the Jack Ryan novels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading between the lines of Clancy's last three novels, I expected the plot of the next one to center around a Sino-Russian rumble for Siberia (which would have been great I might add), but instead we were treated to Rainbow Six, an entirely implausible and ridiculous story. I'm no tree-hugger, but this book shows such contempt for environmentalism it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth. Try not to let your hate show so plainly next time, Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For those who have read Tom Clancy they will enjoy his most recent offering of Rainbow Six. The technical detail is there and so is a good story. In my opinion it did tend to get a little drawn out (long) at the end, but overall I enjoyed the story and the characters of Clark and Ding from previous books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although not as awful as Executive Orders, Rainbow Six confirms that Clancy's basic formula is worn out. I am left questioning whether or not we need a new cold war to get something tolerable out of this fellow."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been trying to get through this book with two thoughts in mind - when will it get better and why is he just rehashing the last book. If I had my druthers, I would have just listened to it on cassette. The specifics of the special ops unit has been the only part of the book that has been interesting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has always impressed me with his attention to detail and what I thought was excellent research. However I note (as many other fellow readers have) that his research is off somewhat in this book. As far as I know Hereford does not have a landing strip for aircraft and as a shareholder in British Telecom I know it is not owned by the British Government! I trust Mr Clancy's work will be more informed next time otherwise I will have to look elsewhere for techno-thrillers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If this book doesn't take you back to GI Action Series comics of the 50s, nothing will. This is about as 2-dimensional and dumb of story as you will find in your airport's bookstore. And that includes the romance novels. Clancy's bad-boys tote the 10mm MP-10, which Clancy seems to have an infatuation with, and &quot;double-tap&quot; all the bad guys. Even when he kills a little sick child at an amusement park, his macho boys write it off as &quot;well, she was gonna die of cancer in a week anyhow.&quot; Give it a rest. Do us a favor, make your testosterone overloaded characters do somthing realistic, like turn the guns on each other, and remove the woman-bashing prose."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The plot was a little too contrived and too far fetched to be belivable. Some of the stuff sounded like it came from a Mac Bolan story. I think Clancy is resting on his laurels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was altogether an awesome book, there were some problems though. The first team was always used, but when they used the second one something happened, but I can't say. I haven't finished the whole thing but its filled with excitement page after page!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was surprised by this book in many ways. While I've always been a fan of Clancy's, I thought I would finally start getting sick of reading about CIA groups and issues like that. I was dead wrong. This is a book that no Clancy fan should miss. Even though it's a massive book, it still gives you suspense and action more than 50% of the time which is great for any book. This might just be my favorite Clancy book and is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Being an avid reader who reads about 3-4 books per month, I found this book to be interesting but way, way to long. There were many dead spots in the book where I would lose interest and even contimplated not finishing it. Clancy could have gotten the same result in about 300 less pages. Too much time introducing characters and setting the plots."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The story while rather mediocre and most unbelievable could have been told in 200 pages or less."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I found the fook to be fabulous, but the ending could have been much better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is typical Clancy; written as if he has been paid by the word. Disjointed, hard to follow plot, brings in names and then changes them in middle of story. It is about a group of men who come together and are involved in a number of various plots. Nothing seems to fit. A real waste of time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is hard to believe that such a gifted writer as Clancy could produce something like this book. Premise is absolutely unbelievable, many of the characters are shallow, political statement is stupid. Unfortunate that paper had to be wasted to produce this book! What is his publisher thinking?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"We kept waiting on the character detail of the good guys. Popov gives his horse an apple and compares it to a guy drinking a beer? Popov is so lost in confusing reactions to the western world that it makes you wonder how this guy ever passed the SAT for the KGB.I agree with some of the other reviews-- this is not a typical TC masterpiece.Ding isd talking to his wife Patsy-&quot;Are you still in the C.I.A.Ding? &quot;Technicallly yes-not sure how the admin chain works.....&quot; (hello?) Ding dosen't know who he works for or where his evals come from? any E9 I ever served with could tell you where the headshed got the bucks and who was filling in the squares for you. This is proof that once you get the first novel published, all you do is send a synopsis and they send you the advance. Why the rag on the ecology folks in general. Not necessary. It will be interesting to see if the next one-- which I'll read a few chapters at B&amp;N while drinking some starbucks before I take it to the check-out line- returns to the disipline that Tom had when the bucks were coming in a little slower and no video games to promo.Good shot of Tom on the flyleaf in his new flightsuit"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've always enjoyed Clancy, because he usually taught me something in a suspenseful, quick moving story. Yeah, it was apparant his political view wasn't quite mine; but, hey, he often made a good case for the other POV. Until now. Clancy has absolutely no understanding of environmental concerns. Equating them with druads and cultish religious fringes is pure nonsense. Its the author who sounds like a &quot;bomb hugging&quot; nut. Clancy has lost his credibility, which was barely floating after Executive Orders, anyway."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Yet again Clancy shows his ability to produce a topical and timely treatment of a 'big' issue in the Jack Ryan world. Despite the underlying theme, a number of errors and naive shallow characterizations mar this book. On reflection I've seen the same problems with characters in some of his other work and gotten over it so what went wrong here? Clancy has upped the ante so much in his recent Jack Ryan series that in seems every sequel must now attempt to construct a credible doomsday scenario. By attempting this in Rainbow Six the evil protagonists lack the credibility they need to be menacing.Clancy thinks he must save the world or more importantly, America from dire consequences to provide adequate entertainment for his readers. This time around unfortunately the high stakes game has worn a little thin. How many times can you threaten nuclear, biological or constitutional catastrophe before it becomes dull and before you run out of ideas? In Clancy's case the answer would seem to be &quot;This many.&quot;. It's never the high stakes alone which make his plots interesting. There was far less at stake in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; yet that book demonstrated Clancy's ability to tell a great story and tell it at just the right time.This won't be my last Clancy book, normally I enjoy his work. I just hope he rediscovers what he's best at. Not saving the world, but weaving a great plot embroidered with the speculation on new technology which he's famous for."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Maybe Clancy was trying to raise cash to lay down for a football team, maybe he wants to earn enough money for a Presidential bid someday. Maybe he was writing for Television. Who knows why he wrote and published this work? In the ideal world a Publisher would have done the right thing and trashed this gratuitious quick cash maker. It was predictable. It was boring. It reminded me of a cheap movie. It was nothing like what made him great and his books highly anticipated. I can wait for the next one because even I could have written this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Wow! I could not put this book down. Emotions, ranging from suprise to sheer horror filled me as I flipped through the pages. From the dramatic opening in the airplane to the showdown that summed it up, this is Clancy's best book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It the plot is somewhat belivelabe,and I liked it but it was to long some &quot;died space&quot; not much happen. I like to see Mr.Clark and Chavez but the rest were boring. It was not his best work but acceptable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If its action you want then you won't be disappointed, it fires up 'movie style' in the first chapter. However this novel lacks the depth, complexity and techo-education that are the usual Clancy hallmarks. Like other reviewers I found the plot too derivative of Executive Orders and the prose far too repetative. I guess now that Jack has made President there just wasn't anywhere else for him to go and we have to make do with the less sophisticated Clark and Chavez!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read most of what Clancey has written. His first novels were hard to put down. This one is hard to pick up. Degenerating story line and dialog makes me believe Clancey now writes the outline for someones idea for someone to write to be published in his name and meet his deadline and he rides his previous successes all the way to the bank."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the best book I ever read. I recomend the book and the game. But that is my opinion. So read it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"More boys and their toys crap from the man who can't write but who sells like crazy.Those who buy rather than get this from the library should keep in mind that Clancy is a right-winger who loved Star Wars, helped Reagan &amp; co. spread their paranoia, and has given unqualified support to the most extreme comments of the NRA."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is bad, bad rubbish with extra bad for good measure. It represents little more than a vehicle to wax lyrical about how good and great American soldiers (and their little buddies in the UK) are.Perhaps the worst aspect of it is the horrible boorish characters. Both the good guys and the bad guys (the latter actually being a term used by the former) are emotionless, one dimensional cartoon characters. The Rainbow team are all squeaky clean superheroes. Their wives are all straw-person brainless babymakers. All the other women are evil and conniving. Anyone with environmental concerns is a treehugger. Perhaps worst of all is the cultural and racial stereotypes applied to so many of the non-American characters. British men-even bartenders refer to people as &quot;chaps&quot;. Obviously Clancy has only ever spoken with Torys like Jeffrey Archer or John Major so he wouldn't know that 80% of British men DO NOT say &quot;chaps&quot;. Australian men DEFINITELY never EVER use the term.I've noticed a lot of 12 year olds like this book. That's about the demographic it's written for."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am baffled that any professional editors, or any one who can read for that matter, could give this book a glowing review. I have read and enjoyed some of Clancy's previous work, but I found myself shaking my head at the emotionless, flawless and uninteresting characters in this book. Has Clancy spent any time around real people? Some of the robotic dialogue coming from these characters was just plain laughable.As for the plot, I'll forgive the unrealistic nature of it, and the use of seemingly normal people as bad-guys who yet have no problem with mass murder. Was Hitler that normal? Anyway, I can put all that aside, but c'mon Tom, at least entertain me. The conflict was anti-climactic as hell. Every confrontation was resolved without any interesting confrontation. Throughout the novel, Clancy beat it over the reader's head that these men were the best -- supermen, but the takedowns were &quot;pure vanilla.&quot; Not one character on the team did anything unusual. Our local police force could have done the same thing. Are terrorists that stupid? Almost all of Rainbow's accomplishments simply fell into their hands without any clever investigation or strategy. When Clancy finally let something bad happen to these guys, he did it to characters we didn't even know.Would a company that invested ten years and millions of dollars on eliminating the world population rely on one average Joe to carry out the most critical part of the plan, with no one there to help him? I wish they had given this guy some back-up, maybe then there could have been some conflict in the scene instead of - Hey buddy, put your hands up. - scene over.When I read the jacket on this book, I expected to see some interesting interplay among the Special Op's guys from several different countries, but I think Clancy forgot there were foreigners on the team. Either that or he's never met one. If this seems rough, I admit I'm bitter. See, I always finish a book when I start one, and this one was 900 pages"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has officially hit rock bottom. I couldn't believe how ridiculously one-sided this book was. The good guys are perfect, and the bad guys have the emotional intelligence of a six-year-old. I'm hoping that the American military doesn't have the same perception of our enemies as Clancy does.What really bothers me is that even some of the most successful special forces operations in history--especially those which took place in such public settings as what is described in Rainbow Six--had a few things go wrong; hostages were killed and soldiers were injured. Some even completely fell apart. Clancy apparently either didn't do his homework on this or simply chose to disregard it.I was really, REALLY disappointed in this book. I am (or maybe was) a huge Clancy fan, and while the technical details were still there to satisfy a hard-core military techno-geek, the story was somewhat absurd, and the dialogue is bad, even for Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Formulaic garbage. Major errors in the plot (i.e. Gives one character the knick name Bear and names another Oso (Spanish for bear) who is sometimes called Bear, it's cold in Australia in the summer...DUH). Clancy, who used to be cutting edge, should have retired about three books ago. What an embarrasment."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My main question is where the heck is this guy's editor? Besides the unrealistic plot, mindless one-dimensional characters, and tired cliches, the most irritating aspects of this book are the errors and constant repetition that a little proofreading (or even a spellchecker) might have caught.Thank goodness I got this from a library instead of a store; when I pay for a book I like it to be completed, not a rough draft. A competant editor could have cut almost half the material out and possibly brought the story up from painfully bad to merely mediocre...but a competent author wouldn't have spent 900 pages writing this drivel in the first place.I also found a lot of the stereotypes to be ridiculous. Vegans and enviromentalists (oh my bad, &quot;tree-huggers&quot;) are all either idiots or fanatics who want to wipe out the human race. Riiiight. And my rating isn't politically motivated; I consider myself to be pretty conservative, but Clancy just looks foaming-at-the-mouth insane with his constant tirades. (and using your characters as a mouthpiece for your views is bad form in any case.)Also, as many reviewers have already pointed out, summer in the U.S. is WINTER in Australia. You'd think if he was using it for a major plot point (insofar as Rainbow Six can be said to have a plot) he'd do a little basic research first."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Does he ever have his books proofread before they are printed? I've never seen so many spelling mistakes in a book before.To make matters worse, the plot of this book is absolutely ridiculous. Mr. Clancy obviously doesn't have any clue about environmental issues.On top of that Rainbow Six is repetitive and just plain boring."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Aside from the contrived and ridiculous plot, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is too long. I would guess that at least 300 of the roughly 900 pages should have been edited out. It is, at times, painfully redundant. Everytime some important (or not-so-important) plot element is mentioned, the same multiple-page explanation is given.The plot: A conspiracy lead by the radical-environmentalist head of a biotech company and the president's science advisor to &quot;Save the Earth&quot; by killing off the world's human population with an Ebola-derived bioweapon. They are foiled by our heros, the Rainbow para-military antiterrorist group, led by &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; The details are even more ridiculous involving the olympics and a live virus &quot;vaccine.&quot;The characters are shallow and the subplots simplistic and predictable. I expected much more from the author but I did enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Basic course in human psychology:The main motivator for the human species is; the survival and continuity of the human race.That is why Mr. Clancy's latest and perhaps most appalling attempt at litterature, plotwise ,missteps horribly.The idea that a network of well educated &quot;eco terrorists&quot; could congregate to develop and unleash a virus so deadly ,it will wipe out the entire human race (save a few select individuals) so that &quot;it would be possible to hunt deer among the ruins of New York City&quot;, is so over-the-top hilarious, that even the most devoted Tom Clancy fan should notice that something is not quite right.I must STRESS the word should!!And I haven't even mentioned the quality of the writing: It's on par with what an average high school student could come up with.The prose is an uninvolving paint-by-the-numbers job ,that would never have been considered fit for printing, if it weren't for the &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; brand name.Other concepts in the book are equally improbable, like the multi-national counter-terrorism force (so much for Op-Sec) after whom the book is named.Granted, good and realistic ,special forces litterature is hard to come by but you could hardly do any worse than &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;.By the way, I would have liked to give Tom Clancy's &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; a rating of &quot;zero&quot; stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"...Clancy undoubtedly is good action writer and a writer who knows the technological gadgetry that goes with the covert operations game. This he uses to good effect.However, I found most characters unidimensional at best, and although Clancy attempts at times to get beneath the skin of the protagonists, in my opinion, he does not succeed very much.Again, in an effort to build a story, he uses too many coincidences, and simplification of events. How else would you explain the fact that Popov was identified because the discarded passport was located due to a malfunctioning trash-can,...Far far too far-fetched!And one last irritiant, why does Clancy have to use '/' so often. Surely if he can last through 740 pages, he can do more than slash?..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the fifth Clancy novel I've read, and it is by far the worst. He must have gotten paid by the word to write this book, because it is much too long. The book is over 700 pages long, yet the same story could have been told in a novel less than half that length. It adds nothing to the storyline to go into great detail about physical training exercises or routine daily events. Whole paragraphs were devoted to what the Rainbow Six members and even the IRA terrorists had for breakfast! On the positive side, the action sequences were well written, though somewhat implausible. Not a single Rainbow member gets killed or even injured nor does anything go wrong until their fourth counter-terrorist operation. It also stretches the imagination to suppose that out of the nearly one hundred environmentalists not a single one of them would have attack of conscience about destroying most of the world's population and expose the virus plot to the authorities. The story itself is a good one and would probably make a great movie. It's just a shame the telling of it was so poorly done."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book lends further credence to Galton's principle of &quot;regression to mediocrity.&quot; Not only does Mr. Clancy give readers a feeble conclusion to his tangled plot, but he also managed to give the impression that the reader is in a video game, with the end of each chapter leading to a higher level of difficulty for Mr. Clark and his team.I was one of those tricked by the &quot;TOM CLANCY&quot; on the front cover of this book. If you want to be entertained while getting some insight about the world we live in, get a good history book. That would be a better use of your time and money. To Mr. Clancy, thank you for sharing with us your exceptional stories, but I think your Ryan and Clark franchise has already ran out of steam."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am glad that I finished Rainbow Six.The story is simple: An american-british special operations outfit, with two NATO and one Israeli alibi members, &quot;zaps&quot; incompetent terrorists in European countries. Only with more grueling gore and technical detail than in the statement above.Then there is that Eco-terrorist conspiracy by some gene-splicing geniuses and their likewise ecologically indoctrinated co-believers. Nice idea, bad execution.Previous Clancy books had me hooked as to their outcome and to the twists Clancy could apply to the storyline. This one I was glad I had finished.Even the rants about Eco-activists, vegans and feminists were boring after the first few. It is only symptomatic that female characters on the good side are either physicians/nurses or moms/grandmoms."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is typical of his other writings it was somewhat long, okay at 897 pages it is very long. This is by far one of his best writings, I have read many, and this is second to only a few such as Patriot Games. If you've never read a Tom Clancy book than you will be in for a surprise, his use of details is amazing, and he has a knack for always finding the right word in any situation. Tom Clancy is definitely one of the best authors alive today, and this is clearly displayed in this book, no other author matches his ability in writing long books that don't bore you. The book starts out with Jack Ryan, his wife, son-in-law Domingo Chavez, and his pregnant daughter on a plane going to England with the purpose of starting the \\"Rainbow\\" project, a group of multinational experts in intelligence, and military experts who protect the world from terrorists. There is a rise in military actions from the beginning, the reader follows the fighters through various missions, successful, and not. Then the reader meats a unique Russian Ex-KGB agent who works against Rainbow. Tom Clancy uses various writing styles in order to interest everybody from changing the style to make the reader go faster during the battles, to slow in the character development sections. The best part of this book is how Mr. Clancy draws a vivid picture of the terrorist mindset, which is extremely complicated with the fact that the majority of the terrorists are psychopaths. The plot has many turns, some of which are hard to follow, but the majority is extremely easy to follow which makes this an easy read. Rainbow Six is a great book for anyone, but there are some people that may be afraid of its length, and at almost 900 pages the fear is somewhat justified, you will not regret reading this book, but if you get bored extremely easy you might want to start with another one of Tom Clany's books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"One of the things that made Clancy's best novels great was the way he kept 20 interlinked stories going at once in descriptive, but not excessive detail that kept your heart racing. He had an amazing ability to protray each group from their viewpoint without judgement, and with some accuracy. He did the best and the worst of society. Apparent his hate of even the mildest of Environmentalists is too great to allow this type of protrayal, or he just didn't have time to do any research on Environmentalist any place other the National Review. His protrayals of the groups involved is shallow and unbelievable, and he has conpensated for only involving a few groups by increasing detail about things he clearly doesn't understand. This book is so bad it goes on the very short list of Books that I can't finish and plan to throw in the garbage to avoid punishing others with its poorly written drivel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Nothing better than Tom Clancy giving hell to the tree huggers. He should write a sequel about what happens to the group of people who are left to &quot;embrace&quot; nature."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a little pressed for time right now, but what I can tell the readers of this book, is that it is a great read. I enjoyed reading Rainbow Six, a real page turner. That's all I have."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I haven't read many Clancy books but of those that I have my favorite is between this one and Without Remorse. Those two books are connected by the main character of John Clark and in this story he creates an international anti-terrorism unit that could be attempted in reality, if not already done so to some degree. I rated the book four instead of five stars because it's been a long time since I read this (when it first came out and I had it signed). I also don't care much for the title and the antagonists of the story are not much more than a bunch of moustche twirlers. Beyond those very minor points I would recommend this book to not just Clancy fans but also fans of realistic military-strategy stories. I for one prefer stories on Clark over Ryan, but that's just my two cents."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has a big ego and is not afraid to let it show. Just look at the back cover. This book is about three hundred pages too long. All the extra material is Clancy demonstrating his knowledge of all things political, historical, and military. There is no character involvement and very little tension. The premise and some of the plot are fascinating and very thought provoking. That is the only thing that kept me reading until the end.Bring back the old Clancy please! Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising are five star books. Everything since then has been on a downhill slide. Read &quot;Arc Light&quot; by Eric Harry if you want to be reminded of Clancy in his good old days."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In short, this is the best book I have ever read. The characters are great and have lots of depth. The story revolves around an ex-Navy SEAL who starts up a counter-terrorist group called Rainbow. Also, The plot is gripping and I found myself not being able to put the book down for hours on end. The book starts off right, with a hijacking on a plane that keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat. Tom Clancy is a great author, and it shows through in this book. Go out and buy it today, and you will see that my statements are true."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Clancy expedition and he didn't let me down. I think I'm hooked. John Clark is a great character. The kind of guy that we want out there but are afraid to unleash. The story kept me reading all night. The way Clancy layed out this global terrorism was great. An International SWAT Team...It doesn't get any better. The length was not a problem. Ignore the negative reviews and go out and get this one. If you love a coldhearted warrior with some conscience (and a sense of humor...the ending sequence) you'll love Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. This book is terrible! Since I read &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot;, I've anxiously awaited each new Clancy book. Not anymore. I've likely read my last Clancy. He should be ashamed of himself."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is was a good book. Not great, good. Not bad, good. I mean, the few action scenes were very well written, the storyline was fair, but the ending wasn't as good as it should have been. This was my first Clancy novel (I mainly read it because of the game) and I thought it was a decent read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think this book is really good for fast readers but otherwise it is really long. But it does have a lot more action in the book than usual. I wouldn't recommendEd this to people who haven't read Tom Clancy because Rainbow Six isn't any thing like all his other books. But it is great for a third Tom Clancy read. If you like lots of action and a sort of mystery you will love this book. But it is sort of the same old save the world thing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think this book is really good for fast readers but otherwise it is really long.

I'm ashamed to say that I wasted around $6 and numerous hours reading this dumb book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of the best friction written by Tom Clancy. Simply exciting for those who love to read how the terroists are being killed by the elite commandos. The story is great, though the ending is a bit disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is definatly one of Tom Clancy's best so far, and was the first one of him that I read, instantly hooking me as a Tom Clancy fan. He shows readers many aspects and elements of terrorism that most (I hope! lol) of us don't get involved with, in a realistic way. Unfortunatly, the first time I read it, it wasn't until after I got past the first scene that I started to understand what was happening. But after I finished it, I went back and read it again. That time it made perfect sense. While rather confusing, it made me want to read more, because I was dropped into action on the first couple pages. If it was dry and boring, I might have put it down, and read something else. In regards to som negative reviews of this book, I think that some things that are lacked wouldn't be appreciated in this type of book. Long descriptions, too much character development, and too many plotlines would all take away from the action in this novel. If you spent all the time on that, it would be boring and uninteresting. Now, I am not saying that Rainbow 6 has none of those, but it doesn't have as many, so as to enhance the action of the novel. I highly recommend this novel for all Clancy fans, and even if you are not, it still makes a great read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I usually really enjoy Clancy's books. But this one is not one that you will read without putting it down. It took me over a week to read and I had to force myself to finish the book. Really not up to his usual standards. No suspense in the book at all."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading the prolouge of this book, I just couldn't put it down until I was finished. I've read several other Clancy books, but this one takes the price. Sure, it's a bit predictable, but it's written with the words of someone with real insight in the business, so it's well worth a buy!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six just seemed to lack that element of the unknown that won't allow you to put one of Clancy's books down. It was as easy to predict as a Disney movie. Other than that it was fun, and if you've already mowed the lawn and washed your hair it might be worth a read. Just too predictable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I don't usually read novels or thrillers, but I was tempted to buy this book because of it's cheap price, and I am now thoroughly glad I bought it. Clancy obviously knows what he's talking about when it comes to special ops and alike, the detail he puts into the several shooting matches is massive, with several pages devoted to just several seconds. The story was also a strong point, as it is a 'what if' scenario about the population killing virus, and the way he juggles the main characters involved is complex, but understandable. My main letdown of the book was the ending. But, ending aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book Rainbow Six is one of Clancy's best.

If you know some of the more intransigent people in the ecology and animal rights movements, it is not too much of a stretch to see how someone could contemplate such a wild and crazy scheme. Clancy is erratic -- some good and some bad -- but always compelling.

I would have liked more mention still of previous characters - interesting how Ryan was never mentioned by name, yet he would have contacted John about at least some of the personal things that happen in this story. Still - well worth reading if just for the fantastically exciting info about counter-terrorism! Some of the scenarios are really incredibly exciting!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"He is the dean of 'technothriller' but I think his creative juices are running a bit dry.

The bottom line is READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I read this book I was very disappointed. It is just about a SWAT team that goes around Europe shooting bad guys. Big deal. Even worse, the plot (which I won't reveal here) isn't as chillingly plausible as those in Clancy's earlier works. It's not believable, it's just dumb. This book falls far below Clancy's usually high standards. It propably makes a better computer game than a book. You'll want to read it if you are a Clancy fan, but if not, read one of his earlier, and much better works."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Pretty good book, but not his best. The story is a little slow at times, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read his previous novels, but am surprised by the amount of knowledge Mr. Clancy has of counter-terrorism. The research was good and I like the impending-event style of writing in this one- you're always expecting the team to go on another mission and who knows what can happen there? But all missions were exciting and detailed. One thing that kept me giving 5 stars is the weak plot, and the weak characters of the villains in the book. But overall, a book u can't put down easily and it makes for fast-paced and finger-biting reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The tactical detail outlined in the first operations is outstanding. As a former SWAT officer I believe that the operations written about are text book. While Clancy writes about some equipment we all wish we had his personnel placement and operational soundness would go well in a training debriefing.

I cannot put it down. Well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I come from a background of reading horror, sci-fi, and thriller, but Rainbow Six was the first Clancy Book I've read. I gotta say I liked it. Yes, the characters are all supermen. But I believe it is actually more realistic if a group of people like this existed than didn't. And to say that there was no plot is a lie . . . Although the first half of the book follows a repetitive path. But that's not the reason I give it four out of five. The dialog wasn't much different from character to character--you'll find all characters saying things \\"dubiously\\" quite often, and things like \\"you say so.\\" It seems like I'm being a prick but this is just something that irks me because it makes the characters feel unnatural. You may not be bothered by it.Besides that little thing, the book is superb. The action is intense, the technology is cool, and the plot is cool, the bad guys have a frightening plan, and the ending is kinda unexpected (won't give it away). And despite my previous remark about the dialog, I still find myself enjoying the conversations the characters have.

Well, after reading 'Without Remorse' (which I HIGHLY suggest), I decided that I might as well read the book that one of my favorite videogame series of all time is based on, Rainbow Six.Reading this book definitely has increased my enjoyment of the game, because it makes all the character much more personal. There's not much else to say that already hasn't been said, though I will say that the plot is actually quite believable, and therefore quite frightening. The only people who might not like this book are staunch environmentalists. Other than that, if you're a Clancy fan, especially of the videogames, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought the book was great, Some of the reviews considered the book too discriptive.

I read this book off and on for quite some time, but when I really got into reading it regularly, I could barely put it down. The descriptions of the characters were very good and made it feel like I really knew them. It was suspenseful and made me sit on the edge of my seat. This was one book where you really root for the good guys and wonder what the heck the bad guys are thinking. The ending seemed too easy compared to some of the missions throughout the book. I was expecting a more exciting ending, especially with the length of the book, and that is the reason for the 4 stars. I do, though, highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was basically about an anti-terrorist group in England that were all recruited because they are the best of the best.

In the meantime the same terrorist is creating a deadly disease and testing this disease on random homeless people they find on the street.The good points of this book is the action and close inspection to detail. The details in this story are really accurate and you can tell that the writer researched his information well. Another point that is good is his style of writing. You aren't just reading from the perspective of the anti-terrorist group or from the terrorists, you get a view from both sides.Some points that I didn't really like is how it gets confusing at some points. I read this book before and I didn't understand some of the things because its very military. But after enlisting into the military and learned a lot I read this again and I understood it a lot better.I would recommend this book to anyone that is into action books or military books. It is a good read and it will keep you entertained the whole time you read it. Although some points of the story are confusing the book is generally an easy read.Kevin Adams"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a reader of all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books, I find Rainbow Six to be the latest in declining quality. The storyline was not creative and seemed to be an extension and rehash of the ebola storyline of the past. The overall research was fair and not up to the high quality of some of the first books, i.e., Hunt For Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and Without Remorse. Troubling were the seemingly unprofessionalism idiosycncrocies of both the good guys and the bad guy. This book was definitely not up to the standards of Clancy's earlier books. I hope the next is back to his excellent researched and plotted books of the past."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I first heard of Tom Clancy when I got the computer game &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Now, I thought it was a pretty cool game (if darned near impossible to win... I didn't understand submarine tactics at the time), but it also came with a copy of the novel. I read 5 pages and was hooked.Rainbow Six is no exception. While the heroes we have come to know and love (Clark and Ryan) have grown past the stage where they're actually *doing* the work, but now they're plagued by the conscience of those who are responsible for others doing the work.Clark (aka Kelly) has captured my attention ever since I read &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, and Tom Clancy in his genius has always managed to keep the character consistent and enjoyable to read. He is the type of person many of us wish we could be. Capable of taking clear, decisive action at an instant's notice, but who also is a good role model and has a good, clear sense of ethics.In Rainbow Six, Clancy feeds you the plot in bits and pieces, much like his style in other novels. You keep finding out enough about what is REALLY going on so that you keep having to read more... and more... and more. Once you know what the plot is *really* all about, you have to sit back and go &quot;Oh My God&quot; for a brief minute or two, before diving back into the novel and trying to find out how the Good Guys will actually be able to Save The World. It turns out that the most unlikely person ends up being the hero of the day.All in all, I think this is one of Clancy's best novels to date, and I look forward to reading more from him in the future."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is probably one of Clancy's best books. Right from the hijack on the plane at the start of the book you're hooked. When I read this I could not put it down and sat reading it for hours. This book is very thick and some might find that offputting, but don't let it descourage you from a perfectly good read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy is getting lazy. This novel comes across as an expensive, overlong, self-indulgent Mack Bolan yarn. The author basically rehashes actual terrorist events, especially the exploits of Carlos the Jackal and the PLO. The German terrorists who conduct the assault in Vienna are virtual carbon copies of actual Red Army Faction members.Another flaw with this story is the near-invincibility of the protaganists. Clancy's commandos are basically bulletproof, which eliminates much of the suspense inherent in such a tale. The only &quot;good&quot; guys killed during the book are tertiary characters at best. Clancy's vaunted penchant for realism is sorely lacking here. I recommend Clear and Present Danger for a more accurate portrayal of combat.If you're interested in stories such as these, pick up a copy of &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not his best, but Clancy is definitely getting back in the groove after several disappointing efforts. Thankfully, the ever annoying Jack Ryan barely rates mention here. Instead, the book focuses on a small band of environmental extremists and their plans to &quot;save&quot; the planet from mankind. The plot is well presented, and to his credit, Clancy takes his time in revealing the full extent of the connection between a series of terrorist attacks and the environuts master plan. We, the readers, get to savor the way the suspense and mystery build, and then are finally resolved. Of course, there's the usual Clancy trademarks - two dimensional characters and far fetched premises (one wonders how realistic the environmentalist wackoes plans are, but the same applies for a sub full of defecting Soviet officers (Red October) or a war on the US declared by Japan in the mid 1990's (Debt of Honor)) but the basic premise is an intruiging one - namely, what if a bunch of people as utterly devoted to extreme environmentalism as people once were to Hitler or Marxism decided to pull out all the stops to achieve their goals? The ending was mildly disappointing, with a Clancy-esque shootout as opposed to exploring the deeper philosophical issues at hand (namely, how should mankind deal with people whose ideology overrides their basic humanity), but overall the book hit the spot. And it was certainly an improvement over the past few Clancy efforts, which seemed to be little more than caricatures of earlier Clancy works."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I definately enjoyed reading Rainbow Six but missed my favorite Clancy character, Jack Ryan. There was some references to the &quot;president&quot; but why the omission? The storyline was convoluted enough but the thread that went from the terrorise to the save the earth group was kind of a far stretch. Clancy does pull the needle through and gives the story enough glue only as he can and that made for a good read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a BIG fan of Tom Clancy's books. I have gone through 3 copies of Red Storms Rising and 2 copies of Clear and Present Danger and have read every book he has wrote. Having said that, this book is a disappointment.The premise of this book holds enormous promise. The mere thought of John Clark SEAL and Domingo Chavez forming an international multinational anti terrorist unit was enough for me to circle Aug. 3 on my calendar and clear my itinerary for that day.The first few hundred pages didn't disappoint. The resolution of the airline hijacking was superbly done, showing us not only what transpired but also the thought process of an experienced operative. The subsequent terrorist acts in the bank, private residence, and amusement park were absolutely riveting. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff stops.The main background plot is simply absurd. I will spare the details in the interests of time and those who want to read the book for themselves, but ! quite simply the plot has been done before in a James Bond film called Moonraker. This meglomaniacal, psychopathic scheme is suitable for the light fantasy of Ian Flemming but not the realistic thrillers we have come to expect from Tom Clancy.In addition, what made Clear and Present Danger and Red Storms Rising so good was not only the action but the superbly fleshed out characters, both protagonists and antagonists. It was action at its best, Cortez vs. Ryan, Andreyev vs. Robinson. Both sides were intelligent, rational, and played to win. Rainbow Six's antagonists were so far out on the ideological scale that it is a wonder they weren't institutionalized. I found myself not eager for our heroes to win the day but for something, ANYTHING to shut these lunatics up. I read each page, hopeful that a meteor would fall from the sky and kill these imbeciles so that we could return to the masterful action of the preceding pages.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The book! 's resolution is astonishingly unsatisfying. Our heroes di! scover and stop the evil plan not due to ingenious detective work but because an antagonist got cold feet, luck saves the world. The climactic battle is little more then a turkey shoot and the book gives about as much enjoyment. So much promise, so little delivered."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a strange one to rate. It was a solid book that was well thought out. The pages turned easily as you read. The problem was that it didn't inspire me to keep reading long into the night.The pluses are how well it was written and thought out. The story flows and is very believable. The characters tough and powerful, though not as scary as the young Clark of Without Remorse. You get a military action book that no one but Clancy can deliver.The minuses are minor, but still there nonetheless. We know that the Rainbow guys are tough and strong and in shape, that they are the best at what they do. Must we be told this every time they appear in a chapter throughout the whole book? Also, there is no mystery or suspense. You know Rainbow is going to utterly devastate the terrorists. In one part the plan for an attack was laid out, and in the next the opposition guessed the exact same thing that they had just laid out. This makes for the story to be a little too neat without getting the reader too involved.A small comment in reference to other reviews. This is a book of fiction. An author creates his works based on the frames of mind that his characters fit into. So fiction can in no way be construed as the author's \\"political agenda\\" or that these are Clancy's personal beliefs. It is fiction, not a treatise or diatribe, and therefore should be read as entertainment, not as Clancy's personal venue to assert his beliefs (as other reviewers have asserted).All this being said the book focuses more on getting from point A to point B, rather than the military action so enjoyed in Without Remorse (although there is plenty of the military action). I would recommend this book definitely. Would I say it was great? No, I wouldn't. But I would say it is worth the read.3.75 stars."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished the book and I was disappointed. The realism of the plot, technology and the real-life type characters (that were hallmarks of his earlier books) have given way to story that is dumb. Not only are his books getting really fat --Tom: as a helpful hint, let an editor do some trimming-- but it is now populated by characters who are all super men, super dedicated and fighting to save the world on a just in time basis. While that formula may work for Robert Ludlum, it detracts from the believability that have made the earlier Clancy novels so entertaining, engrossing and keeps you eagerly waiting his next book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"First, the nits:1. One character has a male calico cat. Male calico cats almost never exist in real life. Knowing his penchant for wordy explanations of every darn thing, one would think that if Clancy knew this, he'd remark on how Dr. Brightling got her rare cat. (genetically engineered him? That would have been cool.)2. A character eats an egg salad sandwich and mentally comments about his companion with a pastrami not being 'vegan'. Vegetarians eat dairy and egg products, while 'vegan' is a term for people who only eat plant-derived foods.It's not too hard to find definitions of the above terms, so why did Clancy misuse 'vegan' for 'vegetarian'? Which leads the astute reader to wonder how much Clancy really knows about the eco-freak organizations he ruthlessly lampoons throughout this book.This is a really lazy effort by a writer who has obvously done everything he can with the genre. Sure, he may know his guns, helicopters, and tanks, but...his characters are cardboard, and I'm pretty sure Clancy has a bunch of cut-and-paste text files he throws in every 20-30 pages just to save on brainpower. All those repetitive, testicle-headed 'musings' by Clark and Ding (retarded nickname, by the way)about being Proud Americans with Razor-Honed Troops and How Great It Is To Command The Very Best Of The Good Guys. I guess this is supposed to convey to the reader how really deep and committed these wonderful soldier/spooks are, but it really just exposes the shallowness of police thinking, and makes me scared to think that there may be real people with guns out there who are equally incapable of coherent non-jingoistic thought.Basically, this book was a moneymaking venture and maybe a bit of a soapbox against environmental extremists, but not really a very good work of fiction.On the plus side, I did read to the very end. What the heck, even though the characters were all cardboard, Clancy can create some good tension. That's the only thing that raised this story to 2-star status."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I hope till the end that the story would improve in a strange and dramatic way... but it doesn't... this is really a waste of money and time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Poorly written and thoroughly predictable. At one point I wondered if this book was not written by TC since the style was miles away from 'Red Storm Rising' and 'The Hunt for ...'. Then I wondered if maybe TC needed money and it was therefore necessary to finish the book in record time. In any case the next book from mr. Clancy that I buy will not be a hard cover, instead I will wait untill the paperback version comes out. In short mr. Clancy has been removed from my 'must read' list."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was really great because the story line was so interesting and suspenceful. This is one of Clancy's greatest books!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. The length of the book is a mystery as any amateur editor would have cut 35 to 50 percent of it out and thrown it in the trash can. It seems like he took pieces from his previous books and tried to change the plot and characters to fit. Not one of seven writers who reviewed the book liked it. I read the first 100 reviews and realize some fans would like reading Tom's grocery list and would give it 5 stars. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also The Notebook is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and 'Seeker' by Frazier."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This Clancy book was a good one, but several have topped it. I sorry to say this, but there are too many grammatical errors."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Despite some of the negative reviews I've seen here at Amazon.Com for Rainbow Six, I actually really enjoyed it. Without spoiling anything, the terrorist incidents and some of the characters, no matter how unrelated and irrelevant they may seem in the first few hundred pages, are all key parts of a plan to wipe out the world's population to achieve an insane goal. The ending, though, was poetic justice at its very best. Bravo to Clancy for another top-notch thriller! But next time, how 'bout another good Nation vs. Nation pot-boiler?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although I am a loyal fan of Tom Clancy I just had to put this book down. Why you ask? For one thing the book was just to drawn out, possibly if he had condensed the book a little more i would have liked it. It's also not as realistic as some of his other books, the terrorist plots are just to far fetched and the terrorist counterstrike team never seems to have anything bad happen to them. Overall I'll have to give this book ***"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The idea is good. Anyone who thinks that this cannot happen has their heads buried in the sand. However, the story itself is weak. The &quot;good guys&quot; win way too easily. Anyone in REAL spec-ops knows it is never this easy. There is even some hints of plagiarism in this book. Tom, have you been reading Dick Marcinko's Rouge Warrior books? If not, and I think you have, you should, and you will see what REAL spec-ops personnel go through."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book reads just like one of his op-center &quot;gee, i need to make an alimony payment, better write something&quot; books. It is terrible, with the worst ending he has ever written. Read &quot;Sum of all fears&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love Tom Clancey's novels, but you can skip this one. I was actually bored while reading this."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm tired of people who know nothing of what it means to be in Special Operations writing about it-- and getting it wrong, time and time again. Clancy doesn't have a clue what the true spec-ops guy is and this book is the worst of his stuff yet. Hunt for Red October was good, but this-- the bad guys are such idiots a girl scout troop could take them down. And the good guys aren't. I served in the military because I believed in democracy not to be judge, jury and executioner. Even Dick Marcinko's stuff is better than this. Or check out Andy McNabb's SAS books. Or Bob Mayer's special forces series. Let's get is straight."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is wonderful. You have to know something about the military, but if you pick it up you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy puts tons of action into this novel. He is very detailed but not blurry in his description of the elite force and it's missions. Clancy has done again what I think he does best, developed a smart, realistic, and very frightening possibilty of terrorism and war."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Tom Clancy novel and I have to say that I truly enjoyed it up to the end. I thought that the ending was somewhat predictable and boring. After reading 700+ pages I expected more of an intense ending and not some rush job. I think the ending must have contracted the &quot;shiva&quot; virus."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six was an excellent book. It was one of the best books I have ever read. It was full of excitment and tension."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels. I even buy them in Hardback because I can't wait to emerse myself in his world Jack Ryan etc. This anticipation magnified my dissappointment with Rainbow 6. This is a formula book with way too much formula. I found reading this book like jogging, you have to push yourself not to give up."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The main strength of the novel is its main idea - an all-out war on terrorism. Clancy focuses on John Clark, Domingo Chavez and other characters who have had minor roles in previous novels. While the action scenes were exciting, there was not much transition between them. Finally, the book appears to be targeted to the general population, and thus appears to be more of a financial endeavor on Clancy's part than anything else. In short, I did enjoy reading the book, but its quality was less than many of his other books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was a cunning novel which combined Clancy's skill as a military historian with his knack for writing engrossing fiction. Definitely the best book yet!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"...*somebody* needs to edit it for spelling and punctuation. The errors are glaring. It's distracting to read.And here's an idiom that is used too often: &quot;for him, killing is as automatic as zipping his fly after taking a leak.&quot; Interesting the first time. Do we have to repeat it again and again?I always expect the best from Tom Clancy, and he should hold his editors to the same high standards.I remain an avid Tom Clancy reader."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has gone from bad to worse. Both &quot;Executive Orders&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; have basically boiled down to Republican manifestos and Clancy's own paranoid delusions. In this book, the Rainbow team is basically invincible and the battle sequences are all the same. The end of the book was too short and was not very satisfying. Clancy's books have become longer but lack the character development and plots of his earlier works."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I had heard many people say that this was one of Clancey's best books. In reading it, it is a slow paced story with many technical innacuracys and one could take out a couple of hundred pages and not miss anything. Would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Tom Clancy book i ever read. I picked this book, because i have the game Tom Clancy's rainbow six.

I read it and i was amazed, by the visual picture Clancy can put in your mind! The next day i went and bought the book and started reading.This book is a great book if you feel like you need some action in your life. It's my favorite book I ever read. If you read &quot;WITHOUT REMORSE&quot; you NEED to read this book, trust me. It stars John Clark, and his son Ding Chavez.

If you're not in the US military then how are you expected to know what half of this stuff means. A lot of writers of military stories now include a brief glossary, explaining various technical terms but just telling us what the acronyms stand for would improve the book immeasurably. Maybe some of these abbreviations are American slang, but being English I don't know all of them and therefore, at some points in the book I feel like I've missed some joke or crucial point.Apart from this It was an decent effort, keeping me gripped right to the very end. It occasionally reached the point where I stayed reading so late into the night that I stayed awake until it was daylight again. I just couldn't wait to find out how it all ended, and as with all of Clancy's books I was not disappointed.However, I do feel that Tom Clancy has started to become a bit of a treehugger himself, instead of writing thriller stories for the thrill, and I think it all started with The Sum of All Fears. I think it is a bit of a shame because his earlier books (like The Hunt for Red October) were so good, and so believeable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just completed &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; by Tom Clancy.

Or, to use another &quot;old&quot; phrase, &quot;If it wasn't one thing, it was another.&quot; Where is Jack Ryan when you need him?I've always liked John Clark as a supporting character, and might like him as a lead if Mr. Clancy hadn't put in so many disasters.Mr. Clark has found himself the head of a unique organization set up to fight world terrrorists - but only when asked to help. This man was busier than the CIA during the Cold War. It became too improbable, even for a diehard Tom Clancy fan like myself.The action was so non-stop, I began to ask myself, &quot;Will this insanity never end?&quot;I think there might be a future for John Clark and his son-in-law as new crime fighting heroes; they are both very likeable and talented. Mr. Clancy just needs to calm his exuberance and deal with one or two major world-peace shattering terrorist events rather than 10 - one right after the other.I was exhausted after reading this one!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a Clancy fan from the first time I picked up Red October. While his characters have always been two dimensional, the plots and action sequences have kept you glued to the pages and the story lines were never been predictable....until now. R6 bears none of the hallmarks we have come to expect from Mr Clancy. Instead it feely borrows from the plot lines of previous novels while the action sequences stumble along like a drunken sailor on a week long binge. This novel might have done better if his editor had been awake when it crossed his or her desk. We might have been spared the sophomoric moral pontifications and interminable political rant."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is better than the OP-Center books, but not quite up to Hunt or Clear and Present Danger. At least there is quite a bit of action. If you like action, I recommend an author who was in special forces and writes about what he knows: Bob Mayer. Check out his books here at Amazon and treat yourself to one. I've read all six and enjoyed them all.

After hardly eating or sleeping for 2 days, I was finished, and I dont care what anybody else says. The story maybe slightly far-fetched (okay, may more than just slightly), but its a damm good read, with good characters, ripping action, and a very satisfying conclusion. Highly recomended!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has improved from recent books that had more brain-numbing detail than action.

His best offering since Cardinal."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Rainbow Six. Constant action keeping you riveted to the novel not wanting to put it down. Well researched and documented novel with an abundance of eye opening scenes.

Begins with a bang right from the start and continues at breathtaking pace until the very end. It's really hard to find a place to put this book down.In this book, Clancy brings back John Clark, CIA operative, and Ding Chavez, Clarks long time side-kick. Remember Clear and Present Danger? Clark heads up an anti-terrorist organization made up of multi-national &quot;best of the best&quot; soldiers. They take you through breathtaking plot after plot. At the same time Clancy weaves the master plot throughout.This is a truly gripping novel you will thoroughly enjoy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"From the moment you read the first page, the text grabs you.

Following an excellent plot written by Clancy his new book is a must read for all of those techno-thriller fans out there.Nicholas Jorgensen"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. Not as deep as many of Clancys other books but still a very good read. I liked reading about John Clark and the Op Center type dealings. Good book worth the price."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I bought my copy of Rainbow Six for someone (a gift) and once they finished it they offered it to me. Reading nearly 800 pages of techno-war-political-thriller has its pros and cons; Clancy's stuff is great, but the story--and I thought it was a good, if not completely plausible one--is spun out over a mass of pages. I recall &quot;Without Remorse&quot; as less complicated but a lot more entertaining than ...Six. I enjoyed reading it and it's worth reading, but for those who don't want to devote a month or more of reading to one book, go elsewhere. If you, on the other hand, want to achieve the feeling of accomplishment, you'll be proud to complete this novel (and the ending's great, too). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I borrowed the full version book from the libuary and tried to read it but fell asleep about 12 times and never finished. So I tried the audio CD, and wow, it was sooo much better. David Duke does an excellent job doing a unique voice for each individual character and clear and crisp narration of the story, to the point that you can imagine a movie about this going inside your head with vivid (but not boring) details of almost everything. The story itself is pretty good too (but only possibly enjoyed by those with some knowledge or interest in military or policing matters). Its about the interesting and intricate formation an international black ops anti-terrorist Unit called Rainbow. The units go around the world stopping terrorist incidents-but thats not all or else it would be a boring story. In all the terrorist incidents Rainbow gets into involves this world wide conspiricy run by an American Company to -lets just say make the world a little more Green (not giving it away). So this story is really good all the way from an interesting creation story of covert gov. unit to a multifaceted sorta spy's detective story with everything imaginable with spies, trickery, FBI, defectors and etc. So if ya like suspense and military related fiction definitly, skip the book and get the Audio CD- ENJOY."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!!! On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10!! This is easily the best book Clancy has ever written. He wrote this book so well and so accurate. He obviously knows alot about Counter Terroist teams. He describes things correctly down to the gunshot wound. I could not put this book down it was so good! I recomend it to everyone. This book is about a team of CT specialists from differant countries and origins, hence its name Rainbow Six. The team comes into action just in time to takedown a few terrorists attacks. Unkown to the team and others but it is a part of a plot for a much bigger terrorist attack. This will be done by a type of tree hugging group that want to rid the world of humans. That is all I can tell you. But if you don't read this book you will never find out the end of this great story!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a college student who loves to read fiction/fantasy works. This is the second Tom Clancy book I've attempted to read (the other was Clear and Present Danger, which I tried to read when I was 13; needless to say, it was a bit over my head at the time). I'm about halfway through it at the time of this review, and I can honestly say it's becoming one of my favorite books on my 'all-time' list. Sure, it doesn't have the emotions and deep character thoughts that comes with the fantasy territory, but it is an excellent read. I'm a fan of politcal intrigue, and this book definitely has lots of that. Intense action scenes after several pages of careful planning...intersting characters with backgrounds from other books that I shall have to read after this one...and a 'mystery story'plot that makes you wonder if this sort of thing happens daily (it probably does, but I'm just an Average Joe; what do I know?). My quarrels with the book are: all the technical terms (SAS? NSA? At least I know what NPR is); confusion of who a character is when you here their name when they're not currently present (that's bound to happen in a book this size though); and lack of character thought (Ding, we know you get a bit edgy after killing someone, but what about everyone else?). However, I'll retain most of my judgements till after I finish it, and perhaps after reading a few more of his books to compare and contrast. So far though, so good. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is for the previous review entitled by 'A Reader.'I think they have some bad information here. It DOES get cold in Australia. Did you know they have penguins in Australia? It also snows there too? Australia has a diverse climate, depending on where you go. Much like America."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is good because it is something that could happen. John Clark and Ding Chavez return in this story about a multi-national counterterrorist team. Clark, whom you remember from Without Remorse and every Ryan book from The Cardinal of the Kremlin on, is the leader of the team, which is headquartered in Hereford Air Force Base in England. This book is simply excellent. The action sequences where team rainbow takes down the terrorists are great, and the story is good, and makes you wonder what will happen next. The mail problems are the lack of character development and the Australia Olympics scheme. It is cold there in our summer, that is why we had to wait several months, for it to warm up there. Nevertheless, an engrossing story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In Rainbow Six we see John Clark and other old friends like Chavez assembled into a super elite counter terrorism force. In several exciting scenes we see them take out terrorists in a variety of locales, my favorite of which is an amusement park. We also get to read about super high tech military gadgets such as a device that can pinpoint anyones location through detecting their heartbeat. The climax to the novel is humorous and gratifying."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is simply this: a must-read for the espionage/action lover. By far Clancy's best yet."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of my favorite Clancy books. Jack Ryan gets thrown into the Presidential seat through a horrible accident, and from that moment he stays focused on his beliefs and morals, vowing not to become a politican. Everyone around him is doubtful of him surviving the pressure, media attention, and ability to lead our country. Ryan immediately takes charge in his own honest, caring, humble ways, and starting with the Secret Service agents, he quickly begins to command respect, and loyality.They (S.S agents) know this guy is different from other politicians they have had to protect and although he makes it difficult for them to keep him secure. They understand Ryan isn't doing things for future &quot;votes&quot;, but because he CARES. As he becomes more popular, an ex-vice president decides Ryan's all wrong for the job he feels should be his. Fear of terrorism begins investigations through FBI/CIA/NSA, and in true Clancy form, a totally diffrent plot is beginning to develope across the other side of the world. Ryan brings his militay perspective into play with the developing terrorism information surfacing. World leaders and terrorists beware! Ex-Marine/CIA Agent Jack Ryan Has a temper and you dont want to be on the wrong side of that! Clark and &quot;Ding&quot; are superb (as usual) and the attention to detail that Clancy brings to his stories keeps it all to REAL! The mix of ruthless killing and family values, honor and deceit, religion and extinction, helps to make this book very hard to put down for long. Tom: Keep em' coming ! Lets get these remaining &quot; Ryan&quot; and &quot;Clark&quot; books on the silver screen. Thumbs up Mr. Clancy!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When i saw tom clancy's newest book, Rainbow six. I was excited. I'd just started reading his books and was looking forward to reading one with everyone else. Ok, now the book. The book was a standard clancy novel with the big letdown in the middle just to make the book longer. I has no mention of Jack Ryan at all whatsoever. The plot was decent when you didn't know what it was but it gets really really bad. The mission parts were fairly decent but confusing at times(like in most of his books you need to re-read stuff). The ending was ok but clancy doesn't seem to be willing to let some of his characters go. Even Price,Loiselle and Weber were untouchable. He doesn't talk about the past of anyone at all. The only really significant character he introduces is Dimitry Popov, who you should pay attention to from page 1. Unfortunately though the book is much too long to make a whole heap of sense afterwards. It doesn't leave any loose ends and if your really don't want to read it but still want to be able to follow the Jack Ryan Storyline then you can safely skip Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm the kind of guy that'll gladly read any spec ops novel. When I saw R6 at the bookstore, I salivated at the thought of a long, fat, juicy, Clancy spec ops extravaganza.This novel has great potential, but the writing is a little underwhelming, as if Readers Digest had whitewashed it.Clancy's main problem is that he makes his lead characters too proper, too polite, too middle-class. As in, &quot;let's shoot up some tangos (with regrets of course), then let's get back to cornflakes, barbeques, and apple pie.&quot;This Americana formula has served Clancy's bank account well, but it robs his novels of sass and of psychological complexity. Compare R6 to any of Richard Marcinko's or Ralph Peters' novels, respectively, and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is even worse that &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, and that is really saying something. And it's too bad, because Clancy is still capable of writing fanastic action scenes. But Clancy isn't writing technothrillers anymore-- he's writing moron right-wing screeds that should embarass anyone who once called himself a Clancy fan.In this one Clancy has yet another pathetic woman who messes everything up, and yet another terrorists-release-virus-to-kill-everyone plot. I can't believe he had the guts to recycle that from &quot;EO&quot;, and I was in even greater disbelief when he has the president of the Sierra Club thinking out loud how great it would be if the President got himself assassinated. That's just pathetic, such a lazy cheap shot that I can't believe the punching bags called his editors let it slide.The book is boring, like &quot;EO&quot; was, and stupid. Still, the parts where something is actually HAPPENING, the parts when the Rainbow Six team is actually going about its business, are still a blast to read. But that's maybe 5 percent of the book. The rest is just a mess.Now that Clancy is an industry and not a writer (see his NetForce and OpCenter imprints) he apparently doesn't feel the need to put out work of the quality of &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;. It's too bad. I used to look forward to Clancy's latest release with baited breath. Now I won't waste my breath. This will be the last Clancy novel I read, unless I hear that the book is under 600 pages and actually makes some sense."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think Tom Clancy has written some interesting novels in his career, but Rainbow Six displays some of Clancy's worst faults. The narrative is peppered with Clancy's own personal viewpoints on certain matters, reducing the suspension of disbelief so important for a thriller. To me a good writer should be an *impartial* teller of a tale, without injecting the book with the writers views on some matters. For example, a made up and fairly inoffensive example might go;John Clark took a swig of Miller Lite and grimaced.\\"Ugh, tastes like s***!\\" And he was right, all Miller beer tasted like s***.Such lapses are as disconcerting as watching an intense movie and then having an actor look directly at the camera and say \\"I'm only doing it for the money\\".Another writing fault is with national sterotypes, particularly the English. I lost count of the number of times I read such sub Spitfire pilot stuff like \\"Good show, old man!\\" \\"I say chaps\\" \\"Rather\\" and other outdated phrases. Tom Clancy seesm hellbent on injecting the most tired and cliched \\"Briticisms\\" and every oppurtunity. He seems to be wracking his brains for ways in which his English characters can say \\"bloody hell\\" \\"loo\\", \\"telly\\", \\"chappies\\", \\"wally\\" etc. Yes Mr Clancy, The \\"Brits\\" do talk differently, as you seem to delight in pointing out, but we kind of get the idea after the 100th time. I'm not English and not innately offended by any of it (I live in Scotland) but the English charcters are so overdone that if Clancy had intoduced a Scottish character I'd seriously half expect him to be called Hamish MacDougal, wear a kilt and play bagpipes. It'd be almost comical if it didn't get so tedious. And as I said most of these are *outdated* phrases. To me it's as odd as having the American characters talk ike Hopalong Cassidy or somebody from a Charlie Chan movie;\\"Well gee, pardner, any news on the wherabouts of them low down horse rustlin' varmints? Let's head 'e, off at the pass\\"\\"Say, what's the big idea?\\"\\"Gee, you're a pretty swell fellow\\"Sound ridiculous to appear in 1998 novel? Of course it is. And most Clancy national stereotypes are just as cringeworthy.So overall, this book has me turning the pages, but it hasn't made for 100% smooth reading so far."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to like Tom Clancy's books. But it seems to me, and a lot of other people, that the newer stuff is just crap.Where do I start with this one? The characters were two dimensional, they heroes were more like superheroes that could do nothing wrong. The story if so repetitive it borders on funny. The villian is an oxymoron, he's the president adn CEO of a corporation, yet he's a tree-hugger. And to make it worse, he has an idea for world domination that looks more like something out of a bad James Bond movie. Then to top it off, Clancy obviously didn't do his research when he was writing, because he seems to have forgotten that when it's summer in the US and England, it's winter in Australia.Overall, the book is lacking and seems to be on the collapse of a once good writing career. If you want to read a book written by someone who knows how to write an anti-terrorism unit book and not as long, go get OMEGA FORCE: THE GHOSTS OF WAR."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I was a teenager, I burned through all of his early books in a few days, completely absorbed in the exciting military battles and intriguing political maneuvering. But it's clear that starting with this book, Clancy has run out of boogiemen. I'm an environmentalist, and although his topic of environmental terrorism didn't insult me, the bumbling, utopian narrative spewed by the disturbed tree-huggers did make me cringe. I remember turning each page, hoping, begging, to find something interesting to grab onto, but in the end it was a giant letdown. He started to lose it somewhere around Debt of Honor, but this is sure proof that he simply ran out of enemies. How much more Robby Jackson talking jive can you take? Or Ding spewing his East L.A. street-slang? The characters and plots are now cliches. Oh well-it was good while it lasted."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If I have somehow overlooked this, then I am the fool but, A bit of a spoiler so don't read if you hate to know important data! I better get this in now, I enjoyed the book. Great way to pass the time, but glaring inconsistency must be pointed out. The premise is that Shiva is released through a spritzer-type coolant system at the Austrailian SUMMER Olympics. Gang, look at the Today show, consult your globe, Which Mr. Clancy obviously didn't do! IT'S WINTER IN AUSTRALIA WHEN IT IS SUMMER HERE!!!! Which just about kills the whole idea of introducing Shiva in Australia with a device designed to cool the crowd, when the crowd is already huddling in 40 degree weather!!! It's this type of asinine mistake looked over obviously by every editor and reviewer,that makes Americans look bad to everyone. I mean c'mon doesn't anyone pay attention, especially Mr. Clancy the particular &quot;Uber-American&quot; who espouses American superiority in every page. I have no problem with Americans on top, I just want to make sure every American actually knows where the &quot;top&quot; is &quot;down under.&quot; I invite any exchange to my yahoo address djamesnm@yahoo.com. I will not respond to obvious diatribes, honest criticism or disagreement is the First Amendment baby, I live for it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was so superbly written it stunned me. The way clancy meticulously describes every detail made you very anxious. I could not put this book down and read it in 3 days. 740 pages of pure genius. Some might say clancy is strange, crazy, or the like. I agree completely, which is why his work interests so many people. Some of his work is so frightening is actually scares you (LIKE THIS). If you want me to tell you one book to read, definetly this one, no doubt about it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a 11 year old boy. I read this book because I knew that Tom Clancy was good (read the Sum of All Fears), and that Rainbow Six was on a SWAT commando style topic.The book begins with an exciting plane hostage situation, where the stars of the book, and also the members of Rainbow Six, an international elite force designed to eliminate terrorists across the globe, are on board the plane as it happens.Then, Clancy describes the training in full detail, while still keeping it exciting.The first &quot;official&quot; mission of Rainbow Six is a terrorist threat in Switzerland. Clancy spends a while on this one, but again keeps it exciting.I won't give away the rest, because why read a review when you've already read it?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a 14 years old boy from Norway!

Buy this book if you want some excitement! Its worth the money!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is an interesting read, but it's not up to the level of Clancy's previous work. John Clark and Ding Chavez are still great characters, and the insight into their family life is good, but the plot is sloppy and predictable, the anti-environmentalist stance is thrown in the reader's face ad nauseam, and the brutality of the situations, while necessary, is repetitious and eventually tiresome. I became thoroughly sick of the phrase &quot;splattered brains&quot; and its less than subtle variations. I am looking forward to the next book in the Jack Ryan universe, but I hope it's written with more care than this. Clark and Chavez are great, but bring back Jack!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was on of the best Clancy novels I've read. This book starts out exciting and doesn't stop.

Intriguing to me, interesting to me, the way you know seeming unrelated pieces will come together. Mysteries explained but can you second guess the master and figuer out how they fit together?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I first read Rainbow Six when I was ten or eleven. Then it seemed great. I reread it recently at age 18 to see if I still enjoyed it, and found to my disappointment that it was not the same. My aim in writing this review is to provide the most helpful and completely honest review of this novel that I can. That being said, some background...I am not overly qualified to write a review of this book, as I am not well-versed in the details and minutia of military strategy and equipment. However, I am and have been a Clancy fan for many years, and have read his work widely.The quick and dirty version of this review is as follows: Rainbow 6 represents a significant backslide from the Clancy who wrote the famous Cold War Era books we all love. This is confirmed in most every other 1,2,3, and even some 4 star reviews that I have read. The plot is a mix of relatively unoriginal sub-stories and action scenes woven together into an in-congruent main story. The characters have little depth, as many others confirm, and (heroes and villains alike) demonstrate questionable, if not outright disturbing, mindsets. That being said, the jargon and technical data Clancy is given to producing is intact and interesting (to me), though some have found mistakes (I do not debate their existence, but I did not notice them and I do not feel that they detract from the story).The following paragraphs present more in depth analyses of these problems. They are listed in order of annoyance to me personally, but can be taken in any order and have no intrinsic rank. Next to the title of each are two numbers enclosed in parenthesis, the first of which represent how bad the particular problem is on a scale of 1 to 5. The second number represents how characteristic (1 to 5) that type of problem is to Clancy in general. In this way, Clancy fans can ignore comments with low first numbers and high second numbers, while new-to-the-author types can shy away from Clancy if off-put by high second numbers.REPETITION (5)(3):Much of this book seems to be recycled, either from other books, or, worse, from earlier pages in Rainbow Six itself. I cannot remember how many times the phrase \\"pure vanilla\\" occurred in the writing, but it was enough for me to notice and be annoyed - i.e. probably too much. The virus plot is also recycled as others have pointed out. Many scenes involving terrorist take-downs are carbon copies of each other. I cannot count the number of times that someone \\"put 3 10mm hollow points\\" through someone else's head, but again, it was too many. Clancy always has some of this, but I have not seen it this bad.DISTURBING IMAGERY (4)(1):Clancy, in my opinion, has always stayed pretty clean in his writing where violence is concerned. Not so in Rainbow Six. This novel is filled, literally to the 850 page brim, with violent images, gore, blood, and (in my non-military opinion) unwarranted and unnecessary killing (for instance, the team actually kills an unarmed [disarmed] terrorist after a hostage situation has been resolved. He is literally shot in the stomach and spleen, fatally, but not immediately fatally, injured when he poses no threat and could have easily been taken alive. This is a disturbing image, and a breach in the professionalism Clancy tries to associate with the team. There are more examples of unnecessary killing and gore throughout.DIALOGUE AND THOUGHT (4)(3):Dialogue is not one of Tom's strong suits, and never has been, but it seems just a little weaker in this book. Scenes which are supposed to have emotion and depth of feeling do not. There is no moment in this book (like there is in the sum of all fears) where I fear for the relationship between anybody. In fact, there are no relationships, because the dialogue to create them is so weak. An unfortunate lapse in proper writing - many good opportunities to develop the shallow characters were missed when the words fell flat. Thought process is also weak in this novel - nobody seems to actually think like a human. People spend so much time thinking about how proud they are, and how much they hate terrorists, that they never actually think about wanting to be home, never have fear or worry about making mistakes, never really ( I say really because attempts are made) consider the responsibility that they have. In addition, the villains actually have no thoughts - an unfortunate departure from the Cold War Era villains that filled Clancy's classics.CHARACTERS (4)(2):Tom Clancy is not Harper Lee, or Steinbeck, or Dickens. There are no characters in any of his books that are as real - as wholly human as Atticus Finch, Tom Joad, or Pip. But there used to be characters that you could get behind: namely Jack Ryan. Like all the other fans, I understand John Patrick Ryan's days are done, and Clancy needs someone else. The shameful part is that he takes two great, round characters (Domingo Chavez and John Clark) from previous Jack Ryan novels and nearly ruins them. Luckily, Clark maintains some depth and can still be appreciated, but Clancy has actually managed to flatten the round character of Chavez - a feat impressive, but in a bad way. No other characters except the oft mentioned Popov really seem to be their at all. Unfortunately, Clancy also makes the characters (good guys in particular) unlikable - they are all egotistical masters of warfare who care little for life and who enjoy slaughter. I understand duty. I understand military ethos. I read a book by Navy SEAK Chris Kyle who hated terrorists and did not pause before shooting armed enemies dead. But even Kyle had a sense that he was ending someone's life, and I doubt he would have had the gall to joke about the hole he put in somebody's head whilst standing over their body. Some things are off limits. But apparently not in R6.GENERALIZATIONS (5)(5):This is a problem that has always been HUGE in Clancy's work. People are grouped by one shared characteristic, and then assigned whatever beliefs Clancy wants to assign them. For instance (all examples taken from R6) all terrorists are foolish and ideological. Ok. Well what about the terrorists that are religious? Or smart? Or who just don't give a damn and are out and out crazy? Also, all military soldiers are geniuses, incapable of error, against terrorism in a \\"snipe your wife and kids in the stomach and leave them to die\\" kind of way. I am not in the military, but if I was - I would find that generalization very insulting. All British people talk completely different than Americans (true to some degree, but not to this degree). Women are never in the service anywhere!? Every environmentalist is a terrorism-bound crazy. I am not entirely certain how I did not notice all of this in Clancy's writing before, but WOW! I can get past it, but really? Really?CAPTAIN AMERICA (5)(4):Nothing new here. I love my country. And maybe I will be damned but I think we do have it pretty right here (politics and all) in the United States. But we are not God. And other Countries do exist/are as good. This also applies to the heroes in the book of any nationality. As is usual in Clancy writing in R6 anyone American or \\"good\\" is indestructible, incapable of failure or accident, and in possession of the best technology. Anyone not US affiliated or \\"bad\\" is foolish and incapable - in fact the villains often seem to fall over and destroy themselves with no hero help needed. Annoying and unrealistic. We make mistakes like everyone else.Overall, I repeat my earlier sentiments. This book is fair - and based on a good, albeit VERY fictional, idea - but it suffers from a number of setbacks which impair the writing. Many Clancy novels suffer from these problems, but not to this degree. In fact, in almost every other novel of his it is easy to ignore theses issues completely (even on the third or fourth reread). I feel this is evidence of lazy writing and forced structure. Shameful, and un-Clancy-like.Good writing is often flawed, because all writing is flawed to some degree, but the mark of good writing is its ability to distract you so well with all of the positives that you never notice the negatives. In great writing, the flaws are hidden so well they are often invisible even when you are looking for them. Clancy is not and never was/will be a great writer - by which I mean on level with the true geniuses. But he was always a good one...at least...until this book. Read it once (but get it from the library) if you are a fan. Read The Hunt for Red October (again if you've read it once) if you are just into this genre. Run like hell if the military and endless detail are not for you.I hope this is of some help."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Have always been a Tom Clancy fan.

I always learn something from his books and I enjoy the read"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since Hunt for Red October. His books are always spell binders. Sometimes what he writes seems to be minutia, however, by the time you get to the end of the book you realize that the minutia was character development that is very germane to the story. I look forward to reading more of the Rainbow series."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is only the second book by Tom Clancy that I have ever read, and it was excellent. I loved it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I feel as though I cheated. I bought the game (PC Version) first and then read the book. I must say that the game pales to the mastery that Clancy exercises over the written word.In the game, you have a lot of characters who weren't in the book which is sad because I would have loved to see what Covington and Tomlinson were like on the game.The book is top notch in every way. It starts with a hi-jacking that is un-related to the crust of the book and builds from there believe it or not!!!If you had to narrow down this review to one word, it would be WOW."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This being the only Tom Clancy novel that i have read, i have to say i was greatly dissappointed. I found Rainbow Six an extremely predictable story of good guys versus bad guys. This book logged in at nearly 900 pages and yet the charactors were all one dimensional, the plot could be seen a mile away, and there were no suprises at all. The women, although educated, were incapable of comprehending the hard realities of the job the men performed - killing terrorist. Huh? The sexist nature of this novel portrayed women as liberal, pouting, drones best left to mothering children than worrying about politics. The vigilanty style justice at the end of this book was pure fantasy.On the positive side about this novel was, although way too long, it was a quick and easy read. The action was fast paced and rarely bogged down too much. My recommendation is that if you like this type of genre, you would be much happier reading anything by Robert Ludlum. His novels are far superior to Tom Clancy's."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought I'd give Clancy a try - after all, so many people read his books on the train that I am taking to work. What a disappointment! The writing is poor, the characters are 2 dimensional. I suppose &quot;Rainbow 6&quot; could be a comic book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked the anti-environmentalist stance, all the cool medical stuff, Popov, and the part where Rainbow gets ambushed at the hospital. That was about it. There were a few other interesting action scences early on, but other than that, the book was about 400 pages too long, and the plot was poorly thought out. I agree with the other reviewer who thought the foiling of the bad guys' plan was WAY too easy. It was clear that the part at the Olympics should have been the climax, and that the novel should have ended shortly thereafter. But no, it drags on and a second attempt at a climax is made in South America (and failed). It was as if Clancy planned to have a big battle scene in Sydney, then realised it wouldn't work for some reason, but instead of thinking around the problem just glossed over it and kept writing. Not too bad a book, if you're just looking to kill time, but not one of the better books I've read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"You have to love Tom Clancy for giving such a compelling and blatant middle finger to all tree-huggers. Clancy makes these kooks very hateable in Rainbox Six. While the plot really does seem far-fetched (I can't imagine a Ted Kaczynski type having access to the resources the granola-types have in this story, nor can I believe that that many people would be able to keep their mouths shut about a plan to exterminate most of humanity), the threat of bio-war is a real one and will become even more frighteningly possible in the next few decades. Like the work of most of today's popular writers, Clancy's work will never be mistaken for great art, but he spins a yarn as well as anyone and has a Stephen King-like knack for keeping the pages turning. I highly recommend it to anyone who just wants to read an entertaining story. Unless you're a member of Greenpeace, that is."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is definitely one of Clancy's great works. I love how he tied John Clark's aging career feelings with the plot, and showed how he almost &quot;grew up&quot; into his leadership role as Rainbow Six. Excellent details that kept the plot moving and the entire text interesting!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first read Tom Clancy book, but I am familiar with some of his other books. This book is one of the best books that I have ever read, and I have read quite a few such books. I totally agree with those of you that say a) that it is nearly the same as his other books, but that is what he writes about, and that is what he excells at. b) there are long boring parts in the story, but no, i will NOT call them boring, they are pretty long, but they mainly tell the storyline, and if you think in your mind that they are fun, they will be interesting and not boring. It tells a story about a former-CIA agent, John Clark who organizes a counterterrorism task force based in Hereford, England and how he and his team battle some terrorists very soon in the story, and the question arises, are they being tested or is there a connection, and as the reader will soon figure out there is a threat there to all mankind... Read it yourself and find out! It is a bit lengthy, but it is worth it. Those that did not like this book, I totally accept your thoughts even though they are different from mine."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's novel is everything a military brat could dream of. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Western European Powers must focus their military expertise for a new kind of warfare: urban, counter-terrorism. With the backing of the CIA and British 22nd SAS Regiment at Hereford, England, ex-Navy SEAL John Clark and Major Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez lead an elite counter-terrorism force, with members from Delta Force, GSG-9, and SAS. The weapons are fabulous: Heckler and Koch fully suppressed MP5 submachine guns, Remington Magnum sniper rifles, flashbangs, and heartbeat sensors. The main characters are well rendered and the reader is immersed in the action, plot, characterization, and the fears of the unexpected. Also, this book would make a good teamwork building trainer: you must rely and have total faith with each member of your team; otherwise you may fall victum to a tango's bullet. Personally, I hate terrorists. There was an incident over in the middle East at Khobar Towers that I would not like to happen again. Everytime a terrorist dies in this novel, I feel it is a personal victory."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is long but it flies by,especially in the cracking action moments(plenty).Its all about a group called Rainbow(anti-terroist)And Their leder John clark,the book mainly focus'on Ding(Domingo).All in all read it Its Clancy's best."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is another of Mr Clancy's excellent series of books which, typically for him, entertains, educates and treats hypotension all at the same time. The true beauty of this and all of this series of books is that you can actually learn interesting things while escaping the four walls that surround you. The only pity is that Clancy isn't one of a series of clones so that more books can become available faster. If you can't enjoy this book, you must have a flat brain wave and no pulse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was very disappointed, the characters are dull and the plot was not what I expected from this ex-great author Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is unusual to see a thriller writer's talents decline so rapidly (Alistear MacLean also comes to mind), but the writer of such passable works as Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising is no more. Whether it is because of his interest in writing Rush Limbaughish right-wing drivel, or because he is paid by the weight of his books, he has managed to become a caricature of himself, much like the pose he affects for his picture on the back cover. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is labyrinthine, and the dialogue is sophomoric. Shouldn't there be a lemon law for books so we could get our money back? That's a rhetorical question; I read a library copy, thank goodness!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've run into a first with a Tom Clancy book...usually, I'm interested that I literally hang on to every word, but in this one I've started to skip all the exposition scenes, in which the various eco-villains paraded their villany around in great tedium. Ah, yes, another page and a half of the Science Advisor thinking how much she hates all humanity. And now the researcher. And the hunter. And what feels like every one of the people who are involved in the project. The anti-environmentalist position started grating very early as well. The more I think of this one, the more I'm convinced that this one is going back to the bookstore tomorrow."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The only character that I found remotly interesting in Rainbow 6 was the former KGB agent, and I don't think he was supposed to be the main character. I found the plot to be extremely predictable, anad at no time was I worried that the bad guys would outsmart the good guys.On the plus side, this novel was easier to get into then the last couple of Clancy's novels.In other Clancy novels, the plot has been strong enough to carry the lack of character development but this one wasn't."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been reading Clancy's books for a long time, but it took Rainbow Six to crystallise something that's been nagging at me for a while. Where before had I encountered his great narrative skill and breath-taking and totally convincing technical descriptions combined with cringe-making simplistic extreme right-wing politics? Starship Troopers came to mind, but Heinlein always seemed(to me at least)a little tongue in cheek. Then suddenly, as I was recoiling in distaste at the vigilante ending of Rainbow Six, it hit me. Rename John Clarke as Kimball Kinnison, put a mysterious Lens of Arisia on his wrist, rename Sandy O'Toole as Clarissa McDougall, and it all slips into place. The parallel with the Lensman Saga is uncanny - superb spectacle and excitement, but two-dimensional stereotyped characterisation - convincing and meticulous exposition of technical detail, but a simplistic eulogising of institutionalised violence which would have embarrassed the Waffen SS. Everything, including credible character development, is subordinated to the action and the hardware.John Clarke/Kelly deserves more development as a character, and Without Remorse proved that Clancy can do it. Otherwise we need Jack back as Clancy's most compelling character by far. On the basis of Rainbow Six, the sooner Jack Ryan starts having &quot;inappropriate physical relationships&quot; with his aides and resigns or gets impeached, the better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book really disappointed me. I've read all of Clancy's stuff except for his last couple and the Op-center series. Since it has been so long since his last one I was hoping this would be gripping. It's not. The plot could easily have unfolded in 290 pages rather than 740."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot; I commented to several friends how I'd love to see Clancy's next book feature Clark and Chavez as the main characters. He must have read my mind!&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was no disappointment. It starts out with a bang (literally) in the very first chapter and, with Clancy's usual flair for the inexorable twists and turns of a good plot, kept this reader turning the pages (and ignoring other things that needed to be done).I laughed out loud when reading the guidelines for the review, and #1 was to leave out profanity. If Clancy overdoes anything in this book, its the gutter-talk that permeates every bit of dialogue. Please! Anyone could expect some #@&amp;*#!, but enough is enough!5 Stars, definitely, and I'll be first in line for the next Clancy novel, and won't be disappointed if it's a sequel.And by the way, has it struck anyone that the Sudanese factory bombed 8/20/98 was called &quot;SHIVA&quot;???"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a die-hard fan of Tom Clancy and his genre, I read every one of his real books. This one, while still a thrilling read, shows signs of a declining Clancy. The element of beleivability in this book is somewhat missing, and Clancy goes way overboard with the right-wing thing. Clark and the little bit of Ryan have lost their punch, and Ding is a bit too much like, say, James Bond? Clancy is way too anonymous and unspecific about the bad guys at first, and this book has Clancy's biggest flaw in full: A lousy ending. Unless Clancy stops trying to buy the Vikings, CEO his new company, and doing all this op-center stuff, his books may not be long for my world."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Interesting anti-terroist commando missions, and lots of them -- these parts will be read with pleasure, compulsively.But the book is fatally flawed -- bland villians, and a pathetically ludicrous MacGuffin...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy really missed the boat on this one, the plot was foolish, the characters were stereotyped comic book characters, he might as well have been writing a bat man book! I was a HUGE Clancy fan, but this was a book I had to struggle with after 200 hundred pages. It is not the size that is a problem, but the politics and missing story plot. This book offended me pretty harshly, so much so I might not pick up his next offering until I heard a lot of good reviews. I have never agreed with Clancy politically, but now, I think that Clancy is actually MORE conservative then Rush Limbaugh!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With Rainbow Six, Clancy has written a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; novel, change the names and places, but the basic plot remains the same. If you have read some of Clancy's most recent Ryan novels, this one seems to follow the same pattern. Rainbow Six is still a thriller, but best enjoyed by someone who has read some of the other John Clark stories that Clancy has written. Without those, a new reader would not appreciate much of the background that is implied but never really stated."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love Clancy's writing, with an abundance of technical details and swift, brutal justice for the bad guys. It seems that Clancy foresees actual world events as he is writing each book. Rainbow is an anti-terrorist task force and the week the book came out, there were two terrorist bombings in Africa. Too bad we didn't have a real &quot;Rainbow&quot; to go after the terrorist leaders as Clancy would have them do.The plot of Rainbow Six is a good one, with the task of saving the world (literally) upon John Clark's shoulders. A 20% edit in length would have made for a four star review. Some of the chapters were as routine and boring as the routine and boring training Ding remarks about."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"You want believable action-- read Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE in paperback. It's cheaper than this tome and much better. Besides, Dalton is a former Green Beret who knows what he's talking about first-hand. This book was simply too long, too unbelievable. I liked Clancy's first books, esp Hunt For Red October but ----"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I wish Clancy would get off his high horse. Why is Rainbow full of Americans? British snipers have represented their country in the Olympics and won medals yet Clancy reckons they aren't good enough. He rightly points out that the Special Air Service Regiment is the best unit at Anti-terroism yet the force is made up of Americans who have had little experience in actual situations. Not a bad story, I bet the tree huggers have a go at him now. John Clark is the best character he has created, Ryan is such a goody goody. By any chance is Clancy Catholic, like his heroes, and Jesuit trained, like Ryan? Red Storm Rising, Sum of all Fears and Without Remorse are his best to date."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy should be ashamed of himself. Its' (too few) action scenes are suspenseful. The part of the book, however, that surrounds these minor sub-stories is absolutely lacking in plot, character development or focus. It's almost as if it were dictated as free-association , with little or no thought given to story elements beyond, of course , reaching (in as many unnecessary words as possible) Clancy's morally depraved ending."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. After slogging 700 pages into it, I gave up the effort and gave the book away.Fundamentally, the entire premise is flawed. First, Clark and Chavez aren't very interesting people unless you like government sanctioned killers. Unlike Jack Ryan (who, while obviously president, is never mentioned by name), they have minimal ability, or more importantly, disposition to effect their environment. Consequently, Clancy's efforts to build the story around them becomes an exercise in tedium. His effort to include their wives only exacerbates the situation as this leads to the obvious comparison with Patsy Ryan.Secondly, it's a one idea book. To wit: Look, Ding, Look.... See the terrorists.... Kill, kill, kill.... Train some more.Finally, I found the politics frightening. Clancy's last two books have evidenced a particular fondness for police state tactics. Some examples which spring to mind were: the press misreporting Waco and Ruby Ridge, Oso expressing amazement when the terrorists were read their rights and arrested (instead of being summarily executed as implied)and Clark's statement that they were not bound by the niceties of the law. The depiction of the environentalist movement was so absurd as to be farcical.Overall, it was sloppy, wordy, mercilessly overlong and just downright disinteresting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"To the reader from Rock Springs, Wyoming: If you never finish Clancy's books, then why do you continue to buy them and critique them? I thought this was an excellent representation of Clancy's talents. The action never stopped. I can't wait untill his next Jack Ryan book. I read that he already has a couple hundred pages written. Clancy is the Supreme Writer of our time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My anticipation has turned into disappointment. The first hundred pages seemed to be very exciting then it stopped. I find the book to be very long-winded... Instead of 740 pages, the book could have been cut to 540 pages. I am very disappointed. His best book is Clear and Present Danger. Would I recommend this book? No."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This reads like a wooden Ops Center book, where we at least expect ghost writers.The characters have no individuality; the dialog looks like it was generated by a &quot;Mad Lib&quot; process (how many military types from different countries use &quot;Fair enough&quot; as a standard rejoinder?).The plot is beyond silly: not only do we have 3 basically similar setups to bulk up the book, but we also get the obligatory and pointless attack on Clark's family. The center in Brazil for the bad guys is only created in order to make the closing plot joke possible, and has no other reason to exist.Altogether, this was very disappointing. I've already stopped buying the Ops Center books. If Clancy can't be bothered to do a decent job, he shouldn't keep churning them out - he ought to have enough money by now."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's last several books have been interesting reads, but not the well rounded efforts of Red October, Clear &amp; Present Danger, and Without Remorse. When Clancy is on top of his game, you find the exhaustive detail-work of his lengthy set-ups to be fascinating and enhancing. It leads to a climax, a or series of them, that are equally detailed and thorough. When he's not, as in Rainbow Six (and his previous two efforts), the details are just formalities that come as Clancy-style literary baggage.I didn't throw the book down in anger when I finished it. But I was left with the feeling that the author had run out of energy and didn't want to devote the same attention to the books conclusion that he had to the massive text that preceded it, ... AGAIN!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"True to form, Tom Clancy has cooked up yet another super-tense technothriller. This time the threat is bioterrorism on a global scale, all part of a nefarious plot hatched by a gaggle of environmentalist wacko intelligentsia types that frequently find themselves on the receiving end of some unflattering commentary by Rush Limbaugh and his contemporaries. These \\"characters\\" are really more like caricatures, with their off-the-wall ideas and somewhat corny dialogue. But when you throw in the ultra-sexy element of high-end, world class special ops, you have all the makings of an awesome read -- until the end.The basic premise is that a group of self-styled defenders of Mother Earth are conspiring to restore her to her pristine, unsullied state by eliminating the chief cause of her defilement -- humanity. They will do this by developing and deploying an ultravirulent bioagent designed to render mankind extinct -- except for themselves and a few \\"chosen\\". These will be immunized with an appropriate vaccine, and will whether the storm in a \\"biodome\\" type of facility. After the cycle of bio-death has run its course, they will emerge to rebuild humanity and civilization \\"as it was meant to be\\", in an environmentally sound and sensitive way.These goings-on just happen to coincide with the assembly of a multinational force of special ops experts built around John Clark, with Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez (of \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" fame) as the XO and senior field operative. This organization, known as \\"Rainbow\\", will fill the gaps in counterterrorism efforts of other individual nations by providing an integrated rapid-response team with all the necessary jurisdictional and diplomatic details hammered out in advance. As luck would have it, little hints begin to drop and little pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together over time, allowing the goods guys ultimately to stymie the evildoers.This one is chock full of suspense and gritty action sequences, with some slick operations involving all manner of high tech weapons and gadgetry -- you would expect nothing less from Clancy. There are also some pulse pounding hostage rescue situations where the Rainbow team shows just how good it is -- but not perfect. Generally speaking it's a great read and a good time, but I was incredibly disappointed by the anticlimactic ending -- Clancy definitely dropped the ball on this one. I'm not sure what happened, but he had an opportunity to make this a top-notch thriller and he just plain blew it. I've read only about a third to a half of what Clancy has in print, so I'll just get over it and hope the next one of his books I pick up doesn't have the same flaw."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is one of the most action-packed books I have ever read. A new international counter-terror strike team is assembled, and is headed by an experienced CIA field officer named John Clark. This team, Rainbow, is the best in the world, with team members from all around the globe. For some mysterious reason, terrorism in the world increases, which keeps Rainbow busy defending its allies when a new threat surfaces, like none the world has ever seen. Rainbow has to react and the all of humanity is depending on its actions. If you are into guns and Special Forces, I would definitely recommend this book. Once you start you won't be able to put it down. The main reasons that I like this book are that the characters are very believable and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. Clancy captivates his readers by evading to something intriguing or dangerous, but then he stops and talks about something else. This leaves you curious to see what is going to happen next. Clancy's knowledge of politics is extensive, and he uses this knowledge to create a whole new world of intricate politics to enshroud his readers. Tom Clancy is an awesome writer and Rainbow Six is an awesome book. I think that the theme of the book is that human life is the first priority."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first book from Tom Clancy. I had played the video games and decided to see what all the fuss was about. I have to say that I was very pleased by the read. It moved along at a very quick pace following John Clark and Domingo Chavez.Character development was great, not too indepth, but not so vague that you were left cold. The action was great, and the suspense leaves you sitting on the edge of your eat.It shows how one slip up can break cases wide open in the FBI, new technology in the military, and how corupt human kind can be.My only perks about this book are few:team RAINBOW comes of as beeing too good. The first three missions they encounter go by too well without any problems. All the men on both teams seem to supermen that can't be hurt, which takes away the humanity factor of them. The ending is somewhat questionable as far as moral/legal issues arive, especially after the book pushes for legality and justice in many of its cases.It would alos have been nice if a little more incite had been given to Team 1other than that, a great read!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This novel was pretty good, the tactics and charcters were right on with Clancy. I liked seeing Clark again, and the events as told were pretty close to real world events. But their were times where it got to be a bit downer. All in All a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you want to talk about a page turner, this is it. I would lock my self in my room so I could get through a whole scene. Clancy goes into so much detail about what is going on at that moment. Not so much as to bore you. This is a great book to start out with if you are just starting to read Tom Clancy's books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Fans of the character of John Clark will enjoy this novel, although we see an older, wiser Clark now...not the cool, efficient field agent we've come to know.Clark is chosen to lead a secret, multi-national anti-terrorism task force. Well manned, well funded, well equipped, and able to act when other countries cannot, Rainbow is the world's greatest hope in the ongoing war against terrorism.But Rainbow's skill and resolve will be tested by an unparalleled amount of terrorist activity. Some of it is personal, and nearly all of it is related. But the biggest threat is yet to come, one so horrible that failure is not an option.This story, while very engrossing, does not have the typical, multi-layered plots we see in other Clancy books. It's a more lighter read, but has enough cool gadgets, genre jargon, and intense plot to remind you it's a Clancy novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This selection by Tom Clancy was an excellent read. Like most of Clancy's books it started off a little slow for me but in the end was a book I would recommend to anyone interested in this type of literature. Even if you have never read anything by Clancy this is one that would be good to start off with, it is full of action and adventure, just be sure you have enough time to sit down and read it within a rather short period of time. If you read only a chapter or two every two weeks or so like a friend of mine did then you will not get the true effect of the book because you forget so much information and have to go back and re-read the previous chapter just to remember where you were."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"None of my friends actually thought that i read this book (cause im only 10) but after they saw it they were all amazed. Anyway lets get down to buisness.This was just the best book ever made because: I loved the action, great characters, unthinkable plot, great detail, and its wicked graphical. This was the first Clancy book i read but i was not bored with it. If you have read any Tom Clancy book at all (besides this one) read Rainbow Six. You won't be able to put it down! If you dont feel like going through all the talking and everything (every tom clancy book) well this book has plenty of action. If you read the sample pages you'll see this part. Theres like a gun fight on a plane. Luckily John Clark was there. Theres no telling how AWSOME this book was. (If you noticed i capitalized AWSOME just to get people's attention.)This book was amazing and you should atleast read it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was one of Clancy's worst. John Clark and Ding Chavez assemble an anti-terror special forces unit comprised of men from several different countries, including Germany, UK, France, Israel. You've got to be kidding me! What's the possibility of these countries working together on anything, let alone a special forces unit that uses their soldiers at the will of other nations?! Not only is this extreamly unrealistic, its just plain stupid. Another one Clancy shouldn't have bothered to write. The team foils some terrorist operations, but doesn't know that they're being financed by a group of tree-huggers who want to kill everyone in the world with some version of Ebola mixed with Cancer(impossible), because they don't want the environment hurt anymore. And then of course, there's the usual over - detailing of things, only this time its unbearable. If someone lies down on some grass, do we really need to know how its cut and what it smells like? Of course, in the end, the \\"Rainbow\\" team(the name itself had me laughing)saves the world by uncovering the environmentalist plot and stopping it before it can be executed. There's no need to read this book, because the activities that occur in it are never mentioned in \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", so you won't be confused. And if your a Jack Ryan fan, you especially won't get anything out of ths book. His name is never once mentioned in the whole book!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read this book a few years ago when it came out and I thought it was a great read. To be honest, this was the first Tom Clancy novel that I had ever read and I was not disappointed. Because of this, however, I do not have a point of reference to compare to any of his other fiction work.Clancy is a great story teller and the plot of the book was interesting and creative. For me, it was a difficult book to put down and I found myself constantly wanting to read further (which is unusual for me). :P Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six has everything one would expect from a Clancy thriller, so for Clancy fans, they shouldn't be disappointed... or should they? Clancy doesn't deviate much from his tried and true formula, so the book DOES prove to be a quick and exciting read. However, it isn't a stellar Clancy novel like Without Remorse or The Cardinal of the Kremlin. It is more along the lines of The Sum of All Fears or Debt of Honor. The premise of the book is fairly weak, but with the state of the world, who's to blame Clancy for choosing environmental terrorists? Clancy's novels have always been like Action movies, you're entertained while you're in it, but afterwords, you're just wondering what to have for dinner."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It was well worth the wait. Once again, Clancy brings us John Clark, the muscle behind Jack Ryan. The writing and technotalk is classic Clancy. I am 1/4 through the book and am taking my time. I thought the Brits' dialogue came from old Sherlock Holmes movies, but can be forgiven for the great plot. Terrorists beware, Rainbow Six is here!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This new novel is everything you would expect from a bestselling writer. It contains plenty of action and a suberb plot that slowly unwinds."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, Clancy has brought forth another new thriller, RAINBOW SIX, and IT'S GOOD !!! I can see the movie or mini-series already (preferably with Tommy Lee Jones as Clark), and the guy who played Ding in CLEAR...should do him again, as well-he's perfect casting. Can't wait for the next Ryan book-hear Clancy has started that already, for publication in '99. Maybe we'll hear soon if WITHOUT REMORSE will be made into a mini-series, Clark is a deep &amp; fascinating character, and I relished Clancy revisiting his character , and further developing him. Can't wait for the CARDINAL IN THE KREMLIN movie, I recently reread the book, it'll translate well, esp. w/ Harrison Ford (in his final movie as Ryan, of a 3-movie deal*which Alec Baldwin turned down!). I hope Clancy is thinking about introducing a New, Major character, and considering a science fiction book/concept for his next book. All his major characters have reached the pinnacle, and its time for NEW BLOOD ! If you're a REAL Clancy fan, you'll buy/read, and enjoy RAINBOW SIX."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked Tom Clancy's early books, _Red Storm Rising_, _Sum of all Fears_, etc. However, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was interesting in places, but too formulaic. He tends to get lost when not speaking techno-babble - the character development is poor, there isn't alot of tension, etc. And long...way too long. It could use some serious editing. Has anybody else noticed how Clancy has started using the same phrases repeatedly in his books? For example, two or three novels ago he started using the phrase &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Not just once, but many times per book. Rainbow Six has 3-4 &quot;been there, done that&quot;s in it, several comparisons of the men on Rainbow 6 to &quot;lions&quot;, that sort of thing. It is as though Clancy is writing each scene in his story outline, then just glueing them together. He needs an editor. Also, this book could have been written by Rush Limbaugh. Yeah, vegetarians are a pretty serious danger to the world."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Again, Tom Clancy displays a mastery of uncovering operational tricks of the trade for his readers. Continuing from where he left off with his last fictional novel, Clancy tells us an &quot;edge of your chair&quot; story of international terrorism and worldwide ecological terrorists. This book will be impossible for any Clancy fan to put down and I burned many a late night candle finishing it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I admit I was a little disappointed when I first heard the new Clancy was not a Jack Ryan book, but reading the first chapter on line changed my disappointment to anticipation quickly. I had thoroughly enjoyed Without Remorse and Rainbow Six provides the same action and character development. I would recommend this book to any of my friends, even those sometimes intimidated by the length of a Clancy novel and assure them that this is one of the least &quot;technical&quot; of his novels with a story that moves quickly throughout.l"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was one of the scariest stories I have ever read. Although at first the premise seems rather silly, when one thinks about it the idea becomes horribly possible as it does not cost all that much (as such things go) to accomplish what the book describes. States no longer have the monopoly on mass death. Clancy puts together an excellent, well written and well constructed tale full of the usual technical accuracy and suspense. At times one does feel that the book was written a little too much with easy conversion to a movie script in mind as well as consideration of the computer game Mr. Clancy will sell under the same title. Slightly more character exploration (as in Without Remorse) would also have been appreciated. Still, these are minor points that take absolutely nothing away from the quality and excellence of Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six started well, and had me engrossed for the first half of the book. But critical plot elements did not make sense, and the book simply fell apart at the end of the middle. Characters are not well developed, and the ending silly. All in all, not a strong effort from an author I usually like."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was outstanding. It was a flowing story that never seemed to bog down at all. It was lackaing all the technical information that Mr. Clancy is famous for. However, everything appeared to be accurate. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this whole saga.

Jeffries boils it down to a concise and entertaining read, although in parts it's a bit unneccessarily graphic.

This book is VERY outdated, and extremely incomplete."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"First of all, I would like to thank Ross Jeffries for publishing this book. It is hard to find a book on dating that deals with hands-on tips. Most books throughout the world are books for women on how to find Mr. Right. It is very difficult to find a book for men on how to meet the right woman. Taking a look at the title and content of this book it might be 'disgusting' for the female audience. Unfortunately, especially in the US one does need to have this kind of book. It is pretty sad that many women in America are falling for pick up lines like this and are very materialistic, esp. in areas like Southern California or Las Vegas. Those women include also those from other nations who became americanized and are even more superficial or worse than those American women. To make a long story short: women who complain about men who are showing off with money and are into one-night stands, head-games and God knows what else are producing those kind of men.I am able to make those statements because I am seeing America with different eyes, as s.o. who is born and raised here and considers all that quite normal. In Europe, it is still personaliy what counts and not what kind of car, cloth, watch, shoes you were and how good you are in playing games with women.Maybe it sounds like discrimination but I think that the analogy Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus is not that far of.My final thought: Ross Jeffries' book does not attack the nice, down-to-earth women that do also exist for whom this kind of book is superfluous. But it deals with those who need to taste some of their own medicine. Unfortunatly, there are a lot of men and women in this world where niceness is a big no, no to them. The only way those kind of people learn is by either a catastrophe or by s.o. punching them into their face."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Just in case none of you noticed, most of the positive reviews for this this book were written by Ross Jeffries!

Have you ever heard something and somewhere inside you recognize genius and find yourself going...Huhhhmmmmm! There must be something that he does that is getting results, in order to stimulate such emotional reactions. After all, if it had no power no one would object to it. This book is Ross's first work to share on a mass level what he had learned at that time. He has much better work but this book is still bursting with great information and laughs. You would agree that one of the best ways to discover, realize and learn is to laugh it in. Would'nt you? This is a good introduction to Ross's style and practical strategies. His early work comes from a place of &quot;doing to&quot;. Now , he is kinder and gentler &quot;being with&quot;. As you will soon discover his work will work for anyone except two types of people.

His tactics may seem sleazy and unethical to most women (they aren't in my opinion) but women do hold the most power in this situation, and men, if they are going to get anywhere with us, have to find a way to get some kind of edge. Ross uses hypnosis and NLP to get that edge and I have to admit that I would not mind having these tactics used on me--they certainly are more entertaining and humorous than the self-absorbed, bullying jerk type of lines and strategies most women are used to and are sick of. Some of the lines are a little corny, and if the woman thinks they are, then of course, she won't go for it. The woman is actually in control of the scenarios Ross describes--if she isn't interested, Ross suggests that the guy move on and tells men when, how, and why. Which I think is great because some guys still hang on even after you've told them to #$%! off.However, the most important thing Ross says is that when approaching a woman, a man must focus his attention on her and not on his erection--which unfortunately is earth shattering news for most men! It's a concept that is lost to most guys.After you get through the graphic language and the references to women as &quot;chicks&quot; and &quot;broads&quot; Ross's book gives you a lot of useful insights to male/female dating rituals whether you are a straight man or woman."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I read this book because I was hopeful that the more favorable reviews would be accurate. Coming off of a four year relationship and new to the dating scene, I thought this would be a helpful tool to &quot;get back in there.&quot; I really was disappointed. This may or may not help people who are really shy or who never had any women, but for those of us whose success with women has not been terrible, this book is a waste of money and travesty. The author's main strategy is to ask women questions like &quot;What was your favorite vacation&quot; so that they will think of romantic feelings and want to have sex with you. It's very stupid and won't help a bit."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"... although Ross Jeffries' wild NLP theories and crazy schemes seemed like ground-breaking psychobabble nearly 20 years ago when gullible chumps were eating it up, nowadays a sensible man would only read it as a curiosity that's about as relevant today as the 8-track player, the waterbed and retro roller skates.The cover photo alone says it all - while the gal's lying in bed waiting for him to make a move, he looks like he's consulting a step-by-step sex manual because he's totally clueless about what to do next.To be read for entertainment purposes only."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"That's it! This book is the answer to my problems. I'm all done being a &quot;nice&quot; guy. I'm a 20 year old college student, and I have way too many &quot;friends&quot; for girls. Not for long though. I've been down in the dumps because I haven't gotten laid for two years.

This same approach is preached in countless books and courses on how to conduct yourself in meetings, job interviews and submitting resumes - dare we see some connection here?2) In some context this is one man's answer to all those books by women on how to land a man. And just as intelligent.3) If you ever meet anyone sucker enough to be used by this approach, lose them or steer clear of them; they're not worth knowing. Before someone tries this on you, read Sheldon B. Kopp's &quot;If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him.&quot;4) Jeffries' biggest selling point is his attitude; there has always been a market for it and always will be. On the whole, it's better this should advertise itself publicly than go underground - this way, we know where they are."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Guide to using hypnosis to get women horny.

His pick-up lines are THE WORST I'VE EVER READ."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"This 11-year-old book should be looked upon as a great introduction to the NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) that the talented Ross Jeffries pioneered in using in one's love life. Ross is to be commended for being original and creative, far better than the elderly John White, who uses the pen name of R. Don Steele, and, who &quot;borrowed&quot; the few strategies that actually somewhat work in John White's silly approach. Ross has CDs and videotapes that reflect the continuing progress he has achieved as a dating guru thru the years. Washington state and just now, in 2003,California have started nailing men who live with or marry single mothers for child support, even when the child is not the new guy's offspring. All the more reason for men to have a definite set of dating skills and not settle forbottom feeders. Again, most men will find this to be an introduction and not a stand-alone product."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"If you are the kind of guy who has no real morals or conscience (and the woman will probably already sense this 10 minutes into a conversation with those of you who abide by this book) *and* your goal is to have the kind of relationship that lasts less than a week, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, lose the book and be yourself. Women want nice guys who *won't* use them for their body or affections. Women want men who can be their best friend -- not best lover. I have yet to know anyone who's ever said otherwise. And the one's who probably only want sex and nothing more are as riddled with problems and emotional baggage as the men who use them. This book is worthless to those of you who still believe that being a nice guy is the only real way to earn respect from women."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I think I saw a copy of this in Austin Powers' personal effects when they thawed him out! Yeah, baby--do I make you &quot;hawny&quot;? Oh, behave!"},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"This fool says over and over not to supplicate to women but you should have seen him at a recent seminar where he clearly was seeking approval and attention from his former girlfriend who was there with the guy who stole her away from Ross in Maui a few years ago. He said he was not going to give a bathroom break because he did not want to interrupt the stream of work he was doing, yet when his former girlfriend walked into the room he completely stopped what he was doing and walked over to her for an accepting hug. Gee, he will not stop for a bathroom break for people who paid him money, but he will stop to get a hug from his manly looking former girlfriend. He also hires people to pretend to be doing really well with his speed seduction material, but it is funny that these guys never seem to bring any hot women with them to the seminar. Wouldn't you think that it would be natural to bring a hot woman if you are claiming to be sleeping with so many? Even one would be nice. But it is all a put-on success and no one really gets the results they claim. Even the guy who also trains at the seminars with Ross named Major mark who is a hypnotist says one thing but behaves different. Major mark says to respect women, but at a recent seminar of his own where his wife was at she began to speak and I could clearly see him make a gesture that was clearly a hypnotic gesture meant to get her to shut up because it worked every time he did it. He is also a bully in his speed seduction seminars bragging about having killed many people and bossing people around in the seminar. If these are the kind of people you want to learn from then you are only making them richer and yourself more frustrated. Don't say I did not try to warn you."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"If you can find yourself looking for the right answers, when it comes to getting the women you desire into bed, then you already know, without even having to think twice, that this book is a vital part of your life.

But don't cheat yourself by only reading the book and order the basic home study course. The guarantee Ross gives you, is AMAZING, and the fact that it really works, is a quantumleap beyond anything else out there.

Beethoven's Fifth Symphony was not only a product of his rare genius that genius was the result of the prevailing zeitgeist of the times, his childhood experiences.etc; etc; and yet, in theory, NLP suggests if you can \\"model\\" Beethoven's cognition, you can compose like Beethoven.Mega B.S.Back to \\"How to Get the Woman \\" yada, yada, yada, and its utterly doesn't-pass- the-laugh-test claim that there are strategies for bedding any woman you desire. Casanova could not even do that and if you plow through his 4,000 page memoirs which touch upon his 200 sexual liasons, you'll walk away with one unambiguous conclusion: NOBODY teaching variation of this pop-psyche drivel was in Casanova's league. He was incredibly eloquent, brilliant, among the best-educated men of his time, an associate of the luminaries of his period, drop-dead gorgeous, unflinchingly courageous, mesmerizing, and had an understanding of the subtleties and mysteries of the female heart comparable to Sherlock Holme'sbrilliance in solving crimes and yet he acknowledged being \\"duped\\" and frustrated by women throughout his life.Jeffries would have you believe all he really needed to be the complete package was this book.Galactial B.S.What Casanova had which is grievously lacking in Jeffries and his peers (\\"Professional pickup artists\\") is a sense of honor. To the crowd that swallows books and courses on this stuff whole, there are few moral lines in the sand. Women are objects to be pursued to relieve sexual tension and how you keep score. \\"Is she married?\\" \\"Not your problem,\\" Jeffries would argue. An affair may be just what she needs although the research suggests affairs are devastating, more times than not to marriages.This, to me, is the real problem with all such books: they advocate seduction as something outside of conventional morality: the ends justify the means. I have seen many examples of tactics being advocated by other seduction gurus that could (and have) gotten men arrested.In New York City, for instance, there's a law on the books that prohibits staring at women on the subway.Check out You Tube. Watch a few of these \\"candid camera\\" pickups. Women are lied to, touched without their permission, and in one case actually forcibly removed from the presence of a friend.Buy this book if you're desperate, lonely, or have been dumped but sleep with one eye open. \\"The devil hath power to assume a pleasing form.\\" You may wind up sleeping with a woman or two but after the initial high wears off you may notlike the face that's looking back at you in the mirror--the face of a hustler who will quote scripture to serve his purposes."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"First off, this book is NOT for everyone.

Jeffries also explains some confidence building techniques. However, if you are a guy who is SERIOUSLY lacking in confidence, this book may not be the right one for you to start out with. Otherwise, you will find the confidence builders to be both unique and effective.The real meat of the book is in the \\"get the girl into bed\\" strategies outlined in the last several chapters of the book.

It is an absolute must read for those wanting to get better at understanding women and the ways a woman's mind works. Though there are countless other ideas and methodologies available today, they all stem from this book.

He has also created much simpler ways to practice and learn quickly and easily.If you are just looking for a book to introduce you to the area, check outSecrets of Speed Seduction Mastery. It is a much more thorough introduction which also brings you up to speed on some advanced concepts as well.At the time it was written, this book was easily 5 stars.

He wrote the book to make money and although some of the methods work for you if you're an expert at NLP, some are completely bogus, like the complement ladder (or something like that) where you keep giving her complements until she folds and likes you.

My self-respect has risen so much as a result of this book, not to mention the enriching effects of a healthy relationship, that I've gone from a so-so non-achiever to a take-charge master of my own life. The relationship worked out so well that we've been married now for five and a half years and have two wonderful sons and one on the way. There is no doubt that even this relationship would have fizzled away like all the rest (if it had started at all), if it had not been for this book.Anyone can read a book and wish that it will help, but you have to actually DO!! the exercises to get the results, which for me have been wonderful. I can't recommend this book highly enough, even to whiners.By the way, the heart of the book is self-respect. So, you can apply that to job interviews and other personal interactions, not just to dating women.

It is no secret that too many of us have elective hearing to begin with and how much more so on a date. When you are going in for the kill, you should always be aware of your environment, the present circumstances, and the mood of the girl you are seducing - and how that affects your strategy (and progress). This book quickly takes you into the realms of persuasion that most men do not believe even exits.What I like most about this book is its timeless relevance. You will not learn methods that have anything to do with the current (or past) eras. What you learn here is how your skills at communication affect every person you interact with - and how to use those skills of communication to easily persuade people into agreeing with your point of view. Ross focuses here on technique and results, leaving you to practice and master what he lays out.Add this to your collection, and refer to it often. Most of all, use the techniques you learn in this book IN CONJUNCTION WITH what you learn in other books, from real life experience, from other gurus.

The premise is amazing; that you can walk up to some hot chick you've never met in a mall, get her to close her eyes and picture a delicious chocolate, and minutes later get her in bed. Nice fantasy, but it reminds me of the story about the guy who stands on a street corner asking every woman who walks past him to go to bed with him. 999 times out of a 1000 he gets slapped. Ross' advice is as practical as telling you to get rich by buying a lottery ticket; the odds are about the same.A far better book is &quot;how to date young women&quot; by R. Don Steele.

I have spent the past several years ending up in a virtual sexual, dates from hell wasteland. Now, is it because I am really bad-looking, uneducated, boorish, offensive or totally misogynistic? No. The reason is that I have been trying to be, and shape myself into, what I felt women wanted- all those qualities that women talk about gushingly in magazine articles- sensitive, kind, dependable, smart, funny, etc.... I grew up in my relationships with women thinking that brains (I have two advanced Masters and am working on a PhD), money (which I luckily make a lot of), and a whole host of other qualities would just make me the ideal man. I guess I figured that the female companionship thing would just come as a matter of course, that it would take care of itself. But, as someone said in another review, those qualities may be great. But, that's not what turn a woman on or makes a woman desire you. It's not what causes a woman to respond. This book, along with another one I bought called 'How to Suceed with Women' really kicked my butt. Which is okay. I needed it. It reoriented me into what I was doing wrong, and really showed me that the best way sometimes to get a woman to walk towards you is to be totally willing to walk away from her. Seems simple. But, this book opened my eyes. I am not sure I would try everything in this book, but I do think that it can help a 'nice guy,' or a guy that continually is told that he is just seen as a friend. There is very little about dating that is fair, even with the most egalitarian-minded women. As a matter of fact, I find someone women my age (late 20's) as more spoiled than ever. If you want to succeed and get what you want in your relationships, particularly with some of the women out there who will gladly let you do everything for them, you need an edge. This will given it to you, or at least sharpen it up. Ross gives women virtually no quarter, which is something I respect. And believe me, once you've tried it, women will respect you for not letting them pull their BS on you either- even if you do frustrate them at the same time. A great book written by a guy who understands how men think, and explains his tactics to you in a way that a guy will clearly understand. Buy it! PS- If you suffer from the nice guy syndrome, also look into buying 'Nice Guys Don't Get Laid.' If you have ever been told you were a nice guy, this book will also set you straight about how bad that can be sometimes."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"It's not that the book wasn't quite as good as I had expected. No, it was pathetic. I have no use for obscure pick-up lines and Ross Jeffries's success stories. Maybe this book will give a complete jerk something of a start. Maybe it can help one improve from three conquests a week to six conquests a week. I don't know. What I do know is that it won't help an average guy like you and me who succeeds to get a woman now and then, but who needs to improve radically upon the number and quality of his relationships, and - above all - who wants to get control of women instead of being pushed around by them.I agree completely with the female reader from San Francisco - Ross's techniques, as described in this book, DO LEAVE WOMEN IN CONTROL. The advice repeated by far most often in the book is: &quot;if she does so-and-so, dump her immediately and throw away her number&quot;. Well, do you want to pay money for being taught how to run away? I guess you'd rather want to learn how to nail those chicks. As it is, the book should be titled &quot;How to Get the Women Who Desire You into Bed&quot;.If you have read Ross's newsletters that are available for free on his website and expect to find something different in this book - the real stuff, you know, knowledge that would enable you to get the women you desire into bed - you'll be bitterly disappointed.The book's got no clear content. First, it's very short - 88 pages, not counting the advertisement. In a normal print and without all those empty and half-empty pages, it'd probably be only a half of it. On those 88 pages, Ross is jumping from subject to subject, giving you small pieces of unrelated information. You'll feel like having 50 pieces of a 1000-piece puzzle. You have no chance of putting together the whole picture - or even a part of it, for that matter.One thing that has probably awaken your interest is the claim that the first part of the book is dedicated to confidence building. Well, sort of. That means actually a few pages of chit chat and a most primitive NLP exercise. Exercises of this kind will take a long time before you'll see any results. (If you are to get any results at all.)Ross Jeffries is the world champion in making big words. Very, very big words. When someone throws such &quot;guaranteed overwhelming success&quot; claims all around him as Ross does, he better deliver something of real value. This book made me cautious about Ross Jeffries, to say the very least. Maybe he wrote the book just to get women's attention.Some advice in this book is indeed useful to know. If you can find it in a library or something - by all means, read it. I would have given it three stars, were it titled something like &quot;Some Tips on Dating&quot;. But because of the false promises implied in its title and Ross's big talk about it, it'll get no more than two. I don't like being cheated."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I read this book and overall I liked it. The chapters on self-confidence, and the chapters for getting a girls' attention and how to appeal to women are true, so I don't understand how some readers can be so harsh as to discount a book when much of what was written are true. (The section on JASL members had me rolling! :) The only chapters I was skeptical about, were the sections on hypnosis. However, in retrospect, mirroring techniques are well-documented proven facts. Whether it'll lead you straight to the bedroom is something I think has yet to be proven. In addition, I don't necessarily think that his chapter on Using Hypnosis to Get Your Date in the Sack would work, but peripherally, I've had phone sex (and cybersex) with women that eventually led to the bedroom... just not in the same night. All it did was open the crack in the doorway that eventually led to where I wanted it to go. If that's the point Ross was trying to make, then he's succeeded. I think that overall, the book presented a lot of truths, and is worth a glance. Women, afterall, like sex just as much as we men do! And if she denies this, she's lying! If you're looking for a magic *formula* to succeed with women, you won't find it in this book. However, understand the context of this book, and understand what attracts a women to a man, and apply the traits and seduction techniques mentioned in this book, then I think you're dating life / sex life will improve. Mine has"},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I would recommed this book. Not in the heartiest sense but I think there are some important lessons in here. You may be worried about the implications of manipulation but I assure you that it can't possibly be any worse than what exists out there for women to read about manipulating men (The Rules, The Art Of War For Lovers, etc.). Women are big offenders in the &quot;gender war&quot; as well. The only thing that I regret is that there aren't more books out there similar to this, only seriously written and more in depth. This one comes across as a get-rich-quick scheme and the grammar and structure is generally shabby, but is has some valuable tips for all you nice guys out there who may be just a bit too nice; something that I don't believe women necessarily want. As a matter of fact, I don't believe women actually know what they want as much as they think they do; they are highly inconsistent beings. Take the good advice you can get from this book, such as &quot;Make no excuses for my desires as a man&quot; and &quot;I move through the world without apology.&quot; Skip chapter 10. You can read this book and still be a nice guy. You may not actually get laid but the few tricks that are of use in this slim volume will at least put you on the path towards greater confidence. And isn't that what women are always saying they find appealing?"},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I realize this book might be a bit controversial, but I ask the reviewers on this list: Have you guys actually TRIED the techniques in the real world? To me, this would be the ONLY true measure of the books quality. Reading some of the reviews, it's painfully obvious which &quot;reviewers&quot; haven't even tried doing what the book says (most haven't), and are giving their opinions from a COMPLETELY theoretical perspective. This is understandable, since the book doesn't give you the classical, comfortable dating advice so popular elsewhere, so people either reject it without giving it a second chance, or feel uncomfortable with it.Personally, I lost nothing by reading this book, since I got it for free when it was being given away for free on one of Ross Jeffrie's websites. The book deals with an issue most dating books either sidestep or don't deal with in detail: that you have to get a woman TURNED ON in order to take her to bed. I've tried some of the stuff in it (or at least some of the principles), and I can tell you women drool when you use the stuff on them (properly), and basically by changing your attitude towards them, they view you in a completely different light. The principles are more important than the specific techniques. I also tried some of Ross's later, more advanced SS stuff, which by the way is much better than this book, and again I was surprised at just how well women reacted. I'm in no way trying to promote Ross's products, (which I consider seriously overpriced), I'm just pointing out that this kind of information has to be tried out before you can judge it - if you're a bit scared at first, just play around with it a bit with your female friends and people you already know. Don't be just another theoretical philosopher who reads tons of books on dating and then gives their &quot;expert opinion&quot; without even bothering to try out what they learned."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"If you're really looking to learn about seduction, Ross Jeffries is the least of the best at this point in time. Sure, he may have started things back in the 90's with his Speed Seduction course, but his stuff is old and he's gone off in odd directions (magick? c'mon - childish fantasy stuff at best). And this book is the oldest of his old stuff. It will basically leave you looking to more of his products if you want to really learn any of what he has to offer. Face it, he's in this for money. This book is bait for his more expensive audio and video products, all of which are pretty questionable.If you really want to learn the cutting edge seduction stuff, look to David DeAngelo (do a Goggle search on \\"Double Your Dating\\") or Swinggcat (do a Goggle search on \\"Real World Seduction\\"). These guys have far more contemporary, far less misogynistic theories and techniques that are aimed more at helping you to understand what about men is attractive to women and how to accentuate the positive to recreate yourself as a man who is naturally attractive to women."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"G'day from Down Under.Although I'm smart enough to realize that a lot of things he says are obvious, it's the way Jeffries said it that made it powerful and had its lasting impact on me (I'm talking about the first 5 chapters). I was the &quot;too-nice&quot; guy too long to let women walk all over me. Actually I kind of reveled in it too. In this book, Jeffries gave me a good talking to, his style kind of reminds me of Thomas Paine's fiery propaganda. That's the only reason this book got 4 stars, because, cliched or not, this changed my life by changing MY outlook on myself and on dating.I read the rest of the book for entertainment but ignored most of it because 1) I find it repulsive and 2) I have no intention to bed every beautiful woman. I'm just another guy looking for The One.The appendix is very helpful. And although a lot of the NLP/hypnosis stuff may be a bit suspect (I'm a skeptic from birth), the section on mirroring is absolutely true and I will speak more about this.I know this works because as a volunteer crisis-hotline counselor and I've been told (by my supervisor who listens in, and the caller too) that during my calls I generate a lot of empathy and made them feel listened to. At first it comes as a surprise because I'm usually detached emotionally. Although I do care about my callers, I know that I really could not care THAT much for them because it'll mess with my head. Anyway, so what gives the impression of great empathy? I was told repeatedly by my supervisor that it's my intuitive ability to closely match the caller's tone of voice, language pattern, etc. And of course that requires me to be a good listener in the first place. So even though on the phone obviously I can't mirror their body language, mirroring something does work. Not only that, but from my end, mirroring actually helps me too because I can feel more of what my caller's feeling.How's this relevant to picking up? Sure looks and wit will get you in the door, but getting her to feel the sense of togetherness is what will keep her. And listen and empathize you must. Look I'm no expert on women, but from my mistakes I can tell you things that don't work, and the very few things that do work for me.Anyway, at least I'd recommend this book for an initial read. And if you like it then get the book for yourself. Might even pick up a copy in the zShop. Oh, and don't actually do everything in this book, unless you want to be or are already a pond-scum."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Ross could have been more complete in how to use Neurolinguistic Programming as a tool to date women. It would give other readers a better understanding of &quot;why this will work for you.&quot;If followed -- Ross' advice does and will work -- not every time with every woman -- but it makes a positive difference."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Although the title refers to picking up women, this book is much more valuable than for that. My initial purpose was to &quot;pickup women,&quot; but I've found that the principles that lie underneath his methods can be applied to practically all aspects of life (developing rapport, making a better workplace, selling more items).The book discusses Neuro-linguistic programming which is used in many self-help and inner power type books and seminars, for example, Anthony Robbins. But in this tiny $20 booklet, you will probably learn more than if you were to shell out hundreds of dollars.There is no fluff in Ross Jeffries' book. It's all method and why it works. Skepticism should abound, just as it should in any other purchase, and perhaps it will still be around after using his methods the first time around. But rest assured, there will be results that first time around. It only gets better each time."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Ross Jeffries provides very useful insight in this short, but crucial text for guys. I think one of the reasons why nice guys always finish last with girls is because they allow themselves to be walked over, I know I did. After reading this book it just all made too much sense.The majority of girls, particularly in California LOVE to play games and mess with a guy's head - and they're very good at this. Yes I know - not ALL girls are like that, there are some good ones out there, but they're probably reclused into the confines of a living room with Star Trek videos or are already hooked up with a two-bit jerk who belongs in jail!This book not only woke me up and allowed me to see right through it all, but also provided a how-to on dealing with it. The results : no more anxiety, no more dangling to the manipulative whims of game-playing girls who think that they can continue to do what they do and expect to get away with it!. No more, now it's our turn.Girls are nice, they mean well BUT where they fail is simple : They want a nice, caring compassionate guy who empathizes with their universe of problems - however, when that guy DOES come along, he gets walked ALL over and gets left behind for the arrogant jerk, who the same women later complain about - yet can't leave! Sort your lives out, ladies please!"},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Eroticism is involving yourself in a playful encounter. Jeffries is all about exaggerated wounded male ego, evidenced not least by his need to &quot;pad&quot; his list of bad reviews with inflated ones of his own. Sex should be fun, playful, healing and mutual, not a stolen trophy in a bitter gender war. Heal the bitterness, learn to love yourself, and who you'll attract will much more likely be who you'll want to keep. No wonder he hates most women--look at the assumptions he's bringing to his social universe. We find what we seek. Honest readers, keep looking."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"This book was very good for it's time, however Speed Seduction has evolved so much since 1989. I am a current student of SS and I can state that what is out there today is a quantum leap compared to what is presented in this book. The attitudes and techniques taught in the new millenium are much more powerful than what is presented here. The attitude has developed way past using SS for just 'getting laid', but using SS and NLP to improve yourself as a person in all aspects of your life. I recommend this book, but if you are truly interested I highly recommend you check out Ross' later stuff. Cheers to the book that started it all."},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"I have known the author for many years, and would like to finally put to rest the rumor that he was the inspiration for the Tom Cruise character in \\"Magnolia.\\" Other than making a living in the same way, the two have nothing in common. Jeffries is a genuinely funny and friendly guy, with no seething anger toward women at all. And his parents were fine people, nothing like the Jason Robards character in the movie.Neuro-linguistic programming, on the other hand, may be a legitimate field, but the way it is presented here is ridiculous. Subliminal messages have been discredited for years. Yet the reader is advised to pull stunts like hooking his thumbs in his front pockets, positioning his fingers so the subtly point at his crotch, while working the phrase \\"below me\\" (i.e. \\"blow me\\") into a sentence. This is supposed to induce his target to perform fellatio on him. By this standard, if I happen to glimpse a faded \\"Bo Gritz for President\\" sign out of the corner of my eye, I will be motivated to write him in the next time I vote.All this theory is nothing more than a way to build the reader's self-esteem. Let's say a man is ugly, boring, and poor. He has no self-confidence, and no success with women because he views them purely as objects. Frustratingly, they are unattainable objects because he immediately makes them aware of his inadequacies in environments like pick-up bars, which are probably among the worst places to meet people. In addition, he has an inflated notion of what he \\"deserves,\\" repeatedly inflicting himself on women that he believes are out of his league, then masks his own part in his failures by complaining that women are \\"stuck up,\\" \\"superficial,\\" or \\"only interested in what you can do for them.\\"He then reads this book, or takes a class on seduction through NLP. He learns a few new techniques, like suggestive hand gestures and statements with ambiguous sexual overtones. He learns that he doesn't have to be handsome, or interesting, or rich; that none of this matters. Now, when he returns to the bar, he has a plan. Now, he doesn't blame his failures on his own deficiencies; he simply hasn't mastered the principles of NLP sufficiently. Unlike his other shortcomings, this is one he can improve on. And eventually his improved self-confidence will result in success, if not merely due to a large number of repeated overtures.But he's still going to be an ignorant, obnoxious, self-centered jerk.Leopold Bloom \\"Jackie Treehorn treats objects like women, man!\\""},{"Title":"How to get the women you desire into bed","review":"Ross makes a whole plan for &quot;tricking&quot; women into having sex using his &quot;pattern&quot; for hypnosis or &quot;NLP&quot; or some such soundbite by talking about &quot;exciting&quot; things or whatever.

Well, I am sure it may work on some girls sometimes, so does my technique of walking up and saying &quot;hi&quot;. Too simple for Ross I guess. My point, spending time learning a Ross Jeffries &quot;pattern&quot; or using his pick-up lines that don't fit your personality are a waste of time when you could be out interacting.

Prof. David V. Erdman's fine introduction reveals the heart of this lovable peace frog that so impressed The Doors' Jim Morrison and myriad others - \\"Blake dared to search for humanity even within the \`dark horrors' of war and to keep \`the Divine Vision in time of trouble'...He went on bravely because he never lost his faith in the imagination, which turns mental death into fourfold life.\\"Blake's optimism and constant instigation of the spirit comes through in The Doors' \\"Break on Through\\" - \\"The gate is straight. Deep and wide. Break on through to the other side.\\"Being a modern rocker, Morrison grasped for the excessive side of Blake and brought it public. Yet there is a humble/religious side that \\"The Selected Poetry of Blake\\" brings forth. The value of humility jumps out in \\"The Clod and The Pebble.\\" \\"The Garden of Love\\" bursts with religious sentiment while showing the downside of organized religion. And, just when you start being carried away into natural law, Blake serves up \\"There is No Natural Religion.\\" In this piece note how the sentences of sections A and B bounce off each other and try to conjure what the missing fragment (III of section B) might have been.Those tempted to anoint Blake one of the fathers of modernist secularism should note that poet holds Christianity and its morality above the \\"slaves of the sword\\" of ancient Greece and Rome. Many greats including Milton and Shakespeare assumed a continuity of Christianity with the Greco/Roman worldview (as do many conservatives and Christians today) but Blake shows himself a rare Westerner in demonstrating that it's not so. The Western rationalism of Greece and Rome lead to war and destruction while the Eastern \\"irrationalism\\" of Christianity points to peaceful service of G-d and our fellow man.Jesus popularized the service ethic which in Judaism was cloaked behind multi-layered language and the national wars and struggles of the Jewish people. Yet it was always there for those who searched for it.We glimpse this when Jacob our father (Genesis 48:21-22) tells son Joseph of things \\"which I took from the hand of the Emorite with my sword and with my bow.\\" In \\"Milton,\\" Blake tips us that he knows Jacob was chiefly talking about wisdom and prayer, calling us to put on weapons of the spirit.\\"Bring me my bow of burning gold;Bring me my arrows of desire;Bring me my spear; O clouds unfold!Bring me my chariot of fire!\\"The same piece has the master poet forecasting how physical war and the materialism fostered by industrialism would destroy the ethics of old Jerusalem and the emergence of the New Jerusalem, or what Blake called the City of Art.\\"And did the Countenance Divine,Shine forth upon clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded here,Among these dark Satanic mills?...I will not cease from mental fight,Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand;Till we have built JerusalemIn Englands green and pleasant land.\\"Blake ends with a final bow to Torah, quoting the great and humble servant of G-d, Moses -\\"Would to G-d that all the Lord's people were prophets.\\" (Numbers 11:29).This being the Passover season as I write this one can't help but think of Moses and the punishments that G-d brought on Egypt. The plague of the frogs was said to have started with one frog. The Egyptians, like all those wishing to do strengthen man-made empires, struck the frog but it split into several frogs and this was repeated until there were millions of frogs. Yet the Egyptians persisted until Pharoah yelled \\"Stop, you fools, can't you see you're increasing their numbers?!\\" May the G-dly spirit of our peace frog, Blake, animate us and that the blows of the taskmasters cause us to go from strength to strength."},{"Title":"Grandmothers, Incorporated","review":"I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard from reading a novel. Not a TV Show or movie, a novel. Oh and what a novel it was!Grandmothers, Inc. is the story about three grandmothers who through a series of events became crime solvers. When Bea's former beau, Frank, dies from a heart attack she doesn't buy it. Bea smells something fishy and she believes that the smells are coming from her high school enemy, Charlie Mae. With the help of her loyal friends, Hattie and Connie, Bea plans to prove that Frank didn't die from the natural cause like everyone believes.There were so many memorable scenes, I lost count. My favorites include when Ms. Fannie, Hattie's mother in law had to use the restroom immediately and the gossip that circulated about Frank's funeral. I also enjoyed the scene when Hattie and Connie question a suspect they believe is involved in the murders. These three sassy grandmothers turned Matlock incarnate broke the stereotype I had about \\"old people\\". Hilariously funny and witty, I would recommend this novel to anyone. Grandmothers, Inc. proves that age is truly nothing but a number.Reviewed by Joy Farringtonhttp:www.nubiansistas.org"},{"Title":"Grandmothers, Incorporated","review":"The story begins with three best friends, Beatrice Baker Bell and Hattie Collier attending their Crispus Attucks High School's 50th reunion that is being held in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rounding out the trio is best friend Connie Palmer, who accompanies the pair to the reunion. All three women have fared well in the looks department, and Beatrice, Bea for short, has high hopes of seeing her high school sweetheart, Frank Schaffer. Problem number one, Frank is married to her nemesis, Charlie Mae, who has incidentally changed her name to Charmaine, to match her classy status. Bea and Frank rekindle old feelings, but just when Frank admits he's about to divorce Charlie Mae, Frank suddenly dies and Bea, flanked by her best friends are hell bent on proving that Charlie Mae is a gold digging slut who is responsible for Frank's death.All hell breaks loose when Charlie Mae moves back to Indianapolis and flaunts her money, among other things in Bea's face. And so begins their man-hunt for the killer or killers that are running around in their community, thus the forming of Grandmothers, Incorporated, their three-woman company crime solving investigative unit. But you can't tell any of them that they're not skilled investigators as they stumble upon a drug bust, an insurance scam, are involved in car chases and a host of other things that will leave you laughing until the very last page.This is a very easy, enlightening read, although I felt the ending was too quick. Bea, Connie and Hattie reminded me of Angela Lansbury in Murder She Wrote mystery series, but with a comical twist. I await the sequel to this heartwarming read as the book ends with the trio heading to Memphis for their next case. I can even envision the trio starring as in their own television show.Reviewed by Vanessa A.

Beatrice Baker Bell is dressed in her finest and looking good. She is attending in hopes of seeing her high school sweetheart, Frank Schaffer. Only problem is that Frank is now married to Beatrice's nemesis, Charlie Mae Schaffer. In L. Barnett Evans and C. V. Rhodes debut novel, Grandmothers Incorporated, Frank suddenly dies and Beatrice, flanked by her best friends Connie Palmer and Hattie Collier, try to prove that Charlie Mae is not the loving wife that she claims to be and possibly caused his death. But the real question is whether these bumbling grandmothers know what they are doing.Beatrice, Hattie and Connie know everything that goes on in Indianapolis and if they don't know it when it happens, you can believe that someone in the community or a member of the CLUCK Baptist Church will tell them. In their amateurish, bumbling way, these grandmothers come to the conclusion that several murders have taken place in their city. They confront Charlie Mae, after she has been caught with her lover in the mall, just weeks after Frank's death. Then the untimely death of Cheryl Feathers fuels the fire to the vendetta they have against Charlie Mae. Proving Charlie Mae's guilt is difficult, so they turn to Beatrice's son, Bryant for help. When he tells them to sit back and let the police do their job, they take matters in their own hands. In their bumbling investigation, they accidentally bust a drug ring, and help indict a ex-police officer of fraud. Bryant gets a promotion out of this, the grandmothers get something they were not expecting.This is a cute, quick read. The ladies reminded me of the Golden Girls television show of the 80's. The twist in the plot was well planned. The fight scene between Charlie Mae and her lover was comical. The authors lead the readers to believe that a series featuring the grandmothers is forthcoming as at the end of the book they were heading to Memphis.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Grandmothers, Incorporated","review":"Meet Bea Baker Bell, Hattie Collier and Connie Palmer; they are sixty-something grandmothers who, by default, form GRANDMOTHERS, INCORPORATED.

The style of inserting massive passages of quotes just threw me off a bit because just when it felt like I was flowing with it, there came another big, long passage from the sources.

Kundtz, a psychotherapist, author, and speaker. Dr. Kundtz is an advocate of Stopping, &quot;which is doing nothing--for as briefly as a minute or for as long as a month--for the purpose of becoming more fully awake and remembering who you are.&quot; People today are starved for time to themselves. Their days are filled with so many things that have to be done that they have no time for solitude or reflection. Dr. Kundtz's meditations are intended to help people turn those little moments between activities into &quot;stillpoints,&quot; where there is no guilt or pressure, where the focus is on just quietly and peacefully being. Those who are able to make such moments for themselves will find that they enjoy life more, and have more energy to do the other things they need to do. Dr. Kundtz divided the book into fourteen chapters, with titles like &quot;Making Room for Life&quot; and &quot;Finding Your Balance.&quot; Each chapter is filled with relevant meditations. Finding Your Balance, for example, includes &quot;A Walk Down The Street&quot; and &quot;It Just Is.&quot; All the meditations begin with a quote--some from philosophers like Socrates, and some from contemporary sources, like Woody Allen. Dr. Kundtz then offers a quiet &quot;reflection&quot; on the quote, and ends with a suggestion of how the reader might apply it to his or her own life. His reflection on &quot;It Just Is&quot; ends with &quot;today quietly observe what keeps you from going with the flow.&quot; Everyday Serenity includes a meditation for each day of the year. Each is designed to serve as an opportunity to &quot;pause for a purpose, to draw you to a moment of both rest and insight.&quot; Readers who use them will find themselves &quot;becoming more awake and intentional&quot; with a greater understanding of what they truly want from life and how to get it.Sandra Smith, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Everyday Serenity: Meditations for People Who Do Too Much","review":"'How are you today, Mom?\\" \\"I'm fine, if you overlook a few things.\\" --a conversation between author David Kundtz and his mother.

Fighting games are as much of an art as the martial arts themselves, and guidebooks for such shuld be, nay, OUGHT to be perfect. Every combination for every move must be entered correctly, and if any moves are pictured, the frames must be clean, understandable, and large.The guidebook for Bushido Blade has none of these qualities. The offered material is of the kind most often found in the game's own instructional booklet, frequently misquoted at that. The moves are sometimes entered for the incorrect characters ( I imagine that numerous gamers will go mad while trying to perform a move that doesn't exist). Picture frames are often misplaced and smudged, defeating the entire purpose of their existense. For a game of such finesse as Bushido Blade II, Prima's guide does little to fill in the fine points of combat. Strategies that are given are often basic enough to be guessed. The information about the storyline, character background info and statistics, and other interesting and quirky data is contradictory and mostly useless.I can freely say that it is easier to master the game WITHOUT this guide, rather than with it."},{"Title":"Bushido Blade 2 : Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"The Bushido Blade 2 strategy guide is not up to the high standard of Squaresoft's excellent game. Moves are not always attributed to the proper characters, the biographies of the characters are mostly badly written filler that you'd get from a quick run through of the game,the screenshots are too dark and too small to be of any real use, and the few character renders that are included are often overlaid with other graphics or charts that don't add much to your knowledge of the game itself. Minimal information, no bios and no pictures aside from more useless screenshots are included of the final boss characters despite the fact that this information would help clarify the game's storyline.

At the last minute Prima moved me over to Bushido Blade 2 (I really wanted to do Virtua Fighter 2 as I was already really good at that game, but someone had already signed off on that one). I was never able to play the game long enough to write in-depth strategies and struggled just getting the screenshots, art, and moves list down in the very short deadline I had. Needless to say, its not much more than a glorified instruction manual.I apologize to anyone who bought it. It was the last video game strategy guide I wrote.

I've become quite fond of her peripatetic style of writing, weaving the semi-autobiographical stories among the well written travelogue of the 30's. Compass left me disappointed, unfortunately.The story was somewhat repetitive of some of her earlier books, an autobiographical rehash. It did give some insight into the direction her libido was taking her as a teenager, alluding to the passion of her affairs with strong, older women. She might have elaborated more on this aspect of her awakening but perhaps felt constrained by her generational decorum.For the Sybille Bedford devotees this is a must read; all others may want to take a pass."},{"Title":"A compass error","review":"Bedford's sequel to \\"A Favorite of the Gods\\" again takes place in that charmed era \\"between the wars,\\" when movement between countries was easy, artists, writers and scholars congregated in a tourist-free South of France, and one seemed able to live well on pennies. The story opens with the 17 year-old Flavia being left quite alone in St. Jean, as her mother goes off with her fiance (as soon as he gets divorced, that is) and the family's faithful maid returns to Italy. Flavia lives a solitary, regimented life of study for university exams until taken under the wing of the wecoming Therese, who presides over a home with her children, a famous, tempermental artist-husband, and numerous unidentified lovers. Flavia soon becomes one of these, slowly realizizng that she prefers women over men, although it is \\"understood\\" that given her age she has had no experience of the opposite sex.All this is portrayed by Bedford as perfectly innocent and normal, until the malicious Andree arrives on the scene. Flavia falls hard, not realizing who Andree really is, and none of her new found friends sees fit to enlighten her. In a new forward, Bedford asks whether Flavia really knew in her heart, and chose to ignore her instincts. Bedford readily admits that it may seem improbable that Flavia wouldn't find out, but nevertheless this is the moral dilemma she presents.I won't give anything else away--all this is more or less described in the forward--but what is disturbing about this tale is the weight of responsibility for her actions that all place squarely on Flavia's shoulders. I saw the story quite differently. Flavia is an odd mix of sophistication and innocence, left on her own, prey to all. Why is not Therese responsible for seducing her? Why isn't Andree judged to be fully responsible?I won't say more, but I found my owm moral compass disturbed as I read Bedford's novel. She's a beautiful writer; the more autobiographical the story, the better she is. But a reader needs to shed his or her 21st century notions of how teenagers should be protected (or at least how one would like to protect them) and what the responsibility of adults is, to enter fully into the story."},{"Title":"A compass error","review":"You have to read Favourite of the Gods first.

From the bungling government and perverse incentives placed on the nuclear engineer teams which made it a disaster just waiting to happen, to the clean up, evacuation (largely also botched) and health effects of the nuclear fallout.It is amazingly detailed. The author even discusses wind patterns during the disaster which effected what areas were worst effected by what radioactive material (as the disaster progressed the wind AND the composition of the radioactive dust changed). I can honestly say that I was never really bored even though it gets technical in places.The author's writing style actually makes a reader feel that they are there when the Reactor explodes... not to mention (for one example out of many)sharing frustration at the government's incompetence when they delay an evacuation for half a day thereby increasing the populations poisoning over ten-fold.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"This book is a must read for any serious student of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It was written not long after the accident (1990) and so lacks information about the long-term health effects. However, the detail about the interactions of the participants, the top-down, Moscow directed policies that intentionally misled everyone including the operators, the comprehensive data about the immediate radioactive release, and the description of the sequence of events and decisions leading to the accident are both amazing and well researched. One of the most revealing aspects is that the radiation release, as bad as it was, could have actually been FAR WORSE. Cooling the basement with liquid nitrogen averted a complete meltdown into the water table. However, the author, as well as most reporters, doesn't display an understanding of the importance of xenon buildup that led to a positive-feedback nuclear excursion as the xenon burned out leaving a super-prompt-critical core."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"The book was a fast read.

I guess that means to the second power) Anyway I reccommend THE LEGACY OF CHERNOBYL BY Zhores Medvedev if anyone is interested in what happened at Chernobyl. This book helped me to write the one-act play \\"CHERNOBYL.\\""},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"I bought this book hoping for a general introduction to the explosion, its causes and its aftermath. The book does contain such information, but it's buried underneath a heavy layer of technical detail that can be, at times, mind-numbingly boring. Unless you are a nuclear engineer or otherwise interested in the minutiae of the reactor's workings, I'd skip this book."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"more than a book about horrific accident at chernobyl. explains nuclear energy 2 make electricity in general. also tells of various governments lack of real concern over issues of whether using nuclear reactors 2 make electricity is really safe. i recommend everyony read this book."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"This book is very technical, very dry and full of figures - and this is a good thing. If you want a very insightful and in depth view to what happened in Chernobyl in 1986, the background and aftermath of the disaster and its effects in Ukraine, Soviet Union and around the world, this is a book well worth reading. The Legacy of Chernobyl was published in 1990, so the information is a little bit dated in some respects. Nevertheless, I can highly recommend this book for those readers who want well researched facts and figures instead of an entertaining yarn."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Chernobyl","review":"I thought this was a very good novel. I used this on several occations as a document for research papers I have wrote on the subject of Nuclear power and Chernobyl. The author is very accurate and shows the world what goes on behind the scenes."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the worse book by TC I have ever read! He's clearly running out of fresh ideas. It would make a wonderful X'mas present to someone whom you hate!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This novel, the latest in Clancy's series, is very well written save for the fact that he goes into a bit too much detail at times. It is a great novel for anyone who wants a book that they will be reading for sometime, and especially for fans of the Jack Ryan series. The last section of the book is particularly suspensful and Clancy really well portrays the internal politics of the communist Politburo in China."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help but wonder if Clancy purposefully screwed up this book to keep us all off his back for future Jack Ryan adventures. Afterall, it is so distasteful and unrealistic in parts, what other conclusion is there to draw?I guess we could assume he's bored with Ryan and just forgot to do research, or maybe he became fanatical about using this book as a political forum and nothing else mattered, or perhaps he is just simply an angry man.Whatever the reason, the gratuitous sex, the excessive profanity and vulgarity, and the dim-witted antagonists (wasn't Roscoe P. Coltrane a character somewhere in this book?) all seem blatantly uncharacteristic of Tom Clancy. It seems to me that he doesn't want to do another Ryan book and had to piss enough of us off so we don't flood him with emails for a sequel.I wouldn't give this book a complete TURKEY rating, but compared to his previous books, it is glaringly loose (was there an editor?), heavy-handed, and, in my opinion, offensive.Because I want to remain a Clancy fan (is there anything better than &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot;?) I'm choosing to believe that &quot;Bear&quot; is a calculated, intentional screw-up, rather than believe that Clancy has turned himself into a distasteful, uncreative, run-of-the-mill author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I agree with several of the other reviewers that there is a great Clancy novel here, with a couple of hundred too many pages in the actual released version. There were repeated sentences exactly in different parts of the book, and things that should have been caught in editing process. I also agree the anti-clinton meanderings were totally unnecessary, and not connected to the Ryan storyline at all. Some of the best sub-plots were not resolved in the end, which I thought was unusual for Clancy, (as I own almost every fiction book he has written). The ending seemed rushed, and or cut to just finish it and get it out. I believe most of this blame should lie with the editorial staff. Towards the last half of the book, there were large sections of that familiar Clancy feel, and tension, and I was caught in the &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; web again, and for this genre, that is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I, like many of the reviewers who have already submitted their thoughts, am a huge Tom Clancy fan. Well, let me clarify: I am a big fan of his nonfiction and his Jack Ryan novels - not of the franchised &quot;OpCenter&quot;/&quot;NetForce&quot;/et al. that he doesn't write but sticks his name on. So, I was one of the throngs eagerly anticipating &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot;.Mr. Clancy's typical pattern in the Ryan and Ryan-related novels is to build a wide-scale story, then blend it all together bit by bit into a dramatic and fast-moving finale. The style is no different here. He has an extraordinary knack for being able to write what seem to be unrelated &quot;side stories&quot; in the course of the general plot that wind up relating somehow to the broader picture at a later date. He is, for better or worse (depending on your viewpoint), on his game in this latest installment.Also, with most of his novels, the pace seems slow at the outset, then shifts to breakneck speed in the last 200-300 pages. In some respects, that was also done here, with a couple exceptions. I found the first 100+ pages to be a very fast read. Then it slowed down for another 100 or 150 before picking back up for a similar amount of pages, until finally hitting that last 200 pages blitzkrieg.Like some who have reviewed already, I was both surprised and a little put off by the dramatic increase in the sexually-related subplots, innunendo, and references. This seemed totally out-of-character for Mr. Clancy, moreso because instead of a small dose of it we got near-overload measures that popped up all the way to the last sentence of the book. Initially, in regards to the spy subplot, it was okay, but it just escalated to the point of being far too much and also unnecessary.The conclusion also seemed a bit rushed, and, unlike his previous novels, didn't seem to leave much &quot;open&quot; for the next Ryan adventure. It is an interesting parallel, then, to have Mr. Clancy describe Ryan as drained and not knowing what his next decision is while at the same time rushing to a rather awkward conclusion that wasn't entirely satisfying.I have never had a problem with the length of Mr. Clancy's novels, for the simple reason that they are great &quot;escapist&quot; works that you can savor for longer than a couple of days. So, I was initially not bothered by the 1000+ pages. But, I would submit that if he had cut out the numerous sexual references (as mentioned above), some of the tedious China-U.S. diplomatic meeting scenes, expanded the climatic battle, and fleshed out the conclusion more, the 1000 pages would have been of better overall value.If there is one wish for the next Jack Ryan novel, it is that is is a real barn-burner. And the first step towards that, in my opinion, is for Mr. Clancy to pay heed to the reviews from his die-hard fans (like myself). Otherwise, he does run the risk of falling towards the path of mediocrity. Some previous reviews have put him there already; I disagree. &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot; is, overall, a fun read. It has a good storyline, a great batch of characters, and did entertain. For that reason, criticism aside, I do rate it &quot;4&quot; stars. It is not Mr. Clancy's best work (&quot;Hunt For Red October&quot;, &quot;Cardinal Of The Kremlin&quot;, and &quot;Clear And Present Danger&quot;), but at the same time is not anywhere close to his worst. That inglorious title is still jointly held by &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Sum Of All Fears&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of the Clancy novels. This was by far the most offensive, as far as language, that I have read. He traded plot and characterization for vulgarity and insensitivity. For example, until now, choirboy Jack Ryan describes child rape by Chairman Mao as &quot; ...Mao liked Virgins, the younger the better. Maybe he liked to see the fear in their cute little virginal eyes--- that's what one of our pshrink consultants thought, kinda like rape, not so much sex as power. Well, I guess it could have been worse-- at least they were girls.&quot; In effect Clancy has his hero stating that rape of little girls is less criminal and vile than the rape of little boys. Now Jack Ryan is supposed to have a daughter, what kind of father, would find this less offensive? Clancey I have enjoyed all of your novels up to now, but you falter in trying to make your characters too macho. Jack Ryan's strength comes from his intelligence and dedication too family. He falters on both accounts with language like this."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A good read: it's got a lot of what Clancy's good at, and not too much of his faults. You learn gobs of authoritatively detailed things about modern spycraft and high command and the toys of a year-2000 war, and you get to have a good time learning them.Like most of Clancy's books, this one has a bunch of plotlines and viewpoints -- a CIA agent in Beijing, a police detective in Moscow, President Jack Ryan in the White House, a Russian general in Siberia. But all the plots hang together nicely. And the crisis is easier to swallow than the ones Clancy used in Executive Orders or Debt of Honor. His characters are more real, too. They don't even preach at the reader as much. Clancy's just become a better writer. (Am I allowed to say that?)Clancy finds a clever way to stage a major war in a world where the USA is too big for anyone to plausibly take on: it's not the United States' war, but Russia and China's. The USA comes in as an ally on one side, but it's a long trip to get United States firepower to northeast Asia... Even so the actual warfare is just the last third of the book. This is as much a spy novel as a war novel.Fortunately it's a good spy novel. There's lots of fun, interesting stuff about intelligence work from several angles, from the White House to the secret agent to the Moscow cop, as the Russia-China crisis escalates and the USA tries frantically to track it.The war novel in this book isn't quite as neat as the spy novel. Clancy does a great job bringing across the human side of things: what it feels like to be a recon group lurking just in front of an enemy division, or a commando team going after a nuclear silo. There's an eerie mixture of skill and luck and personality and the other guy's mistakes that makes up a combat operation, and Clancy captures it all. Clancy also shows off neat tactics, like how to jury-rig a nuclear missile defense, or how to turn an unmanned drone and the Internet into the ultimate propaganda weapon.But I was hoping for more than that. The bad guys in this book try a basically straightforward war, and when the American toys come into that war the bad guys get crushed. This is fun to read. But it isn't much of a surprise. Since 1860 if not earlier it's been suicidal to have a straight fight with someone who has thirty years' technological edge. How would a smart adversary adapt against American forces? What's the year-2000 equivalent of Afghanistani tactics against the Soviet Union or the North Vietnamese tactics against the USA? This book doesn't have to figure it out, because it cheats a little: it assumes the bad guys are dumb.So this is no Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising. Clancy's gift in this book is in the details, not the big picture. But it's fun and you learn a lot. How much more do we ask of a book?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After about 600 pages, I realized that I was not having any fun reading the book, but I was too far along to quit. Clancy's best novels (Red Storm Rising and Clear and Present Danger to name two) were filled with action and suspense, not chapter long diatribes about such issues as abortion, population control and domestic politics. I see that Clancy is trying to move in a different direction with his writing, but it just comes of as contrived and preachy. Until he returns to his former style, I will be passing on all his future books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found this book impossible not to put down.In many of his recent books Clancy has been in serious need of a ruthless editor,but never more than in &quot;The Bear and the Dragon.&quot; There was so much fluff and extraneous material that I found it impossible to follow -- or eventually to care about -- the story line.Even worse,readers are continuously subjected to gratuitous doses of Clancy's political views.Do we really care in the context of the story about President Jack Ryan's views on abortion or social security? A good editor could have shortened this tome by several pages without damaging its content one iota.Then,perhaps we could have decided whether there is enough to the real story to make it interesting and entertaining.Unfortunately,we will never know. Instead,we are stuck with a cast of familiar characters who are no longer interesting or even credible and a world that is impossible to care about."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Too much unnecessary profanity Too much whining by Pres Ryan. Too much Clancy agenda about abortion. Some factual errors. Lone Wolf Gonzales's last name was incorrectly spelled, It was actually Gonzaullas. Whine, whine. Gee I sound like Jack Ryan. Much too long."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not going to summarize this book for you, but Im going to describe something. As readers, we have all had that feeling that is hard to describe with certain books. That feeling that makes us stay up till 3am, just so we can finish that last chapter, that feeling that makes you late for work, cause you have to get past that certain part. Well, this is one of those books. And, if this review can off you anything, it's not to miss reading this book"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First things first, this is obviously fiction, no way a dragon(and just between us this dragon is actually not very good looking) could in anyway win the love and affection of a bear. I mean he has those big claws and teeth...and all the dragon can do is blow fire...flamer. If you want a really good love triangle rent &quot;A Muppet Movie&quot;, many don't see that Kermit is actually in love with Gonzo...it is suttle but it's there, look hard. Besides there where no pictures! I haven't spent the last nine years in nineth grade for nothing. I don't even get the symbolism between the dragons cousin and the mongoose, and what was he doing with toothpicks? But all in all I laughed, I cried and it was a roller coaster of emotions....I LOVED IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The entire first half of this book was offensive, infuriating, and, ultimately, extremely disappointing. I am an avid Clancy reader, having read all of his books. I love them, and I'm a huge fan of Jack Ryan. I'd been awaiting this book since Amazon began taking pre-orders months ago.But in this book, Clancy's nationalism, xenophobia and arch-conservative politics spilled over the top and ruined an otherwise compelling plot. In each of Clancy's books, Clancy's conservative political views on domestic &amp; international governmental policy are apparent. However, his politics are usually seamlessly woven into the story. And the knowledgeable Clancy reader understands that Jack Ryan, the messenger of these politics, is likely Clancy's alter ego. Even Clancy's lengthy political diatribes -- delivered through Jack Ryan -- are tolerable because they are so obtuse. It's Clancy's book. He has a right to use it as a soapbox.Certainly, as Clancy sets up the United States's political and economic enemies for the big fall to come, he must compel the reader to feel enmity for those enemies. But need he pander to racial prejudice in doing so? What is my concern? The repeated, numerous and uniform derogatory racial epithets directed by every American character towards the Chinese people: &quot;little,&quot; &quot;yellow,&quot; etc. (Forget not the blatant references to Chinese genitalia).While I can understand a demeaning reference or two as a literary tool to build the necessary hostility towards the Chinese protagonists in the book, Clancy went too far. It is one matter for one or two characters to make prejudiced remarks in the heat of the moment. It is quite another matter for VIRTUALLY EVERY American in the book to make the same prejudiced remarks repeatedly. I find it implausible within the flow of the story that the entire American government has racially-grounded prejudices against the Chinese. And for Jack Ryan to be the most conspicuous messenger of those sentiments was profoundly disappointing to this fan of Jack Ryan.I hope that Clancy will stick to what he does best: Weave big, compelling plots that celebrate the strength of this country and develop the character of Jack Ryan et al. as American heroes. Leave the cheap xenophobia on the cutting room floor.The second half of the book was redeeming, although the first half set-up detracted from it tremendously."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was surprised at this books portrayal of the people, culture, dress and mentality of modern China. In that respect, this book was a parade of simplistic, bigoted nonsense. It would appear from the contents of this book that Mr. Clancy has never stepped foot in the country, or if he did he landed at night at the airport, went straight to his room at the Beijing Hilton, took off his baseball cap, ordered a hamburger from the Hard Rock Cafe down the street, guzzled a few Budweisers and left the next day with a hangover.This book was very good at vilifying the Chinese to make them into inhuman objects of death, but if he chooses them as antagonists for his next plot, I would suggest that he find a more credible basis to do it from. This book showed even more ignorance of foreign culture than was exhibited by the authors failed attempts at the German language in Rainbow Six. The book also showed the same lack of understanding in its ridiculous portrayal of the Russians as wanabe Americans.I used to be quite literally glued to Tom Clancy's books but it looks like he is just &quot;doing it&quot; for some easy money now. This one was a gift (perhaps also in the German sense). I won't even accept the next one.Before starting his next book, Mr. Clancy should remove his dark glasses and take a very good look around. Or maybe it is just that his Polar Bear rug is blinding him......."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; isn't that bad a read - it has all the trademark Tom Clancy techo-war details that we all buy Clancy books for. But it is a LONG way from being his best work.The problem is that it takes hundreds of pages to get to the good stuff, and while waiting, we're subjected to: a dull plot about a botched assassination, a seduction story that is resolutely unsexy, endless &quot;I don't like this job&quot; complaints from Jack Ryan, and extensive liberal-bashing (he calls them &quot;vampires&quot; and makes numerous reference to the Lewinsky affair, as if conservatives would NEVER fool around...righty-o, Tom!).The problem with this book is that there is too much fat and too many right wing platitudes, and the book simply sags under their weight. Worse yet, the characters are more portraits than people; we know everything they're going to do before they do it.I think Tom Clancy was far more entertaining when he was telling taut sea stories like &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; and &quot;Without Remorse.&quot;Frankly, if Clancy wants my hard earned money, he'll lay off the verbal diarrhea, right wing platitudes, and silly liberal bashing (if I wanted to hear that, I'd listen to Rush Limbaugh) and stick to what he's best at: lean, mean storytelling.Otherwise, this may well be my last Clancy book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A reel disappointment. Four a book to bee enjoyed it helps if it does knot contain sew many speling and typograffikle errurz.I usually enjoy TC's books---but this one was indeed a disappointment. Decent story, but the typos and errors became tedious. Halfway through the book I started circling the obvious errors for entertainment value alone. Obviously the publisher opted to use an automated spell-checker because the book was filled with typos---some funny, but most were annoying and detracted from the reading experience. Just because a word is spelled correctly does not mean it's the right word to use! Next time the publisher might consider having real people proofread TC's novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I started reading this book a few days after the World Trade Center was destroyed by terrorists. I'd read and mostly enjoyed Executive Orders, which contained elements similar to the real-life disaster. From Tom Clancy, I was expecting a cutting-edge description of 21st century warfare, and lots of right-wing politicizing. I got both of those. In spades. In buckets and spades.The first half of The Bear and the Dragon is a leisurely setting up of the chess pieces. A cartoon version of China (whose Politburo is staffed by half-a-dozen foaming copies of Ming the Merciless) wages war on a newly prosperous Russia. The Russians are all hard drinkin' law and order cops. The United States, whose Democrat-led government was swept aside by terrorists two Clancy books ago, has been remade as a conservative military power.And what a power they are! In the second half of the book (roughly 400 pages of the 1100-plus), or about 48 hours of real-time, the USA thwarts the Red Communist threat. It's to Clancy's credit that I read every page of the book and absorbed all his political views, ranging from abortion to religion to gun control to tobacco and booze, and back to religion again (this Clancy guy really watches his &quot;O'Reilly Factor&quot;!). But I knew what I was getting into, so apart from the occasional eye-roll I didn't mentally fight back.If you can stay awake for the 1100 pages, you'll find an old-fashioned flag-waving romp over the Evil Enemy (is there really any other kind). The final 100 pages turn funny as President Ryan leaps out of the Oval Office and into action in the unlikeliest of places. Bear/Dragon has about 0% literary merit, but most people read it for the hardware and the bombs and the political asides, so if you're up for three weeks' worth of those, you're in for a few smiles. And eye-rolls."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"THis book has a scenario that is so unreal, it borders on bad military science fiction. RUssian in NATO, China invading Russia. Right. What's next, flying saucers come to the rescue in part 2, where the secrets of Area 51 are finally revealed by Clancy. THere was once a time when Clancy wrote good books, but his latest, if indeed he does write them himself, are getting worse and worse. Which is apparently okay, becasue somehow they still end up on the best seller lists."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the third Tom Clancy novel that I have read. I was a little unsure about reading it because of all the negative reviews that I have read. I am glad that my interest in President Jack Ryan was greater than my doubts. I finished this book in about eight days. This is not for the weak of heart it contains over a thousand pages.What I didn't like. I was disappointed that the novel jumps ahead to where Jack Ryan is reelected President. I would have liked to read about that process and him having an opponent. Clancy could have talked about campaign reform and all that good stuff but it didn't happen. Clancy gives you the flashback highlights about how Jack got reelected. The only other thing that I didn't like about this book was that Ryan called the Chinese &quot;Klingons&quot; about 80 times. The first time was funny but come on come up with a different term.What I did like. This novel is a good continuation of Executive Orders and I feel it is a better book. Why? One thing there isn't 100 pages of technical blow by blow combat that really has no bearing on the rest of the characters. The assasination attempt on Golovko chairman of the Russian SVR was a good plot. It progressed well and it had an interesting development of FBI agent Mike Reilly. The Chinese angle was tremendous and interesting and showed how cultural differences between two nations can be a major problem in understanding each other. I felt Clancy explored and explained this very well. I also liked that there were opposing viewpoints within the Chinese government. I felt that this made this book very realistic and not comic bookish. Clancy also gives plenty of historical, cultural and detailed background information.What maybe important to you. If you don't like sex scenes in your novels you maybe a little offending by this book. I think it contains about 3 sexual explicit scenes which in my opinion could have been deleted but they also did prove a point. If you are on the ultimate polical correct nature you will be offended by the use of racial slurs toward Asian people. Their is more vulgar language in this book than in Executive Orders but it is reasonable placed. All in all this is a fantastic book. If you like Executive Orders I believe you will like the Bear and the Dragon. It is a faster pace book. This book is a little lower on the Jack Ryan end so if you want to read a lot about Jack it is not in here. The conclusion I felt was better than Executive Orders and Rainbow Six. Not that I liked or disliked the conclusion but I felt that Clancy did not rush the ending like he did on his previous two novels. It is a little preachy on Clancy's views but hey it is his book to write anyway he chooses. This is a work of fiction and I think that people tend to loose sight of that when they read Clancy's books because they are so believeable."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is another triumph in the Ryan saga for Clancy. Ever since the publication of Red October Clancy has created a brilliant fantasy world surrounding this character. Now he is president and the story continues. Clancy manages to combine a fast paced plot with interleaving storylines while still capturing the emotions of the reader. It is a long read, but you won't regret it. Well done again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's been stated over and over again in these reviews, Clancy could not keep HIS politics out of this book. Maybe the divorce and embarassment of not having the money to buy the MN Vikings has turned Clancy a tad bit bitter and it is beginning to refect in his writing. Ryan doesn't like being President we are reminded over and over (we understood this in Executive Orders), we learn to sympathize with the woes of rich and powerful white males, teaching kids to use guns is fine and only liberal weenies and the Left media would object, no oogling at the White House interns and a good national economy has nothing to do with the President, it's all the Federal Reserve. Those are the things we read in the first 86 pages!! Hey Clancy, we know you love Ronald Reagan, please stop transforming Jack Ryan into the MYTH of Reagan. I would not tell anyone not to buy this book because if you can stomach the politics, it's still an adventure. Clancy's talent shines through his politics, buy this book, hold your nose and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first 700 pages were mostly boring - developing each character way too much. All kinds of subplots that have little or nothing to do with the main book. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands following surgery I would have put the book down long ago. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yes, the language is a bit strong.Yes, the editing was sub-par (too many repeated thoughts).But this book provided everything you come to expect from a Clancy novel. Lots of intertwining sub-plots and a good dose of technology and 21st century military stategy. Clancy does apply some controversial political views to Ryan (probably his own) but what president does not have strong convictions often not shared by others? After the large dose of liberal views applied to most Hollywood presidents who demonize conservatives, I have no problem seeing the opposite here. If you do not like his domestic political views, ignore them and enjoy the other 975 pages of international political/military intrigue. Do not get on your high horse and just lable him a right-wing racist.As to the language, these are techno-thillers, often involving warfare and lots of resultant deaths. This is not a Harry Potter childrens book. I find it humorous that some claim to have stopped reading the book due to the language but murder and warfare are just fine.I realize this is more of a defense than a review, but I felt compelled to do so after reading some of the other reviews. Suffice to say I enjoyed the book, not as much as some of Clancy's earlier work but better than almost anything else out there in this genre."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you love Tom Clancy, suspense, or just great books, you will love this book. I am a big Tom Clancy fan because I love his writing style. His books usually start slow, but what he is doing is telling you about several different plots that will eventually converge into huge suspense. Sometimes I even read his books multiple times because I don't realize the importance of the earlier parts of the book. All of his books are worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a Clancy fan for years and thought the character development was a good carry on from his previous work.

And though most of his books have had the scent of the Red Scare in them, this book reeks of it. It reads at times like some sort of late '50s pamphlet, save that it's over 700 pgs. long, but the real question is why? Why take a story brimming with all sorts of intrigue, and pile on this unnecessary, and despite the author's attempts, wholly irrelevant 'Gee, Stalin was bad' material - the amount of it, and sacrifices of flow and plot to insert it are, quite simply, baffling.

This is an aircraft that is provenly better than F-16s, so it should outclass F-14s. OK, the later has long range missiles that can shoot down BOMBERS. A Su-27 isn't a bomber, OK? It is extremelly manouvarable and has extensive capabilities - it can easily escape those missiles.Anotehr thing is how whole Chinese divisions turn to dust - the Chinese are obviously so stupid and don't have any air cover so the US can prance around how they want.The Russians - OK, we get it, Mr Clancy, the Russians are incapble fools who can't defend themselves and have NO technology.Yes, and the US saved Europe from the Germans in WW2. The Russians, like in this book, couldn;t and didn;t do a thing.Russia has the biggest tank force in the world - their Air Force can do more than jsut get shot down and outclassed.Their Special Forces are biologically inferior to everyone else - it takes a whole platoon of Spetsnaz to do what one US GI can do.This is a trend started back from Red Storm Rising - Russians are incapable of anyu military thought.Now the Chinese are as well, and the US suffer no casualties - so the US soldier is biologically better than everyone else and has twice as fast reflexes? So the US plane, 20 years older than the Chinese and ifnerior in every sense, by some strange law of physics that applies to US planes only, destroys everything in its sight?Clancy has regularly over estimated US power - for example giving an Aegis cruiser many more missiles than it can carry so it can survive an onslaught (done in Red Storm) or downclassing foreign weapons by a huge margin (so a T-80 Russian tank has NO laser rangefinder - do they use binoculars to aim then?). He has simply gone too far here.It's so unrealistic on the military side it is not even funny."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Personally, I didn't think that this book was all that bad. Yes i agree the derogatory terms on the Asians went a bit overboard, but i think it was probably done to show the bigotry of the people.. I mean, you cant expect humans to talk super nicely about people they are at war with, and so i dont think we should really dog Mr. Clancy for it either....Anyways, the book itself wasnt all that bad...Clancy changed course a bit when he had the Russians and Americans hanging out together, but it was a good change. The battles that actually transpired were very cool, and nicely written. The book did take a little while to start with, and i admit that i might not have finished if it wasn't for the underlying sense of intrigue and other cool stuff waiting to happen. The people who go off on the book cause they are 300 pgs. in and think its not going to amount to anything need to continue reading, they are barely more than 1/3 of the way through. I saw some comments also mentioning the cursing and increased sexuality..The sexuality part really trails off after a while, becomes that particualar aspect really doesnt need any more clarification, and we get the idea anyways. The language part didnt seem too terrible to me..Im sure not all of it was necessary, but i still dont think it is as bad as some people say, certainly not more than &quot;clear and present danger&quot;. I enjoyed the book very much, though it took me over a week to read, but i dont argue with length, it just makes the book more in-depth and interesting. The only apparent problem with the book was that with so many subplots going on i think Clancy got lost and forgot to go back to them occasionally, but other than that I recommend it, just give it a while, and believe me, it will pull you in."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every Clancy novel featuring Jack Ryan, and I like all of them until this one. Yes, I know this is only fiction, but since Clancy cares so much about little details, shouldn't he at least create a world that looks like the one we live today? His idea about China and Chinese people seems to stay in the 1980's, and they're so stereotyped that it could only be called racism. Did he spend time to even study China and it's people? I think not. Also, his idea about economics are just plain stupid. He thinks that $100bln is such a large amount of money that it would somehow save Russia's economy. Do you know that $100bln is about what Russia gets from selling crude oil this year? A compleate waste of time and money!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a Tom clancy fan but I must say this book may change that. the book is full of errors, impossible assumptions and repetitive, boring languages.ten biggest shortcomings of the book1. China is still in Qing dynasty style in B&amp;D, does anyone believe that?2. I have no idea why the part about trade negotiation need to be in the story.3. If a couple had a child but the child died, you can have another one, legally, no problem4. Normal cops does NOT carry guns and in cities, especially Beijing, cops will think a second time before they get rough with foreigners.5. Jack Ryan was president for 15 months, and he is still wondering &quot;how I get to sit here?&quot;6. Secretary to a high-ranking official is not so stupid to do what a foreigner tod her to do on a top secret computer, even they are in &quot;love&quot;.7. The book is too long and has too many unnecessary swears in it.8. Labeling China as Nazi and uncivilised is downright insulting.9. The story is predictable and unrealistic. the war scene described is too one-sided and if that is the case no one in his sane mind will start a war in the first place.10. Mr Clancy seems to forget that Jack Ryan have had two war already. a repeat of style is boring to say the least.My suggestion: Let Jack Ryan retire and Mr. Clancy may consider a trip to China."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't expect this to be read, but I have to agree with all the previous die-hard fans (have to go out and buy the book the same day of release). I've never come here to read a review of TC before, his quality was always high. I came here just to see if I was the only one with this sense of disappointment. Not by a long shot - too long (or too thin on story line), too many phrases repeated immediately afterward by another character, an enemy that never had a chance to be a good villian, and an ending that befitted a 60 minute TV program - the list is very long and casts doubt who is writing/editing his work.I will return here before I buy my next Clancey novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's too bad that Clancy has either forgotten how to write an exciting book or has so much money that he just doesn't care anymore. The first 600 pages of this waste of trees are spent primarily badmouthing and/or demeaning everyone in sight (chinese, russians, germans, israelis, jews, blacks, congressmen, women, the Supreme Court, Democrats, Pres.Clinton, supporters of abortion rights, the press.....). Apparently in Clancy's world the only really worthy people are white catholic men. Clancy's idea of ongoing character development is to turn all of his usual cast of formerly admirable characters/heroes into completely unsympathetic ones. The principal protaganist, jack ryan, has developed from an interesting, thoughful character into a whiney, self-absorbed one (much like Clancy himself from the interviews I've seen). If the author's books had started out this way he would have been relegated to the remainder's list with book one.There are no original ideas here (Red Storm Rising rides again) and a complete failure to generate any tension. Every plot turn is telegraphed well in advance and there is absolutely no suspense created nor surprises to be had. There was either no independant editor for this book (&quot;department of redundancy department&quot; phrases abound throughout {&quot;didn't I just read that?&quot;})or the publisher just figures &quot;hey - we'll sell millions anyway so who cares if the writing is c**p&quot;.I have kept in my library every clancy that I've purchased. Not this one - it will be donated to my local library in hopes of saving some other potential sucker from wasting their hard earned money in support of Clancy's colossal ego.It's too bad that &quot;no stars&quot; is not an option - save your money!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, so this isn't a masterpiece, though some of the reviews written go too far. In writing as he did about the Chinese, Clancy can be viewed as racist, or afraid of foreigners, or a bigot, or a whatever. I belive what Clancy did, however, was to create an 'Us vs. Them' scenario...just as in every Clany novel. Other than the obvious terrorist action and the middle east conflict, the world seems to be without a serious, global threat. Because he'd just written about terrorism (somewhat) and Iran/Iraq (though it looks as though he wants to stay away from the Israel situation), Clancy had to create a \\"Bad Guy.\\" And, obviously, Clancy chose China to wear the dark hat.One problem with his most recent novels has been finding something to write about. He has, in fact, had to manufacture evil recently. When looking at the story as a manufactured \\"Us vs. Them\\" scenario (just as in Rainbow Six), it really isn't all that bad...of course, it does have its repetitions."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I will keep this brief - unlike Clancy.This book is the worse book that I have read from Tom Clancy.The characters are pretty one-dimensional. The Chinese in particular seem to have no saving graces. The book has a fairly racist characterization of the Chinese, in general.Filled with pointless sex.Extremely repetitive. How many times can he refer, for instance, to \\"sausage\\"?Clearly, expouses a very-right wing political view point that would never work were these characters actually running the country in reality.He should stick to his strengths and talk about miltiary technology issues as he has done in his best books: Red Storm Rising and Red October. This book was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm only about 250 pages into this book and so far NOTHING is happening except a LOT of useless and unnecessary inner monologues and ridiculous dialog. If something actually happens, I might be willing to give 3 stars.Reading this book (so far) is like watching a version of a movie on DVD in which edited portions have been included. It's glaringly obvious why those portions were edited out of the final version - they do nothing to advance the plot or characters. Clancy needs to fire his editor because it would appear large portions of this book could go missing and nothing substantial would be lost. In fact, it might become a more interesting and fast paced read!Like others, I find the foul language and racial slurs totally unnecessary and somewhat distracting. And finally, liberals (even moderates) be warned. It seems Mr. Clancy has decided to use Jack Ryan as an outlet for his own very conservative views. Again, totally unnecessary to the overall plot (which I'm having trouble discerning at this point.) I hope it improves as I don't like quitting books in the middle!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"i have always been a fan of his earlier books but it seems that tom clancy is losing his touch. it seems that his vocabulary is limited to the few f words and those lousy, lousy really lousy sex stuff... if you want to read tom clancy read his earlier books. he should go sell his insurance instead of writing books that are full of stereotypes. had there been things such as -5 stars, i would think that he fully merits it. too bad the minimum bar is a star. i wonder who send it to the bestseller list. i must have been one of those blind fools."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a very entertaining book, though the ending seems too abrupt for a work of 1,000-plus pages. I read this during the flap over the EP-3 surveillance plane that landed in Hainan and found that the China of &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot; was all too similar to the one in the news, with cynical, propaganda-peddling Maoist leaders trying to reconcile their failed ideology to the realities of an emerging capitalist state. Ryan is superb as the refreshingly politically-incorrect Leader of the Free World, and the book offers an enlightening take on high stakes diplomacy. Not Clancy's best work, but still a very good read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Slow start, but great battle scenes. Jack Ryan has become a bit tiresome and the Hollywood ending is sort of silly."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"AS others have said, the book could have been shorter. It seems that the luster of Clancy's previous books has been replaced with the need to throw in a handful of profanity and an occasional limited sex scene.If this keeps up, the dialogue will become something akin to that of the Rogue Warrior series by Dick Marcinko!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Customary Clancy and that is the conundrum. Like every other book in the Ryan collection, THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is an account of what, presumingly, could happen. (In this instance, the threat Chinese adventurism into a de-clawed Russia brings to international security and stability.)As any long time reader should expect, there are multiple at-surface-value unrelated events eventually commencing to merge somewhere near the midpoint of this 1028 page volume. There is a liberal mix of espionage and covert operations, with the lengthy, but meticulous, descriptions of technological battlement available in the U.S. arsenal. Anyone looking for a wide range of complex multi-dimensional characters should look elsewhere. Such character development has never really been a focus of this series and there is little deviation here.For me, the problem has become one of familarity and freshness. Clancy has always written in a present time context with an eye toward prominent political and economic issues. Real time, real life plausibility enhanced my ability to accept his premises. BATD is not centered on what I perceive to be a legitimate threat to U.S. or international security. That said, the conclusion although not unexpected, left me feeling unfulfilled. My marginal dissatisfaction is neither based entirely on plot unbelievability, nor necessarily did I find content and style disconcerting. By and large, BATD does not detour from what I anticipated, and THAT has become the problem.As the leader of the free world, the protagonist, Jack Ryan cannot reasonably be expected to remain as singularly focused as he was portrayed in each book - where he appeared as the central character - prior to EXECUTIVE ORDERS. As president, his beliefs are part of the story. The philosophical positions of his opposition (whether Clancy supports or disagrees, whether they are politically correct) are incumbent to crafting an intriguing story line. It's simply not precisely the same focus as the initial books in this series, like RED OCTOBER or THE CARDINAL.On one level, the series could be re-energized by identification of threats of greater feasibility and probability, or it just might be time to pass the lead character baton to Ding Chavez and get back to the espionage and attention to technological detail that originally made me seek out each of the newest releases as soon as they were available."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's been awhile since I've paid for a Clancy book, mostly I just wait till I can check them out at the library for free. Which was a wise decision in the case of his latest effort. Not that it was bad per se, however, while it delivered the basics in terms of readability and entertainment value, one really should expect a lot more from one of America's best selling authors. In short, Clancy is just coasting on the reputation he built up with his initial novels, knowing full well that just about anything with his name on the cover will hit the best seller lists, so why try any harder than he has to?This is a shame, and the result is a series of books which, much like the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; or &quot;Die Hard&quot; movies, succeeds mainly by sticking to a predictable formula. It basically goes like this: Bad guys will cook up a scheme to wreak havoc on the civilized world, this scheme will eventually be detected by the good guys (led by Jack Ryan) who, after suffering some initial setbacks, will win the day with a combination of high tech wizardry and good old John Wayne style guts. Which is Ok as far as it goes, however Clancy, having made more money than God with his novels, film royalties, video games, etc., is surely in a position to take some risks, and expand his craft as a writer. Unfortunately, he seems content to follow the easy route, and stick with a tried and true, if uncreative, formula.Anyway, the gist of this book is this. A handful of warlords in mainland China decide they want to seize some very valuable oilfields and gold mines in Far Eastern Siberia. They plot an invasion, and in due time, set in it motion. Of course, they are, in the end, utterly defeated (Oh, I know that's considered a &quot;spoiler&quot;, but let's be honest, does anyone have the least doubt that this is the final outcome?) and Jack Ryan, John Clark, Ed &amp; Mary Pat Foley, and a host of lesser characters triumph in the end. There are, of course, the trademark battle scenes in which the Good Guys utilize the latest technology to win the day, just as surely as Bond can be expected to vanquish SPECTRE thanks in large part to Q's ingenious gadgets. Like I said, pure formula, and Clancy, I suppose, can at least be credited for making the formula work in producing yet another best seller.Too bad he didn't try harder. He does attempt to grapple with some genuinely tough foreign policy issues, and he also has the guts to put China's population control policy in an appropriately negative light. Unfortunately, that's as far as it goes. No question that the current Chinese leadership are villains with the blood of Tianamnen Square fresh on their hands, however, I very much doubt they are are as stupid and simple minded as Clancy makes them out to be. His ending (another spoiler) in which Chinese students peacefully seize power from the Politburo seems entirely contrived. The whole thing is just entirely too simplistic, one gets the impression that Clancy made little effort to actually learn about how the Chinese government, authoritarian though it may be, actually functions. Its leaders may indeed be evil, but I very much doubt they are the buffoons Clancy makes them out to be. The future of relations between China and the USA is still very much up in the air. Hopefully, in due time, they will choose to join the rest of the civilized world in terms of supporting individual liberty and human rights, but as far as this novel goes, instead of taking a serious look at how this process might evolve, settles for giving us yet another cliched &quot;Techno-thriller&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book confirms Clancy's status as one of the best writers of political-techno fiction around. Yes, it was long, very long, but I thought that the highly-involving story and interesting characters made up for the somewhat slow pace of the novel (that has been complained about below ad nauseum). I disliked the writer's strong moral bias towards America and against the Chinese, and the way that everything runs perfectly for the Americans (&quot;the underdogs&quot;) while the Chinese stumble at every opportunity. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the relationships between the characters as well as the unusual scenario that is presented by Clancy as having the potential to cause a nuclear war."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The publisher wasted the money they advanced Clancy, I wasted my money when I bought the book, and I wasted my time in reading the first 300 pages before tossing it.I have read and re-read all Clancy's previous novels. I own them all. Unfortunately, I doubt if I shall ever buy or read another. Sorry, Tom: this was a huge turn-off. Take a week off and read &quot;Hunt For Red October' and discover what a real writer can do."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As usual, Tom Clancy delivers. His first book brought me back in terms of reading. And his work to date has made me an avid reader. \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" will sit comfortably next to the many other great works by Clancy. Jack is back, a bit more relaxed and in tune with the Presidency, Mr. Clark is also among the cast of characters that Clancy fans have grown to love. As is always the case with any of the recent Clancy novels, be prepared to invest some time in thumbing through the pages of this book. In the end the payoff is well worth the time invested. I also recommend, \\"Fruits of a Poisonous Tree,\\" by Norm Harris, a fresh new entry into the world of military action and adventure. It is satisfying, fast paced, and the time invested will be shorter. In either case, if you love Tom Clancy, you will not be wasting your time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Unlike the book, I shall make this brief. I had been an avid Clancy fan...until now. The Bear and the Dragon is filled with simplistic, stereotyped, and bigoted portrayals of just about everyone. It is filled more with proselytizing and what appears to be Clancy's personal views of the world than with character development. The writing is sloppy with numerous and rediculous repetitions (&quot;yeah Wilbur&quot;) and the descriptions of technology are inconsistent, with state-of-the art weaponry and completely out of date personal computers and internet connections. I could go on, but that may be as boring as many of the detailed war scenes. Tom, please return to the creative and careful writing of books past."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have never drifted as much with any other book. Meaning I would start reading, and while I'm reading I would think about other things. I drifted! The novel should have been condensed to about 600 hundred pages.Recommend....The library, even if you have to wait for weeks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; certainly has a lot in common with some recent Clancy outings, and with some &quot;big&quot; works by other authors. Tom Wolfe's &quot;A Man in Full&quot; comes to mind, with its vivid characterizations, its keen sense of setting, its complex and fun buildup -- and its relatively disappointing ending that's just too quick and too easy.Clancy's latest outing shares this fault, and has a couple of others. He reuses metaphors in a really distracting way, such as when, twice in 150 pages, he tells us a particular Navy-owned computer was &quot;the flower of 1975 technology&quot; but that it doesn't perform nearly as well as a modern iMac.Despite these faults, it's a compelling read, and fans will devour its 1,028 pages in a few days. The military detail is awe-inspiring, the social commentary is relevant (although sometimes you're not quite sure when his characters are reflecting on actual history or the U.S. history in Clancy's own parallel universe), and the action is first-rate. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is set seven months or so after the action in &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; It's a pity we don't get Clancy's epic installments that often."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"He kept me hooked for the entire time. I read it in less than 48 hours including sleep."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Fantastic book - Clancey has another hit! Unfortunately, the publishing company really needs to find a better proofreader - dumb errors - use of the wrong word - like &quot;ever&quot; when the intent of the sentence was &quot;never&quot; ...but then again, what's a few missing letters? It's still a great read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Once again, Clancy thrills and amazes with technology and intrigue in The Bear and The Dragon. Clancy has written great techno-thrillers since the Hunt For Red October, and the continuity of the characters from ALL of his books is simply amazing. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE appears in The Bear and The Dragon, characters from almost every book he's written, and that's what makes his newest book so fun to read. I think that it will be interesting to see who becomes the next Jack Ryan in Clancy's novels. Could it be Chet Nomuri? I can't wait to see!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Great Book.However, as I always read the new Clancy book as soon as it is released -- this one is a continuation of &quot;Executive Orders&quot; which was released three years ago -- it took me a little while to remember what was going on... The standard characters are familiar, but I had almost forgotten the politics of the last book -- other than the fact that Jack Ryan was now president.I did love the book and this one has enough of the separate plots and subplots to be classic Clancy. He is definitely the master storyteller!If you love Clancy -- definitely read this book. If you are new to the author, I recommend &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;... ;-)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After the last Jack Ryan novel ended with him being sworn in as President, I could not stand the wait for Clancy to publish this book of Ryan AS President. Well, now it's here, and it was worth the wait. Ryan has a lot to deal with, and there are enough subplots and characters to fill a Russian novel. You may have trouble keeping track of the characters and subplots, but it's worth the effort. This is the best thriller novel since Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE, and I hope Harrison Ford will be still young enough to play Ryan when they make THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON into a movie. (I can't help but think Clancy waited for the presidential campaigns in real life to start up to publish this book, to give an indirect boost to the Republicans. But that's speculation. I don't mind if he did, though.) A rivetting read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Well, Tom Clancy's latest is probably the best book he has ever written. All of the old favorites reappear, including some people so obscure that they may have been forgotten from The Cardinal of the Kremlin and Clear and Present Danger. Being Tom Clancy, its got its usual dose of military fun, plus a few humorous moments involving the Ryans. Our two favorite military people (Bart Mancuso, Robby Jackson) have once again been promoted, with both wielding amazing power. Oh, I don't understand how a Chinese man can mistake a pimp for Sergey Golvoko.... Or, for that matter, the six members of the Ryan clan, esp. the President"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's newest title belongs in the same category as his previous works, without a doubt. Ryan hasn't been in any of Clancy's books since Executive Orders, so this is a welcome change. As a continuation of the Jack Ryan series, all of the old characters are there- even Chet Nomuri, the CIA spook who spied on Japanese businessmen in Debt of Honor.I always like Clancy's commentary on the various issues of the world...as the amazon.com reviewer notes, there are several general lessons in all of his books: upgrade and expand the military, defeat communism, hire more people who know the street instead of those who are wannabes, and use the earth for human benefit instead of worrying about environmental impact too much.Clancy's newest book does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear And The Dragon I felt was not worth reading. President Ryan is back in action, but this time instead of being the man that Clancy has shown to us in the past, we now get a complainer and someone who talks down to his staff like they are children. We then meet Chester Normani who is in Communist China to sneak into the governments secret through having sex with one of the Chinese interns.Then in Russia, a pimp is killed thanks to a RPG in Moscow, and oil and gold is discovered in Siberia. Now as the Russians rush to Siberia, China then gets the idea for invading Russia because they have oil and gold and that is what China needs to get their economy booming again. So now as they go into war mode, we then get back to Ding and John Clark who then go to Moscow to train with the Russians. So now, China and Russia are at war, and of course America steps in and in shock only three F-14 Tomcats are lost to the Chinese. There are no American casulities which I found kind of strange. Then the war is over, and Jack Ryan retires the Presidency to Robby Jackson; his Vice-President who is assassinated because he is the first black man to reach that spot.So why did I not like the book? I found this book very stupid, and too long. There is so much mention of sex I thought I was reading a bigger portion of Choke by Chuck Palahniuk. Not worth reading, if you want to read something by Clancy, read Debt of Honor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The story is OK, but since this is abridged a lot of the story is missed. The book is very good but the abridgement ruins the story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book could have been cut in half and been more interesting. It was slow in getting to the story. There were so many characters to keep track of that it took a while to sort them out. Jack Ryan is the president who sounds like he really doesn't like his job, which is contrary to what I have seen in the election battles which we have seen over the years. We have Russia which has discovered a huge oil field in Siberia and gold, another big find. We have China who wants it, the United States who is trying to help Russia (which is just the opposite of what we have seen in years, the U.S. trying to build and strengthen Russia, the very country we have been opposed to all these years?). The greed I can see, in fact, right now, we are in a war fighting for oil, so it just doesn't ring true. The book was so-so and I can't really say I would recommend it. This doesn't mean that I wouldn't read another of his books because I would, because he has written some great ones."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As Tom Clancy novels go this one isn't up to muster. It lacks the mystery, intrigue, and surprize that Clancy is known for.Clancy books usually start you out down one path for a while and then you find out that this was just the setup for the main story. This book doesn't do that at all. The end of the story is anticlimactic as well.The other strange thing I noticed was a distinct repetition in phrases. This may be a literary 'feature' but it sure felt out of place to me.This book is not bad but not worth the full cover price. Try it at a discount or better, used."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is not up to standards clancy used us to. It is less gross than sum of all fears, but still, at points it is even boring. Strong language to fill a content vacuum and repetitions are common. Rayan is not the pleasant character he used to be - he has become arrogant and pretentious. A true disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While Tom Clancy's fascination for military technology led to his creation of the \\"techno-thriller\\", with each new book he also expanded the personalities and politics in his make-believe reality. Unfortunately, The Bear and the Dragon seems to lose its way by comparison to his earlier novels, like Red October or Patriot Games. Though the story runs along at a good pace, it suffers from repeated scene changes between Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, with a dateline that can disorientate. It is rendered even more difficult by the inclusion of enough characters-with-long-names-that-you-can't-pronounce to fill Carnegie Hall, an overload of acronyms, and minimal character development.Having said all that, Clancy's hallmarks are his ability to blend realism and authenticity with intricate plotting and razor-sharp suspense. The Bear and The Dragon achieves what it sets out to do. As usual, the plot is way over the top, with subplots erupting like weeping carbuncles all over the place, and strange characters being unpleasant to each other every few pages. Even so, Clancy finds time to insert his usual non-too-subtle lessons on the vileness of Communism, the (unfair) intrusions of the press on presidential power, the sexual perversions of Mao (and anybody else who's not 110% American), the poor quality of Russian pistol silencers (and anything else that wasn's built in hometown America), the folly of cutting a man's throat with a knife (apparently they \\"flop around and make noise\\" when you do that), and other similar Clancy-like topics. It goes without saying that The Bear and The Dragon positively bristles with intriguing state-of-the-art military hardware. We're never quite sure how much of it really exists, or how much is in Clancy's imagination. In honesty, we don't really care, just as long as Tom Clancy goes on amusing us.Though The Bear and The Dragon is not Clancy at his best, it's still sufficiently Clancyesque, and in this genre there are few better authors. Maybe next time he will make a better job of hiding his right-wing xenophobia. We've always known it was there, but it's better when it doesn't jump out and smack you in the face... ouch!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is to fiction what the &quot;White Raven&quot; is to movies. It establishes a base line of mediocrity and tedium virtually unparelelled by anything else you'll find. Clancy can't keep from editorializing about former real life politicians, and he also exposes himself to be a racist and sexist through the so-called dialog of his shallow and boring characters. If you see this one in the bookstore, do yourself a favor and LEAVE IT. It's time to retire, Tom."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"i think the book might present a better and more logical backdrop to the chinese invasion of siberia by mentioning the historic facts concerning how siberia was lost to russia in the 19 century by the corrupt and incompetent Qing Dynasty regime. This may provide a more balanced reasoning for the poliburo members, rather than depicting them as simple minded greedy thugs."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I must admit, the first time I read this book I was only able to get as far as page 300 before I stopped reading it out of disgust. I was offended by Clancy's use of racially derogatory terms - \\"little yellow friend\\" is one of the least offensive slang terms he uses. About six months later, I started up where I left off. And I must admit, the novel wasn't as bad (or offensive) as I thought it would be.The biggest problem with being one of the world's most successful authors is always trying to top yourself. Unfortunately, Clancy hasn't been able top himself this time. I really enjoyed his previous effort - Executive Orders. Even though it was close to a 1000 pages, it had a tight narrative and a fast pace. The same can't be said for his latest book - the pace just isn't fast enough, and it isn't very tightly written. There's too many points where his characters (especially Ryan), will start musing about topics that have no immediate relation to events in the book. For instance, there's one point where Ryan and his Chief-of-Staff have a discussion about Presidential affairs with White House interns. Huh?Another problem that I had is Clancy's failure in not allowing Ryan's character to progress. By the end of Executive Orders it was obvious that Ryan is now comfortable with being President, and that the country is comfortable with him. This is made very clear in a very well-written epilogue, where Ryan is holding a press conference with the White House press corps. But when we next see Ryan at the beginning of \`The Bear and the Dragon', he's still bitching about his job. Yes, being President is a dreadfully stressful job. But does Clancy have to emphasise that issue every single time Ryan appears? The impression I got (however false) is that Ryan has gone from being a heroic character to being a pathetic whiner.Another disturbing new trend is the excessive and inappropriate use of swear-words in this novel. It's almost as though Tom Clancy is trying to channel Kevin Smith - and trying to turn Jack Ryan into Jason Mewes. I don't think an author as good as Tom Clancy should have to use offensive language to prop up a story - no matter how weak that story is. In other words, leave scatalogical jokes to the experts, Mr Clancy.In conclusion, \`The Bear and the Dragon' isn't quite the disaster that most people make it out to be. I call it SW1 (Star Wars: Episode 1) syndrome. Everyone was expecting a truly great story, and they didn't get quite what they expected. It's obvious that Mr. Clancy is getting a little of weary of writing Jack Ryan novels. Perhaps it's time for him to focus on other novels in the same universe - perhaps another novel focusing on Rainbow Six? Now there's a sequel to Executive Orders I can live with!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've got all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books and have enjoyed mostof them.However, I'm TIRED of Clancy's politics. They can't even becalled right wing - more like blindly pro-government. Clancyis given to using his books as anti-encryption propaganda,presumably on the theory that the FBI and other governmentagencies are as honorable and professional as the agents in hisbooks (and there was no one else trying to read unencryptedemail).It'd be nice if it was so. Unfortunately, one incident in thislatest book was so outrageous as to be macabre: after aChinese policeman shoots a priest holding a newborn infant,a character comments that in the US law enforcement officersdon't shoot people holding babies. Apparently he has neverheard of Ruby Ridge.The Bear and the Dragon was an OK if predictable Summer read.I hope that Clancy eventually aims for a higher goal."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Is it me or do publishing houses no longer employ people to read books for typos and plot and character inconsistencies??? I've read all of the Jack Ryan books - until this one, I loved them all. I couldn't get more than 100 pages into this one due to the errors. Sorry, Tom - great stories, NO editing!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Bear and Dragon is an utterly horrid piece of .... I'm a long-time Clancy fan, but, if this is the best he can do nowadays, he should retire from writing fiction. A single \\"star\\" is far too high a rating for this .... Amazon's rating system should allow negative numbers for \\"books\\" such as this. Ick."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a Jack Ryan-novel fan and a conservative, I must say Mr. Clancy has done more to advance liberal and protectionist causes in this latest trash novel. The first third of the book is little more than personal propaganda, which while I agree with much of (except his insance protectionist stance), has no place in this popular entertainment. It just didn't add much to the story line (except for the late term abortion segment in China which was topical AND contributed to the story). Much of it was simply silly trivia - - why did he have to waste several pages describing the President's visit to the dentist?I also found his use of vulgarities and racial epithets highly offensive. No doubt liberals will soon be able to brand Mr. Clancy - - with some justification a racist - - a racist. He could have advanced his story line - - and maintained who his villains were - - with none of the inflammatory language he uses, and which he hadn't used extensively in prior novels. I suppose Mr. Clancy forgets that many patriotic &quot;slanted eyed&quot; &quot;Chinks&quot; live and work in America as citizens, and it didn't occur to him some might be offended.Finally, it was an exceedingly poorly written work. As side entertainment I finally began counting the number of obvious mistakes that made their way into the paperback version (I refuse to pay full price for hard-cover any more), including:p. 135 &quot;They could do anything with computers these days--make Rosie O'Donnell into Triggy, or Cindy Crawford obsolete.&quot; Clearly Clancy meant &quot;obese&quot;, not &quot;obsolete&quot;.p. 196 'Winston grunted &quot;Not hardly&quot;.' The use of double negatives shows up a LOT in the recent novels, and grates me no end. These are supposed to be the educated brass of American leadership, frequently employing double-negatives? It makes them appear to be doofuses. Ryan uses &quot;not hardly&quot; on p. 474, Robby Jackson says &quot;I've never seen nothing like this before&quot; on p. 575, and on p. 1050 Jackson says &quot;you just can't hardly lose this way&quot;. Maybe Clancy really is illiterate.P. 430 '&quot;How do we expect them to react?&quot; one of Rutledges underlings asked, sparing his boss the necessity of asking the obvious and fairly dumb question. The answer was equally dumb &quot;Your guess is as good as mine.&quot;' Later in the same scene, ON THE SAME PAGE, Clancy contradicts this exchange: '&quot;How will the Chinese react?&quot;, Rutledge asked Hitch. &quot;Not sure, Cliff, but I doubt we'll like it.&quot; These mistakes are REALLY irritating.p. 680 '&quot;Is this for real?&quot; The DC asked?' Clancy means the &quot;DCI&quot;. &quot;Director of Central&quot; or &quot;DC&quot; doesn't mean anything.p. 691 '&quot;What's the big deal&quot;, Jack asked. Clancy means &quot;John&quot;; obviously he confused his own characters. Jack is back at the White House, about 5,000 miles away."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"No one has ever accused Tom Clancy of being a great writer, but in the Bear and the Dragon he hardly appears to be trying. The book is poorly edited, plot lines are dropped or added arbitrarily, and the dialogue is so bad that it has to be read to be believed. In some of his earlier books, Clancy did show that he could construct a fast-moving plot, and turn out entertainment, if not art. But at this point in his career, he can't even do that. Of course, he continues to sell well based on his earlier work, but you have to wonder how long this will continue."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. Clancy (whom I thought was right-leaning) apparently cannot go 4 or 5 pages without using the &quot;s&quot; word or the &quot;f&quot; word. Even Jack Ryan regularly uses the latter (did he do that in the previous books? I don't think so). Tom Clancy has sold out."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon has as usual in Clancy books, a huge gallery of people, a somewhat intricate plot and countless lessons in US politics, US economics and howto's and hownotto's in running large nations. What was well written and part of the plot in \\"Debt of Honour\\", now feels utterly boring and book-wise landfill.I've read every single novel Clancy ever wrote, and for every one, the underlying message just gets clearer; Americans are pure, christian, moral, fair and competent. All other nations and/or cultures are perverse, corrupt, lazy and outright stupid. So, when something really Bad happens because of the Other Guys stupitidy/laziness, Uncle Sam sends some of his Competent Moral People to save their sorry butts. And when battle erupts, only the Other Guys die. Repeat until fade.What's with Tom Clancy and smoking/se*/alcohol anyway? As a European I cannot for the life of me understand why he even bothers writing about it like it was sensational. I smoke and drink and have se* all the time - it's not what I want to read about in a book like this.The persons in the book are unusually one-dimensional, even for Clancy. Robby Jackson's father Hosiah and General Bondarenko are the only characters with a minimum of spark. All the others fail to stand out and just vanishes into nothing as soon as you turn the page. Too bad, because Clancy have done this better before.The technical research used to be Clancys hallmark, but even here he manages to disappoint me. The Red Baron did NOT fly around in a Fokker Trimotor! The trojan horse in Mings computer also confused me. I don't think it would have worked as easy as that. They have firewalls even in China.All in all this was a disappointing book, partly because Clancy doesn't seem to decide whether he has a parallell universe to toy with, or a could-be future of the world at hand. For example, he makes a couple of references to the Clinton/Lewinsky affair, but I cannot see where Clinton fits into the timeline of the Jack Ryan books. There are no twists to this book whatsoever, no cliffhangers at all. Even the ICBM at the end of the book is predictable...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every Clancy novel - usually getting it for Christmas and reading it before New Years. This one I started at Christmas and put down a while and didn't finish until April. Does that say something about how it held my attention or just turned me off? Maybe.China has depleted all of its cash reserves and their bargaining with the US to gain favored nation status is not going well when a televised tragic incident in Beijing involving the Chinese police, the Vatican ambassador and an American-educated Chinese Baptist pastor brings the negotiations to a sudden end. Meanwhile, Russia discovers a rich deposit of oil and gold in Siberia, not far from the Chinese border. What are the Chinese to do?It is typical Clancy. It is a well-researched technopolitical thriller with cliche character development, but many interweaving subplots. Throughout the series, we have watched, rather incredulously, the meteoric rise of Jack Ryan from history professor to the reluctant President of the United States. Now we watch great hordes saved by incredible luck. Don't get me wrong - I like the stories. As far as Clancy books go, I'll rate this one somewhere in the middle.The thing that completely turned me off, though, was the sex and language that contributed nothing to the story. It seems that Clancy sprinkled the book with profanity just for the sake of inserting profanity, and did similarly with the awkwardly-written sex scenes. Clancy should stick to writing about political exchange and weapons systems.So the story was good, but the sex and language took away from my being able to enjoy this book, so this will probably be the last Clancy book that I read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having enjoyed many of Clancy's earlier books I was highly disappointed in this effort that seemed created solely for the purpose of putting as many words, many misspelled and grammatically incorrect, on as many pages as possible.Trying to keep track of the multitude of characters that kept popping up with different, and unpronounceable names was an exercise in futility. I gave up when less than one-third of the way through.I attempted to get away without awarding any stars, but the format wouldn't allow it. The single star is awarded 'tongue-in-cheek.It's sad when I think of all the trees that had to be destroyed to print that worthless effort. Of course, Clancy could care less. If for no other reason, his continual sarcastic reference to 'tree-huggers' has turned me off his writing for all time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I will be brief. Do not make the same mistake that I have made: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. One of the most unrealistic books I have ever read. Mr. Clancy seems not to understand the modern battlefield. Let me just ask you a question: Is it possible for the United States and Russia to be involved in a mojor conflict with China, and only lose 800 men? I do not thinks so. To add an injuty to the insult, China invedes Russia in orderder to capture a Gold mine. Now what is this: Fairy Tale? Mr. Clancy seems to have run out of imagination, and includes all of his previous characters:Jack Ryan, the Rainbow Six Team, and etc. Do yourself a favor: do not read a 1000 pages of poorly written, unbeilivble, self centered piece of work. There are better books out there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Tom Claney's books and really have enjoyed them. I did feel that he was giving too much detail, but I managed to get passed that. The Bear and the Dragon was just terrible. Entirely too much detail and too many people to remember. 1200 pages, he could have written a book with half that amount of text and it probably would have been better. I won't rush out to buy another hard cover first edition of Claney's until I have read some reviews."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found this book to be an immensely enjoyable read. Clancy constructs a very plausible world crisis situation. The China bashing is based upon real world assessments and fact. The book attacks the people who subvert the true will of the masses in that most ancient and honorable land. I am convinced that his sources are career diplomats and agency people who are eager to help Clancy present &quot;what if&quot; scenario's before they become real world occurences. Of particular note is the seduction of Ming. Blunt and honest in its execution, Clancy shows his overridding respect for humanity by giving the protagonist a conscience. The action is riveting and accelerates to a nail biting, gee-whiz conclusion for which Clancy is famous. If you truly follow world politics and history, this book is a must for understanding the dangerous but exciting world of the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I just finished reading The Bear and the Dragon. This is the fifth Tom Clancy novel I have read, and it will probably be my last. It reads as if Mr. Clancy dashed off an outline and a list of characters, sat down at his word processor and churned out as many words as he could, ran a quick spell check, and sent it to the printer.For example, when Jack Ryan spends a page musing to himself about having the Secret Service to keep the boys dating his daughter in line, then later repeats the entire page almost verbatim in a conversation with another character, that is just filling up space.When Mr. Clancy describes, in detail, the sequence that Mary Pat Foley goes through to check her secure e-mail, EVERY TIME SHE CHECKS HER E-MAIL, that is just filling up space.Another peeve: when characters use profanity in dialogue, that is excusable as character development. When the author uses profanity in his narration of the story line, that is an inexcusably cheap attempt at impact.Throw in several mis-spellings that got past the computer spell check, but should have been caught by a real editor (e.g. &quot;soldering&quot; for &quot;soldiering&quot;) and it all adds up to a novel long on word count but short on actual story.Tom, for your next attempt, PLEASE get an editor!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"How many times must we see the same cut and pasted text?How many times must we meet 'Perfect' people (4.0 GPAs, PhDs, The Best of the Best, the absolute integrity, Halleluja I have been saved by the Prince of Peace, Jack Ryan)How many times must Jack whine about being President. Alright Tom, we get the point, &quot;Those who desire power are the worst ones to excercise it&quot;, but Douglas Adams made it better.How many times must we be reminded that abortion, homosexuality, other religions, anything other than the American way, is the ENEMY! Damn those slant-eyed creeps!Why can Clancy not do even the most basic research. Ryan meets Tony Blair (The Prime Minister of the UK) and how does he speak? &quot;Ok, old boy, we'll have to give them a good thrashing.&quot; I expected him to break out into &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and start playing cricket over high tea! A simple piece of research would have been to listen to a single interview with the man if you are going to bother including him in the piece.I have read every one of Clancy's novels, starting with a pre-publication copy of the Hunt for Red October, and all that I can say is that he is getting lazy. He simply doesn't care anymore. It is a shame, but there we are.Now, if you want a good read I would recommend Larry Bond (who co-wrote Red Storm Rising). One of his books is the size of this one, but there is a good 900 pages of story to the 800 pages of the book.In summary, BAD will be staying as pristine on my bookshelves as it is at the moment. I doubt that I will dog-ear this one by reading and rereading as I have with all of the others (except the excerable Rainbow Six. Why, Oh Why don't I learn that when things go downhill for an author I should stop giving him my money?)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"....As many reviewers have described, this novel consists of 750 pages of mind-numbingly repetitive and simple-minded set-up and 250 pages of action. The ratio in his excellent books &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, and even &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is reversed. Mr. Clancy should stick with the horse that got him this far. An as is becoming all to common with Mr. Clancy's work, he ends the novel with none of the attention to detail that he became famous for, but with the brevity and thoughtlessness of a freshman reaching the minimum word limit on a creative writing term paper.In a bizarre vein, Clancy continues to try to expand his use of romantic scenes in this book. His description of intimate encounters parallels his description of the detonation of a thermonuclear device or the operation of a submarines trailed antenna array. Hire a ghost writer for this stuff!On a less humorous note, the level of vulgarity has risen dramatically in this book. Jack Ryan (POTUS, for you acronym wienies), the leader of the free world and hero to all right thinking Americans, can't utter a sentence without including some vulgar reference (either sexual, racial, cultural, ... whatever). Neither can his Vice President. Nor his Chief of Staff. Nor any other character in this book. I understand that talk gets salty amongst military types, ... or amongst most any type. But why rachet the level of vulgarity to such a level that it becomes the feature of most conversations, rather than a literary condiment?Stay away from this book unless you are the most die-hard Clancy fan. I used to fall into that category, but he's lost me for good now. His work has degraded to mere slop, particularly with the last two efforts (this one and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;).Dave Carter Carmel, IN"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is not one of Tom Clancy's best. Jack Ryan's inner dialogue gets very tiresome after the third or fourth time. One of the biggest elements missing form this book is the element of surprise. In his past books, we didn't know what was the master plan that connected all the characters together. In this book, you know from the get go. I think it's time to retire Jack Ryan and move on to a new main character.Wait for the paperback if you are a die hard Clancy fan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't understand why people seem to have problems with Clancy bringing back all the characters from past works - I for one seriously dig continuity in a book series - which is what the Ryan books are - a series. As to the negative views on the PRC, c'mon people, have you done any research whatsoever about how terrible conditions really are over there? Obviously not - people need to wake up to the fact that the world is not all a pretty and happy place, and yes, we do still need to worry about national security. It's always refreshing to read a Clancy novel if for no other reason than to hear a logical and intelligent view on the world. I hope he keeps up the good work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In over 1000 pages Tom Clancy gives us a simplistic,an un- realistic view of international relations and conflict. As an entertainment it is first rate (although too long). Filled with action from the first page to the last, it is typical of what readers have come to expect from this revered author. Don't however expect this book to expand your understanding of international relations or American politics. In this respect the author has, very seriously, dropped the ball. Read it to be entertained, not educated."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A well written, but somewhat slow moving book compared to past efforts. This one is far more concerned with the internal workings of power than with the trappings of a &quot;techno-thriller&quot; i.e. long descriptions of weapons and combat actions. Only twords the last thrid of the book does Clancy really get going, but it's still a very invloving story. Jack Ryan for president in 2004 folks, he's be better than the shlub's we have running now"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used to wait with baited breath for the publication of a new Tom Clancy novel. I read most of Mr. Clancy's first novels in an almost sleepless period of two or three days. Often sleeping only a few hours, working, and then returning to the book-much to the displeasure of my wife. That is no longer the case. The first 700 pages of this novel are so boring it actually took me three attempts to get through them. Twice I quit the book, read another book, and then returned to Clancy's novel. If the first 700 pages were condensed to 100 pages, the reading would be much better.In addition, the book is fraught with typographical errors. The rush to get to press must have been more important than finding the numerous errors. Most are just annoying, but one in particular, a reference to the old F-111 should have been to the newer F-117. It breaks the readers thought pattern to have to contemplate what was really intended in these cases.Finally, Clancy's desire to trumpet his anti-abortion stance and to promote cigarette smoking gets in the way of the story. There are continual references to Ryan's anti-abortion stance. And, it seems at times that President Jack Ryan can't go five minutes (or the reader a page) without Ryan needing to bum a cigarette from someone. Usually the cigarette brand is mentioned. I wonder if the Tobacco Institute now pays writers to incorporate such messages into books?In summary, I may have read my last Tom Clancy novel. Certainly I will wait for the reviews before purchasing others.

Some of the great elements of his previous successes remain in Bear and Dragon, especially his (apparent) insider's knowledge of intelligence and military tactics and equipment. Even if half of these aren't real, they're interesting nonetheless.It appears, however, that given his significant success, Clancy has little if any editorial oversight. This should have been a 300-400 page book, not 1100+ pages. The same positions and points of view were made repeatedly. In some cases, the spoken phrases and thoughts were repeated verbatim, sometimes by different characters.Further, the &quot;good&quot; characters just aren't that interesting -- none are given any appreciable faults or inner conflicts do deal with. The end felt so rushed you'd think Clancy had run out of paper.Its disappointing, but this will be my last Clancy novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr Clancy's books have never been short, and the paperback edition I have of this one numbers 1137 pages (and this reader's head spins...). His initial production was at least made palatable by the display of a mass of fascinating technological knowledge of weapons and weapon-systems (and thus was the term \\"techno-thriller\\" born...) brought to us ignoramus-es, which even made the use of a forest of never-heard-before acronyms acceptable. In the progress of his production, we have been presented with divagations into politics and finance but, above all, with an increasing verbosity. ... Mr Clancy's production seems to be growing inflated, overfed, plethoric and hypertrophic, just as his physical appearance on the TV interviews he gives. He must have felt himself a decline in his readership's interest, if he resorted to introducing into his writing that old and stale ingredient, the torrid herotic scene...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Interesting concept: How would the world react to enormous gold and oil reserves being found in Siberia.The problem is that the book makes things so much simpler than the world really is. Every American is Clancy the corny hero. And every Chinese character is the bad guy who 'hates those greedy Americans who try to control us, because we are the superior race'.Of course this is just supposed to be one long (1137 pages) roller coaster of action, and is fiction after all. It is just that the treatment is so unfair and the stereotyping is taken to the absurd lengths that one would expect of a farce, not a serious thriller.My point is if you are setting a novel in real places like China and America at least try a little to represent the actual complexity of these places.

Sure, it captures the reality of US tension with China and some of the plot even seems prescient at times. Too bad it is so simplistically characterized. Come on Clancy, you are better than this.

Yes, there was a section in Executive Orders that very strongly implied Cathy and Jack Ryan going to bed to have sex, but the passage was minimal and was between a husband and wife.In his latest book, Clancy has stooped to the level of discussing the sexual affairs between the main character, Chet Nomuri, and his information source. It's the type of ploy I would expect from a cheap romance novel, but not from Clancy.Clancy continues to weave multiple subplots into a good story, but it's unfortunate he felt compelled to include such a strong sexual element in The Bear and the Dragon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot; doesn't even come close to &quot;Executive Orders&quot;.

If you actually get through the first half to two-thirds of the book, the rest is ok. I didn't expect the book to be as good as &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, but I was still disappointed.

This puts them in direct conflict with the USA.This has the classic Clancy touch as he illustrates how current conditions, such as China emerging as a superpower, Russia's weakness and the trade imbalance develops as a recipe for a full conflict.He is a master at describing systems, whether they are political, agencies, economies or how the executive branch of the U.S. Government works. His eye for detail and the ability to translate those complexities to the rest of us, is the talent that made him into a best selling author with the release of \\"The Hunt For Red October.I had not read a Clancy novel in many years and I noticed that with this one, he has improved his character development. He describes the thinking process of the fictional U.S. president, Jack Ryan, as he faces a major crisis. He explores both the strengths and very human \\"I don't know what to do next\\" frailties of the character.Clancy, in my opinion, is always an enjoyable escapist read. If you like fictional history, you'll surely enjoy this one. Because he is so great at describing \\"real events\\" and systems as a background for evolving his fiction, I never fail to learn something in the process.P.S.: In one of his earlier novels (before 9/11/01) he predicted that a terrorist would smash a jetliner into an American icon. In that book it was a disgruntled Japanese airline pilot and he smashed into the white house. Those thoughts came into my mind on 9/11 as I sat horrified, watching the jumbo jets smash into the towers. Oh my god, I thought, there was always the possibility of this happening!! I surely hope that most of Mr. Clancy's work will remain fiction"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a fan of Tom Clancy, I like his writing and his techno-thriller style. This book is so good you cannot stop reading. Greetz,"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Another massive missive from TC. Sure, there are typos and grammatical pratfalls aplenty, but nothing excites like this master when he's cranking up WW III with a cast of no less than 85 characters. Grab your atlas, get online (the better to look up all those munitions), and let your palms get sweaty."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have enjoyed Tom Clancy as an author since I read Red Storm Rising as a teenager, and have enjoyed all of his subsequent books. Yet this book does not seem to be on par with what I would expect from Mr. Clancy. It has Clancy's attention to detail and techinical knowlegde that I have come to enjoy from him, but the similarities end there.First theres the glorification of American democracy over Chineese communism. Now I'm and American and I love the way we do things here, but I'm not so biased to say that we have the most perfect system of government and that everything about the communist plan is evil and corrupt. Communism was an attemt to form a goverment with the best interest of the country as a whole, and is just as subject to corruption, error, and ego that any other plan of goverment would be. There is even some passages in the book that go beyond governments and protrayes Chineese people in general under a bad light becase they don't think American.Second, there was a complete lack of respect for the Chineese military and intelligence orginizations. Clancy made China seem to both have the military might and thought process of Sadaam during the Gulf War. I would have to guess that China might just be a little more advanced. After all, it's not just the Americans who have spies and neat military toys.Third, there was an unbelievealbe amount of good luck or lack of realism on the protagonist's side. Spy gets a great source, spy never gets caught, no friendly fire, lax guarding of nuclear weapons, new toys in our military, complete lack of intellegence and new weapondry in China, lack of Chinas citizens supporing their own country, genious deciding to work on a missle tracking system, only one missle getting off, and shooting down the missles on the last shots,.... I could go on.In short I suggest that readers enjoy Mr. Clancy's others book and set this one aside to be forgotten. The entire story is so one sided both in terms of political objectives and personalities that it becomes very tedious to read. If not for my history of reading Clancy books I would of stopped reading well before halfway due to the constant Chineese bashing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first major event is the unsuccessful attempt on the life of Sergey Golovko Chairman of the SVR (formerly First Chief Directorate) which sets off warning bells throughout the free world, all the way up to the President of the USA, Jack Ryan. The second event of global magnitude is that President Jack Ryan has reestablished free trade with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC, i.e., Communist China). The third episode is a power play in which Chester (Chet) Nomuri is sent on assignment to the PRC on behalf of Nippon Electric Company (NEC) but his primary or real assignment is \\"intelligence gathering\\", to collect as much information as possible via espionage ... all this occurs within the first 40 pages of the book. The writing is pure Tom Clancy ... there is the right mix of political intrigue, detailed technology including computers, military weapons and satellite capabilities, global issues, and even complicated romantic encounters ... all of which make for a suspense-filled captivating reading experience.The genius of Tom Clancy shines brighter than ever. There is no rival to this author to date. Clancy casts a hypnotic spell over the reader. The characters are genuine, the future thrills are guaranteed. The reader anticipates a complex puzzle of espionage, politics, global threats, military encounters ... by the world super powers or power-wannabes, all vying to control more of the world's limited resources.Chet Nomuri manages to seduce a top level secretary, Ming, who works for a minor Chinese Politburo member, Fang, who happens to keep a diary of political transactions on a computer. He is no fool! He has witnessed political rivals destroyed based on these types of conflicts. His goal is to survive, no matter which faction, moderate or conservative, is in control. Ming was given a a special computer program by her lover Chet Nomuri which she attaches to her computer. It has a hidden program that downloads encrypted messages of all transactions ... Fang's diary is transmitted straight to the CIA in Washington, DC.There is an unfortunate incident which occurs in a Chinese hospital that is captured by CNN television live ... it creates a serious negative impact on the Chinese economy. The economy was already teetering on the brink of collapse due to an imbalance of trade and lack of capital reserves. World opinion crashes down on Chinese businesses. The bureaucratic political red-tape is tied and knotted so tightly that the Chinese Politburo fails to react appropriately to the unexpected murder of the Ambassador from the Vatican and a Chinese Baptist Minister. The PRC is punished on a global scale as an undesirable trade partner. This creates near panic in the PRC \\"Parliament\\" until ... the solution is discovered: secretly invade Siberia where newly discovered oil fields and gold mines will solve the economic needs of the Chinese, freeing them forever from dependence on world trade.The scenario is set again for yet another daring, exciting and exhilarating World War III episode. How Clancy does it, I do not know, but he can make the players all seem real, the events hair-raising and awe-inspiring in their believabilty. Tensions build as battle scenes are fought. Read the book to discover the final resolution to this depiction of how the-world-as-we-know-it nearly ends ...Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As with many other reviewers, I have read every one of Tom Clancy's books. His hallmarks of good action, plausible descriptions of the intelligence game, and authentic details drew me in. His last 4 books, however, have gone steadily downhill, and this is the worst yet. Clancy's ultra-right politics come more and more into play, and he no longer even gets the details right.I've become particularly annoyed at the demonization of various ethnicities. In Debt of Honor it was the Japanese. In Executive Orders it was the Iranians. In Rainbow Six it was those pesky environmentalists. Here it's the Chinese. I stopped counting how many times Clancy used the epithet &quot;Chink&quot; after the first 10, but I also noticed a few &quot;Nisei&quot; go by as well. I even saw &quot;commie&quot; at least once. Not to mention condemning all non-Judeo-Christian religions as &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;heathen.&quot;As for the ending--well, what ending? It feels as though Clancy spent himself spewing racial slurs and outdated Cold-War venom, then just ran out of steam.Overall I recommend sticking to earlier Clancy: anything prior to Without Remorse. The later ones are really only suitable for readers more conservative than, say, Pat Buchanan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A very good book. The scene in the hospital, with the cardinal and the minister fighting to help a father and mother save their child in the process of being born from a forced abortion, with CNN filming the event, is riveting. The technologies for spying and conducting war are fascinating. Its interesting that you can sometimes learn more by reading a novel than you can from traditional sources...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A fun, fast read that is well suited for Clancy's ongoing Ryan saga. Sure, the plots and characters are incredible and somewhat overblown, but what do you expect from fiction? True fans will be as pleased with this one as always. It is a gripping read and a mind-blowing ride. HYPERWAR is incredible and could be a storyline unto itself. Read this - you will not be disappointed"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Without doubt Clancy is the master of this type of book. As always I was spellbound, barely able to find a stopping point. This book made me &quot;Think&quot; &amp; realize that there is a NEW enemy... for all the world. The Dragon has been sleeping, just waiting &amp; gathering it's resources.... Clancy is not the only one warning us of these future events, he just does with such style &amp; so entertainingly. I did get caught a little on the roughness &amp; crudenss of speech, but I don't doubt it was pretty true to life. Everything else about this book was right up there with the best of Clancy. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has written a very good character driven novel. He fleshes out the characters we have grown to love over the years in a manner I have not yet seen in one of his books.Without Remorse was good with characters we could understand and empathize with, but The Bear and The Dragon goes even further. Clancy is still very strong with the technology, but that is not what drives this novel. In this novel, you come to hate Jack Ryna's job nearly as much as he does. And, you get to see that John Clark is looking toward the end of his career.I like the Japanese agent, Chet Nomuri, nearly as much as I loved Ding Chavez in Clear and Present Danger. I hope we see more of this character in upcoming books. He clearly did not like what he had to do to get the information the USA needed and he was able to put himself in his lover's place enough to see what he was doing was dangerous as well as hurtful.This is Clancy's best yet and I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Another adventure featuring United States' President Jack Ryan, this one is he's best EVER! Tom Clancy wrote the book that will keep readers turning the page late at night, and even with the almost thousand of pages we are used to on Clancy's book, this one, better than every other, does not makes the reader feel tired a single page. At least, not until the characters seem a little bit from early books.And, even better, the amazing character John Clark is in this tale too, what only makes it even better. This is a book for fans, readers who enjoy the genre or anyone who cares for a wonderful book! Go with a little bit of precaution, anyway.Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I could not agree less with the other reviewers. Seldom in my 70 years have I finished a novel with such regret. I thought it was dynamic, suspenseful and well written. Further, it subtly points to the fallacy of our Clinton administrations $30 billion per month trade deficit. It is tantamount to Roosevelt allowing all of our scrap iron to be sold to the Japanese in the 30's so they could melt it and create weapons with which to shoot back at us! The Chinese are a wonderful people. The Communist dictators who run that wonderful country are not. Wait and see!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is classic Clancy, in ways vaguely reminiscent of Rainbow 6. However the plot is more sophisticated. It starts a little slow, but after page 200 (out of about 1000) you will not be able to put the book down. All the dimensions of the book (in one corner we have Ming/Nomuri, in the other corner there's a shot Russian pimp, in the other is a bunch of guys working on a cruiser) will make you constantly guess, what's next? Then it all just comes together in a truly awesome spectacle that is the ending! A must get!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The plot of this book is way over the top and will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are reading it. The inserted subplots make this book a really great one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Sorry Amazon, but when Jack is back, it is to good to wait for the shipping, and I had to go to one of those other bookstores....anyway.Clancy has done it again with a book that has so many characters, situations, and insight that you feel you are truely in the middle of it all. The book is thick, but the day goes quick and you can't wait for the next installment. The details are great, perhaps a bit to explicit in some areas, but it is that detail that enables Clancy to draw you into the plot and that gives you the ability to since the feelings of the characters.Action backed and twists that make Debt of Honor and Rainbow Six seem predictable."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Okay, let's understand something. This review is for normal people who enjoy reading a good book. If you are one of the people who has written one of those nasty reviews I've read, please don't bother. I find that kind of rhetoric annoying and hypocritical. If you believe Clancy is a horrible author, then WHY ARE YOU BUYING HIS BOOKS ANYWAY?! So, if you are capable of writing a book better than Tom Clancy, please send it to me, then complain about how bad he is. Spare me the stupidity.This book is exactly what a true Clancy fan loves: heart-stopping suspense, techno-thrilling detail, and an unbelievable plot. And that's the best thing of all: this book is completely unbelievable, as in you know it could never happen, hence making it an extrememly readable book. No country, Communist or not, would stoop to the level of China in this book. I'll spare you the details, you can read the synopsis for that, just remember that if you love Clancy and the way he writes, this is a book you should buy. If, on the other hand, you're a two-dimensional, non-independent thinker who believes himself one to judge a great author, don't bother.Oh and one other thing, when people write reviews, do me a favor and spell check, why would you want to look like a fool?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is a fine Irish name. With ancestors who suffered so deeply from bigotry and racism, Clancy should know better. This book is jingoistic racist trash and the last of his efforts I will ever read, no matter the provocation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've never seen a more unfortunate pack of misinformation, stereotypical trash put into one book in my life. Clancy shows some flashes of what I have enjoyed in his books in the last 15 years, but very brief ones.First of all, what's with this obsession of his with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany? I know there may have been 1 or 2 pages in the 1000 page book that didn't mention Nazi Germany, but don't ask me to find them. And his cheap shots at the Chinese people are ridiculous. In this day and age to call Chinese the racist names he continually spewed is unfortunate and pathetic.The most ridiculous thing about the book is his blatant lack of respect for the intelligence of the Chinese Politboro. The mere idea that they would send their whole army across the border of Russia with out first gaining air superiority or having any clue what kind of force they will run into is laughable at best.The ridiculous sex crazed secretary who planted software on all the top secret Chinese government computers so she could carry on her love affair with the US Spy. Nice respect for the credibility of female employees Tom.This book reminds me of watching a old, worn out athlete try and continually make comebacks. I don't know what was worse for Clancy's career, the failed bid to buy the Vikings, or this book. At least the Vikings fiasco was a little bit creative. It was so bad that I couldn't quit reading it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first Clancy book I read (13 years ago) was pure bliss. Unfortunately, the last four have declined in content in a predictable slope until this one which falls off the cliff and proclaims it's superiority on the way down.There are so many things to criticize in this pile that I prefer not to waste anymore time (some of my precious life went to reading this thing after all) and just point out that the first 800 pages could have been condensed into 40 to 60, tops.Although I agree with much of his politics, it is sufficient for him to mention only once(if at all) what his characters feel about a certain subject; after that, most of us should be able to retain the wisdom he grants us from on high.The more I write the more I realize how much I hated this book.I'll end it here and take back the 1 star I so graciously bestowed. UUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, either people hate it or love it. As for me, this was by far the WORST book Tom's written so far and I am utterly disappointed.I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy ever since Hunt For Red October. I think Clear and Present Danger and Sum of All Fears were some of his best works. I even own and enjoy his PC games Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear. However, after reading The Bear and the Dragon, it has become painfully clear to me that Tom's lost his skill as a master of suspense and action who can weave a complicated, but credible, storyline that keeps a reader glued to the very last page. In fact, in this book he seemed to try very hard to actually repel the reader. Here are some reasons why:1. The storyline is completely incredible. You'd need to have a Cold War mentality, be an ultra right-wing conservative, or both to believe that China would invade Russia for oil and gold. And that thousands of Chinese tanks and hunreds of Chinese fighters were obliterated by a few bombs and a dozen American fighters? And hardly any American casualties in the end?2. Characters. What happened to the Jack Ryan that I've come to love? He's become this chain-smoking, self-righteous, racist, pro-lifer that keeps reminding people that he doesn't like his job as the President of the United States.3. Overuse of racist and foul language. I've lost count as to how many times Clancy uses the &quot;F&quot; word or refers to the Chinese as Joe Ch**k. Also, I'm not sure if the sexual references in his book are supposed to make me laugh or repulse me. Come on, Tom, a &quot;Japanese sausage&quot;???!!!4. Length of book. My goodness, a 1,000+ page book that could've been written in less than 300. What a waste of paper and time to read those useless pages.5. Misspellings and chronology problems. At least proofread the book before printing it. Am I the only person who noticed that the assassination attempt came before any oil or gold was discovered to become the reason for the assassination?I won't bore you with other reasons why you should't buy this book. If you must read it, I suggest borrowing it from the library like I did. That way, at least you won't feel cheated twice for wasting your precious money as well as the valuable time that you'll never get back after reading the book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There is plenty of room for another World War in the not-so-tame New World Order. This time the bear (Russia) and the dragon (China) fight over newly found Siberian treasures. The United States, now an ally of Russia, along with NATO, tries to restore peace to the region.Tensions with the Chinese have been building as they continue to violate the human rights of its own citizens, and now those of foreigners, including distinguished diplomats. President Jack Ryan flexes foreign trade sanctions as a show of resolve and morality, but to no avail.THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is slow to unfold; then gets exciting in the last few hundred pages; and then abruptly ends. The prequel, EXCUTIVE ORDERS, was a page turner from start to finish. TOM CLANCY's new novel, THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, doesn't have the same level of energy and excitement as his other Jack Ryan novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Gosh, after 450 pages I was bored to death. Still no story, plot-line just a bunch of &quot;gee- why am I president&quot; muses by the main character. It did get better after page 500 - but the remaining book was a rehash of earlier books. Nothing interesting here. Wait for another author - Clancy is just milking the reputation he built (deservedly on his first 6 novels). His last two books shows he's past his prime."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Amazing use of a novel to vent the author's feelings about abortion (Mr. Clancy is against) and the environment (also against or indifferent to) for most of the book. There is also an attempt to romanticize warfare and killing and present it as clean, at least from the standpoint of the white guys. The Chinese/chinks are magically obliterated by the United States marvelous weaponry with hardly a scratch to show for it. Tom Clancy has obviously no experience with the reality of war and the resulting deaths of soldiers and innocent civilians. For Tom it is all tech fun and games from the perspective of the pilot dropping bombs from 30,000 feet.I have enjoyed some of his early works when he focused on the machinery of war without trying to glorify it (though the macho element is always there). Now he adds his tiresome polemics on anything this tired old man decides is not right with the world from a far right WASP perspective. This book is an insult to anyone with modest intelligence and knowledge of world affairs, and definitely not worth the trees that were cut down for its printing (though Clancy is clearly of the &quot;if you have seen one redwood tree you have seen them all&quot; school of thought."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you like redundant passages, endless acronyms and code-words instead of plot, this book is for you. It felt like Clancy took a decent book and then changed most of the references to names into acronyms and code-words to add a touch of (unneeded) authenticity, then quadrupled that. Then he went back and quadrupled the dialog to add in even more acronyms/code-words. Even then the book wasn't filled with enough boring to kill the most determined reader so he went back and copy/pasted from one source to many to show solidarity of thought among the various cast. Thus, passages drone on just to be repeated by another character. Towards the end of the book, when the plot should be speeding along, making one's eyes rush from page to page trying to take in all the thrilling action, Clancy mires his readers in a play by play of troop movements. This part of the novel read like an operations manual for war instead of a thrilling novel about war. If I wanted to have a breakdown of the technical aspects of various weaponry, I'd check out Wikipedia, not a Clancy book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After reading Rainbow Six, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to bother with another Clancy book. Considering how much I've enjoyed his past work, that's a large statement.Personally, I preferred it when Jack Ryan was a nobody; just a cog in the workings of the intelligence arm of the US Government. Things were a lot more exciting then. By making Ryan the President, Clancy has entered into an area where it's a lot harder to write a believable story, since everything he now does has large ramifications on entire nations.I am getting tired of Clancy's notion that Americans can do no wrong; that every man and woman in uniform is an expert, and the foreign folks are emotional idiots. The only \\"villians\\" that Clancy ever endowed with any brains were the Soviets, and now that they're gone, there's nobody left who's really a worthy adversary.The story isn't bad, and I enjoyed the book enough to give Clancy another chance, but he needs to get better. I'm not asking for another Red October, just a nice, believable story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a big fan of Tom Clancy's fiction. But I was a bit taken aback by this one. I would love to pick his brain on the writing of this novel.I have always loved the characters in Clancy's books. I especially love the fact that all of his books, minus \\"Red Storm Rising,\\" fall into the same universe, with minor characters returning and evolving along with the star actors, Jack Ryan and John Clark. I have always felt the different personalities as they dealt with whatever crisis Clancy decided to throw at them...until this book. In \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" I almost felt like I was reading a 1000 page essay on Tom Clancy's view of the world and how he would like to see our country run, only with the use of all his returning characters as vehicles for his viewpoints. Everyone in this book seemed to have the same views on every situation. The most disturbing part of this was all the racial slurs made against the Chinese. It seemed that all military figures, whether they be Russian or American, referred to the Chinese as Joe Chink. Is this an exact representation of how all of those soldiers would be talking about their enemies? I can almost stomach that, until most of the government figures in the White House act the same. The one time Jack Ryan, as POTUS, berates someone for using a racial slur, Clancy makes a point to show Ryan thinking the same racial insult. It's a question I'd like to pose to Mr. Clancy.There was also a lack of humanity present in the novel. I would have liked to have seen this wartime situation through the eyes of regular American citizens more than was shown. The book felt too sterile because of this drawback.This was the slowest book of all the Clancy books I've read, and the only novel I have yet to read at the time of this review is \\"Red Rabbit.\\" As another review states, the action doesn't start until page 800, although the tension starts to build around page 700.That being said, I have to still give great credit to Clancy. Through those first 700 pages, my interest was kept. What makes Clancy one of my favorite authors is that even when his books slow down, they are extremely interesting. I am looking forward to reading the last two books, according to Clancy, in the Jack Ryan saga. Thanks for taking the time to read this."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm hooked on Clancy's Jack Ryan series, and I was happy to see a new installment published. However, after lifting this weighty tome once, I knew I was in for a long haul. The sheer size of this book, at 1000+ pages, makes it hard to carry on the train. Unfortunately, that wasn't my only problem.The Bear and the Dragon picks up after Rainbow Six; Ryan is still the Prez and Clark is still in England running his team of hotshots. The basic premise is that Russia, a starving, collapsing nation that is merely a shadow of its former self, suddenly has the good fortune to find not merely an enormous oil field in Siberia but also a gold mine. Poof! Russia is back on the map. Unfortunately for Mother Russia, their neighbors to the south---China---are short on money, short on land, and have ticked off the United States so badly that Ryan has ordered a trade embargo against them. Russia's new wealth looks mighty tempting.In addition to all this, an assassin misses his target---Golovko, the Russian head of intelligence and a key character in the Ryan series---and an American spy has seduced his way into Chinese intelligence headquarters. Russia needs American assistance, and the Americans have the military power and information to help as well as a President that the Russians can relate to.Very convenient.These tangled storylines are twisted further by the subplots---the lousy seduction scenes between the American spy and the Chinese secretary; the infighting among members of Chinese parliament; the detailed descriptions of how lousy and untrained Russia's military is; the manhunt for the assassin in Russia; the upgrading of American anti-missile technology; Ryan's unending whine about being President; US/China trade talks full of diplospeak; and the bizarre anti/pro abortion storyline that ends up with murdered clergy and goes into depth about how illegal newborns are killed in population-controlled China.The last drawback, and the biggest I imagine for any Chinese readers, is the profound quantity of ethnic slurs peppered throughout the book. Clancy has an obvious bias against Chinese (and perhaps all Asians, if you consider that Japan was the enemy in Debt of Honor) and his characters take this prejudice to the extreme. When reading this book in public, I was often embarrassed by things that were said and would look up to make certain no one else could see me reading such things. It is possible to make people enemies for the purposes of fiction without slandering them, regardless of your own opinions of their culture.In essence, this is a heavy, slow, convoluted book. It has always been my practice when reading Clancy to skip the pages and pages of excruciating detail about military movements, bomb-building, virus particles, etc and move on with the story. The problem here is that every aspect of the story is bogged down by such detail. It has the potential to be a great novel, but the lack of serious editing weighs it down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A rambling, incoherent, confusing jumble of racist cliches.

I have read the first two hundred pages so far and I had to jump so many pages that the real content is probably less than one fourth of it.How it is that TC has to tell us every couple of pages what he thinks (not so hard to guess and not very profund), of the US political environment and of his philosopy and ethic including areas like abortion?Why every single american character complains every time about his position (president, vice president ...) and would rather be living with his family, flying jets, working on wall street etc. etc.?Why the \\"evil characters\\" are so predictably and \\"evil\\" (may have described them as cardboard charcters).I have had the temptation to drop the book many times that I almost start complaining about the fact that I am going on reading rather than doing something better...Definitely boring.Other review point to the fact that after the first (!) 700 pages you get 300 pages of moderately interesting stuff. I will try to get there..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"So the tenth out of ten missiles hits the ICBM that's about to plug D.C., and what does JR do? He invites the crew of the missile cruiser to his house for a party. What a great denoument! Clancy has always been a fun read (except for the execrable Patriots) and he managed to pull me through all 1000+ pages of this one, but mostly out of curiosity over whether ANY of our new weapons systems would fail. I could overlook the right-wing hyperbole on almost every page and the repeated wisecracks; the profanity was a pain in the neck, but I've seen worse. But, having had several PRC students in my classes, I really wonder about the irresponsible characterization of these people that underpins the whole plot. Chinese political leadership may not be as enlightened as we would hope, but they are not as stupid as Clancy portrays them. We would be stupid to think so..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first Clancy novel that I read was &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. I became hooked and read everything that he put out after. This book started out ok, but it seemed as if he just ran out of ideas and then ended the book. I love America winning as much as the next person, but this easily? Come on, now! Book could have been shorter and a little bit more realistic. Everything seemed to fall right into place, instead of wicked plot turns like the ending of &quot;Without Remorse&quot; (his finest novel in my opinion). I agree with the person that said that he needs to end the Jack Ryan series. Jack is old and boring. If he wants to keep with some of the old characters, maybe he could write a book about Clark's exploits in Vietnam. Now that would be interesting."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Probably the moment he finished &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, which ends with Jack Ryan being swept into the White House following a disaster, Tom Clancy probably sat back and said to himself &quot;NOW what do I write about! &quot; He has decided to replace his nail-biting espionage thrillers of the 80s with a very dull, predictable yarn to the right of Rush Limbaugh laden with sexist, racist, and xenophobic rhetoic.Hmmm... &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, not too hard to figure out by the title (and by the jacket cover description) that this will involve a conflict between Russia and China. But even that is not obvious enough for Clancy, who has one of the main Chinese characters allude to the inevitable invasion of Siberia in the first 50 pages (did I mention that there were over 950 pages remaining by the time you figure out the plot?).It's very hard to care for President Jack Ryan. His moaning and whining about how hard it is to be president seems very different from the all-business, lets-get-the-job-done hero of his previous books. Perhaps he's having a mid-life crisis, who knows? When Ryan is not sneaking cigarettes (I suspect that Clancy wanted to defy every PC idea out there, like smoking, guns, ethnic slurs, etc.) and complaining about his job, he is micromanaging all U.S. intelligence and military affairs.Of course, the mighty U.S.A. is all-knowing and all-powerful. The CIA is literally the diary of a Chinese Politboro chief and knows the Chinese's every move before they make it. Not hard to fight a enemy when it's that easy. It began rolling my eyes everytime some Chinese minister revealed a vital part of their plan, knowing that everyone else in the book would know it as well. With regards to China and U.S. trade, Clancy is just living in a fantasy world. His characters start a trade war with China after the killing of two ministers who are trying to stop an abortion (he hits all of the conservative issues in this one, folks). Booo, China bad! But the resons we're turning our back on a trade partner who helps keep Americans employed while backing a former enemy who is broke and corrupt is never explained either.The only interesting and unpredictable sub-plot (and I mean the ONLY unpredictable) involves the murder/espionage investigation in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Here the characters are human and interesting to read about. They're not the two-dimentional conservative mouthpieces Clancy has in the White House chapters nor the civilian's characture of military officers such as those of General Diggs of the 1st Armored Division. But even this if not resolved satisfactoraly... Clancy realized that he only had about 100 or so pages to go and ended the sub-plot.The big climactic war, the one you've been just waiting to start since page 50, is the biggest disappointment. Of course the U.S.A.'s superweapons tip the scales in the Russian's favor with the &quot;hyperwar&quot; and devistate the People's Liberation Army. The dialogue and plot suddenly seem like something from a bad, low budget B-grade military action movie. Of course the invinsible American army wipes the PLA off the face of the map with no problem, the Chinese are humiliated and devistated, and the U.S.A. and Russia (a NATO member! ) are the big heros.Perhaps the STUPIDEST premise was when a balistic missile (Clark makes an appearence in this one too) is fired at D.C. (they destroy all but one of the missiles, but of course THAT one is headed not only to the American capital but also to the only American city with a missile defense system!). In the midst of evacuating the Ryan family, Jack gets macho tough and jumps aboard the ship that is supposed to shoot down the missile to &quot;ride it out.&quot; Oh, come on!But for me, the most disturbing aspect of the novel was the casual use of racial slurs by the fictional leaders of the free world. It seemed as if every character had no problem referring to the Chinese as &quot;Chinks&quot;. The Russians, the diplomats, the soldiers and airmen, even the President uses this dehumanizing tactic.There is also a very patronizing attitude toward the women in the novel. Secret Service Special Agent Andrea O'Day is responsible for the safety of the President of the United States. But when she becomes pregnant, Ryan dismisses her as just a girl who is trying to be with the big boys. He even goes so far to say that because she doesn't have what he has between her legs it's impossible to be as tough as a guy. Is this 2000 of 1900?If anything, it appears that Mr. Clancy has just plump run out of ideas for his protagonist. Jack Ryan has gone from CIA analyst to Deputy Director (Intelligence) of the CIA, to National Security Advisor to President. He should either just retire and start a new generaion of characters of kill him off. Sorry if that sounds so harsh, but the demise of Jack Ryan wouldn't be too bad for me after this last tome. This racist, sexist, and completely PREDICTABLE book is a big disappointment and a weak beginning for a new decade in Tom Clancy novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not even going to get into the problems I had with the characters racist traits (which they never had against the Japanese in previous books) or with Clancy's politics (liberal, conservative, whatever - it was annoying, and it would've been annoying even if I agreed with him).One of the things that made Clancy stand out was his attention to detail - now he's just mailing it in. He misspells the name of China's third most important city several times (like misspelling Chicago), he has people in Beijing using Cantonese slang (Cantonese is spoken only in Southern China), and he has people in Beijing calling each 'comrade' - especially odd when you consider that in current China 'comrade' is how homosexuals refer to each other now in the PRC. What happened to your research TC?And I'm not even going to mention the awful way the plot dragged on - I'll go back and read 'Clear and Present Danger' - thanks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There's 300-400 pages worth of book here, max. The rest is either pointless or exists only to provide a pulpit from which Clancy may espouse his political views. Some of the writing is downright sloppy. It reads as if Clancy was getting paid by the pound and forgot to run it by an editor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When someone sees you holding a book and asks you what it's about, typically you say something like, &quot;Oh, it's about a mad sea captain trying to kill a big white whale&quot;, or &quot;it's about the invasion of Normandy&quot;. When folks asked me what &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; was about, I answered, &quot;Oh, it's about 3 pounds. And about 2 inches thick. About 1000 pages, too.&quot;The past few Clancy novels have stunk, and while this one is better, it's not nearly as good as &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; or &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;. As in all of Clancy's books there are like 20 separate plots, some more interesting than others. And it's chock full of neato techno gizmos that Clancy fans adore. When he's describing how the Internet has revolutionized espionage, or how an armored division with real-time intelligence can savage a numerically superior enemy, Clancy delivers the goods. If that's what you like when you pick up a Tom Clancy novel (and remember, lift with your LEGS, not your back), this book is a winner.The rest of the book is not so hot. Critics often slam Clancy for his prose, which I don't think is quite fair. He's not a poet, but he's perfectly competent. But loves his little catchphrases, the military jargon, and it drives you nuts. It may be true that the President Of The United States is called POTUS by the Secret Service, but it is not neccessary for Clancy to use &quot;POTUS&quot; instead of &quot;Ryan&quot; as tags in dialogue. Maybe the Secretaries of the Treasury and Defense are called &quot;SecTres&quot; and &quot;SecDef&quot;, but no rational person would actually say, &quot;I need to speak to SecTres&quot;. No way. Does Clancy realize how Orwellian that sounds? It's awful.Then there's the problem presented by our hero, Jack Ryan. Ryan is now an elected president, having run for office because, well, he thought it was his duty. Trouble is, he hates being President. And he spends the ENTIRE book complaining about it. He's like a spoiled 6 year old. He doesn't UNDERSTAND what's going on! Why doesn't everyone behave like HE WANTS THEM TO! He thought he had real power but he never gets to DO WHAT HE WANTS! That's really what the Ryan presidency is all about-- whining. Ryan's level of sophistication about the way our govermment works is about that of a 10th grade civics student. For a man who spent virtually his entire live in government service, this makes like zero sense.There's also the problem of Ryan's character. Ryan bemoans &quot;professional&quot; politicians, members of Congress and lobbyists who put their interests above that of the country, yak yak yak. A valid point. But whenever he has to meet with &quot;the common people&quot;, giving a speech in Seattle, meeting with a farm delegation from South Dakota, he hardly conceals his contempt for them, for wasting his valuable time. He's terribly elitist, and wasn't that what he hated in the first place? America goes to war in this book, but there is no mention of Ryan consulting with a single member of Congress, or anyone outside his Cabinet. Ryan constantly worries that he's becoming too used to the trappings of power, that he'll become too regal, yet that's how he runs his government.The dialogue is like it is in all of Clancy's books--bizarre. Men call each other &quot;pal&quot; and &quot;fella&quot; in seemingly every other sentence, which is weird and annoying. What is very weird is that every character sounds the same in every situation, so that a coversation about whether a nuclear weapon will be intercepted sounds the same as a conversation about what to have for lunch. The same expressions, the same slang and lingo. It's bizarre.Clancy thankfully tones down his annoying right-wing politcal screeds in this book. Anyone who would vote against strip-mining Yellowstone Park is still labled a &quot;tree-hugger&quot; (the phrase is used 8 or 9 times). Actually it isn't so much WHAT Clancy says that annoys me so much (tho a lot of it does) but HOW MUCH he says it. If the book was only 600 pages there would only be enough for 2 or 3 &quot;tree-hugger&quot; references. But plump the book out to 1000 pages and it's sticks out like it was in highlighter. If Mary Pat Foley called her husband &quot;hunny bunny&quot; one more time I was going to vomit. It's almost like Clancy programs a computer, selects an enemy, throws in some new gizmos and catchphrases, and waits for a book to spew forth.So why do I shell out my hard earned green for Clancy's books? Partly force of habit. Partly because in those 1000 pages are maybe 400 pages that are really cool and fun to read, but unfortunately you don't know which 400 until you read them all. After the last Clancy novels I've wondered what new challenges Jack Ryan and company would have to face, and I have to admit Clancy's always found one more bogeyman to put in the way. But what's next? Who's next?I wonder where Clancy goes on vacation. He can't go to Columbia. Lots of Irish folk wouldn't like him. Russia, eh, still some sore feelings there. Japan, no way. Ditto anywhere in the Middle East. China, not now, no siree. I don't know what the next Jack Ryan novel will be about, but I doubt it'll be about a deadly threat coming from the Caribbean. The man has to save SOMEWHERE to go and unwind."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you're expecting a &quot;Ryan as President&quot; novel to stand with the first two, you're going to be mistaken. The good start is thrown away as the next 300+ pages ramble exhaustively - and pointlessly as tho Clancey gets paid by the page. Where were the editors?? Do we REALLY need to read page after page of Ryan's thoughts on why he hates being President or Noumouri's thoughts on seducing a secretary? No. 19th century novels are models of concision by comparison. He also much have discovered the word &quot;f**k&quot; since he uses it at every opportunity. As Clancey's vocabulary atrophied along with his creativity? It appears so.Bottom line: don't waste your money. If you MUST HAVE this novel, it should be on the clearance tables by Christmas."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...however the book is over 1,000. It seems as if there were two Toms writing here, one with the exceptional movie-in-your-mind action and tight plotting of the first books but often another who repeats previously used quotes and comments and who uses an annoying quantity of dialog expletives (mostly the same anglo-saxon one) to fill space. One would at least expect the Russians and Chinese to use ethnic epithets.Further, some of the technology does not ring quite true. Even though it is all gee-whiz, it is today gee-whiz and not post-2000 gee-whiz with the assumption that both the Russian and Chinese intelligence community have been asleep the whole time and that their information security and compromise detection is non-existant.Still a steady read and lasted nearly four days. Despite apparently being proofread by a machine, when it was good, it was very, very good..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a long time Clancy fan I have to express my dismay at much of what I read here. THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is not a bad book. Far from it. Clancy has set the bar high with his previous work but TBATD hardly falls on its face in trying to reach those heights again.Admitedly there are some negatives. We all know by now that Jack Ryan didn't ask to be President. There's no reason for us to be constantly reminded of that fact. Also, Jack's newfound 4-letter vocabulary gets old really fast. There's no excuse for the presence of that crutch. So this is not a perfect book. But I have to cut Clancy some slack on the other points people are making here. So what if he inserts his politics into Ryan's character. Has anyone ever thought that Ryan wasn't a reflection of Clancy's ideals? Ryan's political viewpoints, which naturally do come out since he is the President, take nothing away from the actual STORY, thank you very much. I disagree with Michael Crichton's politics but when I read his books that becomes totally irrelevant.And the story's pretty good. Once again Clancy mixes together an incredible brew up international intrigue and conspiracy to a satisfying boil. The regular cast of characters returns to duty and Clancy smoothly slips in some old faces from Ryan's past. The conflict and hotspots are realistic, and that Clancy can find yet another way to bring the world to the brink of disaster is to his credit. You can criticize all you want but in the end THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is a winner, and Clancy is still the master. The Ryan universe is not dead, and I look foreward to one or two more releases to complete his story. A solid Four Stars."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have to say that I am an immense Tom Clancy fan. Some people build cabinets for a hobby, I read Tom Clancy books. I was anticipating this as much as the next person, but my goodness was I disappointed. This was the most repetitive, drawn out book I have read by Clancy. The story was Executive Orders all over again. Just change the names. Instead of the UIR going into Saudi Arabia, it was China going into Russia. Both met a &quot;roadblock&quot; and the smaller army won. It was the exact same story and as a result it was predictable. The ending was rushed and there were only really two suspense scenes in the entire book. It seemed like he had to go answer the phone as he was ending the book and just decided on a paragraph to wrap it up. I expect more from this man, especially when we have to wait so long for a new one and presumably, if there is another Ryanverse book, we'll have to wait another two years."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have loved the previous works by Clancy featuring Jack Ryan, hence I bought this book in hard cover so that I could enjoy it sooner. What a disappointment! The first 300 pages were incredibly boring. The rest of the book is filled with political opinions that don't seem to fit with the characters as we've grown to know them over the years through Clancy's works. This seem to be Clancy's way of thinly diguising and expressing his own personal political views to the American public by using his characters as spokespeople - and it doesn't work. One of the things I like about Clancy's work is that he deals with subjects, e.g., espionage, war strategy, etc., about which I do not possess a lot of expertise. I have always taken his word to be accurate about the workings of DC and the spook world. However, in this book when Agent Price finds out she is pregnant (at about 8 weeks), she supposedly has an amniocentisis that day and is given the results in an hour. Well, this is a topic I know something about. You cannot perform an amniocentisis before 16 weeks of pregnancy - Agent Price's baby would have been killed by the procedure if it were attempted (which NO obstetrician would) at 8 weeks. Second, it takes a minimum of ONE WEEK to culture the cells so that a genetic analysis can be done. One hour is an impossibility. Third, I challenge Mr. Clancy to find me one real physician at Johns Hopkins who would tell a pregnant woman that it was okay to consume a couple of alcoholic drinks per week during the span of her pregnancy. I actually threw the book across the room at that one. Anyhow, the complete inaccuracy in reporting simple obstetric procedures - he could have found out the facts with very little research - leads me to question the credibility of all of what I have read by him. I also grew nauseous by the number of times Clancy had his characters relate to us that Mao like having sex with 12 year old girls. What in the heck did this have to do with the story? Why did we have to read it numerous times? I think everyone &quot;got it&quot; the first time. However if Clancy was getting paid by the page, he must have gotten at least 1-2 pages worth of salary over this overused &quot;fact.&quot; Finally, what is the deal with trying to make smoking seem glamorous? I think that the reading public must have shared several packs worth of smokes with Jack Ryan - how boring to read over and over again about him bumming cigarettes from his secretary. And again, what did this have to do with the story line? The only thing I can imagine is either: 1) Clancy smokes and feels persecuted about it, so he has Jack Ryan smoke, or 2) he is going to have Ryan come down with lung cancer in the next book.... Overall, what a waste of money!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Came back to alert potential buyers to serious flaws in this latest Clancy work, but it looks like most of it has already been covered. Seems like Clancy was rushing to meet a deadline and didn't give his editors a chance. Plot lines that go nowhere. Characters (the few new ones) that never get developed. Most importantly, about 400 pages too long (take them out of the first 600). Obviously no one had time to proofread as the book is literally rife with typos, misspells, and tourtured constructions.If you are a Clancy fan like me, you'll buy it and read it anyway, but I hope enought people don't that he gets his act back together for the next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've gotta say, I feel cheated. I spent a lot of hours and missed a lot of sleep slogging through 800 pages of buildup, waiting for the climax. I put up with repeated dialogue, excessive presidential whining, and buckets of racial epithets. I slogged through scene after scene of various commanders talking and thinking about the training level of their troops/tanks/helicopters, and only skipped over a few pages of all the scenes that brought us up to date on what's new with various repeat Clancy characters, but then went nowhere. There were a few compelling scenes and subplots in there, like a murder/espionage investigation in Moscow (that ultimately just goes too smoothly), and some nail-biting scenes involving some Christian clergy facing off against the local arm of the Chinese government. But on the whole, the first three quarters of the book are surprisingly boring.Sadly, when the shooting finally starts, you really do know just what's going to happen. You know the good guy's plan, and it pretty much happens that way, far too easily. American technology keeps the fog of war at bay, at least for our side. Various enemy leaders choose the climax of the book to come down with a fatal case of the stupids (not that the good guys don't do stupid things, too - but they aren't portrayed as mistakes in the story, but simply exist as devices to advance the plot along). When one final problem emerges, there's no doubt what's going to happen, as this eventuality and its resolution were telegraphed many hundreds of pages earlier. While it stirs the blood to watch the good guys inflict horrible punishment on the bad guys with their superior technology and training and moral character, it's not a true substitute for tension or surprise.Some serious editing could perhaps have saved the first three quarters of the book. The climax would still unfold to quickly and easily - but at least the reader wouldn't have invested so much time to get to it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's a half-hour since I finished \`The Bear and the Dragon', and I am hungry for more (more of Clancy in the style of his earlier works, that is).Clancy's newest Ryan opus is somewhat of a disappointment in comparison to his past stories. For the record, I am a rabid Clancy fan and always grab his newest book on the first day. I have enjoyed every novel he has written, and still consider him to be my favorite author.This time around however, I'm not satisfied with the novel as a whole. Maybe the quality of his past works has set the bar too high for me to enjoy any subsequent attempts. In any case, here's my take on this book:1)Roll Call: As usual, Clancy manages to weave a ton of characters into this story. We see major and minor characters from every one of the earlier Ryan novels, which adds a fun and familiar tone to the book. I especially liked seeing the Rainbow Six troops, Sir Basil (briefly), Gregory from \`Cardinal' and Golovko. If you have read all of the Ryan novels, this book is like attending a family reunion.2)The Clancy Roller Coaster: The use of multiple story lines and his awesome sense of pacing make TC's novels difficult to put down. This book was no exception. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out here, Clancy must not have had a clear ending in mind, as it was very abrupt and trite.3)Ryan is getting boring: Once upon a time, Jack Ryan was a very likable, everyman/underdog whose human failings, self-doubt and morals were interesting. Now he is a whiny, preachy, foul-mouthed shadow of his former self. It seemed that every time Ryan appeared he had to: a) complain about being the President (that got old in the last book), b) rant about the media, abortion, or the sexual habits of others (Get off the soap box Tom), and c) drop the ...bomb (since when was Ryan so vulgar in his daily speech? Does the Oval Office require POTUS to sound like he's on Def Comedy Jam?) I suppose Ryan's ascension from a lowly CPA/history teacher to the Presidency has left little room for more character development. What can Ryan do next? Become the Pope? In my mind, \`Clear and Present Danger' will always be Ryan at his best.4)Get a new editor: You would think a techno-freak like Clancy would utilize a repeated phrase/grammar/spell checker before publishing. Besides typos, there were many instances were he would repeat a phrase, quote, colorful metaphor, or historical reference within the same page or several pages. It was very awkward and annoying. I noticed \`Rainbow Six' did this as well. There were many instances were he would repeat a phrase, quote, colorful metaphor, or historical reference within the same page...whoops, sorry. I guess it's easy to do.Conclusion: Nit-picking aside, Clancy is still the best at what he does. Faults and all, \`The Bear and the Dragon' is worth more that the price of purchase. My dissection of the minutia found therein is merely the ramblings of a hypercritical fan, still fresh from reading the book. Perhaps, with time and another reading, this book will join those before it in a more fond and forgiving remembrance."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"\\"Meet the Good Guys. Meet the Bad Guys. Good Guys beat Bad Guys.\\" There. I just saved you from the 1,000+ tedious pages of absolute filler that surround this simple (non-) story.I used to love Clancy's books, from the intriguing, relevant plots to the detail and research put into combat and technology. Clancy hit his peak with \\"Debt of Honor\\", a book that ended with a gripping cliffhanger that turned out to be an eerily prescient parallel to September 11th. The follow-up, \\"Executive Orders\\", had a tall order to fill in concluding this setup, and while ultimately disappointing, it at least bore some of the hallmarks of past Clancy. That book's main problem was the implausibility of the antagonist group - let's face it, Jack has beaten back just about every real-world enemy that we have today. I'm surprised that he hasn't gone mano-y-mano with S.P.E.C.T.R.E. or the Galactic Empire yet. \\"Rainbow Six\\" tried to break the cycle by getting away from Ryan and focusing on Clark, but it came off like an \\"Op-Center\\"-esque ripoff.But none of these disappointments come close to this clunker. I am not exaggerating when I say that NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS in this book. New spy characters are inserted in hostile territory. . . and then plant a computer virus to steal sensitive Word documents while never even coming close to being caught. (There's nothing quite as exciting as a lead spy character whose weapon of choice is a modem) Ally countries are threatened and attacked by rogue governments. . . but then beat them back like swatting a fly. And the ultimate - a good portion of the book focuses on the details of how TRADE NEGOTIATION sessions work. If you've been looking for a book that captures the spirit of being trapped in a lengthy meeting at work where you have no interest in the topic, then Christmas came early for you this year.It really is time for Clancy to throw in the towel on this series. The old characters are out of fresh ideas (if I hear Jack complain one more time about how he never wanted to be the President, I'll scream) and the new ones are flat and boring. Unfortunately, I see that the next serving of Clancy will focus on Jack Ryan, Jr., fighting bad guys in future as a second-generation hero. Maybe the Galactic Empire really will come into play soon. . ."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Well I was very happy to see Jack again, after that 5 years of leave...but the result is mixed. For hard Tom Clancy's fan, this is still a good book, but for the others, there is now some other authors that are taking the space.I was used to have something like 200 pages of story setup (the what &amp; why), and then 500+ pages of action-packed story and this book is the complete opposite while there is some small action during the 700 pages of story setup. And what about the end... you have a big intrigue that last about 10 pages and whoops, the enemy's destroyed and we cut the story short with a 'dhuh?'. I also like, as some other reviewers, the fact that the Chinese have something like 3 divisions of tank and the Americans drops, with only one airstrike, smart bombs that destroys nearly all of them... Now, usually, TC would have explains this but in this case, you will just see a Chinese communique that they don't have any news from all their divisions anymore! That was the action part which could be reduce to 'we nailed them Mr. President, somehow and you are not on a need-to-know basis'.Beside that, the rest was mostly TC style and it was welcome but I would suggest taking a look at Balance of Power from James W. Huston."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been an avid Tom Clancy fan since &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; I have read all of his single-author books and many of the earlier books for which he is a co-author, but I simply couldn't bring myself to finish this book (sigh).I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; (Clancy's last book) when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I had REALLY enjoyed about Clancy's earlier books was the relative cleanliness of his language in writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other (including the POTUS, at least leave me the luxury of hoping that a clean-mouthed man could be president...why not Ryan?).I was also depressed to wade into the deep pool of sexual encounters described early in this book. I managed to make it to only about page 130 before I called it quits.Don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but not enough to wade through what he put together for this offering. Sorry Tom. But I thought that you and others deserved to at least hear my main criticism.Call the dialog in this book reality if you must, but it's a reality I choose to avoid in the pleasure reading I do.I think that the main story line definitely had potential...but now I'll probably never know.Thus, only 3 stars.Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Big fan of Clancy's books, but I felt this was an overly-long and rushed effort. There were numerous spelling mistakes, factual errors (he switched what planes were doing what in a crucial sequence as if he forgot what he had already set-up) and perhaps the weirdest thing was that Clancy would repeat character's observations, opinions and thoughts repeatedly - as if he had run out of original things for them to say. If I had to read Robby Jackson say something about having \\"a Tomcat strapped to my back\\" one more time I was going to scream. The book takes a long time to get going and then wraps up a little too quickly - as if the publisher cut Clancy off and told him to get the book into stores. Don't get me wrong - Clancy is a fine at what he does, but clearly the attention to detail and imaginative work of his previous efforts are no longer applicable in his recent work. I was disappointed enough that I went back and read \\"Hunt for Red October\\" again. Hopefully he resists the urge to get more books/product onto shelves and takes his time to come up with more original material and more in-depth characters. This book was just irresponsible laziness on his part."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The main story line is really a rehash of the vastly superior Red Storm Rising. In both books, a communist government needs access to some natural resources. Rather than simply asking for them and buying them, said communist government decides to launch a world war to conquer the land containing the desired resources. The war eventually turns against the communists and so some hardliners decide to launch nuclear weapons. This decision prompts a relatively unknown member of the government, who has previously acquiesced in all questions, to take control of the government and end the war.Other parts of the book, namely the technical excercise in destroying missles with lasers, is a rehash of a very similar storyline in Cardinal of the Kremlin. This one even brings the main scientist back again, though he seems to be a very different man now. He's gone from pretty geeky scientist to gung-ho soldier.Finally, let's think about what's happened in the Clancy universe recently. The US has fought 3 major wars (Japan, UIR, China), experienced multiple terrorist attacks (the bomb in Sum of All Fears, the ebola outbreak in Executive Orders), and shut down the Bond-like terrorist with plans to destroy all mankind. This all happens in a span of about 4 years (Sum of All Fears takes place in the middle of Fowler's administration, Debt of Honor and Executive Orders in the election year that would have been Fowler's attempt at reelection, Bear and the Dragon somewhat into Ryan's term as POTUS). Does anyone really believe our military could do all this in such a short time frame?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"\\"Quantity has a quality all its own\\" is a phrase repeated often in this book. Clancy seems to have taken it to heart in producing this 1100+ page work. There is a decent story here, but it is buried in hundreds of pages of political, economic, and social commentary that tends to be to the right of Rush Limbaugh.There are at least 5 stories in the book...all of which are strung together with only the weakest of links. The same jokes are repeated endlessly, and while they are funny the 1st time, you tire of them after the 3rd. The familiar cast of Clancy characters is trotted out, some just to make cameo appearances. All these different people might as well be the same as they mostly share the same views and beliefs.There is decent suspense and the mechanical magic we've come to expect from \\"technothrillers\\", but only the most diligent reader will reach the payoff. Whatever gift Clancy had earlier in his career seems to have left with \\"Clear And Present Danger\\"."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I find as I get older, my reading time is less and thus more valuable. So I'm pretty disappointed at this latest Clancy effort, which falls well below the mark set by the author himself. It's too bad; he's evidently too rich to care about plotting and keeping the reader's attention. There are plot lines in here which have absolutely no bearing on the main story, and the main plot has so many coincidences that it's just way too implausible. In other words, everybody knows everybody already. That's annoying as hell.The book was also poorly written. The pace is uneven to the point of having 20 pages more of boring politics to wade through in the last 50 pages of the book. It's like, &quot;come on, let's get to the point, the book will be over soon.&quot; Then the ridiculous ending is hurried in under the wire. What do I mean about ridiculous? China fires an ICBM at the US, and all the President does is get drunk? Then after an apology, it's back to normal relations. Give me a break.The book is passable entertainment, if slightly insulting to the reader's intelligence. The decline continues.The only thing worse than this book is the review. The reviewer is so clueless, it's hilarious."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am French and I try to improve my skills in English. In that regard, I have always found Tom Clancy's books useful for their abundant delivery of modern American lingo (Do they really talk like that in the Oval office ? Didn't they clean up their act after the Nixon's tapes ?). I have also to admit that Tom Clancy is a good plotter (even thought he takes his time to unveil the plot, but I like it that way). His books appear to be extremely well documented as far as military technology is concerned (I cannot really judge that, but I have been told so by a French warship captain). The political opinions displayed in the books are so right-wing by European standards that it is almost amusing, in a perverse sort of way, to read the mind of a conservative American, especially when his ideas are presented as those of the average citizen. It is almost like watching Hank Hill in the satiric cartoon &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, with Jack Ryan as the King of Capitol Hill... For me, the Chinese are less &quot;Klingons&quot; than these people. But, in his last works, Mr Clancy is getting more and more sloppy with his research. In his previous book &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, he had the summer Olympics in Sydney taking place in a very hot weather...without realising that Sydney is situated in the southern hemisphere and that the games were played in late austral winter. In this one, I noticed several mistakes but I will only mention two big ones : apparently, Mr Clancy believes that Mao Jackets are still the top of the fashion in Beijing, even for young ladies with good jobs. Maybe before writing about a foreign country could he at least watch some TV news ? He seems also to believe that all Europeans use Euros when they talk about price, even Russians, who are not members of the European Union (in the current real world but it is also the case in the near-indeterminate future described in Tom Clancy's book). Tom, your characters constantly praise hard work as an American virtue. May be you should follow their example for your future works."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As usual the action and setup of the book were good, however you really have to get through the inane and assinine dialogue. I can't believe there was actually a line in the book in which the the VP of the US actually says &quot;You can bet your bippy...&quot;. And I'm sure the next Clancy book, he'll have Jack Ryan's wife beatified for sainthood... can there be a more perfect wife, mother, doctor, confidant, teacher, political analyst, lover, etc, etc, etc.... puke!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"We're (my husband and I) the sort of Clancy fans that register months ahead of time for the next Jack Ryan novel. We're pretty disappointed with this one, for most of the same reasons listed by other readers. Ryan is a little too whiny and way too crude. Many of the details are off kilter. Most of all, the Nomuri/Ming/sausage business is REALLY beneath what we've come to expect from Mr. Clancy and left us both sickened. I'd like to know what happened to better sensibilities of his agent and the editors?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like many, I've really enjoyed Tom Clancy's books.... great stories, fascinating research, and very interesting characters. But The Bear and the Dragon is a real disappointment. The story lines are simpler and very slow. The content feels preachy, over-explained, and repetitive. The many unnecessary commentaries present extremist and therefore naive biases, making the book feel more like a political commentary (a poor one) than a good novel. The commentaries regarding the Chinese pyschie and the ordinary Chinese people are grossly simplified and in many cases not even true....they feel like stereotypes borrowed from the 1970s, not at all reflective of the &quot;Internet&quot; age as the book attempts to portray. The characters that I've really come to like have deteriorated, too. When did Jack Ryan become such a whiner? Oh and the unnecessarily (and repetitively) foul language...I really looked forward to this book, but compared to Debt of Honor and the Executive Order, this is a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every Tom Clancy book and own all of them in hard cover. I eagerly buy them on first day they are available. With such an interesting premise, I was really looking forward to this 1000+ page monster. Unfortunately, Clancy took WAY too much time setting up the story, was repetitive and then rushed through the ending. I even began to question his research, which really runied things for me. Among the minor errors, he referred to a stock with a four letter symbol as trading on the &quot;Big Board&quot;. NYSE stocks have three letter symbols. One of his characters took rides to LaGardia airport on the subway? I don't think you can do that.And how many times does one have to hear different versions of Jack Ryan stating he does not like his job? I also was getting tired of being preached to. I agree with many of his views, but what happened to subtlety? Granted, any Tom Clancy book is better than most, but I think he is either too busy with other projects to devote full attention or, worse, simply thinks that he is so much smarter than everyone else, that he can simply go through the motions and collect his $20 million.Sorry, but this one was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Hey Tom I think you need to use the F word or GD a little more. Every other sentence was just not enough. Normally I can read a Clancy book in 3 days. The last 2 I have had to make myself finish. This one should have gone straight to paper back......."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have for years read and re-read everything Clancy. When the cold war was on, there was an obvious enemy to deal with, and mostly, the Soviets were even made out like real human beings, with feelings and all. But then the cold war ended, and TC's books became increasingly weird with wars with Japan and stuff. I was quite disappointed in Rainbow Six, with its hilariously unlikely scenario. When I saw that the new TC was a Ryan book, I though &quot;awright!&quot;. So I bought it, and I'm somewhere in the middle of it now. I'm trying to think if I've ever been so disappointed by a book before. I really don't think so. There's been mention elsewhere about &quot;foul&quot; language, and while I usually don't mind (hey, I'm a user!) it just looks gratuitous here. But what really irks me is how Ryan went from being a thinking man in the Agency to a narrow-minded, mean-spirited president. I guess once the reasonable plot ideas dried out, TC decided to let his characters be vehicles for preaching his own, way-over-the-top right-wing politics, racism and all. I guess I am going to finish it, since I bought it, but TC has made his last buck off me. I'll get my fix re-reading his early, quite brilliant stuff."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book shelves are filled with very successful authors who have sold mega-quantities of books and whose new releases go to the top of the best seller lists on their name value alone, before the latest issue is even read. Tom Clancy has become (over the years) just such an author, and many of us who have enjoyed his work would say &quot;rightly so.&quot; His latest book, however, is more of a slow, dreary tome than a fast-paced exciting novel. At over 1000 pages, it is too long by a factor of at least two. I remember, when I was younger, there was a wonderful adventure writer named Allistair MacLean, who I came to love for books like Guns Of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare etc. After years of great success he began to take the success for granted and his books seriously degraded in quality, he became depressed, drank heavily and, ultimately, died. I'm not suggesting the same path for Mr. Clancy, but hopefully this disappointment will be a lesson that will put him back on the right path. The real problem is that he may have &quot;boxed&quot; himself into a very difficult corner. Having Jack Ryan as President dramatically reduces the ability of his lead character to be at the center of the action. How he resolves this dilemma may ultimately determine his future success and whether this series must inevitably end and another series or unrelated individual novels must be solution. If you have something better to do, carry around all those wonderful memories of Clancy's earlier books rather than these 1000 pages. They will be much lighter and infinitely more rewarding."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Few books, especially novels, are worth reading that are over 1000 pages long. This novel would have been much better at 500 pages. To be cut, would be the endless descriptions of Ryan, our newly elected President, thinking and talking about social security, abortion, balance of payments and other Clancy thoughts on government and Washington policy or the lack thereof. Who cares what Clancy thinks on these subjects. Give us a good read, lots of action and plausible reality. We get enough of the rest on talk shows and in The New York Times"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I no longer have RED STAR RISING with which to compare this novel, but it is my recollection that this is merely a rewrite of it with only the names of the characters and countries changed and the military equipment brought up to date! I feel cheated! I won't read Clancy ever again!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found the book to be full of offensive language and more explicit sexual content than I am willing to endure. I have been a Jack Ryan fan since Hunt for Red October. I put this book down because of the f-word and other swear words occuring many times per most pages and because of the sexual detail. I also find that Jack Ryan has become less interesting and highly shallow as President. Where has the intelligent and courageous hero we all grew to love gone?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Without spoiling things, I felt that &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; was, at times, a rewrite of &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Red Storm Rising.&quot; Like other reviews, I think Mr. Clancy could have trimmed the book by a good 300 pages.I also did not like his extensive use of profanity. I don't recall him using so much foul language in his other books.Clancy is one of my favorite authors, but this book is not his best. It has it's moments, but most of it is quite flat and almost boring (i.e., the first 300 or so pages).I expect better, Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a 200-page initial review: &quot;Not (yet) up to par.&quot; My reading habit is to go to bed and read for an hour or so. Of late I manage to prop my way through 3 or 4 pages before I drop the book.From reading some of the other customer reviews, it sounds like I have 700+ pages to go before the action picks up to classic Clancy pace --- final rating will be when I finish the book; ETR is 15 Apr 01. . . . :-("},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like most TC readers I have read all his previous books and looked forward to this release. However early on in the reading of the Bear and the Dragon I found myself pushing to get through the book. There is little to no character development and little to no excitement. Phrases are repeated throughout the book that feel like they were cut and pasted verbatim from earlier chapters or from other works (The Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reicht). Not that there is plagerism going on. It's just historical reference, but it should have been expanded on and made unique to this book. Nothing breaks the enjoyment of reading as much as noticing the writing.Various times in the book there are severe errors in descriptions of technology - most notably in the areas of the internet. These areas made me cringe in their extreme ignorance on the basics of domain names, email, modem speed and the like. For instance we are expected to believe that in China one can connect to an ISP at 57000 bits per second. First off we can barely do that here in our country and then you would not be connecting at that speed, but would probably connect at a number based on 1024 (i.e. 48128 or similar). in fact i believe that there are limits in a 56k modem that keep the connections below 50k.We are also expected to believe that the CIA also connects via a dial up! It takes 3 minutes for the laptop to send the email and it also takes 3 minutes to receive it at CIA headquarters. Perhaps she really is using AOL to get her most secret encrypted email, but that is stretching belief quite a bit.Also - no one who uses computers calls them 'puters. How about &quot;PC's&quot; next time Mr. Clancy?Okay, I'll admit that this is all nit picking, but the reason that TC is so great is the attention to details as the story is crafted. If the suspension of belief is broken while reading, the story has problems.I also found the plot very heavy handed. I felt like this is a political message about China and abortion. Not that I disagree with his beliefs but everyone has the same opinions in TC's government. Anyone who opposes his view are cast as &quot;tree huggers&quot;, commies or gays and are quickly cast aside.This book is just too much propaganda for TC's political views. It lacks realism and is just a plain disappointment. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every Clancy novel and loved each one. Maybe you just can't maintain such a high level all the time. But it seems he's substituting quantity for quality in this tome. The story line was expected, and picked up where the last novel left off. But we have to endure about 900 pages of preliminary chess moves until we get to the real meat. And then, it was disapointing. We are told over and over that the Russian Army and especially the Far Eastern Command can't defend against a determined Boy Scout Troop. Yet the fight comes comes off more like a Nintendo game than combat with the worlds largest standing army.But what really did the book in was the frequent social and political commentary. For example, when Mrs. Ryan complains about some small thing Jack has done, Jack thinks that all women just need something to complain about. And the frequent references to Clinton is tired. It could be time to retire Jack Ryan and John Clark.Maybe I'll just retire from Clancy!Rock Chalk, y'all..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Had this been his first book it would never have been published and we'd all be saying &quot;Tom who?&quot;. Instead I'm saying &quot;Tom, what happened to you?&quot;. Though slightly better than Rainbow Six, the story is far too linear, repetitive (The word &quot;Klingon&quot; appears over a dozen times - spread through the book!) and ordinary. The final chapter must have been phoned in by those same Klingons. (Among other things Ryan invites the entire crew of a destroyer over to the White House to get drunk with him.) The last line is simply revolting and unworthy. I suspect Tom is using some kind of high end computer program, plus assistant writers, to generate is latest &quot;material&quot;. If so he should either get back to basics or give it up entirely. Thanks for a fantastic run Mr. Clancy. Please don't ruin your legacy with this kind of work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is in desperate need of an editor. There are characters introduced then forgotten, misspellings and redundant statements, cultural anachronisms (sorry, I have spent a lot of time in Russia and no one calls anyone 'Comrade' anymore). The whole thing feels like a second draft that could have been tightened quite a bit. Sorry, I think Mr. Clancy has stretched himself too thin."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I know that I am just adding to the number of people who are displeased and thorougly discouraged the way Clancy writes; verbosity at its best. I think Clancy needs to read his first novel &quot;The Hunt For Red October,&quot; and classic thrillers written by such reputed authors like Fredrick Forsyth to really &quot;re-learn'&quot; the art of writing a thriller. It's all good to strut one's military knowledge, but for god's sake it's useless if you can't hold the attention of the reader. As readers have pointed out, this book barely gets your attention till after 300 pages. Even then, the reader has to cope with voluminous details as if he's due to sit an exam the next day. Clancy should seriously think about his future work and I dare say the publisher must be faulted too for letting this book go on the shelf. It's a total comedown for American fiction writing. Tom Clancy seems to be building a repuitation for abasing himself. Publisher, please spare us this!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a very disappointing book.It's bad enough that Clancy has discovered the word f__k, but he uses it every chance he gets in this book. Clancy descends into using degrading sexual imagery -- &quot;missed by a c__t hair&quot; is used repeatedly in the book. And Clancy doesn't neglect the racial stereotypes liberally, either -- African Americans are labeled &quot;monkeys,&quot; Chinese are &quot;Chinamen&quot; or &quot;ch_nks,&quot; and the Arabs are not forgotten either.Instead of turning into a principled apolitical thinking President, Jack Ryan has turned into a trigger-happy macho who abandons his assigned post and proceeds to get happily drunk during an international crisis.Reading this book is like spending a few days in a garbage bin.The Tom Clancy we knew and read seems to have retired some years ago."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I bought this book because, hey, it's Clancy, so it has to be really good (like &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger,&quot; &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;) or at least a moderately good book that will make a better movie (like &quot;Patriot Games&quot;).I have now slogged through 328 pages of this thing (about a third of the way through the book), and I'm bored out of my mind! Come on, come on, make something happen already! This book is moving at an absolutely glacial speed.There are hints of a few things going on that could build up to something exciting. I figure that that will probably come to fruition at around page 850.I don't usually review a book before I've finished it, but I don't know if I can stick with this one until the end. And that's probably a more telling review than if I had waded through this until the end before writing the review.Clancy, you blew it. Big time. I even loved &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; your last proper novel. But this one is in SERIOUS need of an editor. Don't just write an 1100 page book because you can. Engage the readers a bit in the process, please!I recommend taking a speed-reading class and a couple of No-Doz before attempting to tackle this bloated tome."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In the summer of 1988, I had a day devoted to reading Clancy's first novel. Didn't eat, didn't sleep until I had finished it. And for every novel since, my life has gone on hold because I can't stop reading it. Until his latest, of course. Though some of his novels are a bit verbose at times, this takes the cake! Are his editors (if there are any) too scared of him to use their red pens? Or are they even bothering to read anymore? Publisher, beware: you will lose money and Clancy fans on this one - and deservedly so. Tom (if I may be so bold), beware: save your readers the sermons and the repetition and get back to the fast-moving thriller/suspense we have all grown to love. Might I suggest you revisit Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Or hire me as your editor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since the 'Hunt for Red Ocotber' and 'Red Storm Rising', which I have read numerous times. Actually, I have reread every 'Jack Ryan' Tom Clancy book that I have bought or checked out from the library. I even took the time to reread Executive Orders for the third time before reading 'The Bear and the Dragon'. At least the third reading of 'Executive Orders' kept me on the edge of my seat. I ususally read one of Clancy's tomes in a few days.The first 300 pages of 'The Bear and the Dragon' took me over one week to read. This title never grabbed my attention at all. It must have taken me six weeks to read this novel.I would not rush out to buy this book. This is one that I feel I should have checked out from the public library; and not have added it to my personal libray."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has taken a medeocre 300 paged novel and expanded it into a horrendous novel of over 1000 pages. This is his worst to date and is the last of the hard cover editions of his books I will buy. He is still an interesting read but the development is so slow you start losing interest. Just think back to the hunt for red october or red storm rising. This was clancy at his best. Now he has used up the genre and should develop new and interesting characters not the same cast of characters that can do no wrong."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't want to just pile on here like everyone else, but this book was such a monumental waste of time I'd feel remiss if I didn't say something. Much like the other reviewers here I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier works. However, I'm beginning to lose faith in what was once one of my favorite writers. In &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, I found most of the dialogue to be tedious and repetitive. The plot line wanders along with all the purpose of a random Arctic ice berg. Look out Titanic fans! If you value your time even in the slightest do yourself a favor, pass on this book and wait for more reader reaction before picking up Clancy's next tome. I wish I'd had the foresight to do so this time around."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As an old Clancy/Ryan fan, this one just didn't make the cut. Tired storyline, much too long. About 1/3 of the book is editorializing about the presidency and about &quot;evil&quot; China - no place for all that waffle in a novel of this kind. I waded through to the end, but it was barely worth it. Of all the Ryan novels, this has got to be the worst. Certainly not worthy of all the others. Sad to see."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Man, this was worse than going to the dentist. Not only does Clancy subject the reader to 1000+ pages of drawn-out plot and completely unrealistic coincidences, but he somehow thinks we'd all like to hear him spout off on right-wing politics. Add in the fact that this book has less action, more rambling, and generally a lower level of writing than what we've been used to, and you'll find this book a poor piece of work. The facts seem a lot less well-researched, too. Several times I found myself wondering if Clancy had done the same kind of superior research and technical investigation that he did on his early books. Dammit, I used to LOVE this guy's stuff, but they've gradually become less and less enjoyable fiction and more and more long pontifications of Clancy's personal political opinions. Maybe he's got so much money now that he just doesn't care and wants to spend the rest of his life writing conservative political crap and lecturing his readers on his social theories, but he's lost one customer here who bought every book up until this one. Sorry, Tom, but you really blew it on this and I won't be buying your product again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I join a few other reviewers who came here to find out if our thinking on the book was odd, or if the book indeed, was odd! I feel vindicated, seeing that MANY of the reviews expressed the same feelings and emotions that I was feeling.To those who categorize the reviewers as democrats or republicans, I think you're off base. All reviewers were trying to point out is that Mr. Clancy has intruded into OUR reading of a work of fiction, with his politics. If I wanted to hear Mr. Clancy's politics, I would have purchased his essays.This book is FAIR in quality, certainly not up to his usual abilities. He's written MUCH MUCH better novels. I agree with some of the other reviewers who asked, \\"Which Tom Clancy wrote this book?\\" It seems as if Mr. Clancy was getting paid by the page and decided to quit at 1000. It took him a few more pages to reach \`the end point,' but the thought here is that this would have been a terrific book at 400 pages. Take out the politics, take out the lectures (if I want to be lectured to, I can find those books in the library,) and finally, treat your readers like the adults we are.Instead of a movie contract, sign up for a Reader's Digest Condensed Book contract!Sign me \\"Disappointed\\""},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The absolute WORST! Mr. Clancy needs to get off his soapbox and come back down to earth. We read you Mr. Clancy because your stories were often compelling, (a bit verbose and too technical at times), but the meat and potatoes of the story are well done. I could care less about your political agenda. If you need to speak about it, use another avenue.If you possess the political philosophy of a neo-facist John Bircher this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I think the author has forgotten why people buy his books and it's not so we can read his opinions. Within the first 100 pages, there are several bashes against the current US president and many derogotory comments regarding environmentalists, abortion rights people, gun control advocates and others that traditionally stand against the Republican party. All this before the action starts but it doesn't stop until the end, 900 pages later.There's more bad language here than there was in his first 1/2 dozen books together. He used to be an author who wouldn't stoop to the use of gratuitous profanity but &quot;the f word&quot; now gets dropped every few pages.Anyone who has read an interview with the author knows he's a Republican and that's fine but I didn't buy the book to read his views. I didn't mind the way he used to do commentary in the books, it fit the story. Now, you'll be going along in a good part and get hit with a political view that sticks out like a sore thumb.There's a good story here if you're willing to wade through the wordiness, cursing and political attacks. Clancy was one of three authors I would buy hardcover fiction books from, he'll be lucky if I buy paperback next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you want a book you can laugh at(not for its jokes, but its stupidity) then get this book now!!! WAU!Here is one of MANY examples:Spy: Here, put this CD into your computer.Secretary of Chinese Minister: What does it do?Spy: You don't need to know, do you?Sec: Uhh...I guess not. It won't get me in trouble, will it?Spy: Of course not!Sec: OK!!!The CD is put in, and Voila! Instant information source for Washington inside the Chinese government! AMAZING!But if you're looking for a realistic plot, then don't even bother.Clancy has no idea about what China is like. The people there don't \\"dress the same, have the same awful haircut\\", and they definately don't call each other \\"COMRADES\\".There are things that are written, which I won't go into, that border on racism.Another big setback for this book is the sluggish pace, even by Clancy standards. Also, there are numerous instances where Clancy makes you cringe with the sheer cheesiness and stupidity of it all. Jack Ryan CONSTANTLY complains about being president. Apparently, he hates all the attention, hates all the people serving him, and is just an average joe who's been \\"tricked\\" into the presidency. That's great. But when this point is hammered into you time and time and time again, it gets very annoying.Also, the work \\"puke\\" seems to be very popular with EVERYONE in Washington. \\"Field puke...navy puke...airforce puke....\\" ARRRG"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Bottom line: not a great piece of literature but entertaining. Buy it for the last 400-500 pages.First the bad news: -- Clancy needs to hire a really good editor (if one was involved in this, he/she needs to be replaced). Too many errors stayed in and the first 600 pages should be the first 300 pages, too much repeated stuff and too many words to get the job done. -- If you can't figure out the major plot items 100+ pages in advance, then you're asleep or this is the first Clancy novel you've read. Ending is especially so. -- A few too many echoes of Red Storm Rising. -- If I &quot;hear&quot; Ryan whine about being President ever again it will be too soon. Very tiresome and needlessly so.The good news: -- The espionage stuff up front is generally excellent and sets up a complex situation. If this part were condensed down to be tighter it could stand up well with the last 1/3 of the book and give away less of what unfolds later. Some good ideas here. -- The war sequence at the end is classic Clancy. Full of cool toys, great detail and good storytelling. -- Despite the weaknesses, I found the book entertaining and I'd still rate it as one of the stronger of his more recent books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's latest effort shows that he hasn't had a new idea in years and with each book goes back to the same tired source that has clearly become barren through overuse. In addition, this book is blatantly racist. characterizing Chinese people as 'chinks' repeatedly. I wonder if more than just Clancy's writing skills are waning in his tiresome refernece to woman as sexual objects and far too frequent vulgar language. Clancy clearly sees the world through the eyes of a 14 year old -- good here, bad there. This black and white doctrine of his has always been simplistic, but was excusable in his earliest efforts in context to the times."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As usual I enjoyed the technical aspects of Clancy's Bear and Dragon. And incidentally I happen to agree with his politics, and I think he was actually quite kind to a certain former President. I'm also fairly patient about cliches and over-workings. So I only have one real criticism: Even with 1,000-plus pages, this story ended far too suddenly. I hate it when it appears that the author simply got tired of writing. Several deliciously rich threads were left to dangle in the wind. So I might hope for a sequel, just to wrap up a few very enjoyable subplots, but I'm sure it wouldn't work very well. From page to page I enjoyed Bear and Dragon, and I always enjoy the pleasant fiction of former enemies being such close pals -- fiction only in the sense of so readily allowing massive foreign military assets to touch native soil -- but this book most certainly needed another 20 or 30 pages of closure."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I finished \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" yesterday after a read that took about three days. Overall, I found the book to be enjoyable, but also noticed a not small number of frustrations and irritations.First, I was disappointed by the way the author sort of hastily tied up the subplot involving Ming. At the point in the novel where the Siberian War started she and the American spy in Beijing just sort of disappeared from the story.Second, I was disappointed by the failure to follow through on the Mike Reilly part of the story. After the renegade KGB agent confessed to his work for the Chinese, it seemed like Clancy just let FBI agent Reilly and his colleague, the Russian police officer, fade out from the tale. I think that was a mistake, especially since the last appearance of Reilly was when he told the FBI director about the Chinese plot to kill the Russian president.Third, I got pissed off by the overt anti-Clinton comments in the book. They are totally illogical in the Ryan-verse, of which this book is part, because Clinton was never President in this fictional Ryan-verse and there is no indication in any prior novel that any of Clancy's fictionalized American leaders exhibited behavior like Clinton did in the real world. In any event, this is fiction, not a political speech. We don't need to have Clancy's Republican point of view thrown at us so obviously.And the same goes for his several criticisms of environmentalism and those who advocate for it. None of those nasty comments, which he had come out as \\"thoughts\\" of several characters, especially Admiral Mancuso, had anything at all to do with the plot and they didn't even do much to bring out the character's personality. Again, I thought these were just random, unnecessary and irritating windows into Clancy's personal politics.I didn't like the way the climactic scene involving the missile strike on DC was handled, either. There had never been any hint before that part of the novel that the Navy's hotshot civilian programmer was having any trouble fixing the missile software to allow interception of an ICBM. All of a sudden Clancy drops this thing about how he programmed the interceptor missiles to hit the heat coming out of the ICBM engines. That was weird and it seemed to me Clancy just forgot to set the table for that development.I also didn't see the point of the whole Ryan being dropped off on the cruiser thing. It didn't add anything to our well-developed understanding of the character and I couldn't figure out what Ryan, who normally shows such great judgment in the novels, was hoping to achieve with that move. Clancy even concedes that when he has Ryan say pretty much the same thing.Finally, I thought Clancy's economics were a bit off mark. Granted, before the financial disaster our government created for itself since the novel was published the U.S. had a big budget surplus and a big trade deficit with China, so the author's imagination of a China that was bringing in huge export revenues and spending them on weapons and military equipment wasn't a bad one. However, he never really got around to explaining how the Chinese military could have spent so much money but be so incompetent and so bereft of modern weapons technology or modern combat tactics. This part of the novel was muddled, at best.All in all, the novel kept my attention well. I am not sick of Jack Ryan as President. I hope, in fact, that Clancy writes another novel that focuses on what happened to Ryan after the events in \\"The Bear and the Dragon.\\" While he's at it, maybe he can tie up the loose ends involving Reilly, Ming and the American agent, and the Russian general who became a hero in this novel (Bondarenko). And in what story was Robby Jackson supposedly killed off, anyway?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I realy loved every &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; book that Clancy wrote until this one. This one is one too much. &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; was consumed to its poor end. Enough. He should start thinking of a new hero, no Jack Ryan, no John Clark, but a new one, a fresh one.The book was boring from page 1 until about 200 pages from the end. These last 200pages were more interesting, but still, as a unit, this book is boring.As a Clancy fan, I hope that he will return to himself next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon, like many of Tom Clancy's books, holds the reader from cover to cover. While the detail that Clancy uses is not appreciated by many readers, I found it to be valuable in forming a story which held my interest from the first time I'd opened it to the closing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While I enjoyed The Bear and the Dragon very much, I must say that the book is not for everyone. While Clancy has written some of the best &quot;techno-thrillers&quot; of the past two decades, Bear lacks much of the raw action of Rainbow Six or Clear &amp; Present Danger. Readers looking for a speedy action read will be disappointed.Despite the fact that Clancy is often slighly off-base with his political commentary or cultural depiction, I have always felt that the fact that his books include subplots in these areas to be a positive. This is most evident in The Cardinal &amp; The Kremlin and can been seen again in Bear.The most important thing to know when picking up a Clancy novel is that he is in a genre by himself. No one else, for better or for worse, writes like him. Some readers may be put off by this or may not be able to follow Clancy's complex and multi-faceted plots. I couldn't critique anyone for not liking this book. However, if you are looking for a novel that is about more than guns, bombs, and missiles, I would recommend The Bear and The Dragon highly."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy shines again in this masterful, realistic spin on the world of &quot;what-ifs&quot; that we live in. One of Tom's biggest assets is to combine both present technologies and current theories and weave them into a plot that I have to continually remind myself is fiction. Tom Clancy is known in his past works not only for his immense grasp for technical details but also for his serially written novels. After reading several previous reviews, I can only guess that some people made a mistake in attempting to grasp this fine piece of literature. I have personally read all of Tom Clancy's novels, in order, and I awaited the day that this book hit the shelves; as I remember, it was near my 16th birthday. Here I am, just 16, and I am engrossed in Clancy's works. If I can grasp his plot schemes and technical details, others can too. Otherwise, close the book, and return it to the store so others like myself can enjoy this fusion of past, present, and future military suspense."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"... If you like Clancy and his character, you have to add this to your collection. I like Clancy because of the technical detail and interplay of numerous plot lines..This book was a little like a family reunion of his finest characters - Ryan, the Foley's, Clark - as well as an introduction to several new character that have a lot of promise. A great reprive from the one dimensional, non-lethal weapon, psuedo-Clancy knock-offs."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this book! It's your typical Clancy story packed with great detail. He brings back many of the folks we have become familiar with including the Rainbow crew. The first 100 pages are tough due to all of the characters Clancy introduces. I especially hate when the Russian characters all seem to have at least two different names. Too much to keep track of.As usual, it picks up speed and I couldn't put it down. I've ready everything Clancy has put out (except for his co-author stuff) and can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I just finished this epic novel of Tom Clancy's and I thought it was great. My arms got a bit tired holding it but other than that it was an enjoyable read. I liked the character development and enjoyed &quot;seeing&quot; old friends again - Jack Ryan et al. I disagree with most of the reviews here and wanted to get my view on record."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you're a Clancy fanatic (yes, I'm one) you'll love this book. If you've read his earlier work (the novels, not the co-written material), you'll find this one to be very similar. One big change is that because this work involves the topic of diplomacy, the major action develops very slowly and builds throughout the book. This is in stark contrast to some earlier works (like Sum of All Fears) where dramatic world events &quot;take off&quot; in the first 5-10 pages of the book. Some earlier reviewers commented about the somewhat more adult content (fairly minor) in this work, and I agree with their findings. Clearly a book written for adults, NOT for the younger set due to some sexual references throughout. If you love Clancy's work, you've got to read this one!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When I first got this book I thought it'll be bad 'cos of the reviews I read,but I found out something .The book to someone who hasn't been reading Clancy's book maybe 2-3,but for someone following all his books it's a 4.I think the only book that's beats it hands down will be Without Remorse.I honestly don't think he can beat that any longer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is by far on of Tom Clancy's best novels besides Rainbow Six and Sum of All Fears. It's full of action, spy and mind racing adventure. The only downpart was the &quot;japanese sausage&quot; part. It was kind of lame, (especially since i'm a guy) Anyhow, I highly reccomend this book to all Clancy fans and others."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book, telling the tale of Jack Ryan, Clancy's fictional hero from most of his previous books, really is a classic. After Rainbow Six, which tended to have a more closed, focused story, this book is again very diverse, with many plots and subplots. Truly a great work of fiction. Long may Mr. Clancy write!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"And I like Tom Clancy, BUT. Too long, too repetitious,too little editing, too many lectures, ...and yet you hang in to read about the new weapons and details of war. Jack Ryan is only in an action scene because he does something irresponsible. Who is left to be the enemy? The next one will be fascinating or forgetable. We'll see."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a Tom Clancy fan for years, and am half way finished with this book. I anxiously awaited a new &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; story. However I feel this book moves very slow and is hard to keep track of the characters. I think the basic premise is interesting especially since Congress is considering giving the PRC a favorite trade status. I wonder where fiction ends and reality begins. The book finally started taking off after I had read a third of the book"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"But for the love of Pete, edit more."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ryan has become the caricature of a crass, crusty middle-age man. Too much sex, too much foul language, too many stupid locker-room jokes, too much sermonizing and too little editing (the same clich&eacute;d phrases over and over). The book drags through the beginning and only picks up in the last few hundred pages. But the end is disappointing and unsatisfactory, as if the last few pages were abrubtly wrapped up."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Artless, long, and dull. I plowed through it because it was all I brought to read -- a big mistake. Notably worse than Executive Orders in style."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a person who reads all of Tom Clancy's books, The Bear and the Dragon, was a real treat. I was on the waiting list at Amazon and was not disappointed. I have read the reviews whining about too many sub-polts. Excuse me, but I found the sub-plots extremely informative. One of the things I like best about Tom Clancy, aside from great story telling, is his insight into global politics. This book is great and will cause the serious reader to think."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a person who reads all of Tom Clancy's books, The Bear and the Dragon, was a real treat.

I've stuck with it as long as I can but this is the last. The same story, again and again, with two-dimensional characters that do a disservice to our professionals in uniforms-- heck he even does a disservice with his bad guys. I'm switching to others, most particularly those who actually wore a uniform and served, such as Stephen Coonts, Dale Brown, Bob Mayer, and I especially like Andy McNabb's SAS books. Check out titles such as BRAVO TWO ZERO, CUT OUT, or how about DeMille's SENSE OF HONOR?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy was, in my mind, the unequivocall master of the techno thriller untill Without Remorse, that was the last great book he wrote, untill now. Although The Bear and the Dragon is not as good as Clancy's early work it is far better than Executive Orders, Rainbow Six or any of the CRAP he writes as the Op-Center or Power Plays series. This book takes us back to the style of Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising. I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While there are some compelling moments in this story, this is a book that could have been about 400 pages shorter. I've always enjoyed Clancy's work, but I felt that there was too much political posturing in this story and unnecessary backstories much like his more recent Ryan-verse stories. I'd like more techno-thrills from this techno-thriller author, and there simply wasn't enough.That said, the last 300 pages were entertaining - I just wish the 1st 700 pages were as entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The last few pages are extremely hoaky, but until then the book moves along well and preserves plausibility."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan and when I did see his latest book &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; I couldn't wait to buy and read it. Looking back at it, this is my worst buy ever. I live myself in Asia (as a European) and really, Tom Clancy should have stayed out of Asia, because his views of Asia are biased, racist and simply WRONG. Besides this, the book is just never really starting of and very dreadful. I expected much better from Tom Clancy.."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Before buying the book I read a number of reviews. Most of which were negative. In the end they made me curious for the book. Most reviewers berate the insults and the sex content and lament the lateness of the action. I was disappointed too. Disappointed because Clancy did not dare to choose. What I was looking forward to read was the struggle of Ryan as President. What I got was Executive Orders but a little differently. I think that Clancy should have tried to venture into a different field and leave the Techno-triller behind him and explore his established caracters in an alien environment. As to the profanity and the sex content. I've read worse. As to the conservative ideas, well I suppose that Clancy can be considered to be conservative (he is an NRA supporter) but it is the caracters that voice opinions, not Clancy. To sum it up: I think that Clancy has missed a chance and produced an average book. And he is barely in need of an editor. So am I but I am not an native speaker. So bear with me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book wasn't too good. I guess it was trying to be realistic talk, but I got pretty tired of all the &quot;slant-eyes&quot; remarks. The sausage stuff was not clever or witty, it was just kind of gross. I don't think most people reading this kind of book (mostly men) want to read about some guys &quot;Japanese Sausage&quot; over and over and over again.And the whole last part was predictable...everything in the last couple of hundred pages could've been predicted by about page 500--I knew what was going to happen with the hunter guy, I knew what was going to happen with Clark and all that followed their actions, almost exactly what was going to happen, and the aftermath was also totally predictable."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every Tom Clancy fiction title, but this will be the last. Aside from the many oversights in editing, I'm simply disappointed to see what has happened to my favorite characters. Good ol' Jack Ryan, formerly a regular guy (despite his wealth, intelligence, hero status, and Harrison Ford good looks), now shamelessly preaches about &quot;treehuggers,&quot; Roe V. Wade, Liberals in Congress, White House hanky-panky and whatever else irks Mr. Clancy. Other valued characters, including Robby (V.P.) Jackson and George (Trader) Winston, have become similarly obnoxious. Whether one agrees with the politics or not, this is not why we read Clancy &quot;thrillers.&quot; I would agree with a previous reviewer about the possibility of a ghost writer here; I'm sure it was Rush Limbaugh."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am on page 315 and bored out of my mind with this book! When will the action begin? I too am offended by the increased use of foul language in this book, a definate departure from Clancy's other books, of which, for the most part, I have enjoyed reading. Since I am a die-hard fan, however, I will continue reading this book, although my money may have been better spent on one of the &quot;Op-Center&quot; series books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In the summer of 1988, I had a day devoted to reading Clancy's first novel. Didn't eat, didn't sleep until I had finished it. And for every novel since, my life has gone on hold because I can't stop reading it. Until his latest, of course. Though some of his novels are a bit verbose at times, this takes the cake! Are his editors (if there are any) too scared of him to use their red pens? Or are they even bothering to read anymore? Publisher, beware: you will lose money and Clancy fans on this one - and deservedly so. Tom (if I may be so bold), beware: save your readers the sermons and the repetition and get back to the fast-moving thriller/suspense we have all grown to love. Might I suggest you revisit Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Or hire me as your editor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What happened to Jack Ryan? That's the first question engendered by listening to this condensation of the massive new Clancy best seller. Maybe he shows more acumen and action in the book, but in this abridged audio treatment, he's barely a supporting character. I found myself wondering what Josiah Bartlett, of The West Wing, would be doing in the midst of a Chinese attack on Russia. Saying more interesting things than &quot;F**k,&quot; which seems to be Ryan's (and Clancy's) new favorite word. I deeply miss the Action Ryan of Patriot Games, the Savvy Ryan of Sum of All Fears, and the Early Presidential Ryan of Executive Orders.The thing of it is that no other character rises to take his place center stage. This is a book about battles and hardware, or at least it is on audio. Apart from a little salacious material involng a CIA Agent and Politburo Minister's secretary, there's little character interplay. The novel was in desperate need on condensation, from what I see here on line, but cutting it down to four tapes reducies it to bluerpiunt status.Finally, the antagonists in the Chinese government are portrayed as sucjh attogant idits that there's no ususpense. We know from the start that the US (and Russia, almost an afterthought) will prevail, but there's hardly a sense of danger in any battle. The last part of the book might have been a page-turner, but not much of one.I'm not looking forward to the unabridged version, and am glad I rented this instead of buying it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't want to just pile on here like everyone else, but this book was such a monumental waste of time I'd feel remiss if I didn't say something. Much like the other reviewers here I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier works. However, I'm beginning to lose faith in what was once one of my favorite writers. In &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, I found most of the dialogue to be tedious and repetitive. The plot line wanders along with all the purpose of a random Arctic ice berg. Look out Titanic fans! If you value your time even in the slightest do yourself a favor, pass on this book and wait for more reader reaction before picking up Clancy's next tome. I wish I'd had the foresight to do so this time around."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Been there, done that. A long rehash of what we've seen before - foreign country underestimates U.S., war starts, U.S. crushes foe. Yada, yada, yada. Some things ring very hollow: I don't think I need to see the two most senior people in the CIA calling each other honey-bunny; the same goes for Jack Ryan and his 'babe' comments to his wife. He rants, even more then usual, on Social Security, &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, gays, and women (his Secret Service agent Andrea Price-O'Day). At 1024 pages, there is way too much character development and not enough action. Finally, the whole reason for the conflict - the death of a couple of foreign diplomats, *they're not American, Tom*, is quite a stretch."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Some how my previous lengthy review of this tome didn't make the list, therefore with public spirit in mind I will add my one star and suggest that Mr. Clancy hire an editor. No one should waste the time to read this regurgitated pap."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;Bear&quot; is a worthy addition to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan epic. You can tell it's good when you find virtually all of the sub-plots in the book compelling and interesting. Clancy did an especially good job of connecting the big developments in the book to the ordinary lives of real people -- showing how ordinary people can sometimes change the course of history unknowingly. Clocking in at 1028 pages, &quot;Bear&quot; just flew by. If anything, it was too short.Of course, Clancy can be accused of sticking too close to the &quot;formula&quot; in this book. The prospect of major conflict between big powers, though titilating for most of the book's early section, quickly becomes blase in the Clancy universe. Didn't the same thing happen in Debt of Honor and Executive Orders? Though Clancy introduces fascinating new characters and leaves us wanting to know more at the end, I for one sure hope Clancy's next novel is not about the next &quot;War of the Year&quot; that Ryan has to deal with.Having taken a break from Clancy for a while (dropped Executive Orders midway through and skipped Rainbow), the first thing I will surely do is go back and read what I missed. This guy is still good!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's latest, The Bear and the Dragon, is a damned good story. It does take a few hundred pages to set up all the back-story, but that is due to Clancy's meticulous attention to detail. His skills for writing action sequences are still first-rate, and he has the ability to make the reader feel the exhilarating terror that is modern war.The language is a bit rougher than usual, and some of the sexuality could have been toned down. There is also such a thing as too much attention to detail; the assassination attempt investigation runs too long; Ryan's distaste for the of the Presidency are repeated too often; the inscrutablity the Chinese.Clancy refers to the Chinese as Klingons several times; perhaps he is referring to the Original Series versions; because they have been much more fleshed out in the three incarnations of Trek since. Perhaps Romulan would have been a better choice for comparision.But just when the setup starts to get boring, the plot takes one of those famous Clancy twists that make him the best seller that he is. In this case, events transpire that convince the Chinese to make war. They have sorely misunderstood the magnitude of the situation they have created. One hopes the Chinese aren't as politically dense as he paints them to be; else we might find this situation playing out for real someday.Ryan is almost an Everyman; he may hate the job he has to do, which probably makes him the best kind of man for the Presidency. If he were a real person, our current canididates wouldn't have a chance. Hell, I'd vote for him."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is actually the first Tom Clancy book I ever read that focused around Jack Ryan and I have not been disappointed since, after reading it, I hungrily consumed The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, The Cardinal of the Kremlin and am now ripping into The Sum of All Fears.This probably a great read provided you're an avid reader and love to stay up forever readng, from start-to-finish, this book is a powerful adventure with great twists and turns with a very good batch of characters, god knows I'd love to see a guy like Jack Ryan run the Presdential Office.The plot is excellent and the way Tom Clancy has you hooked on one part of the plot or another as he leads you around, making you go &quot;what?&quot; at all times as you find out how it all comes together, this book is easily worth the money spent.If you can't take long, long reads and hate technical details, you're probably going to want to skip this, but if you enjoy such things, this book is definitly for you."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Clancy again presents an extremely believable and intriguing scenario. As a committed Clancy fan I was a little disappointed with the dramatic change in character of Jack Ryan. I believe that the Author has &quot;tarnished the Star&quot; of the central character. He was changed from the solid Irish Catholic, Police officers son, devoted father/family man and solid citizen to a lay person whose actions, demeanor and vocabulary leaves something to be desired. Not the Jack Ryan of previous books, still a great read"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is another competent effort by Clancy. I was excited that he was going back into the large scale war story line that he did so well with in Red Storm Rising. For me the whole Jack Ryan as President role just does not work. This book probably could have done with some of the uncut pages left out, it does go on and drags a few places. It must be the power he has gotten over this editors that each of his books that is driving them to be increasingly longer. With that said I am a big fan of Clancy and I thought the book moves along and is never dull. Let me add that you always get a lot of detail and fact with a Clancy book, this is one of he reasons I really like the books and the reason some of my friends are getting turned off. The extra pages on the detail and weapons bring extra value to me. If you like Clancy you will love this book and probably do not need these reviews to prompt you to buy one. If you are just curious then give it a try or grab one of his earlier books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon was well written in the classic Clancy style. That style of course is the mixing of miscellaneous plots toward the beginning of the book that evolve throughout the end of the book. Finally, when the reader is able to wait no longer, he combines all of the plots into a well-engineered global conflict. Clancy spent a lot of time on characters in this book, further developing Clark and Chavez's character history and future, and a lot of time was spent on Jack Ryan's presidential psyche and courage. Not only was this a military thriller, but a spy novel as well. Much of the United States' information came from a source within the Chinese government's headquarters building. An interesting direction was taken in this book assuming it continues to be followed; the United States and Russia became allies for the first time since World War II. Whether this relationship is enduring or whether the Russians were only serving their best interest will be interesting to see in the next Clancy books. As the Jack Ryan presidential administration is maturing it is growing shrewder in its political ideas and actions and will need to evaluate the situation and act accordingly. The next in the Jack Ryan series will surely be an interesting book if it follows in the footsteps of The Bear and the Dragon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is a magical storyteller but I have noticed that his books alternate between the fantastic and the good but could be a little better (leading into the next fantastic book). Patroit Games was fantastic, the Hunt for the Red October was good. Cardinal in the Kremlin was fantastic, Clear and Present Danger was good. Sum of all fears was fantastic and Debt of Honor was very good. Executive Orders was fantastic and the Bear and the Dragon was good. It is the classic good book that lays the foundation for his next great book. I am a devoted Clancy fan and I can't wait for his next fiction book in the Jack Ryan series. I hope Clark and Jackson have more face time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"At first glance, the 1,137 page count seems daunting, but while Tom seems insistent lately to include every single decision and detail that leads up to whatever war the book involves, it goes by pretty quickly. It comes off as a remake of RED STORM RISING: aggressor Communist nation makes a move on NATO territory to steal oil, but modernizes it with using China as the invader and Russia as the victim. The Jack Ryan Administration continues to follow the path of common decency and creative occupations for some of its staffers--First Lady Cathy is still doing eye surgery at Johns Hopkins, the kids get taken to school in a VH-60 Blackhawk helo, Jack wants out of the job despite actually running for election, and his VP (who shall remain nameless for now) has certain ideas about how Air Force Two should be operated when ferrying him around the country. There's also a bit of a tirade on missile defense from the POV of Al Gregory, who's working on the problem aboard the Aegis cruiser USS Gettysburg."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"1028 pages total, 600 pages with no substance. It would have been a good read if the book is thinner.There is nothing much to anticipate given the author portray of the competency of the Chinese armed forces. The battle described feels more like some US military hardware advertisment. I hope Mr Clancy can do better next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a Tom Clancy reader, I looked forward to this book, finding myself trading needed sleep hours for the stuff I got addicted to while reading other Clancy books.Editing is somewhat poor in comparison. While the story captures the reader in an intricate weave of plots and sub-plots, the ending left me wondering if Clancy asked some hyped up 17 year old to whip out a quick chapter for him.He might as well had the president emerge flying from the whitehouse window wearing superman spandex, darting around and shotting the bad guys with a ray gun. This was mass murder of the numerous sub-plots he spent so much time developing.After an entire novel going to painstaking lengths to establish Jack Ryans discipline and professionalism, ending the book with him getting sloshed doesn't make sense. Though the immediate crisis had been avoided - it was still a delicate time in need of focused attention by the Pres. and his staff - and the beer fest didn't seem to fit. I would have liked to see the news conference that night!Some better closure to other important characters and areas would have been appreciated - like the Chinese woman who narrowly escapes forced government abortion, the wife of the murdered Chinese minister, the CNN reporter, etc.Hope I don't spend long hours on the next book in a dash to another disappointing end. A matter of fact, I'm going to rewrite the ending for myself this time. . . ."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Not great. I have always enjoyed Tom Clancys books often reading them twice or more and still staying up till 2am reading. His large storylines always come together so well and this book was no different. However this book could have been better. I feel like he drew out the beginning like i always expect of him and then i strap my self in for one hell of a finish. This book however needed an extra 200 to 300 pages to really make it good. He compressed the end too mucch and that is something i really never expect from him. I still found myself staying up till all hours reading it though. If you are a Clancy fan you should read this but if you are just getting into him read this one last after all of his others(in order prefferably). I still eagerly await the next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Continuing a series, my personal favorite being the Cardinal of the Kremlin, President Ryan takes on a fairly plausable crisis involving China and Russia. The ending was less than satisfactory, and it is unclear how the whole situation was resolved. Also, I would hope that Americans would be more resonable (Remember Pearl Harbor) and boycott goods from aggressor nations."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's fans will no doubt read this and enjoy it.It is, however, not one of his better efforts.While the plot is fast paced, the story did not grab me the way his previous books did.Sometimes, not churning books out so fast would be the better way to go."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is like getting a B+ paper from your A++ student - I'm disappointed and wondering what happened. Tom Clancy is my favorite writer. I ordered this book to be delivered to my beach vacation, and waited anxiously for it to appear. Although the Clancy-style is there, the story line isn't polished enough for a writer of his caliber. Repetitive phrases are distracting and none of the characters (including Ryan)have the depth they had in previous books. I do recommend the book if you're a fan already, but if you're not, then start back at the beginning of his books, with the Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Overall, better than Rainbow Six (by a long shot), but I actually liked Executive Orders better. No matter, it's still decent Clancy, which means intricate plotting, lots of modern high tech, good action (when it finally gets going), and politics that will annoy the liberals. Don't let the 1000 pages fool you; it's a pretty quick read, and a lot more satisfying than most of the other thick tomes out there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If your like me, you've read every Clancy book out there and so have I. But unfortunately he has set a standard that is hard for even him to meet every time. And this time he has not met it. The basic plot is interesting (the Chinese are the predicable bad guys here), but this being his longest book ever, I found little character development here. What I mean is that what I enjoyed in the Jack Ryan series is that each book went further to explore Ryan and all the central characters (to include are favorites: Clark and Chavze). But not this time. I did not find myself interested in the characters, they even introduced some new one, then hey...where did they go? All in all, if you are loyal you'll read this one and his next. I just hope it has the excitement of Debt of Honor or Rainbow 6. This one was more like Sum of all fear, but not that good. Sorry Tom, time for new blood (i.e., maybe little Jack joins the Marines to follow his old mans foot steps or something like that)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I agree with T. Drizzle almost word for word. I found itlong-winded and - well- boring! More superficial than Sum and less entertaining than Rainbow. I thought he glossed over sections that needed attention and poured pages into things that had no bearing on the story.I read for fun and relaxation and this was neither. Maybe Clancy suffers from too much success, since his other books were so well done, but without the Clancy name and reputation, I would have put this one down after the first slow 500 pages. In retrospect, I should have.I have read and own all the Clancy titles, but my next Cancy will come from the Library...Does anyone know a current author that writes like Clancy used to write? I guess it is time to move on...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's latest is true to form. For diehard fans of JackRyan, John Clark and other Clancy characters, The Bear and The Dragon is a must read. Clancy flawlessly develops his intricate plot from multiple angles and the use of techno-speak is just enough to be factual without actually becoming an annoyance. The book is quite a long read at 1000+ pages, but its hard to put down nonetheless. Don't plan on buying it unless you have a little freetime! A couple minor criticisms arise from the several typo's I found while reading the book (editor's fault?) and a more racial slant in describing the villian of the book, China. While the Soviet villains of yesteryear's Clancy novels were easy enough to hate for their ideology and actions, I don't really find it necessary to throw in racial stereotypes to make a convincing villian. But, as I said, these are minor criticisms and I anxiously await another Clancy novel after devouring this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I remember the &quot;good old days&quot; when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In classic Clancy style, The Bear and the Dragon weaves a varied story on the front end, only to tie them all together by the time we turn the last page.The action begins with an assassination by rocket propelled grenade. The catch is that the intended target is not completely clear. True to form, Clancy moves from there and creates the framework for the &quot;backside&quot; of his story.During his development of the story, he explores the political reality of rationalizing the actions of nations using our own notions of right and wrong. The complexities of this task become evident as heads of state fall short of the mark in anticipating the actions of their adversaries. This effort finds itself arriving at a time when the nature of relations with China is evolving... from espionage to most favored nation status... its hard to go through a day without hearing some news relating to China. This fiction finds itself fiting well into the todays news.The only complaint I might have to level at this work is that the ending seemed to abrupt. But this is a small concern when considering the entire work.If your in the mood for hard hiting action, I would suggest taking a look at Rainbow Six or Debt of Honor before picking up this 1000+ page tome. But if your into the kind of story that Clancy weaves that builds to a final climax, this is the book for you.In closing, I find it difficult to set aside time for pleasure reading. Most books of this size would take months to read as I eek out a few minutes a day or even in the week to take in a few more pages. However, in this case, all other lifely pursuits had to take a back seat in order for me to finish it in 3 days. If you have found Clancy as addictive as I have in the past, you may want to put off starting this book until you've cleared those improtant projects off your schedule... if you don't this book will do it for you!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you are looking for literary art, don't buy this book. On the other hand, if you are just looking for an action-packed 1000-page book that you can waste a couple of afternoons on, this is the right book for you, unless you are one of those politically correct people who can't even think of reading non-PC material. I skipped through about 25% of the book because some of his &quot;let me show you how much military-techno stuff I know&quot; details got to be too tedious and boring but I compare this to the use of the fast-forward button when viewing a straight-to-video action flick featuring Jean Claude Van Damme."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Another great Jack Ryan book from Tome Clancy. A page turner of a book that almost made me lose my job because I was up so late reading it. Tom Clancy brings out the best of many things in a book that brings to the reader many of the characters of his three previous &quot;Ryan&quot; novels.The presence that President Ryan describes as he visits Auschwitz is the same one I, and others I have talked to, had when I visited Dachau.Overall an intense, readable, suspenseful novel that makes me want to buy the next one as soon as it comes out."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"WOW just finished what a book.. Fast moving from the start and wildly entertaining!! Tom Clancy at his best. This book kept me glued to the pages could hardly put it down!! Way to go Tom!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is demeaning to all Chinese, female and male. In Mr. Clancy's book, all Chinese men are sadistic, simple-minded, and evil. All Chinese women are willing to do anything for western goods and money. All American officials and military personnel are extremely casual in using racial terms and profanity. It is obvious Mr. Clancy lives in a world vastly different than this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon by Tom Clancy is another well written Jack Ryan story. In this story Jack Ryan becomes President of the United States and things go downhill from there for Ryan.The book starts out typically for a Clancy novel... slowly and methodically. Clancy builds the story over the first two-thirds of the book working the reader through pitfalls, antiterrorism, conspiracies and international government intrigue.Ryan has found out that being President is not all it's cracked up to be as the world economy is going to hell in a handbasket. Russia finds gold in Siberia, China is fostering terrorism and is wreaking havoc world-wide. As suspense builds to a climax, the world will never be the same again.Clancy works the characters to a belief of realism and the techo-babble is plausable. Audaciously authentic, written with the world true-to-life scenerio that could be applied today. All in all, a story that becomes very interesting after you read the Clancy setup, so you get a book that really is one-third of the impressive 1000+ pages.Clancy does write a lot of profanity and we could do with a little less, but otherwise the tale is told well... Clancy does well with this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is excellent. He has done an excellent job of researching cool information and put it to a very good use in his writing. The book is so convincing and full of factual info (although I don't know how accurate they are) that it hooks right on to you till the end of the book. Although I do think that the ending could've been better... Well, definitely worth every dollar if you're into this genre of literature."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A Russian intelligence official is the target of a deadly assasination attempt in Moscow....A vast new oil field is discovered in the remote expanses of Siberia....In Beijing, an ambitious minister and a large faction of China's People's Liberation Army plot an ambitious invasion of a seemingly weakened Russian Republic....In Washington, D.C., President John Patrick Ryan and his administration must find out who is behind the plot to kill Sergei Golovko, a former KGB official and erstwhile rival (now friend) of Ryan's from his days in the CIA. When the resulting Russo-American investigation points to Chinese operatives who want to weaken Russia's intelligence services, everyone starts wondering: why? And when the pieces of the puzzle start falling in place, American and Russian forces scramble to defend Siberia and its natural resources from an act of naked aggression by the People's Republic of China.Tom Clancy's tenth novel, The Bear and Dragon, returns to the arena of large-scale conventional warfare. While at times Clancy's conservative agenda becomes grating, as a piece of speculative fiction it works.The Bear and the Dragon also ties up some leftover narrative threads from Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, and Rainbow Six. The &quot;heavy&quot; is that mysterious Chinese minister, Zhang Han Sen, who was a shadowy force behind America's war with Japan and the subsequent Persian Gulf war between the U.S. and the United Islamic Republic. Also returning for a repeat engagement is the young CIA field officer Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Nomura. Long-time Clancy supporting cast members John Clark, &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez, Ed and Mary Pat Foley, Bart Mancuso, and Robert &quot;Robby&quot; Jackson join President Ryan as he faces one of the worst crises the world has known since the end of the Cold War.Despite its length and sometimes heavy-handed preachiness about what Clancy perceives as China's worst human right excesses, The Bear and the Dragon still entertains. I prefer Red Storm Rising, Clancy's World War III classic, but this novel is never boring and, near the end, gets downright spellbinding."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The main thrust of Clancy's latest novel depicts a conflict over Siberian resources between China, Russia and the USA. This part of the book contains all the combat action we have come to expect from this great author and more. It is undoubtable that the last section of the book that deals with the war itself is his most masterful piece of writing yet. I would certainly have liked to see this expanded to take up a greater section of the book at the expense of shortening some of the sidestories that are a hallmark of Clancy's novels, because I particularly enjoy the author's descriptions of military action, but those readers who prefer the build up phases will be happy with the allocation of the bookspace. Overall, this is an excellent book that I would highly recommend to any fan of Tom Clancy and it has the added benefit of identifying what may very well become a point of conflict in the future."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"LIKESI liked this book for the same reason I like his other books. The suspense, the detail, the espionage (sorry about the spelling), and the technical aspects. I also like Ryan's reluctant hero character. This book has all these things and I found it entertaining. Some people may not like the \\"good guy versus bad guy\\" storyline, calling it simplistic. I think that there's room in one's reading for a simply good guy versus bad guy story. Not everything's black and white, but not everything is grey either.Like his other books, I could barely put this book down. I was constantly wondering what would happen next. The characters were o.k., but it was the story that just kept sucking me in.Clancy's books don't portrey the world as it is, but they do a marvelous job at portreying the world as it might be. The personal rapport between President's Putin and Bush, and Russia's oil deposites have helped us move much closer to Russia over the past year. Could Russia and the U.S. become close commercial and military allies? Could China's economy be pushed to the brink by a serious of bad decisions and bad luck? Could China and the U.S. come close to fighting a war or actually fight a war with each other? Clancy gives us a plausable scenario of how these things might come to pass.I liked the fact that Clancy brought to light some of the egregious individual rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese goverment. I think that his description of the Chinese leaders was probably too simplistic and an exaggerated portrait of their faults, but this book doesn't claim to be an in depth study of Chinese politburo dynamics. The PRC has done a good job of convincing the world that it's just one big happy family. A nation that forces women to have abortions and that outlaws religeon is not a nice nation. I think it's nice that Clancy hasn't forgotten that Russia and the Middle East aren't the only potential hot spots in the world.A lot of reviewers here seem to dislike Clancy's politics. Personally, I like his politics and I think these other reviewers should grow up a little. I've had to read literally dozens of books that were liberal/left-wing. Some were fiction, others were fiction passed off as fact or non-fiction. I think he should have toned down the politics a little, but Clancy's not the first artist to incorporate his political views and biases into his works.DISLIKESI thought America's final battle with the Chinese seemed to be won too easily. One \\"smart pig\\" can take out an entire mechanized division? That seemed a little too incredible. A war with China would be messy and costly. He should have portreyed it with a few more American + Russian casualties.I also think that Clancy should put more effort into developing his characters a little more. Jack Ryan, VPOTUS Robbi Jackson, and a number of other minor characters seem to talk, think, and act the same. This is a problems that can be found in most of Clancy's other \\"Jack Ryan\\" novels. It would be nice if he made some progress in having more diverse (in thoughts and mannerisms, not in the PC sense) characters. This just shows that Clancy is not Tolstoy or Jane Austin, although IMO he's 100 times more enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"this is the end of the road for my reading this man's work. it was to long filled with stuffer and unintresting. the continued use of four or five names for ryan all on the same page sometimes not only felt backward but disjointed. somepages required rereading just to figure out who was being writen about potus, ryan ,jack, president ryan, swordsman as far as i can tell all these descriptions for the same character make the reading difficult. not to mention unenjoyable, as i have enjoyed all the other books (they are slowing down with the last couple)dull dull dull"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If I wrote 1000 pages of hash and rehash, I would be so tired I would probably have come up with as lame an ending as this one.

One thing I know for sure now is that T.C. does like a smoke (big no-no) every now and then. He does not endorse tree-huggers too much (medium no-no), but he likes a sip of smooth vodka if the time is right (who doesn't). Well, we all know that the most Russkies are good chaps with big hearts most of the time - there are exceptions of course - and that Red low-tech hard- and software is not quite up to the standards. But this could be corrected with a little help from the right guys, couldn't it? One other thing we all know is not to trust the Chinese too much. (Secretaries: Be alert and always know to tell the right saugage from the wrong one!) Once you did the first half of the book - this takes time - the plot starts accelerating. After the climax the quick and dirty end left me kind of unsatisfied. Is T.C. running out of good plots? Has he covered it all in his previous books? I hope some real highlights are still to come! ;-)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm afraid, no, I know, Tom Clancy is slipping. He's been my favorite fiction author since 1984, and even part of the reason I'm in my current job. However, for the last few installments, his work has been slipping, and with &quot;Bear&quot; he's finally over the precipice. As many other reviewers mention, the plot is recycled, and to me the portrayal of the Chinese antagonists is jingoistic at best, if not outright racist (not that I think the PRC government is on our side, but I simply expected a better work from Clancy--his analysis of the Russian mindset had so much more to it). In addition, his reputation was made on his excruciating attention to detail, and this appears to be slipping as well. I could go on and on . . . The four star rating for comparison to other authors; on a Clancy-only scale I'd give it about a 2."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom, what the heck happened here?

Whether or not you put out an interesting novel, please don't insult your devoted fans with typos and other editing nonsense (virtually the same sentence 2x in the same paragraph).I think we deserve a refund or an explanation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Another country, another senseless conflict. In the past three &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; books, we have seen the US fight battles between Japan, a fictitious union of Iraq and Iran, and in Clancy's latest book, China. The formula that Clancy has dreamed up is getting increasingly boring. He is having to dream up insane courses of events that cause the US to do battle with a yet another enemy, thus allowing him to write another marathon, over-detailed, I-skip-ever-other-page kinda book. Clancy must think really poorly of the political ideologies and cultures of these countries in order to have the nerve to dream up some of the dialog that goes on in these books. Either that or he is cocky enough to believe that America is top-dog in every way, shape, and form.Jack Ryan, a once enjoyable and well respected character, was taken to previously unapproached levels in The Bear and The Dragon. Clancy has turned a once decisive hero into a bumbling weenie who whines about being President, and relies on the his underlings to perform his presidential duties for him. The only dialog spewed from Ryan's mouth falls along the lines of &quot;I didn't ask to be put in this position&quot; or &quot;Why is being President so hard, Arnie?&quot; What people learned to love about Jack Ryan in Red October and Patriot Games (and all books since) has been ruined.In my humble (and often stupid) opinion, Clancy should hang up his hat as far as the Jack Ryan chronicles are concerned. The formula is tired, and the latest books are a challenge to read. A little less pointless detail and a lot more plot couldn't hurt either.Man, I'm disappointed...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read all of Clancy's previous works, but this will be the last. Similar to Rainbow Six, this book could be made at least 200 pages shorter by editing out Clancy's rambling political pontifications. Clancy suffers from the extremely naive notion that unfettered capitalism will solve all the world's ills (tell that to people riding on Firestone Tires). Sadly for the reader, Clancy feels compelled to fill this book with an endless diatribe of Limbaugh-esque gibberish. If you must read this book, prepare to skip over pages of propaganda to find the story. It must be in there somewhere."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Seems like each book that TC comes out with becomes more and more of an op ed piece for him than a novel for readers to enjoy. If you're a real TC fan, you'll probably want to go out and buy this book right away. Let me make a suggestion - wait for the paperback edition so you'll save some money. And, on the off chance you might spend some time at your local bookstore reading parts of this book, ask yourself, &quot;Do I even want to buy this when it comes out on paperback?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book reveals Clancy's complete ignorance of any country's military abilities or geopolitical strategy. The only thing he seems to know is a smattering of facts about US force details and hardware. Not reccomended for anyone looking for any realism"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In the middle of the book, i took some time and read some of the other reviews here to see what i was getting myself into by reading this book. The beginning was RATHER slow, and i found myself skipping over some of the more techno-jargon that i didn't really think i needed to know to enjoy the book. That being the case, not reading those sections, didn't hinder my enjoyment reading another good book by mr. clancy. however, i would recommend to anyone who reads this to re-read &quot;Executive Order&quot; and *maybe* &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Debt of Honor.&quot; Since it had been a while since i had read those books, i found myself scouring my brain to remember the correct circumstances the characters were referring to. With all of that said--the last 100-200 pages move like lightening and are very exciting. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read everything written by Tom Clancy to date, including the collaborations with other authors. I am wondering if he gave the authorship of this book to one of them. His writing of late, especially this book, has been very below par for him. Was completely bored with Jack Ryan and his whining. His seduction scenes read like a clinical study. The investigation in Russia read as an ringing endorsement for the FBI. Nor did he at any point tie in Bart Mancuso, and Robbie Johnson. What did they do? What intergral part did they have in any of this if at all. All right Clark and Chavez came on the scene but did absolutely nothing to aid the Russians. Only as observers. Give me a break when I was first introduced to these two characters and subsequently reading about them, they have always been men of action. I understand about Clark getting older and wiser, but Chavez is still young. I was eagerly anticpating this new novel, was happy when it was given to me. Began immediately to devour it, but after the first few hundred pages had to put it down for it was leaving a very bad taste in my mouth. Mr. Clancy please go back to doing what has made you a very highly praised author. Bring back the Machiavellian and suspenseful plots."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Exciting solid story that's believable and potential; I wish he'd get help when writing dialogue for women."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read the first few pages: Russian pimp gets blown up by a rocket launcher right next he Kremlin. Yeah, lets buy it! Page 800: Chinese will invade Russia, America will help Russia and naturally just manage to win with their high tech stuff. Why did it take 800 long pages to get to that point. In Clear and Present Danger I didn't know how he was going to make the action last 600 pages, but an Introduction lasting 800? Waste of time. This is NOT the famous Clancy we know and love, but a shadow of his former self."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is not a very good writer. I'm not sure he ever really was. He could come up with a story, though. But now he seems to have dispensed with the skills of an editor and allowed Jack Ryan to become his ultra conservative spokesperson. And without a credible story, this book is thoroughly disappointing. Demeaning to the Chinese and women, and with most of the characters thoroughly undeveloped and one dimensional, the 1000 pages become a strain. As usual, Clancy characters don't have conversations, they lecture each other instead. And they drink coffee. Lots of it. Anyone with a lot of time on their hands might use it to figure out just how many cups of coffee have been downed in all the Clancy books put together. It would be more interesting than this foul mouthed, misogynistic and racist bunkum."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, I admit that I've read every novel Clancy has written. (God help me.) But they have gotten progressively worse, and this latest, Bear and the Dragon, is so bad it is insulting to the reader. It is monumentally ignorant, and the only thing worse than the writing is the editing. (Was there any editing?) All of the characters -- regardless of nationality or position -- speak in the same tiresome, moralistic, pseudo-chummy voice. The same phrases (....&quot;that fellow&quot;...) must appear in the book at least a hundred times. The cartoonish quality of the characters and the dialogue is nothing new, but there is little to none of the military/espionage nitty-gritty detail that made his earliest novels a success.The book is a complete waste of time, and the only reason its on the best-seller list is because of the sheer momentum of Clancy's name. It won't be lasting much longer if he puts out more like this.If you have to have a Clancy fix, go back and read Red October."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not even finished with the book, but felt compelled to write an online review. I have read all (except Rainbox Six) of Clancy's books and thoroughly enjoyed them and passed them along. If the character's names were changed and someone had asked me to read this book and tell them who wrote it, Tom Clancy would not have come to mind. I have always loved the fact that Mr. Clancy wrote exciting books, that didn't have all the language and sex in them that this one did. I sincerely hope this is not a new trend. I can't pass this one along...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A tedious book to read. Unlike anything else I've seen by Clancy. He takes whole chapters to say what could be said (more entertainingly) in a paragraph.

I can already feel the disappointment welling up inside of me as I thumb through the negative reviews -- all of which I expected. When TC made an airplane crash into the Capitol Building, I thought he'd lost it. His subsequent novels proved it, and I disliked each successive work more and more.Whatever happened to the strategy and suspense of Red Storm Rising (my first TC read) and Hunt for Red October? TC, are you just an angry conservative now? Using your publisher to express your views? Have you picked up on the fact that, DUH -- no one has turned one of your novels into a movie since Patriot Games? Do you visit Amazon.com and READ the reviews by real people?Sounds like readers are suggesting you go out and stand by the water like you do in your book photograph. Take off the hat and bomber jacket. Jump in. Take Jack Ryan with you. While you're drowning in the depths of your failing career, I'll find a better book to buy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm one of Clancy's biggest fans, but now only of his earlier work. Tom seems to take himself too seriously, each of his recent five or six books was a disappointment to me. The Bear and the Dragon has a great premise (China invades Russia, the US helps out). But it's about 400 pages until anything HAPPENS. Actually, there are only a couple dozen interesting pages in the book. The great story teller needs to get back to his roots and tell good stories."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read every other real Clancy book multiple times. (Real as opposed to those &quot;Op Center&quot; rip-offs) His latest is going to stay in like new condition. By the time I finished it I wanted my money back ...and my copy was a gift. The most racist, chauvinist, gratuitously profane and schizophrenic mess I have ever waded through.The good news is that it worked better than Sominex or Nytol."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a big Tom Clancy fan. I have read all his books and have enjoyed everyone of them until now. The first 800 pages ramble and the final 200 are plain silly.

We are spoiled."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was looking forward to reading the newest Clancy novel. Most of the time I can't put it down but this one I could. There is hardly any action in this book. Most of his books have been action packed. We also get to read about Clancy's views on abortion. This book is not worth the money. Wait till you can get it at an used book store."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am so disappointed. Meaningless pornographic sex, nedless swear words galore, endless preaching (literally, in some cases) and almost no action. Ugh. What happened to the story, the drama, the action? Almost no one does anything but whine and complain. Diplomats, president, field agent. Doesn't matter who the character is, no one is happy anymore and they've all lost their zest to do their jobs. I was very excited to get my hands on this book, and then it actually took several trys to get even a couple of chapters into it. I nearly stopped reading it several times. I just didn't expect to have to work that hard to get to the good stuff. Looks like Mr. Clancy is writing for the paycheck and getting paid by the word to do it. What a letdown."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy likes to write them thick (1028 pages) this one is very slow up to about page 350 or so then gets pretty good. The ending takes up only one short chapter though and I would like the excitement to last a little longer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I intended to write a lengthy diatribe but had second thoughts as I would be saying nothing more than is contained in the other reviews on this site. Yet I am compelled to add a few thoughts, it appears to me that this book was hastily assembeled from a collection of disparate short stories and then clumbsily woven together. Making matters worse is incredibly poor job of editing the material for example in one passage one reads &quot;tax&quot; where its obvious that Fax was intended- Was anything more than &quot;SpellCheck&quot; used? In &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;,Tom Clancy was justifiably praised for his research, yet in &quot;The B &amp; D&quot; it is claimed that Jack Ryan brought out a security with the symbol SALC as an IPO out on the Big Board. The problem with this is that stock symbols on the Big Board are limited to a maximum of three characters. Four character symbols are used in the OTC market, NASDAQ. So much for research!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was much too ponderous. It was a chore to read it all the way through. I've read all of Clancy's novels, and this was the worst, even exceeding Rainbow Six. It was as if he cut and pasted dialog and scenes from his other novels to make up the first 700 pages of this one. It was deja vu, with all the same characters, and all their same viewpoints. I don't recommend it for anyone, and I won't suckered into buying the next one. Goodbye Tom."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am not sure what to say that hasn't been covered by the 500+ other reviews out here, but I'll throw in my two cents.I am a big fan of Clancy's books, by that I mean ones he actually writes not the ones he just puts his name on like Op-Center and Power Plays. However, his last few have followed a certain formula in that if you can somehow trudge through the first half of the book the payoff at the end justifies the effort. The bad thing is that Bear and the Dragon makes those first 500 pages tougher than any of his other books.Perhaps it is because for the past 6 months we have been bombarded with presidential election related messages already, but this book just preaches and preaches on problems related to the Presidency and policy related issues. As many people have stated out here, Clancy just puts Ryan in policy conversations so he can tell us all how Ryan (aka Clancy) would fix them with just some common sense if only the politicians would let him. It is somewhat entertaining the first few times it happens, but by the 30th it is tedious.I'll admit that I found that you could sense a tone change in the book each time Tom was about to go on one of his not so subtle commentaries, and since they had nothing to do with the story I would just skip them. It did make the book go faster.I'll stick with Tom, but he really needs to cut down the length of these books and go back to the 400-500 page turner style from Red October. For some reason he thinks each book must be bigger and grander than the previous. Also, Jack Ryan has to be a more influential character in the government in each book. CIA Analyst, Deputy Director CIA, National Security Advisor, President (appointed VP then assuming Presidnecy), and finally elected President. I guess in the next book he will be some form of Deity."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After being a Clancy fan for a more years than I wish to remember, I was ecstatic at the prospect of another blockbuster novel. While the plot plods along at a snail's pace, one expects it to pick up tempo through the novel as does many of his other works. However, the big disappointment and linguistic &quot;slap in the face&quot; is his prolific use of vulgarities throughout the novel. This seems to be a new Clancy, with new and needless usage of vulgar language that seems to have little reason other than shock value. Indeed, one is reading along and suddenly is confronted phrases of &quot;f&quot; this, or &quot;mf&quot; that, that derails the reader from the story. I hope Mr. Clancy reads this and reconsiders using such language to such an extent in the future. It's not that we don't know that it exists, it's just hard to imagine it exists at such a voluminous variety and with such rapidity."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's books in this series. This one was something of a disappointment. From the outset, he uses Jack Ryan's thoughts and speeches to preach social conservative agenda items. I don't disagree with those items nor do I strongly agree with them but he should have toned it down some. For example, in several passages abortion is brought up. The story was predictable but slow to develop. Ther was also a problem with incomplete story lines. The Rainbow Six team at first seemed to be a primary part of the story but actually played a small role. All that aside, it was good to see what happened to Jack Ryan after the last book. I look forward to the next one in this series."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It cannot be coincidence that this is an election year! Clancy uses this book more as a right-wing political statement than as as an entertaining story. Yes, one can predict and expect the usual military-macho stuff, but one cannot tolerate the endless ideological musings that ruin the flow of the whole story. This book is basically a rant that is anti abortion, pro religion, anti gun control, anti liberal (referring to politicians who levy taxes as wanting to 'suck the blood' out of the country's citizens), anti Clinton, and so on. Mr. Clancy, you need to stick to what you do best. Hint: it's not politics.Oh, and by the way, the language in this book is unnecessarily foul. Tom Clancy seems to be caught in the same trap as Stephen King, thinking that coarse, sexually-explicit language is a way to build up the characters in his story. He seems to use this to try to make his characters appear to be 'regular guys'...and fails miserably."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read all of Clancy's books, excluding the paperback series. Progressively they haved grown longer and more tedious. I don't know that I would even read the next. I was very dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had high hopes when I picked up this new Jack Ryan book. I've already learned that Tom Clancy occasionally loans his name out to hacks (the Op Center series), and that he &quot;co-authors&quot; uneven and misguided books like _A Study in Command_. But here, at last, was a real Clancy.No, it's not, in the true sense of the term.Technical and grammatical mistakes abound. On page 505, he not only USES the word &quot;fungible&quot; incorrectly, but he has his character go out of his way to DEFINE it incorrectly. &quot;Fungible&quot; means &quot;replaceable by a similar item,&quot; such as one boxcar of wheat which can be replaced by another boxcar of wheat. Clancy incorrectly writes that &quot;fungible&quot; means &quot;re-usable,&quot; such as when a gold ornament is re-melted into a new item.A Johns Hopkins doctor wrongly advises a pregnant woman she can, without any risk to the fetus, take &quot;two drinks tonight to celebrate. After that, one or two a week.&quot;Clancy goes deeper into the repeated use of base sexual profanity, explicit sex, and racial stereotyping. He closes the book with a sexual reference. He goes even more rhapsodic with the deification of the &quot;warrior.&quot;Despite the glory of the warrior, Clancy's President Jack Ryan is disappointing to those who knew Jack before. President Ryan tends to shoot from the hip in making major policy decisions. He &quot;borrows&quot; cigarettes like a teenager every chance he gets -- to the point one thinks Clancy is getting paid by the cigarette industry to glorify their product. President Ryan allows the use of racial slurs in the Oval Office.Even worse, this President Ryan is irresponsible. Near the end of the book, at a time of grave danger when presidential leadership may be most needed, Jack not only intentionally places himself in a physically dangerous place, but out of effective contact with the government and people. He just _has to_ be back with his warrior buddies, and invite them all &quot;to the White House, right now, for some drinks on the house.... 'I might be drunk before you get there,' the President thought. And sure enough, with an international crisis still on-going, Jack calls a buddy and announces &quot;How about you and me drain a bottle of something?&quot; and proceeds to get &quot;about half in the bag by this time, and if the media found out about it, the hell with them.... 'That,' Ryan thought, 'calls for another drink.'&quot;It's one thing for a President to get a little high, and quite another thing to do so intentionally when there's an obvious international crisis to deal with.The whole tone of this book suggests that Clancy is laughing at his loyal readers. &quot;Put the name Clancy on the cover, and they'll buy it,&quot; I imagine him smirking. If Clancy continues this way, he'll discover he's managed to trash his name with the reading public."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After following Clancy's early books with enthusiasm, I've found his more recent books to be lacking in story content. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; has hit bottom for me - I gave up after 350 pages!While the story potential is great, Clancy seems to have devoted only about 50% of this book to the basic story. The remaining 50% is divided between moralizing and strutting his knowledge of international and military affairs. I've read his books for the great stories, and his moralizing leaves me feeling cheated and mislead. I don't want to pay for a book just to listen to his personal moral concepts."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"1,000 pages? After I read 500 of them, I checked out the customer reviews and found that all but the most die-hard and blindly loyal Clancy fans pretty much panned the book. How I wish I had read them before I burdened the poor UPS man with delivering these pounds of pages.Clancy was never a creative, subtle novelist. He's a storyteller, and he has a history of being a good one. But my head is sore from his hitting me over the head with each of his beliefs, one or two of which I actually agree with (Well, one).If you want this book, don't buy it. You can have mine (only slightly used)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr. Clancy is lucky he wrote such good books at the beginning of his career, because he's trained us to go out and buy the latest one as soon as possible. This latest effort (?), with its lack of editing, decline of favorite characters (Jack Ryan as &quot;The Whiner&quot;), and less than subtle soapboxing, is the book that breaks me of this habit."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom we love you but get an editor. The page count could be cut 40% and not miss a beat. The battle scenes were mostly boring, alot of repetitive dialogue and the interesting character's that were introduced were never fully developed. What happened to Ettore and the pelt guy? I agree with most other reviewers-should have cut the middle and increased the ending. As a Clancy fan I will continue to read the series, but it's not so much fun anymore. ps- If another character says 'duly noted' again I will scream."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Unlike Tom Clancy's previous works, The Bear and the Dragon falls way short of the standard that fans have come to expect from him. His potrayal of the average PRC Chinese is accurate -if the book was set in the early 80s. Many racist remarks are sprinkled throughout the book, making a boring product offensive as well. Give it a miss and spend your money somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is really long and rather tedious. Tom Clancy needs an editor! His attention to detail is really slipping. Here are two small examples: he describes the language of China as &quot;Guoyu&quot; which is what Chinese is called on Taiwan. In China, everyone calls it &quot;putonghua;&quot; he also mentions a U.S. Navy port call to Taipei. Taipei is not a port but is ten miles from the sea. Taiwan's main ports are Keelung and Kaohsiung. In general, Clancy appears to have never visited China and so describes a mainland culture that is sadly out of date."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When the next adventure in the Jack Ryan story came out, I couldn't wait. I had to get it and read it now. Boy was I disappointed. Jack Ryan stopped being a really interesting guy about two books ago. Yes, I love what Jack Ryan stands for as a character, and yes, the story of his rise to the presidency of the USA is one of the good guys finally winning. But I think, Tom Clancy finally went too far with this character. There wasn't even that much military exposition in this book and I could see the ending coming from miles away. None of the excitement of &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;. None of the geo-political underpinnings of &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. I doubt very much the reactions some of the countries in this book take on the situation around them. The actions of China in &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; made sense. Here? They are just fluff for the 1,000+ pages of discussion of conservative right wing agenda, and while some of that agenda is commendable, 1,000+ pages of it finally &quot;grates&quot; on you. I think Tom Clancy has missed the target on the coming &quot;geo-political&quot; situation. For a more thoroughly entertaining (and informative) novel about a similar situation I highly recommend &quot;The War in 2020&quot; by Ralph Peters."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As usual with Clancy novels the book is replete with action and lots of details indicating that, in at least some areas-military for example-the auhor has done his homework. However Mr Clancy is way out of touch when it comes to life in China-his characterization of Chinese women as poorly dressed and with lousy hairstyles, dressed in boiler suits is so out of date its almost funny. He characterizes women in China in the same way Americans used to characterize Russian women and he's way off base as anyone who has been to China would tell him. I also have the feeling its about time he found a new series-this series on Jack Ryan reminds me of a similar series by Allen Drury-originally very interesting but becoming increasingly less believable and mired in right wing ideology. Find a new subject Tom."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's latest is true to form. For diehard fans of JackRyan, John Clark and other Clancy characters, The Bear and The Dragon is a must read. Clancy flawlessly develops his intricate plot from multiple angles and the use of techno-speak is just enough to be factual without actually becoming an annoyance. The book is quite a long read at 1000+ pages, but its hard to put down nonetheless. Don't plan on buying it unless you have a little freetime! A couple minor criticisms arise from the several typo's I found while reading the book (editor's fault?) and a more racial slant in describing the villian of the book, China. While the Soviet villains of yesteryear's Clancy novels were easy enough to hate for their ideology and actions, I don't really find it necessary to throw in racial stereotypes to make a convincing villian. But, as I said, these are minor criticisms and I anxiously await another Clancy novel after devouring this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In essence, if the reader has read Clancey's prior efforts, the reader has already read The Bear and the Dragon. It is time for Clancey to move on to a new theme or re-kindle his plot development skills shown in The Cardinal in the Kremlin.Sadly, each story line reaches a conclusion hundreds of pages after the conclusion is evident to the reader. This has not been the case in previous Clancey efforts.As to the publisher, it would be nice if they hired a proof-reader for Mr. Clancey's next book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Somewhere in these 1,000 pages there is a decent 250 page book trying to get out. A sentence here, a paragraph there. The problem is that we gotta read the whole thing to get the little that is there. A wonderful job of padding by Mr. Clancey. And phew, do real people cuss as much as these guys do?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is getting lazy. Many times in TBATD different characters make identical observations or comments --looks like Tom's got the Copy and Paste functions sorted out on his Macintosh. The editing also leaves much to be desired. The manuscript was obviously passed through a spell checker, but there were lots of word-choice and grammatical errors that interrupted the flow of things.Others have also commented on the abrupt ending and it's true that for a book of over 1,000 pages, the ending seemed quite clipped.Overall, I enjoyed The Bear and the Dragon, but for Clancy it was a middling effort. I am also praying that Jack Ryan is done being such a whiner and complainer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a good basic story, classic clancy, and a nice continuation of the Jack Ryan saga. Excellent use of existing trade and economic relationships to make the story and reality sync up. I think its the weakest of the group though, it reads as though it was written a chapter at a time, with some sloppy editing. Reading the same chunks of dialog used by the same groups of people 4-5 times in a row gets a bit distracting, and since this comes up several different times in clearly intended comments on contemporary politics, very tiresome as well."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The overall plot of the book is very similar to Clancy&iexcl;s previous work, Red Storm Raising. The causes of the conflict are the same; the parts about wars are similar, with the side that has American in always have the air supremacy and better intelligence. Even the bad guys&iexcl; desperate attempt at victory is similar, except in this book they get much closer than in Red Storm Raising. This conflict, however, only takes up the last quarter of the book. For the first 600+ pages, Clancy carefully construct events that will eventually lead to this conflict. This part of the book has the feeling of The Cardinal of Kremlin, but without the more detail part of the spy-operation. The book is good at both part, but both of these have been done in greater detail before. The book doesn&iexcl;t add much new things to these two major themes.The book is also filled with parts that describe the character in excess amount of detail. Some of the detail does have some importance later on, but most of them are just repeat of events that happened in other previous novel. This isn&iexcl;t necessary a bad thing for people who just start reading about Tom Clancy&iexcl;s novel, but it interrupt the tempo of the story for us who have read all other books that leading up to this one.Still, the book manages to be interesting in the first part and exciting in the second, so it&iexcl;s still worth the time of reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's fans will no doubt read this and enjoy it.It is, however, not one of his better efforts.While the plot is fast paced, the story did not grab me the way his previous books did.Sometimes, not churning books out so fast would be the better way to go."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a good book with an expansive plot that Mr. Clancy manages to keep moving along fairly well. I thought the book drug a little bit prior to page 450 or so, then picked up pretty well after that. I believe also that somebody new to Mr. Clancy would enjoy the book moreso than I did, as I got a strong sense of deja vu while reading it. In my opinion, this book followed the same main plot as his last two (i.e. somebody big and bad needs put in their place by the US), with only the details and the enemy to differentiate it from Debt of Honor and Executive Orders. My biggest concern is that it has too many appearances of characters from previous Clancy books to the point of being distracting. The one new character (the Italian policeman in Rainbow) was interesting, and I wish there could have been a little more development of him. I also think the ending was a bit too convenient, as if suddenly the book had to be wrapped up. Mr. Clancy might be well served to pare down his next effort, perhaps changing to a different universe of characters and reality. Still, a good effort that I'd recommend to others."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a big Clancy fan who has read every one of his books. This one has too much build up to too little climax for me. I found myself skipping over pages to read for more interesting passages..this I almost never do with a Clancy novel. I love Jack Ryan..but I don't think I would vote for him based on his handling of this crisis..which he makes worse at every turn.. The best character was Robby..and maybe he ought to be the next preseident while Jack goes home and becomes a house father and Cathy runs for the senate in new York!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Until Sept. 11, our country, especially its national media sources, were full of contempt for patriotism. Now that we have been attacked, we are united again, and the country's citizens are showing the media the true spirit and heart of the country: love for God, love for country, and gratitude for both.Tom Clancy's latest novel is perfect for this time. It shows the greatness of our nation: military might combined with passion for those who love freedom and democracy. I almost hope what Clancy has written comes to pass, for my experience with the Russian people is not unlike Clancy's: appreciation for their greatness, marred by too many years of despotism. May a revolution come soon to China, so that their great people can bask in the blessings that other free peoples enjoy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was Clancy's worst book. Yeah, I didn't want to put it down - it was gripping - but it was wholly unsatisfying. It was simply too fanciful. The good guys got ALL the breaks (to a sickening extent) and the bad guys could do nothing right."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used this book to pass the time driving 2 hours back and forth to Houston. It was entertaining, but surprisingly simple and formulaic. If you just want some entertainment and pure emotional response, it's ok, but the book really lacks in depth."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is one the best writers of our era, and his long list of books (not the collaborration series: Netforce and Op Center), are worthy of reading if you like political fiction and evil, if not almost realistic, plots spanning the world. I say almost realistic, because if they were true to every law of nature, the story would be about as fun to read as reading a government print manual. If you read every Clancy book until now, read this one, you owe yourself to it. Unfortuanetly, the plot does become a little repetitive with Jack saying how much he loves his job, but they are excusable, and those who scan everything piece of text looking for all those little 'microfaults' probably not that big of Clancy fans, as this books is like all his others. Just read it and take it for what is is."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I do not understand why people say that Tom Clancy is making the whole China culture to be a bad guy, tell me something, if they were such a bad guy in this book, why did one member of the PRC made a apology to the United States and started working on making this ordeal in the book justified. This book, the Bear and the Dragon, is masterfully, skillfully written, superb sub-plots and plot, great telling of the the story, very realistic, and a very honorable read. I would recommend this book to all who likes Tom Clancy and has an interest what China and Russia is currently like right now. Some reviewers do not know what they are talking about when they downright bash this book, Clancies writing didn't declined in greatness, it heightened in greatness. One of his best books I or you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's The Bear And The Dragon was an action-packed book, full of military and political actions, real scenes, excellent writing and basically good material. The detailed way Tom Clancy writes adds to the true feeling of being there. The storyline is complete in every aspect, from the locations to the weapons and people. Overall, I would describe this book as great, detailed, action-packed and addictive!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all the Clancy books - is this the best? Probably not but I couldn't put it down during the last 300 pages.Classic Clancy - can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I liked the mix of action, types of characters and use of &quot;technology.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this was a good book. If I can read a 1028 page book in three weeks it has to be pretty good. I'd like to see more action with Ding and Clark though. They are two of his best characters. Ryan's choice for a VP was excellent and any true Clancy would agree. This isn't the greatest book he's ever written but it wasn't a bad one. Another good book is The Lion's Game by Nelson DeMille."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While Tom Clancy takes the first 100 or so pages to set up the storyline, it's worth wading through to get to the good stuff. From the literally explosive start in Russia, through the careful set up of a CIA plant in the office of a high member of the Chinese Politburo, oodles of computer tricks, to the Chinese trying something REALLY foolish, our reluctant hero, Jack Ryan, copes with it all.But not without the help of a few friends. John Clark, &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez and the rest of the crew from Rainbow Six help the Russians against the attack of the Chinese. Admiral Bart Mancuso is back for yet another challenge in the fight for peace.A totally absorbing book. I ignored my family for two weeks because I could not put this book down (they're used to this, though). It reminds me a little of Patriot Games; a bit slow at first because of the needed background necessary to the story, but one it gets going, it doesn't stop."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them). This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I went on holiday to relax, took The Bear and The Dragon with me and spent most of the holiday in a state or nervous exhaustion! How does Clancy do it time after time? What's his secret? His understanding of wars and fighting machines is unsurpassable, his understanding of the different cultures is a bonus. You should read The Bear and the Dragon, just to get an understanding of world politics. Top marks for Tom Clancy for pulling another thriller out of the bag."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Hunt for Red October, for all of its dark political undercurrents{the naval institute press issuing this book when its sub funding was being put under the scope,its author a fantasy war monger who couldnt find it in his heart to seve in Vietnam]was a great ride. tautly written, far fetched in some of its plot but close enough to reality that its credibility was never too stretched, it introduced J ack Reilly to America,the anglophile with the Irish name{Clancy,well, you get it...].Since then, Mr Clancy has been getting further from reality,where all of the good guys are military republican types[well, this is a fantasy beacuse this guy NEVER served under these dunderheads]and the bad guys are swarthy arabs[sigh] or drug smugglers[also swarthy types[heavy sigh]or worst of all Intellectual liberals{shock&gt;Horror of Horrors.Oh the humanity...]In this vapid tome, Mr reilly is now president{dont ask how,star trek is more believeable...]and doing battle with,well...over the top assinine violence from soemone who had not seen it{no one who witneses this type of carnage glorifies it,or dishonors the memories of those who perished.

Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up. \\u0004 Yes, and I spell terrible..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book was scary in some places as it illustrates what could happen; international politics have big consequences. The plot unfolded very well, although not as many plot twists as Clancy usually inserts. This is neither good nor bad - just a choice of method. It was an enjoyable as well as a believable read. Most of the subplots are very well thought out and lead directly to the main climax. The events concern American and Russians in conflict with the barbarian politicians of Red China. I have read every one of Clancy's novels and this one, although not my favorite, still satisfies. It is a good illustration of international issues as they are right now.Some of the reviews that I read here are just unbelievable. I read the book along with Clanccy's others. Reviewers using the word &quot;racism&quot; to describe some of the dialog are simply mouthing off a useless term with little or no meaning. I really cannot believe people still use that worn-out, illiterate term. I suppose popular culture has broadcast the words like &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;sexism&quot; so much that people really feel like the sentences containing these words are somehow meaningful. Pitiful - just pitiful - especially in a review where one expects more.Anyway, this is a good book. It requires a little bit of reflecting, it has some political ideas, but it is a integrated work of art nonetheless.In summary, read the book and not the reviews herein (except for this one)..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy, mainly for the TV game plotted by Tom, and I have spent tons of time on that. This is the first book I have read by Tom. But what a Disappointment! As a Chinese, all the details, scenes, and characters Tom written could be real, but not at a time of 2000, not even 1990. All the Chinese plots may be true 30 years ago when China was still under the control of \\"MAO.\\"This book simply reminds me the Chinese movies and books I watched and read when I was a boy in China.

As with most of his works Mr. Clancy takes some time putting the pieces of the puzzle together, which he does with great skill. Once the puzzle starts to come together it is quite difficult to put the book down. While reading this book I had to keep telling myself it is just a book and not real. The characters seem very real. I am waiting for his newest book &quot; Red Rabbit&quot; with great anticipation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's magnum opus, The Bear and the Dragon (starring movie hero Jack Ryan), is rollicking good fun for about the first 400 or so pages.

It is a testament to clancy's skill as a thriller writer that he can write over one thousands pages and have most of them not ... . Some could say that this book lacks realism. I say, why look for realism in a Tom Clancy book. You're looking for action, adventure, detailed descriptions of weapons, stock military characters, and the president of the United States Jack Ryan kicking some serious international ... .

Get to it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have to agree with the majority on this one, I wondered whether actually wrote this book! The repetitive dialogue, cliches, and profanity are not hallmarks of the earlier Jack Ryan dramas. In fact, Jack Ryan seemed different; does being President cause one to become profane, cynical, and less intelligent? Oh, yeah, I forgot...I think Clancy needs a hiatus to reclaim the essence of writing about techno-political issues."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this book was great. Granted it took a long time to develop, but the last 300 pages were smokin'! Keep it up Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a true fan of Tom Clancy's fictional works. This book is not up to par with his greatest works: Without Remorse, Red October, Sum of All Fears, and Patriot Games. As with all Clancy, it starts off with some action then labors on for 700 pages essestially discribing a political philosophy that swings pretty far right. Unfortunately, it felt very forced and I had the distinct impression that I was being lectured. In Executive Powers, Clancy was subtle about revealing what are certainly some of his deeply held political views. Bear and the Dragon is so obtuse in preaching a political viewpoint that even those of us who lean to the right feel imposed upon as readers. Tom, bubbie, sweetheart ... stick to what you know. Write another background piece like Without Remorse only on Jack Ryan and his experiences as a Marine. Better yet, how about a real spy thriller like Cardinal starring Chet Nomuri. Anyway, all Clancy is worth reading but there isn't the usual high payoff finale and positive denoument that have kept me coming back. My recommendation, wait for the paperback or borrow the book on tape ... abridged version!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While the book had good suspence , I felt it would have been a better read at 800 pages and please loose the pandering to the military and making each character, the best of the best of the best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Good Grief, it takes nearly seven hundred pages to get going!

Tom Clancy- start fresh with new characters please!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I think that Tom Clany is either over the hill, or just not working hard anymore. There was a point in his career where i loved nothing more than to be reading one of his books. But now, he makes everybody so wimpy. Where are Ding and Clark???? In my opinion his two strongest characters, they are left behind in the field!!!!!I want the old Clancy, or i want my money back."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found this work to be less than what I have come to expect from Clancy. The basic elements that have made him so popular are still there (expert plot development and the ability to run multiple story lines without confusion) but this book seemed formulaic and not a little bit angry. There seems to be an underlying asian xenophobia in the writer that isn't there when he writes of Russian or Arab enemies. I wonder why? I still love Clancy but I am hoping for more in post-presidental Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Too much unnecessary profanity Too much whineing by Pres Ryan. Too much Clancy agenda about abortion. Some factual errors. Lone Wolf Gonzales's last name was incorrectly spelled, It was actually Gonzaullas. Whine, whine. Gee I sound like Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having gotten about 100 pages into this book, I had come to Amazon to see what other readers thought. It seems that at least some of you agree with me that this book is a disapointment. I'm sorry to say that this will be the first Clancy book I won't finish.And it's not just that the story is lacking (which it is, more on that later). My biggest gripe is the foul language. When I first read Hunt for Red October, I was relatively young, and one of the things I liked about Clancy was his ability to tell a good story withouthaving to use gimmicks like sex and profanity to keep you reading. I've noticed it increasing recently - Rainbow Six had just a little, for example - but it feels like there is more swearing in one (small) chapter of this book than in both of his first works combined. And it was the quality of those books that have kept me reading, until now.Now, about the story. It's just a feeling, but this one feels cramped. In earlier books, I got a feeling of expansiveness and connectedness between all of the characters. Not here. Also, in the past I was hooked by the second or third chapter. Now, who cares? I'm sure it would be relatively entertaining to go through the rest of the story, but is it worth it?The feeling I get is similar to the one I got reading Chrichton's post-Jurassic Park books. They read like movie scripts (which they are). And that's what this feels like. If I want poinless sex and profanity, or if I want a weak, stripped-down story that has to make up in bangs what it lacks in substance, then I'll go see a movie. Hollywood puts out plenty of crap like this."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been an avid Clancy reader ever since Red October. The suspense was so great that I could not put the book down and read it in one sitting. I have bought every book since, and in hard cover!But Bear and Dragon was a great dissapointment. It did not even get interesting until after I turned over 700 pages. The long rambling background the first half of the book was a total waste. What happened to the great suspense and action?And the last 200 pages were too short and incomplete. Worst yet was the close.....there wasn't any!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As not only a Clancy fan but a Jack Ryan fan, I held out 48 hours before buying the book despite the fussing by my wife's \\"wait for the paperback.\\" I am sorry that I did and I want my money back. The book fails on several points most of which are terminal for me as a Clancy and Jack Ryan fan.The first and the least of Clancy's errors is overuse of the F-word. Yes, yes, I was a sailor and can swear like one, but the gratuitous use of that word diminished the story, the Presidency, and Jack Ryan. Jack, ol' buddy, you are better than that. The work was used in the wrong places as well as overdone.Next, Clancy has Ryan drone on and on about how he hates this ******* job as President. Alright already! We knew that from \\"Executive Orders\\"--which BTW, this book is a re-dressed version. Has Clancy gone into a serial of President Jack Ryan like a cheap detective novel? We fans of that \\"Everyman we'd like to be\\" Jack Ryan are getting the first of many hints that our hero is breaking down into a terminal case of Character Dissolution.The use of sex and sexual language in this novel was inappropriate and dirty. While no prude, I was offended by its prurient handling and overuse to *no purpose*. There was nothing sexy or macho at all; it did not further story. Where it was found, bespoke of a wanker at the word processor.The old gang of supporting players were shallowly used and often out of character. These characters we have grown to like or dislike were used as simple props for gimmicks or quickly contrived devices. There was more depth of character in a kindergarten play for some of them. I liked Jackson, Ryan's best friend. I did not like him either by the end of the book.The character of Jack Ryan is broken. Clancy so poorly portrayed (is it \\"thoroughly betrayed\\") the character and with each passing page, Ryan was written more and more out of character. In the end of the book, he's a jackass and a fool. [...]There is a lot of cut and paste in in the book. You'll read several sentences and a paragraph or two twice or thrice.This book was rushed and poorly edited. There are errors of grammar and spelling through out.There are so many loose threads, we need to get Clancy over to Goodwill for another suit.He left Clark and Chavez out in the field.Then the story just ends. The novel begs for a longer ending, but it is just rushed. One star for Ryan; one for Clancy, not that either deserved them. Poor story. [...]"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read all of Clancy's &quot;Ryan&quot; novels, I have come to expect certains things from his storys: Much techno-babble, intrigue, impossible to pronounce Russian names, and Jack Ryan to the rescue. I also expect to enjoy the book. In &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, we get the techno babble to the Nth degree(do we need the workings of an encrypted phone explained every time it is mentioned?),the Russian names and Jack Ryan. We also get is a story of marginal entertainment value, a large dose of Clancy's personal political views on everything from Clinton to abortion,story lines that seem to meander along and sputter, and very little reading enjoyment. Of course the ending has been commented on many times, with its screeching halt &quot; I am tired of writing this story&quot; ending that stretches believability to the limit. Aint it amazing where the last remaining missile is targeted? Overall, very disappointing, and ranks poorly when compared to any of the other Ryan novels.&quot;Oh writer of Patriot Games, hath though foresaken us?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you're reading this, you've probably read some of the other reviews on this page and know about the opinion of the too long and drawn out book. The book, at 1028 pages was in fact too long. I could have lived with Jack expressing his dislike of the job about 15 times, but the 16th time was the last straw. But let's think of a real person. If you don't like your job do you complain to your best friend once and be done with it, or do you constantly complain about how your job is such a hassle. It may be annoying, but guess what, that's how a real person handles it. Also, many of the reviewers say that nothing happens through the first 700 pages, but they fail to realize that things do happen. There's the murder investigation, the diplomatic trade negotiations, the Catholic/Baptist events, and the set-up of SONGBIRD. This doesn't take just 100 pages to build up. True it's not an action packed thrill ride, but it's necessary. A country can't just declare war on another without good reason. Clancy's criticizers seem to think the book would be better if the book started out: &quot;Chapter 1: Suddenly, China decided to declare war on Russia for no apparent reason!&quot; It can't work like that, and I personally believe that Clancy has a sheer genius for thinking up these dense plots. Maybe you could see where things were going from the beginning, but does that truly take away from the story. If you've already seen Patriot Games will you not read the book because you already know how the events work out? This book with an amazingly intricate plot and real-life characters is misunderstood."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, I admit it, I anxiously await each new Tom Clancy novel to be published (no, not op-center or net-force or the non-fiction works - just the fictionalized novels).This was the first one I COULD put down and not finish in 1-2 readings. I was able to read a couple chapters at a time over a week or so. At 1000+ pages and 60+ chapters, its almost mandatory.The plot was classic Clancy, lots of technology, espionage, sub-plots and characters - (the Chinese and Russian character's names are so similar that I found myself going back a few times to see who was who), but sufficiently exciting to keep my attention over a week's period of time. The first 75% of the book sets up the last 25% which describes the inevitable &quot;war&quot; chapters - definitely exciting reading.This book continues to portray the government of the People's Republic of China as the &quot;bad guy&quot;, continuing the theme started a few novels ago, but not generalized to include the population as a whole. Deep cooperation and an alliance with Russia is also a primary theme. Finally, we get to see a very interesting (and realistic?) portrayal of Jack Ryan as a seasoned POTUS (President of the US).Enjoy the book, and the frequent reference to Japanese sausage!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The plot was good as usual. Nobody knows more technical stuff than Clancy and his assistants. But this book is just too damned long. He could have whacked about 300 pages from this book and the reader wouldn't have missed a thing. If you've read all of Clancy's novels to date, you'll have to read this on too just because it's Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Give the Chinese a break. I found Clancy's redundant attacks on Chinese views and policies to be offensive. As a subway reader, I felt compelled to put a brown paper cover over the book to hide what I was reading. Sounds hypocritical but I kept hoping there was a point to the China-bashing. (There wasn't!)As an aficionado of Clancy's action writing I continued on with the book; however, I was dishearted at the often repeated paragraphs that were anti-Chinese. It appeared to be more a book on what Tom likes and doesn't like. Maybe Tom needs to travel abroad a little bit more.Villains should be people not countries. Find a bad person in a country's heirarchy and make us hate HIM. Readers can't hate the entire country!And finally, have someone proof your books for consistency and repitition, this book could have been reduced two to three hundred pages."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book is longer than what I normally read. Its a good book for those who like his style of techno and government. It's not as good as his books of the past. It has good action and entertainment for those who enjoy that type of book. It's a thriller but too long for some people. I also enjoyed a thriller called Apocalypse South by Kyle Watson on amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've loved Ttom Clancy's books ever since I read Executive Orders one summer three years ago, but this latest book is just bad. I haven't gotten past the first 250 pages yet because it's just sooo boring. I've looked at the last several hundred pages and they look good, though. So if anyone actually had the will power to sit through the first 400 pages and would like to tell me what happens in them, I'd like you to e-mail me, because I think I'm just going to restart this book at page 500 and finish from there. Another thing about this book is that the United States gets into yet ANOTHER war. Since Sum of All fears, the United States has been involved in three(almost four) wars, gone through three presidents and has had nearly it's entire government killed. That doesn't sound like the America I know, that sounds like Romania(which, in retrospect, is an insult to Romania). Also, this stuff is supposed to have taken place all in a four year period(since Fowler was elected, resigned, and then Durling being killed in the year of the next election.) It just.... I don't know, if Tom Clancy wants to write a seriese of books that continue where the previous book left off, he needs to read his previous books and get his facts straight first. He also needs to stop with the 500 page buildups."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Well, Tom had some spelling errors in this one, but the one error he did not make was creating a sequel to Rainbow Six. That book was 1/2 star. This one gets three because it is: - a rebound from Rainbow Six - over 1,000 pages - a decent story - cool technologyIf you have read every Clancy novel (and, like me read two in a week when you just started) this one follows the &quot;pattern&quot;. Get through the first 200 pages, it gets faster. You are addicted between 400-800, then it has a rapid wind down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read all 1,028 pages in less than a week. I've own all of Clancy's books in hardcover and rate this one solidly in the middle. I only wonder why Clancy as to sell his books by the pound."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If someone had attended a creative writing course and was given an assignment to write a 'Clancy-esque' military-thriller but had then decided to turn it into a parody or 'literary-caricature', they would have ended up with 'The Bear and the Dragon'. It was ponderous, predictable and way too long. It took me less than a week to finish my library copy but then I would speed read past the tedious sections (which was frequent). Eric Harry did a much better treatment of the subject in either 'Arc Light' or 'Protect and Defend' and he went so far as to actually take out DC with a nuke in the first one, something that I think most readers were rooting for especially after Ryan does his idiotic Clint Eastwood routine with the aegis cruiser as the warheads are falling. Also, Clancy has quite a set of double standards considering that he broke up his marriage through infidelity. I guess his Ryan universe is a 'do what I say, not what I do' kind of place."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I own every book in Jack Ryan series, and have read each book at lease twice. I bought this book the moment it came out, but actually had to struggle to finish it. That's a first.The story is global in its scale as expected, with a ton of different sub-plots that makes you ask &quot;what's the point of this?&quot;, yet come together nicely at the end, the subplots merging together in an explosive climax. This is all expected of Tom Clancy novels. I expect to read through a few hundred pages of plot development, and I'm used to it, but this book really pushed the limit. Too many times I was asking &quot;can something substantial PLEASE happen???&quot;Wanting to find out about the on-going plot of the Jack Ryan world, in continuation of the previous novels, kept me going. But a book should not make the reader &quot;work&quot; to stay interested. In the end, the conclusion DID live up to previous novels, but again, it just took too much work to get there...Beginning with Executive Orders, the books take an almost &quot;first person&quot; perspective of the Jack Ryan character. Readers are exposed to the very thought process of Jack Ryan, as opposed to implied character development through seeing the actions of the character in previous novels. Nothing wrong there, except the same info is repeated over and over again. I'm not sure if was ok for the readers who are new to Tom Clancy, but having read previous work, the information got old read quick. I'm absolutely sick of exchanges between Jack and Arnie that goes like - JR :&quot;I hate this job. I didn't ask for it.&quot; AVD:&quot;You didn't have to take the job, remember? You could have run away, but you didn't. So suck it up!&quot;It seems many readers were offended by the coarse language, explicit sexuality, apparent racism in picking on Asians as enemies, and blatant political preachings. The amount of cursing and sex has increased in TC's novels and I thought it went beyond what was necessary in this book... I hope this isn't a trend. In regards to perceived racism, I had no problem with it. TC likes to keep the potential threats in the book mirror the ongoing world events. With the demise of USSR, the potential threat has shifted to hostile Middle East and the Pacific rim. I think TC adapted well to the ongoing changes. And since the books portray US at war with this nations, its only natural for the characters to speak unfavorably about them. As for blatant political views, it is a natual result of character development and this book's &quot;first person view&quot;. I don't understand people who have a problem with that. Jack Ryan is an extension of Tom Clancy's views. If Tom Clancy was NOT writing about things he believes in with passion, what's the point of reading that book? How can a book written not to offend anybody be worth reading?Anyway, in conclusion, its a Tom Clancy novel. It has a great ending. But be prepared to work through it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Continuing the saga of Jack Ryan, this book lives up to Clancy's standards and goes beyond. It's thoroughly enjoyable and keeps the reader glued to the pages. An astonishing book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While I am enjoying the book so far, I enjoyed the others more. I am rather disappointed in an author of his stature using the &quot;F&quot; word so frequently. Occasionally maybe but not page after page. I hope that it gets better as I read further into the book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It seems that many of the reviewers giving The Bear and the Dragon a poor rating are doing so because of a political agenda of their own. Too much swearing or sex? Neither of these things was significant in the book. Tom Clancy is described as too white and Catholic for some other reviewers. If you like Tom Clancy books or techno thrillers in general you'll like this book. It did seem to take him a little too long to get the plot running, but I suspect this is because it is difficult to set the action so that it is easy to believe. Clancy does an amazing job of writting spy thrillers that can be believed in the post cold war world. This scenario as many of his previous ones was quite easy to believe in the light of the current world situation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Starting at the end... (Careful, gives ending away...)Communist nuke ICBM land on Wash DC, but no-harm no-foul. Clancy then writes to justify how the the communist leadership is not responsible for this 'mistake', and everyone on 'our side' can be a hero, and feel good. Bad joke?This book is a bad joke right from the beginning. I agree with some of the other low ratings posted on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Bought the book in a used-book sale a few years ago, and thought I'd finally read it. Too much narrative, not much dialogs. But I kept reading it until the author starts to write about the Chinese, and then I skimmed it to find more ignorant and racist remarks, some of those came out from the mouth of Jack Ryan, a character I'd liked before. I don't think I'm going to read another book by Tom Clancy. As for this one, it is not worth the 50c I paid and belongs to the trash can."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I agree with the reviewer below who contrasted this book with Hunt for Red October. That was a masterful story, and it shares little with this one; the story was much more concise, Ryan had not yet evolved into Superman -- it was superior in every way.I have come to realize that Ryan is an excellent storyteller, but not much of a writer. For example, all of his good guys talk the same way. Who said this to President Ryan, when he said he hated his job: &quot;Ain't supposed to be fun, Jack.&quot; Was it Robby Jackson, Arnie Van Damm, George Winston, Cathy Ryan, Ding Chavez, Mary Pat Foley, etc.? My point is that the words fit all of them perfectly, because they all talk with Clancy's one &quot;good guy&quot; voice.I could give lots more criticism, but I'll close by agreeing with another reviewer who complained about the Foley's &quot;baby-honey bunny&quot; act. Are they the two top intelligence agents, or sitcom characters?Tom -- take a break, stop writing, and enjoy all that money."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is actually a response to Easy To Put Down. If this is to be your first Clancy book, DO NOT buy this. This is the newest book of the John Ryan series. Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, Sum Of All Fears, Debt Of Honor, Executive Orders all come before this book. If you pick up Bear and the Dragon, you will be lost, and bored like that guy. So do yourself a favor and read those books first, and you will then understand what is going on, and who the characters are."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a devoted Clancy fan but am growing tired of constant politics and non-thrilling storylines. Clancy's publisher should challenge him to contain his next work to less than 500 pages. There were a couple of vintage Clancy surprises in this novel which kept things interesting, but this book simply doesn't rank with Clancy classics like Red October and Sum of All Fears."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The worst piece of crap I have ever laid eyes on."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read all of Clancy's books, and liked all of them with the exception of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, which was totally unbelievable, and almost enough to turn me off Clancy forever. This one is a big step back for Clancy: enjoyable, entertaining, interesting. Sure, there's a lot of repetition (referring to someone as a 'puke' is the best example of this fault), but the story held my interest.Gerry"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Same old, same old. I could tell what was going to happen, who does what to whom, at every step in the story...I can even predict when Ryan will say &quot;I hate this job&quot;.Where are the rebels in uniform, the kooky scientists, the hateful politicians, and even the journalists in this 1000+ re-hash of the 3 previous books.Don't spend your money. If you have to have it, wait for the paperback!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Usually a 1,000 page Tom Clancy book is an occasion for much rejoicing, but this was as big as a disappointment as I've had since I found out my Dad was Santa Claus. To summarize:1) Nothing happens for almost 800 pages. By my count, there are three &quot;action&quot; scenes before page 780-- and one of them takes place in the first 10 pages! In the meantime you have to suffer through a lot of people sitting around talking or thinking about the same topics over and over and over . . . (yes, Jack, we know you hate being President-- but then why did you run for reelection?)2) When the action does start, it's Executive Orders all over again, with the poor Chinese playing the role of the UIR. Remember when Clancy wrote about an enemy that was formidable (e.g. Red Storm Rising)? Not anymore. The US is smart, everyone else isn't, we win. Oh, and our guys are so arrogant, it hurts. I find it interesting that no one joins our armed forces who's incompetent (or even slightly less than perfect).3) The plot was too contrived. The decision-making process really bugged me. The decision to let Russia into NATO is made over coffee without any consultation with the other members. China decides to invade Russia in one meeting without any serious considerations as to the consequences. The US decides to fight China and then seem surprised to learn that China has nuclear weapons and might use them! The special forces are sent in in a seat-of-the-pants decision. (Of course they pull it off without any training; this coming immediately after a Clancy novel (Rainbow Six) that preaches the necessity of property preparation and training for special operations.) Please tell me the world isn't run like this!4) It's time to retire some of these characters. I used to like Jack Ryan. Now he's a whining, ultra-conservative, male chauvanist, (semi) racist (the Chinese are &quot;Klingons&quot;?) jerk. Clark was once a dark, mysterious character-- now he's a boring bureaucrat. In Clear and Present Danger, Ding was awesome-- now he's as exciting as my next door neighbor. Robby Jackson is pathetic (you're not a fighter pilot anymore-- get over it!!!).5) The &quot;new&quot; characters who had potential disappear. The Chet Numera plot could have been exciting, but after being the main character to start the book, you don't hear from him in the second half (which, given the cheesy sex dialogue, was almost welcome). The Russian cop was cool, but that plot just dies off. (At one point, the KGB agent who was caught was going to cut a deal to double-cross the Chinese, but that was never followed up). And the Italian sharpshooting cop? He could have been great but there was no reason to include him at all. Hopefully this was a preview to the next novel with him as the lead, ala Without Remorse.6) I don't want to hear about Clancy's politics. Please keep them out of the books.It appears to me as if Tom Clancy has spread himself too thin, with supervising his cheesy &quot;Op-Center-esq&quot; paperback series, his non-fiction books, his computer game company and whatever else he's doing. I feel ripped off and taken advantage of.Please Tom, get back to what made you great!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clancy years ago, right after The Hunt for Red October caught the country by storm. I liked his book and his writing. I have read almost all his books, the paperback techno thrillers are trash, and it only took 3 of them to convince me he was getting paid for his name and not his talent. His latest book has some good ideas but he gets lost delivering the material with bizarre subplots that had no meaning on the story. It is like he is getting paid by the pound for his work. This book could have been done in 600 pages and it would have been a page turner, instead it was 1000+ pages of yawner in some spots. This book was worse than Rainbow Six which was pure manure, because it could have been a good book. Rainbow Six started with the impossible and continued to get more unbelievable on every page. At least this book has some interesting ideas, but his delivery of the material to the public missed by a long shot."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't read Tom Clancy books and expect writing like John Le Carre, but this one is a new low in Hardy Boy like prose. It also features a lot more of the worst written character in American fiction, his pal Robbie. Every scene this guy is in makes me cringe with embarssment that Clancy is actually trying to pawn him off as a real human. Boy's Life magazine has more real sounding dialog. If I had to read once more about &quot;fighter jocks strapping an F-14 on their backs&quot; (which we had to hear about, verbatim, at least five times) I was going to puke. Oh, and can you imagine a Tom Clancy love scene? Don't. I have enjoyed Tom Clancy books immensely over the years, and might again, but the next one will wait till it's out in paperback, if there is a next one. Maybe he just cranked this one out to pay for his divorce."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm still reading &quot;The Bear and the Dragon,&quot; so my three stars are provisional. Still, I wanted to share some thoughts. I'm about 200 pages in, but unlike his previous books, I have yet to encounter any true suspense. In &quot;Rainbow Six,&quot; we had the attempted hi-jacking that grabbed me and other readers right into the story. I'm sorry, but the attack on the Russian pimp just doesn't measure up in the suspense department.I think the problem here is that there is not much he can do with Jack Ryan as president. His previous Ryan books were much more spell-binding because Jack was involved in the action. Here, and in &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; our hero is stuck in the Oval Office. I don't know how or if he'll be able to write his way out of this situation, but until Ryan is out of the White House, Clancy will continue to face the same problem.That's why I'm starting to enjoy the John Clark-themed books more. Clancy is able to do much more with Clark.One other thing. Tom, please, no more &quot;honey, bunny&quot; from MP. This is the CIA. We didn't have this kind of talk (at least, I don't remember it) between the Foleys in past books. It just doesn't resonate with me!Still, unlike others who have written here, I'm still enjoying this read, even with its shortcomings."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been an avid Tom Clancy fan since &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; I have read all of his single-author books and many of the earlier books for which he is a co-author, but I simply couldn't bring myself to finish this book (sigh).I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; (Clancy's last book) when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I had REALLY enjoyed about Clancy's earlier books was the relative cleanliness of his language in writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other (including the POTUS, at least leave me the luxury of hoping that a clean-mouthed man could be president...why not Ryan?).I was also depressed to wade into the deep pool of sexual encounters described early in this book. I managed to make it to only about page 130 before I called it quits.Don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but not enough to wade through what he put together for this offering. Sorry Tom. But I thought that you and others deserved to at least hear my main criticism.Call the dialog in this book reality if you must, but it's a brand of reality I choose to avoid in the pleasure reading I do.I think that the main story line definitely had potential...but now I'll probably never know.Thus, only 3 stars.Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy needs a new editor. Someone who will do his job and ask Clancy to stop sending in first drafts. I've enjoyed most of his novels and I thought Rainbow Six was excellent. This one, however, has to be his worst. The plot is extremely one-dimensional, predictable, and oh....so......slow. This is his slowest one since Clear and Present Danger. The editor was completely out to lunch on all counts. The plot and characterization needed to be beefed up. Style needed a lot of polishing (Clancy used the same metaphors, jokes, and turns of phrase far too often). Scenes and whole chapters needed eliminating. A good 30% of this book needed trashing. The part that's left needed several revisions.And probably the worst part of it was the shallow idiocy of his portrayal of the Chinese Politburo. I think most people would agree that Communism is demonstrably not the smartest way to run a country. This doesn't translate, however, to sophomoric stupidity on the part of China's leaders.I'm very disappointed in this book and hope he either does better next time around or hangs it up before he completely fulfills the cliche about 'degenerating into self-parody'. I sincerely hope it is the former he undertakes because I'm a big fan and would really hate to lose one of my favorite authors.Mr. Clancy, fire your editorial team. Whoever told you this was a great yarn is a serious brown-noser. This was a great idea for a yarn that needed a lot more work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I cannot help but feel disapointed at the standard of Tom Clancy's latest novel- &quot; the Bear and the Dragon&quot; I feel that he keeps repeating himself and the ending of the novel is too sudden. Its almost as if he wrote the novel and then decided its getting too long or he had something better to do and finished it off suddenly. Considering his other novels, this is of a low quality. Looks like the author is getting complacent with his fame and cannot be bothered with his novels anymore. After all, he has many other &quot;co-writers&quot; who use his name to sell their novels-&quot;op-centre&quot; series comes to mind. Tom should not lower his standards just to produce novels under his name. If he cannot be bothered writing a quality novel HIMSELF, he should not write any. It would only harm his reputation and disapoint his readers/fans."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm 90% done with the book (boy, is it a big one), and it's definitely a great page-turner. It's nice to see Clancy dial back the techno-overload a little (I never have minded it, but I can see where it makes his stuff inaccessible), but he still gets a little bit preachy at times. I've noticed in his last few books, he takes the chance, through the characters, to do a little over-the-top conservative preaching. I don't read the books for the politics, and it tends to go far beyond character motivation and into the author writing an editorial through the characters. It's only a bit less than previous books, but still fairly tolerable.However, it's looking to me that Clancy is running out of things to write about. Rainbow Six and Executive Orders had basically identical storylines (bio-warfare? Again? ), and Bear/Dragon is pretty much an amalgamation of Red Storm Rising and Debt of Honor (uh-oh, major power in economic trouble, let's have a war). I'm not sure how it ends up quite yet, but it's looking fairly predictable at this point. The biggest casualty of the cold war ending appears to have been Tom Clancy's source of stories.Still, it's a fun read, and definitely worth $25.Hope this helps! -JAL"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As referenced in the review title, I'm a big fan of both Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler. However, both authors have recently been demonstrating that it might be time ship some of their stars off into retirement. Overall, I did enjoy 'The Bear and The Dragon', it's your standard Clancy page-turner. There are minor complaints, mainly the feeling that dialogue has been cut &amp; pasted at times (how many references to the 'new toilet paper joke', 'as long as the cat hunts', and other lines crop up several times in the book spoken by different characters). Whether it's done on purpose or by accident, it really gives some scenes a 'been there, done that' feel. I also feel that several new (or briefly glimpsed old) characters really needed more fleshing out. I was also annoyed that Clancy has obviously fallen so in love with his creations that he can't bear killing any of them off. Three books ago he wiped out most of the government and several minor characters as well. James Greer died so long ago, I can't even remember in what book it happened. Yet now, all of his characters (major or minor) seem to be invincible. Which brings me to my major problem with the book, the ending. After going through 900 pages of excellent reading, I'm left with an ending that seems tacked on in the worst way. It's almost as if Tom get's bored by the story and decides to wrap up everything in a single chapter. Not to give anything away, but it begins with on pretty improbable event, is compounded by any lack of surprise in the target (even a 1 in 10 chance didn't make it surprising), and finishes with a Jack Ryan performance that only Dirk Pitt and Al Giordiano could deliver convincingly (and it would be a longshot for them as well). The last 50 or so pages just got worse and worse as you went along. So once again, I'm faced with reading another great Clancy book, spoiled by the last two chapters (I hope I wasn't the only one who hated the hackneyed ending which had a passenger jet that destroyed half the U.S. government a few books ago). Clancy made his name by concentrating on detailed plotlines, which while played on the world's stage, featured minor players. Now that many of them have graduated to becoming major players, they seem to have lost what made them interesting in the first place. Putting them into a formulaic plot ripped from several other techno-thrillers just doesn't make sense. At least Tom hasn't taken a page from Dirk Pitt's creator, and started appearing as himself in the pages of his own novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've always loved the TC/Jack Ryan books up until Rainbow Six which seemed like it was based on a video game. This book has a very compelling story line but the dialogue is so inane I have trouble keeping a straight face as I read each page.Clancy seems to think that by adding the F-Bomb and the dick comments that the conversations will seem more realistic and cover up his inability to present normal human conversation. Pathetic moments include: When President Jack Ryan says for 10 millionth time &quot;...GODDAMN IT call me Jack not Mr President! &quot; The repeated use of the SS codenames for the first family and cabinent members is so lame with lines like &quot;SWORDSMAN says to SURGEON...&quot; or that dope Mark Gant (&quot;he's good with computers&quot; - duh) who in the middle of tense trade negotiations starts berating a fellow diplomant and attacks the guy's penis size...unbelievable...and worse yet &quot;SWORDSMAN&quot; thought it was great?Ugh! This is such a lame book...but of course I'll finish..hopefully this is the end of the Jack Ryan books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"what a disappointment! the only reason I finished this book was I paid full price for it. stupid me.the theme in this book sound interesting, but, by 565th page, I just found it ridiculously laughable. china invaded siberia of Russia and US sent troops to help defend? how the hell clancy could come up something like that. didn't make any sense at all.worst, clancy tried to create his own evil empire, China, to replace the Regan version, Russia. But he just failed to do his research on modern chinese life, culture and society. A lot of things he described the chinese are outdately wrong. obviously he relied on his own personal imagination to create this chinese background w/o any basis of facts. that's just plain lazy. then he casted this evil empire image on the whole chinese civilization, you can call him racist, I would rather think he is just retardedly flawed in his logic.I think it's time for clancy to retire the Ryan character (it's getting old and boring) or the readers should retire clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon starts up about as quickly as a 78 olds in the dead of New England winter. The first 400 pages could and should have been condensed into about 50. I ended up feeling that Mr. Clancy was speaking his political opinion through a sometimes whiny Jack Ryan. That adolecent complaining coupled with the perpetuated weakness of nicoteen addiction has really grown old on me. When you read this book, you'll understand what I mean. This awful begining makes the remainder of the story difficult to enjoy. References are made to past books that seem forced, almost as if the thread was caught in the editing phase and was just thrown in. I won't spoil the story for you but how can you spend the first third of a novel graphically describing the exploits of a spook, only to completely forget about them for the remainder of the book? This is a very sub par effort by Mr. Clancy. I read my first Clancy book, Rainbow Six, a little over a year ago. In the mean time, I have read every book in the Jack Ryan era spare cardnial and enjoyed them for the most part. with out question, Mr. Clancy has had a slump that started the last 300 pages of Executive Orders, spiked up during Rainbow six, and now has dropped through the floor with The Bear and the Dragon. I will conceed that when this book is good, it is fantastic. Unfortunately, only about %40 of the book is fantastic and it may only be fantastic since the remaining %60 is about as much fun as a trip to the dentist. If you are a Clancy fan then by definition you are accustomed to drawn out boring side stories that you really don't care about. Read the book so you can tell people at parties you have read all of Tom Clancy's books. If you are trying to convert your brother in law into a Clancy fan, this book is probably your worst choice."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I preface this this review to say that I have read all of TCs books (excepting opcenter or Netforce) and I have been and still am a big fan of the author. However I think the continuous story of Jack Ryan which started with Red October has grown stale.Honestly I figured TC to have given up the Jack Ryan series years ago. This could, or rather should have happened after either Sum of all fears, Debt of Honor, or Executive Orders.The book itself is entertaining enough but it sorely lacks two things. Originality, and more distressing, believability.The trend that has appeared over the last few books is TC keeping every significant character from his other works and including ALL of them in this one. This has made a pretty decent 500 page book into a 1000 page monstrosity. I even noticed the reintroduction of a character from Cardinal, and that book was written 12 years ago! This has made this book overly complex. Just keeping up with whos who makes this book less than really enjoyable.All in all I wish Jack Ryan would go away. TC should either create a new and unrelated series or split off with another character from an earlier book. Personally, I would like to see the story line of John Clark in the heyday of his early (1970s) CIA career."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am, or better yet, WAS a Clancy fan. I've read all his novels. I have to say I am astonished at how poorly written, plotted, and edited &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is. Many critics say Clancy must get paid by the word, I never felt that way before, but I do now. His narrative is that of a novice. He repeats himself over and over and over by using the same metaphors and phrases, duplicating and explaining the same characters thoughts and feelings repeatedly. It's either a form of writers block, a plea for filler, or a lack of literary vocabulary. I also blame Clancy's editor. He/she should have picked up on the redundancies, but lets face it, that's a lot of editing in 1000 pages, and dare they doctor that much manuscript? God forbid it be 600 pages and not over a 1000! He (Clancy) has lost all since of characterization through poor dialogue. Characters which we've grown to love are suddenly talking like randy sailors on shore leave, rather than heads of state with intelligence. In fact, I don't recall ever reading a book where the characters swear as much (Maybe &quot;Clockers&quot;, but that was about NYC crack dealers) President Jack Ryan's cabinet seems more like rowdy college students at a fancy ball they don't belong at. This book was like taking that miserable long cross-country trip to Walley World, and discovering it's closed. I suggest Clancy not worry over size so much as content. Like a Jazz musician who only improvises a phrase knowing their vocabulary is limited, Clancy should do the same if he can't deliver. I know Clancy has his fans that love Jack Ryan (I was one), and are just happy to have a new book to read, but that doesn't make this a well written book. It's mind boggling how his recent &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; could be so well written, and &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; be so poor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After redreading Executive Orders three times, TB&amp;TD comesas a crushing disappointment. The book is rife with typos, repetitive dialogue, longwinded xenophobic discourses and, worst of all, Jack Ryan (and most other characters) appears to have undergone a personality transplant and now curses like a longshoreman. His new VP (identity withheld) is a gross one-dimensional caricature and the dialogue within the CIA is excrutiating. ... Perhaps military technology has outpaced dramtic suspense as one series of bombs can now take out all the opposition. Its a decent first draft but hardly a quality finished product."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In the beginning, Clancy's books were great. Why was that? Well, his main character (Jack Ryan) was a good one, with lots of development potential, always in the middle of some interesting spy-situation in the dual world torn apart by the cold war. Besides, his style and competence to describe accurate and believable military conflicts was what captivated millions of readers around the globe.Well, the years passed, lots of books came and went in what is now known as \\"Ryanverse\\". But the quality of the books surely is not the same. What happened?First of all, Ryan is now president, and a veteran of almost ten books. He has nowhere to escalate further, and after ten books there are few development fields for a character: they become repetitive and predictable. Now, Ryan is a boring man, always complaining about being POTUS. What is worse, few new characters are introduced in the series. They are always the same: Clark, Chavez, Golovko, Jackson, Van Damm, etc. etc. The readers are getting tired.Second, Clancy now doesn't write anymore about military, he writes about politics. That would be OK, if the book wasn't 1100 pages long. I mean, who has the patience to wait 950 pages of politic (and sometimes economic) conflicts that go seemingly nowhere before Russia and China engage in a war over oil and gold? I don't have that kind of patiente.Even with all that, this book could be considered average (not like his previous and good books, but still average); but this time Clancy overreacted: every sub-chapter has an ethnic prejudice sentence, and not after long I was tired of the supremacy and intelligence of the americans and the stupidity and craziness of the chinese.In the end, after the war is concluded, the book rushes to an end in less than five pages. I mean, I read more than 1000 pages and this book doesn't even END PROPERLY? Ridiculous. Clancy is clearly doing his own editing and that is always a mistake. Clancy is treating his readers as idiots. And, if I was a chinese I would be very, very angry at Mr. Clancy right now, work of fiction or not. It's very clear the author doesn't know that much about China (or was misinformed, but I don't think that is likely) and created a ridiculous China look-alike with lots of hateful things to instigate that hate on his readers. In my opinion, it backfired, and now Mr. Clancy himself is in a bad position.(...)Grade 4.0/10"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"At over a thousand pages this book is tedious, even for the verbose Clancy. Profanity abounds, as does sex, neither for any useful purpose except to add pages. Three or four hundred pages could be deleted and not affect the story. Even when the story finally gets interesting in the last quarter of the book, it is not up to Tom Clancy standards. The war is too simple and too easy. The American techno-whiz-bang makes the whole thing a \\"no contest\\". While American technology really is amazing, to believe that there would be virtually no casualities is not believable. The few American losses appear to have been thrown in at the last minute. We just shot down 60 Chinese airplanes? Hmmm, maybe the good guys should lose a plane, too! Definitely not up to the quality of his early works."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The premise of the book is good: China and Russia are at odds with one another over oil fields and gold mines in Siberia. The only other good part of the book is it starts out with an exciting beginning. From there it goes downhill very fast.First of all, the President Jack Ryan, is constantly bitching about domestic politics; most of it is criticism of the left-wing. Do we really need to hear Clancy's rants about politics in a FICTIONAL book? A book about foreign affairs no less. I kept on rolling my eyes. I have no problem with Clancy voicing his opinion, but you'd think he'd come up with a more professional way of doing it.Secondly, the whole scenerio is unbelievable. China attacking Russia?? And why does it attack Russia? Because of a trade embargo imposed by American citizens over the death of one fellow american and a cleric. Sorry Mr. Clancy, but your average american isn't as radical as you are and neither is the Chinese government.I admit, I didn't finish the book. I got sick of the political viewpoints of Clancy that I kept on having to read plus I just gave up on the rationality of the actions taken by the characters in the book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read all of Tom Clancy's books in chronological order, I have always been inclined to ignore his blatantly extreme conservative views for the sake of getting an exciting story in return... these huge novels were always a nice read on the beach, at least.In &quot;Bear &amp; Dragon&quot; though, Mr. Clancy's right-wing outlook on life has gone completely over the top. His repetitive mentioning of those disgusting &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, &quot;chinks&quot; and &quot;rats&quot; really turned me off, as did his boring excessive macho talk and two-dimensional view of the female gender. Also, I couldn't help to notice that Mr. Clancy all at once seems to be fascinated by having his main characters use the bathroom... no problem with that basically, but his fixation on nature's call wore kind of thin by the time I reached page 300 or so.On top of that, poor editing (John becomes Jack) and stereotyped characters spoil much of the reading fun that this book could have provided."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There is little to add here that hasn't been said by hundreds of other reviewers. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading any of this. Of all the different bad points, I think that TC's absurd, uninformed and racist fantasies about China in 1999 (or 2000?) were the most outrageous. To sum it up: poor literary style, poor editing, poor plot, poor dialogues, poor research, poor knowledge, poor readers, and a very rich author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Firstly, I'll concede a few points to the one-star reviews. I thought the anti-Asian racism in the book was unnecessary and was a crude stereotype of American and Russian soldiers but it was really a minor thing that was balanced out by other sections in the book. I would certainly hesitate to call Mr. Clancy himself a racist. Furthermore, there were a number of military inaccuracies which other reviewers have pointed out though that does not necessarily bother me all that much. The most obvious criticism I have of the book is how one-sided a take Mr. Clancy has on a theoretical war between China, Russia, and the U.S. I seriously doubt that the world's most powerful economy and second-most powerful military force would be caught so woefully unaware and have such rudimentary surveillance/counter-surveillance technology. I am sure that if an American or Russian military planner went based their strategy against China off of the scenario presented in this book, they would be in for a rude awakening. I also find it somewhat doubtful, though not beyond the range of possibility, that the entire Chinese Politburo could be dragged into an adventurous war by two hardliners. That move risked everything China had from its international reputation to its military capabilities to its economy to its own people and to the government itself. Zhang and Luo, the instigators of the war, simply had no foresight whatsover. They were one-dimensional characters and while it is probably true that there are some die-hard ideologues in the Politburo, it is unlikely that they would risk their entire country. And that the prime minister would passively agree to such a thing is also a bit unsettling. At least Bush and Rumsfeld didn't risk the entire country when they went on their misadventure.That said, this book is thoroughly entertaining and if you are patient enough to read it all the way through, it will leave you satisfied. Other reviewers criticize the length of the book but I think Clancy needed to make it that long to strike a good balance between character development and action. He tried to show that there are real people making the decisions and executing them. Maybe some parts could have been better written or a little more developed but there is nothing wrong with trying to show the human side of war (though it is mostly from the Russian/American side). All in all, it is not quite up to par as his previous works but it's pretty close."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Jack Ryan books have gone from great to average. Having read &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot;, &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, &quot;Executive Orders&quot; and now &quot;Bear and Dragon&quot; pretty much back to back to back, the decline is palpable. All have interesting premises and, of course, the detail in each is stunning. However, the quick-thinking, intellectual, reluctant but ready action-hero Jack Ryan of the first two of these has become the I-don't-wanna-be-President mope who fills up so much of the later two. And between EO and B&amp;D, he has taken a turn for the even more monotonous. Tom, you only have to say once a book that JR doesn't like his current position and then let it go!B&amp;D also suffers a few other things. A promising plot line concerning the personal life of a spy in China that is detailed in the first half of the book is pretty much left out of the last, oh, 500 pages. A second plot line involving Russian spy trackers gets a little more extended coverage but in the end it, too, is abandoned. The ending has little or no umph, unlike EO where there was at least a few really good stand up and cheer moments to wrap things up. And finally, while the first half of the book builds up a considerable expectation that the good guys might have their backs to the wall, the final half makes you wonder what all the fuss was about.The best I can say is that the book is a good time filler in the way all Clancy/Jack Ryan novels are. Unfortunately its not much more than that."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr. Clancy changed genres from technical/military to political thriller a couple of books ago. As a result his political thriller contains lots of - semi - military jargon and action. It must be said this side of the book is OK (not splendid as the &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; or &quot;Red October&quot;, but OK). However, the political part of this 1080 page book is unfortunately not op to standards: the issues have not been thought through enough to be convincing. And though some solutions could be tempting (some problems are irresolvable if all issues are taken into account), most are a mere waste of time.Another problem I have with this series is the decline in the language quality (techno talk and an overdoses abbreviations was always a part of this series, but the current level is having an impact on the readability.I would like to suggest Mr. Clancy to stop solving the problems of the world with this series and let Mr. Ryan rest."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book takes place after the setting of Executive Orders. It talks about war between Russia and China. Clancy has written about war against every possible US foe-USSR, Japan, Iran, and now in this book he sets his eyes on the People's Republic of China.However, this book lacks the excitement of Executive Orders (however, its difficult to live up to this book). I think Clancy did a hurried up job on this one (he even admitted he rushed through the ending in an interview in C Span).Its okay for Jack Ryan fans, but not all that good."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"just another one of clancy's \\"could happen\\" stories that could never happen. he is obviously talented at writing but his ideas and stories are so boring and pointless. some of his stories like the op center series and rainbow six are alright, but stories like these are trite and shouldn't even be considered \\"thrillers\\" they should be put together nostrodomous's [ideas] and labeled as wild prognastications. if you are looking into police or government books, i suggest you look into rainbow six and op center series. some of his earlier novels such as the hunt for red october is ok too"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"what a complete let down. after reading rainbow six, my first clancey novel, i was tempred by this one. bad move.in rainbow six at least there was enough action to laugh at the endless repition of cliches and sermonising.its a long uphill struggle to get to the end, when the action actually starts about 1000 pages in, it makes for the biggest possible let down.About halfway through you get to the point where you dread any piece of the story involving jack ryan or numerous other characters as you just know its going to be more ultra right wing sermonising which youve read already enough times before the end of the first chapter. the book would have been improved considerably by complete omission of jack ryan. what tom clancey needs is a good editor, and some respect for the intelligence of his readers."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was less impressive than the other TC works and in total, was a disappointment.Yet, I did read all 1100 plus pagesIt does have those great moments and what is a typical Tom Clancy plot- American military vs. bad guys military. But I found the first 700 pages worth devoting maybe 200 actual pages. The sexual overtones and interactions with the Chinese mole came across as amaturish and awkward. I also was annoyed by the many (probably dozens) of repeated scenes, comments, jokes, thoughts and one-liners. They are fresh once and after that - lame. A little help from the edit department needed.I would summarize the book as a fairly predictable plot that lingers on too long and then comes to a climax in a seriously doubful and unrealistic finish, but the way it set up it was predictable. Almost like Tom was going on and on with the story and the editor said &quot;Hey Tom, wrap this up we just passed a thousand pages&quot; I know it is fiction and all but come on...the POTUS goes from watching the war on TV (CNN) using the military's UAV- Dark Star and wisking away from the *** only to land on a dry-docked Aegis class destroyer, and watching the &quot;fireworks&quot; with the boys? It just wasn't believeable or convincing. The action pages (last 2-300)seemed like retreadded notes from previous books. I had the sense of &quot;I've read this before&quot;.In the end however, Clancy is Clancy and the theme was pure TC.I am going to backtrack a book and read Rainbow 6 and hope for more, but take notice if you are Tom or the publisher, I am going to buy another TC book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was the first Clancy book I've read and also the first one in English. It got me going and going, but as I looked back, it was looooooong and tiresome.I don't think anyone sould try reading it, it's long and not too intresting if you're looking to something thrilling.All in all is one of the good guys so think I'll keep trying his books out anyway."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon is more of a political statement than the other Clancey novels that I have read. I disagree with the political statement but the description of the thought process that Clancey uses is remarkable. I think that he shows a great deal of understanding of the thought process that other people use. The level that he is able to accomplish this is remarkable .The story though far fetched is excellent. Of course the idea that somebody would drive an airliner into a building was bit far fetched not so very long ago. The technical detail that he describes the weapons with is wonderful. It is interesting to hear about the same weapons on the news every night.I did not find this story as spellbinding as some of the other works I have read by Clancy but it is still a better book to buy than most of the entertainment books out there.I wrote the above before I read the other reviews. I would caution the potential first time buyer if all you get out of this is an American, Russia, Chinese comparison you ain't paying attention. The nationalities aren't representative of races as much as they are thought processes. And they are foils more than reality. This book is not about America versus them. It is a very, VERY detailed pro-life statment. Either that or I totally missed it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon By Tom ClancyHave you ever wondered how a world war could start? \\"...The distant dump truck. A man had been lying in the back. Now he rose and he was holding... it was an RPG.\\" This is a quote for the book showing the attempted assassination of the head of the SVR (the current day KGB of Russia) Sergey Golovko. This would bring about a world war between China, Russia, and the United States. The sides of this war, however, would be very different than what to be expected. The attempted assassination is only the start of the story. Soon thereafter, America manages to make a spy out of a secretary for a member of the Chinese Politburo (the Chinese governmental body). Then the reason for the world war comes along. The Russian economy is in shambles and there is no light to be seen at the end of the tunnel. However, a geologist team finds a vast oil field and a massive gold mine in Siberia. Both of these are the biggest the world has ever known. However, this is when Russia's luck begins to run out. China's economy is also going down the whole. The members of the Politburo believe that the only way to save China is to invade and seize the gold and oil of Russia. America has just found this out, by way of their spy. This is when the unexpected happens. Jack Ryan (The President) offers to help Russia. He gets them to join NATO and sends troops into Russia. The rest of the book describes the war between the three super powers. I would recommend this book to people who like action and war. There are however many different sides to the book besides the fighting. People who like spying or politics would also find this book enjoyable. It is also very enjoyable how the story is presented to you. You read the story through the eyes of many different people. One second you could be reading the story though the President and the next you could be at the meeting of the Chinese Politburo The only thing that might be hard for some readers is the length. The book is a tad lengthy at 1,028 pages and it is still only available in hardback. For those who become involved in the story there are several other Tom Clancy books that add much more enjoyment to this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's first book, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was probably the best and most scientifically accurate books of its genre. Clancy's grasp of military technology and tactics is close to that of a professional soldier and this shows in his books. However his undestanding of cultures and international politics is probably inferior to that of a redneck. When he sticks to writing military books Clancy is quite all right. This time he went too far into geo-politics thereby showing a dangerous ignorance which I hope is not shared by most Americans. The result is an implausible, racist book which tarnishes Tom Clancy's reputation."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},A=["disabled"],B={key:0},O={key:1};function D(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(e(!0),t(m,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(e(),b(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",O,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,A)):f("",!0)])}const j=d(S,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-1d3838ed"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/35.md","filePath":"people/35.md"}'),H={name:"people/35.md"},M=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(j)]))}});export{W as __pageData,M as default};
