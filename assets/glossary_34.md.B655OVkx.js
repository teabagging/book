How do you communicate your ideas to a client, and how do you accommodate a client s requests while maintaining the integrity of the project? The answers to these questions, and many more, can all be found in Understanding Garden Design. Most books on garden design focus on only one or a few aspects of garden design choosing plants or creating a hardscape, for example.

In fact, garden owners and clients of garden designers who want to understand more about the designer s craft will be able to profit from the book s lessons.

Practical aspects are clearly laid out, including working with contractors and staying on top of the various phases of construction. This thorough handbook is profusely illustrated with helpful photographs and diagrams. A particularly interesting tool is the hypothetical garden plan that appears in each chapter to show how to apply the topics at hand.

The distinctive feature of their challenge to theistic and specifically Christian belief is expressed by Paul Ricoeur when he calls them the \\"masters of suspicion.\\" While skepticism directs its critique to the truth or evidential basis of belief, suspicion asks two different, intimately intertwined questions: what are the motives that lead to this belief? and what function does it play, what work does it do for the individuals and communities that adopt it. What suspicion suspects is that the survival value of religious beliefs depends on satisfying desires and interests that the believing soul and the believing community are not eager to acknowledge because they violate the values they profess, as when, for example, talk about justice is a mask for deep-seated resentment and the desire for revenge. For this reason, the hermeneutics of suspicion is a theory, or group of theories, of self-deception: ideology critique in Marx, genealogy in Nietzsche, and psychoanalysis in Freud. Suspicion and Faith argues that the appropriate religious response (\\"the religious uses of modern atheism\\") to these critiques is not to try to refute or deflect them, but rather to acknowledge their force in a process of self-examination--and this for two reasons. First, while these critiques are not, as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud tend to suppose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w4ukywEACAAJ&dq=Suspicion+and+Faith:+The+Religious+Uses+of+Modern+Atheism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adrian Mole from Minor to Major: The Mole Diaries - The First Ten Years","description":"All the mole diaries plus the further diaries for 1989-1990.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xxQfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Adrian+Mole+from+Minor+to+Major:+The+Mole+Diaries+-+The+First+Ten+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire (Discoveries)","description":"This in-depth survey by historian Roux gives readers a clear vision of this incomparable leader and the achievements of his mighty empire. 130 illustrations, 113 in full color.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IaveOt6AllsC&dq=Genghis+Khan+and+the+Mongol+Empire+(Discoveries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stan Lee Presents Captain America: Man Without a Country","description":"Accused of attacking a U.S. military base, C aptain America has been removed from his position and exiled from the country.

In one clear sense it responds to the call for consilience by Edward O. Wilson. I agree with Wilson that there is a pressing need in the sciences today for the unification of the social with the natural sciences. I consider the present work to proceed from the perspective of behavioral ecology, specifically a subfield which I choose to call interpersonal behavioral ecology th Ecology, as a general field, has emerged in the last quarter of the 20 century as a major theme of concern as we have become increasingly aware that we must preserve the planet whose limited resources we share with all other earthly creatures. Interpersonal behavioral ecology, however, focuses not on the physical environment, but upon our social environment. It concerns our interpersonal behavioral interactions at all levels, from simple dyadic one-to-one personal interactions to our larger, even global, social, economic, and political interactions. Interpersonal behavioral ecology, as I see it, then, is concerned with our behavior toward each other, from the most obvious behaviors of war between nations, to excessive competition, exploitation, crime, abuse, and even to the ways in which we interact with each other as individuals in the family, in our social lives, in the workplace, and in the marketplace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7LSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scandal in Fair Haven","description":"When a bloodstained and desperate man breaks into her vacation cabin, Henrie O poses as his aunt and journeys to Tennessee to investigate a town's murderous secret","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=knzKiJ1s6JsC&dq=Scandal+in+Fair+Haven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Late Devonian Mass Extinction","description":"Based on two decades of research, The Late Devonian Mass Extinction reviews the many theories that have been presented to explain the global mass extinction that struck the earth over 367 million years ago, considering in particular the possibility that the extinction was triggered by multiple impacts of extraterrestrial objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xc70cveVCJsC&dq=The+Late+Devonian+Mass+Extinction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panorama of Paris: Selections from Le Tableau De Paris","description":"Panorama of Paris offers English-language readers an introduction to one of the forgotten masterpieces of French literature, Louis-S bastien Mercier's twelve-volume Le Tableau de Paris (published from 1781 to 1788), an important and original work that helped shape many kinds of French writing. Colorfully written, the text provides a fascinating portrait of everyday life in Paris on the eve of the French Revolution, describing the interactions of workers, street peddlers, prostitutes, police spies, actresses, noblemen, parish priests, servants, and criminals. Based on Helen Simpson's lively 1933 abridged translation, this edition includes seven newly translated chapters and an introduction by Jeremy D. Popkin. Earlier authors had described Paris's monuments and the lives of its wealthy elites, but Mercier was the first to try to capture in words the texture of its everyday life. His text, contemporary with Rousseau's Confessions, is the first attempt to write the autobiography of a unique urban community. His writing deeply influenced Balzac and other nineteenth-century French novelists and continues to serve as a major source of social and cultural history for French historians. Panorama of Paris will fascinate all lovers of Paris and its history. It should be of special interest to students of French literature and history, and to anyone interested in the origins of modern attitudes toward city life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dv1WaVU2_eoC&dq=Panorama+of+Paris:+Selections+from+Le+Tableau+De+Paris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lau's Laws on Hitting: The Art of Hitting .400 for the Next Generation; Follow Lau's Laws and Improve Your Hitting!","description":"\\"You need to work on your swing!\\" If this advice has ever been given to you, Lau's Laws on Hitting will spell out the professional instructions you need.

It argues that the central concern of Romans is with the question of justice, a justice that must be thought outside of law on the basis of grace or gift. The many perplexities that arise from thus trying to think justice outside of law are clarified by reading Derrida on such themes as justice and law, gift and exchange, duty and debt, hospitality, cosmopolitanism, and pardon. This interweaving of Paul and Derrida shows that Paul may be read as a thinker who wrestles with real problems that are of concern to anyone who thinks. It also shows that Derrida, far from being the enemy of theological reflection, is himself a necessary companion to the thinking of the biblical theologian. Against the grain of what passes for common wisdom this book argues that both Derrida and Paul are indispensable guides to a new way of thinking about justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RJu8fO9n808C&dq=Reading+Derrida+/+Thinking+Paul:+On+Justice+(Cultural+Memory+in+the+Present)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follow Me I: The Human Element in Leadership (Follow Me (World Books Paperback)) (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jrDNMyIhamkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Forbidden Face: Growing Up Under the Taliban: A Young Woman's Story","description":"In a moving tale of oppression and courageous defiance, sixteen-year-old Latifa tells her story of growing up in war torn Afghanistan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BrBBHQAACAAJ&dq=My+Forbidden+Face:+Growing+Up+Under+the+Taliban:+A+Young+Woman%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandalas For Meditation","description":"MEDITATIVE MANDALAS . . .

The legendary curator John Szarkowski, director emeritus of the Department of Photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art, has painstakingly selected what he considers Adams' finest work and has attempted to find the single best photographic print of each. Szarkowski writes that \\"Ansel Adams at 100 is the product of a thorough review of work that Adams, at various times in his career, considered important. It includes many photographs that will be unfamiliar to lovers of Adams' work, and a substantial number that will be new to Adams scholars. The book is an attempt to identify that work on which Adams' claim as an important modern artist must rest.\\" Ansel Adams at 100-the highly acclaimed international exhibition and the book, with Szarkowski's incisive critical essay-is the first serious effort since Adams' death in 1984 to reevaluate his achievement as an artist. The exhibition prints, drawn from important public and private collections, have been meticulously reproduced in tritone to create the splendid plates in this edition, faithfully rendering the nuances of the original prints. Ansel Adams at 100 is destined to be the definitive book on this great American artist. John Szarkowski is director emeritus of the Department of Photography, The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

It has not always had a proud past, however. In premodern times, atrocious physical punishment, exile, and unspeakable torture were the tools used all too often by those called upon to enforce society's correctional philosophies-especially the strongly felt need for vengeance. Important changes in correctional practice began around the time of the American Revolution when the purposes of criminal punishments were closely examined by influential reformers. More recently, corrections has become an important field of study in which scientific techniques are valued and reasoned debate is encouraged. The best, however, is yet to come. Only within the past 30 years have conscientious corrections practitioners begun to embrace the notion of professionalism-wherein ethics, a sense of high purpose, a personal longterm career commitment, a respect for the fundamental humanity of those supervised, and widely agreed-upon principles and standards guide the daily work of correctional personnel. Corrections professionalism, although not yet as well-known as police professionalism, has garnered support from policymakers and is winning respect among the public.

Spare the rod and spoil the chlid... Don't leave the table until you clean your plate. Life was tough for kids. It wasn't fair, and there wasn't even an 800 number to call. Times have changed, and experts have advised today's parents to treat their children with more kindness and understanding. Sounds good...but has concern for the child's happiness overidden parental responsibility? Many of today's kids are out of control, and parents are frustrated and exhausted. Modern kids are not only heard-they're often the ONLY ones heard, with adult conversation drowned out by endless choices presented to three year olds, boisterous squabbling by five year olds, or the battle cries of nine year olds playing war games. Mealtime in many homes has turned Mom into a short-order cook, catering to the likes and dislikes of each child, with little time to enjoy a meal herself. Spankings are out and \\"time outs\\" are in, but many a little kid feels free to express his frustration by throwing a few punches at Mom or Dad. Maybe it's time for a change. With dozens of straight talk examples, Maybe Mother Did Know Best compares the \\"old-fashioned\\" with the \\"modern\\" way to raise children and concludes that today's parents need a little \\"time out\\" from letting the children rule. Somewhere between the harshness of the old way and the indulgence of the new, common sense must prevail, with good manners, discipline, and parental guidlines pointing the way to a more harmonious family life for both children and parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fAIkGwAACAAJ&dq=Maybe+Mother+Did+Know+Best::+Old-Fashioned+Parenting+the+Modern+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Questioning the Bible: Guide to the Most Questioned Book in the World","description":"Everyone has questions about the Bible from the senior pastor of the big church down the road to the guest at the hotel off the interstate.

The puzzle is especially troublesome if we think of cases in which breaking the law is not otherwise wrongful, and in which the chances of getting caught are negligible. Philosophers from Socrates to H.L.A. Hart have struggled to give reasoned support to the idea that we do have a general moral duty to obey the law but, more recently, the greater number of learned voices has expressed doubt that there is any such duty, at least as traditionally conceived. The thought that there is no such duty poses a challenge to our ordinary understanding of political authority and its legitimacy. In what sense can political officials have a right to rule us if there is no duty to obey the laws they lay down? Some thinkers, concluding that a general duty to obey the law cannot be defended, have gone so far as to embrace philosophical anarchism, the view that the state is necessarily illegitimate. Others argue that the duty to obey the law can be grounded on the idea of consent, or on fairness, or on other ideas, such as community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EN2aX6uj27UC&dq=Obey!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honeybee's Busy Day","description":"Honeybee is very busy gathering nectar from the flowers to make into honey.

About one-half of the terrorists resided, planned, and prepared for terrorism relatively close to their eventual target. The terrorist groups existed for 1,205 days from the first planning meeting to the date of the actual/planned terrorist incident. The planning process for specific acts began 2-3 months prior to the terrorist incident. This study examined selected terrorist groups/incidents in the U.S. from 1980-2002. It provides for the potential to identify patterns of conduct that might lead to intervention prior to the commission of the actual terrorist incidents.

And you'll find that if your own lesbian relationship lies outside the  traditional monogamous couple  model, you're definitely not alone. You'll explore many multifaceted and multifarious love relationships, each one applicable to your own liking, if you so choose. You'll find successful models of relationship styles--regardless of your own orientation--from cover to cover, and you'll discover the pleasing polyphony in the many, many female voices of authorities on love and love relationships. Whereas other similar studies project the limited view of one or two authors, The Lesbian Polyamory Reader calls upon a broad scope of writers, professional women and academics alike. You'll see that outside the gay rights movement that currently pushes for a traditional, monogamous marriage model of gay couplehood, there lies pleasing multiplicity in the arms and hearts of lesbians worldwide. Specifically, this collection offers:  first person  articles--stories that describe a variety of lesbian experiences relating to multiple lovers in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s  how-to  articles--descriptions of the various polyamorous relationship configurations, including ways of dealing with jealousy  theoretical  pieces--the history of multiple relationships, the social implications of practicing a love style other than monogamous coupling, and safer sex considerations Much, much more than a book on personal satisfaction, The Lesbian Polyamory Reader also focuses on the social implications of this love phenomenon, bringing it into a more inclusive circle of discussion for lesbians, educators, and students of sociology and sexology.

Here she presents the authentic principles in a technical, no-nonsense pocket book specifically for architects. As clients become more demanding and the competition for projects heats up, the architect is well advised to have many strings to their bow. This practical guide includes line illustrations that present the principles of feng shui, the Chinese art or practice in which a structure or site is chosen or configured so as to harmonize with the spiritual forces that inhabit it, and their application in architecture through planning principles, services, building elements and materials, in an accessible, easy reference format. The feng shui-savvy architect can also benefit from feng shui's ability to match structures and land, and the peculiar capacity of authentic feng shui to forecast development-related concerns including cost overruns, quality issues - even worker injuries and trade disputes! The author explains feng shui from archaeological sources and evidence of practice in the east, contrasting it with what passes for feng shui in the west. She analyses the practice in terms of such concepts as western systems theory, viewshed, space syntax and the 'pattern landscape' theory of urban planning. For the first time, the Sustainable implications of feng shui design are explained with reference to the latest developments in behavioural and cognitve sciences, evolutionary biology and other western viewpoints.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wf8_dpGXPEsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indonesia Free: A Political Biography of Mohammad Hatta.","description":"Mohammad Hatta, the first Vice President and joint proclaimer of the Republic of Indonesia, was a man who devoted almost his entire life to an ideal. From his early years until his death in 1980, the issue of Indonesian freedom overshadowed all other aspects of his life. Hatta's biography depicts the dogged determination, courage, and optimism, required by an Indonesian leader if he were to confront a colonial power and win his country's independence. His life history also portrays the disillusionment and frustration a leader experiences when his life-long democratic ideal is shattered and the new nation reverts to a type of government similar to the one he had dedicated his life to transforming. Indonesian freedom meant more to Hatta than the attainment of national sovereignty; it also demanded an element of social reform. Freedom for Indonesia must also ensure the people's participation in their country's government. Independence must not bring to birth a nation in which the majority of the people would be powerless, as in the colonial period. Hatta's concept of democratic government and social and economic betterment for the people he named kedaulatan rakyat, people's sovereignty. Writing Hatta's biography has been for me an immensely satisfying experience. Since reading his anthology Portrait of a Patriot as a first-year undergraduate, my curiosity to discover more about Hatta has compelled me to research the life of this complex leader who walked in Sukarno's shadow but yet was a \\"powerhouse\\" in his own right. I have been aware that it was impossible to discover the whole truth about Hatta, for only a fraction of his life could be uncovered and recorded. There are also formidable barriers dividing me from Hatta, as I am neither an Indonesian nor a Muslim. I have tried to break down some of these obstacles by interaction with Indonesian people, by extensive reading of Indonesian texts, and by a study of Islam. Fortunately Hatta and I have perspectives in common which acted as bridges. I regret very much that I never had the privilege of meeting him, as he died just at the time I commenced my research. - Mavis Rose","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VmoSnSUU9QkC&dq=Indonesia+Free:+A+Political+Biography+of+Mohammad+Hatta.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Language of Saxophones : Selected Poems of Kamau Daood","description":"A long-awaited collection from a pioneer of the spoken word movement, these poems soar and sway with the syncopation and melodies of jazz.

Starting with paracinema or  badfilm   a movement that has grown up around sleazy, excessive, or poorly executed B-movies and has come to encompass disreputable and unworthy films  this trend has been evident in various formats: on television and in video-art, low-budget and straight to TV films, amateur and home movies. The proliferation of trash on screen can be seen as delivering the final blow to the vexed issue of taste. More importantly, it prompts a reconsideration of some critical issues surrounding production, circulation, understanding and teaching of  bad objects  in the media. This collection of essays, written by international film and television scholars, provides detailed critical analysis of the issues surrounding judgements of cultural value and taste, feeling and affect, cultural morals and politics, research methodologies and teaching strategies in the new landscape of  after taste  media. Addressing global and local developments  from global Hollywood to Australian indigenous film and television, through auteurs Sergei Eisenstein to Jerry Bruckheimer, on to examples such as Twilight to Sukiyaki Western Django  the essays in this book offer a range of critical tools for understanding the recent shifts affecting cultural, aesthetic and political value of the moving image.

Well, Cicero has some good news for you. In How to Grow Old, the great Roman orator and statesman eloquently describes how you can make the second half of life the best part of all and why you might discover that reading and gardening are actually far more pleasurable than sex ever was. Filled with timeless wisdom and practical guidance, Cicero's brief, charming classic written in 44 BC and originally titled On Old Age has delighted and inspired readers, from Saint Augustine to Thomas Jefferson, for more than two thousand years. Presented here in a lively new translation with an informative new introduction and the original Latin on facing pages, the book directly addresses the greatest fears of growing older and persuasively argues why these worries are greatly exaggerated or altogether mistaken. Montaigne said Cicero's book \\"gives one an appetite for growing old.\\" The American founding father John Adams read it repeatedly in his later years. And today its lessons are more relevant than ever in a world obsessed with the futile pursuit of youth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SSzFCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meeting with a great beast;: A novel","description":"On the surface, it is a straightforward narrative of one man's last hurrah - a safari deep into Africa, where, as he stalks an elusive and wily old elephant, King of the Forest, the cancer that is growing inside his body is also stalking him.

For 10,000 years the desert had been mined for silver, iron, and copper, but it was the 19th-century discovery of nitrate that transformed the country into a modern state and forced the desert's colonization. The mines' riches generated mansions and oligarchs in Chile's more temperate region and terrible inequalities throughout the country. The Norte Grande also gave birth to the first Chilean democratic and socialist movements, nurturing every major political figure of modern Chile from Salvador Allende to Augusto Pinochet. In this richly layered personal memoir, illustrated with the author's own photographs, Dorfman sets out to explore the origins of contemporary Chile and, along the way, seek out his wife's European ancestors who came years ago to Chile as part of the nitrate rush. And, most poignantly, he looks for traces of his friend and fellow 1960s activist, Freddy Taberna, executed by a firing squad in a remote Pinochet death camp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N3LhdPm4b4kC&dq=Desert+Memories:+Journeys+Through+the+Chilean+North+(Directions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Saint Coran: Traduction Et Commentaire de Muhammad Hamidullah Avec La Collaboration de M.

Reflecting upon the fate of Jews and Gentiles, Paul wins his audience to a vision of a God who always acts inclusively. The God who, in the person of Israel's Messiah (Jesus), has acted faithfully to include the Gentile peoples within the community of salvation, will not fail to see to the eventual inclusion of Israel as well. In the victory of grace displayed already in the risen humanity of Jesus, the original design of the Creator for human communities and for the world begins to come true. The interpretation of Paul's letter to Rome has accompanied and stimulated the path of Christian theology down to today. Romans touches upon virtually all main issues of Christian theology, as well as presenting a rewarding introduction to Paul.

The Anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner is not a theoretical system, but the results of research based on direct observation. As Steiner's research was so vast and conducted over such a long period of time, no single book can be said to contain the whole of his spiritual teaching. However, of all his books Occult Science comes closest. Steiner even referred to it as \\"an epitome of anthroposophic Spiritual Science.\\" The book systematically presents the fundamental facts concerning the nature and constitution of the human being and, chronologically, the history of the universe and humankind. Whereas the findings of natural science are derived from observations made through the senses, the findings of Spiritual Science, or Anthroposophy, are \\"occult\\" inasmuch as they arise from direct observation of realities hidden to ordinary perception. And yet these elements of humanity and the universe form the foundation of the sense world. A substantial part of Occult Science is taken up with a description of the preliminary training needed to make such spiritual observations. Given his energetic involvement in practical initiatives and extensive lecturing, Steiner had little time to write books. Of those he did write, four titles form an indispensable introduction to his later teaching: The Philosophy of Freedom (CW 4); Theosophy (CW 9); Knowledge of the Higher Worlds (CW 10); and Occult Science: An Outline (CW 13). Occult Science: An Outline is a translation from German of Die Geheimwissenschaft im Umriss (GA 13).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_h0b568j9lEC&dq=Occult+Science-+An+Outline&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HOLIDAYS AND HOLY NIGHTS : CELEBRATING TWELVE SEASONAL FESTIVALS OF THE CHRISTIAN YEAR","description":"This joyous, sparkling book opens the treasure chest of liturgical year to bring the creative power of the Divine into our ordinary lives here and now.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cNv5tXrV-K0C&dq=HOLIDAYS+AND+HOLY+NIGHTS+:+CELEBRATING+TWELVE+SEASONAL+FESTIVALS+OF+THE+CHRISTIAN+YEAR&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: Amongst the Olive Groves of Liguria (Windsor Selection)","description":"Painter and printmaker Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (160964) was one of the most technically superb and innovative artists of the Italian Baroque. Although he is best known for his evocative etchings that reveal a mastery of light to rival that of Rembrandt and Van Dyck, he also redefined the drawing and printmaking genres through the introduction of his monotyping technique and was among the first to conceive of the oil sketch as a finished work. Sadly, Castiglione s prolific artistic output has been largely overshadowed by his turbulent character and troubled private life. With this lavishly illustrated biography, leading Castiglione scholar Timothy J. Standring and curator Martin Clayton and seek to restore to prominence this forgotten master of the Italian Baroque. Drawing on extensive new research into court records and other documents of the time, Standring and Clayton have reconstructed the artist s life, from his arrest for murder that led to the estrangement of his contemporaries and the loss of valuable patrons to his eventual decision to flee the region. The story of Castiglione s life and important new discoveries about his art are presented here alongside one hundred brilliant reproductions of his oil sketches. Published to accompany a major exhibition that will debut at the Queen s Gallery, London, and travel to the Denver Art Museum in May 2015, Castiglione: Lost Genius is the first new publication on Castiglione in decades, and it is sure to bring his first-rate work and fascinating life to the forefront.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LrfsmgEACAAJ&dq=Extra+Virgin:+Amongst+the+Olive+Groves+of+Liguria+(Windsor+Selection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Peony Pavilion","description":"This is a complete English translation of a great love story by Tang Xianzu, perhaps the finest of the Ming dramatists.

In Ming dynasty China and early modern Italy, exchange was made through poetry, speech, and music; in pre-colonial India through magic, music, chemistry, and other arts. Yet like the art of courtesanry itself, those arts have often thrived outside present-day canons and modes of transmission, and have mostly vanished without trace.The Courtesan's Arts delves into this hidden legacy, while touching on its equivocal relationship to geisha. At once interdisciplinary, empirical, and theoretical, the book is the first to ask how arts have figured in the survival or demise of courtesan cultures by juxtaposing research from different fields. Among cases studied by writers on classics, ethnomusicology, anthropology, and various histories of art, music, literature, and political culture are Ming dynasty China, twentieth-century Korea, Edo and modern Japan, ancient Greece, early modern Italy, and India, past and present. Refusing a universal model, the authors nevertheless share a perception that courtesans hover in the crevices of space, time, and practice--between gifts and money, courts and cities, subtlety and flamboyance, feminine allure and masculine power, as wifely surrogates but keepers of culture. What most binds them to their arts in our post-industrialized world of global services and commodities, they find, is courtesans' fragility, as their cultures, once vital to civilizations founded in leisure and pleasure, are now largely forgotten, transforming courtesans into national icons or historical curiosities, or reducing them to prostitution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&dq=The+Courtesan%27s+Arts:+Cross-Cultural+Perspectives+Includes+CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imagination and Me Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beginning ASP.NET 1.1 with VB.NET 2003","description":"A guide to building ASP.NET web sites covers such topics as basic programming using Visual Basic .NET, reading from databases, reusable code for ASP.NET, Web services, and ASP.NET security.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vFjj_N5WG4sC&dq=Beginning+ASP.NET+1.1+with+VB.NET+2003&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Zodiac : Poems","description":"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award Black Zodiac offers poems suffused with spiritual longing lyrical meditations on faith, religion, heritage, and morality.

The panel, called the Gaither Committee in recognition of its first chair, H. Rowan Gaither Jr., emphasized the inadequacy of U.S. defense measures designed to protect the civilian population and the vulnerability of the country's strategic nuclear forces in the event of a Soviet attack. The committee concluded that in the event of a surprise Soviet attack, the United States would not be able to defend itself. The years following Sputnik and the Gaither Committee's report were a watershed period in America's cold war history. During the remaining years of the Eisenhower administration, the intensification of the cold war caused the acceleration of an arms race that dramatically raised the stakes of any potential conflict. The Gaither Committee was at the center of debates about U.S. national security and U.S.-Soviet relations. The committee's recommendations led to increases in defense spending and the development of our nuclear arsenal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eJJ4AAAAMAAJ&dq=Gaither+Committee,+Eisenhower+and+the+Cold+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enabling Romance: A Guide to Love, Sex and Relationships for People with Disabilities (and the People who Care About Them)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L3ZVPQAACAAJ&dq=Enabling+Romance:+A+Guide+to+Love,+Sex+and+Relationships+for+People+with+Disabilities+(and+the+People+who+Care+About+Them)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil's Sea (Atlantis)","description":"\\"They have invaded then thousand years ago when they destroyed Atlantis.

S. Marshal Nix","description":"Heck Thomas, Chris Masden and Bill Tilghman, the Three Guardsmen and E. D. Nix have been considered some of the best lawmen of the Old West. Heck Thomas came closest to the legend but he had a reputation of shooting first and serving papers on the corpse. Chris Masden's reputation as a \\"Trigger Marshal\\" is largely undeserved and Chris spent considerable time in prison himself. Bill Tilghman ran saloons and bawdy houses and did as much to break the law as he ever did to enforce it. The true story of Tilghman's death is completely at odds with what previous biographers have said. E. D. Nix billed himself as the \\"Fighting Marshal\\" and took a lot of credit for wiping out several gangs of outlaws in Oklahoma. What Nix did really best was cook the books. When his expenses for the U. S. Marshal's office rose from $25,000 to $218,000 per quarter federal inspectors were sent to examine the books. Nix was soon relieved for the public good. Samuelson tears away the veils of myth, legend and outright lies that have surrounded these four early Oklahoma lawmen. The truth is far more interesting than the legends. A must have book for anyone interested in outlaw-lawmen history. Shooting Star Press, 8962 Canberra Dr., Sacramento, CA. 95826.

In fact, most of the old rules and principles have proved ill suited to this new world. What's needed is a user's guide to the new economy -- a handbook for everyone looking to succeed in this new, fast-paced environment. In this single, highly unconventional financial reference volume, America's most trusted financial consultant and author of the bestselling Die Broke and Live Rich takes an aggressive approach to the new economy and tells you everything you need to know about money. The Die Broke Complete Book of Money is the definitive guide to modern money management. The man famous for turning conventional wisdom on its head expounds on the new rules for the new millennium with opinionated, hard-hitting, and informative entries on everything from accessory apartments to zero-coupon bonds. Pollan's clients are grappling with today's financial challenges -- and his advice is battle tested in the real world. Putting the old rules aside, he sees the worlds of consumerism, career, business, and personal finance as being inseparable -- money has to be considered as a whole unit rather than as different elements. And because he's a practicing financial adviser who deals with real people, he knows financial decisions shouldn't be made in a vacuum: emotions, feelings, and attitudes must come into play. By explaining what you should do and how you should do it, Pollan offers advice grounded in a hands-on, real-world approach that is easy to understand and simple to follow. Savvy, sophisticated, and succinct, this incisive and engaging book is filled with offbeat, practical advice that stems from Pollan's unconventional strategies. It is an indispensable guide to money for anyone who plans on succeeding in the new economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kMRqQAWq15UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Judaism","description":"\\"Judaism is one of the oldest religions in the world, and it has preserved its distinctive identity despite the extraordinarily diverse forms and beliefs it has embodied over the course of more than three millennia.

In this magisterial and elegantly written book, Martin Goodman takes readers from Judaism's origins in the polytheistic world of the second and first millennia BCE to the temple cult at the time of Jesus. He tells the stories of the rabbis, mystics, and messiahs of the medieval and early modern periods and guides us through the many varieties of Judaism today. Goodman's compelling narrative spans the globe, from the Middle East, Europe, and America to North Africa, China, and India.

Our guests who feel most comfortable here, and return year after year, are Gentiles.\\" So begins Natalie's fixation with the Inn and the family who owns it. And when Natalie finagles an invitation to join a friend on vacation there, she sets herself upon a path that will inextricably link her adult life into this peculiar family and their once-restricted hotel. The Inn at Lake Devine will enchant readers with the beguiling voice, elegant charm, and deft storytelling that have been hallmarks of Elinor Lipman's previous novels and have made her beloved by her fans. Her characters sparkle on the page and delight us with their wit and grace--even when anti-Semitism rears its head in Vermont and the tables are turned in the Catskills.

Kuhn's landmark idea of \\"paradigm shifts,\\" applying insights from cognitive psychology to the history and philosophy of science. Building upon the arguments in his acclaimed Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition, Margolis suggests that the breaking down of particular habits of mind of critical \\"barriers\\" is key to understanding the processes through which one model or concept is supplanted by another. Margolis focuses on those revolutionary paradigm shifts  such as the switch from a Ptolemaic to a Copernican worldview where challenges to entrenched habits of mind are marked by incomprehension or indifference to a new paradigm. Margolis argues that the critical problem for a revolutionary shift in thinking lies in the robustness of the habits of mind that reject the new ideas, relative to the habits of mind that accept the new ideas. Margolis applies his theory to famous cases in the history of science, offering detailed explanations for the transition from Ptolemaic to cosmological astronomy, the emergence of probability, the overthrow of phlogiston, and the emergence of the central role of experiment in the seventeenth century. He in turn uses these historical examples to address larger issues, especially the nature of belief formation and contemporary debates about the nature of science and the evolution of scientific ideas. Howard Margolis is a professor in the Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies and in the College at the University of Chicago. He is the author of Selfishness, Altruism, and Rationality and Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition, both published by the University of Chicago Press.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8AafTbNIKg8C&dq=Paradigms+and+Barriers:+How+Habits+of+Mind+Govern+Scientific+Beliefs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mending the Skies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bQoOAAAACAAJ&dq=Mending+the+Skies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travail So Gladly Spent","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6w7AAAACAAJ&dq=Travail+So+Gladly+Spent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History, Passion, Freedom, Death, and Hope: Prose About Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v3sgAQAAIAAJ&dq=History,+Passion,+Freedom,+Death,+and+Hope:+Prose+About+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Athos : Travels on the Holy Mountain","description":"The story of the author's journey around the Holy Mountain of Athos, combining travel writing, history and spiritual reflection.

The fact that health care work is inherently more stressful than many other occupations makes it vital that the problem of occupational stress among health professionals is addressed. CBT for Occupational Stress in Health Professionals goes beyond simply defining the problem and fills a gap in the current literature by providing clear and concise individual treatment interventions. In three parts, the book covers: an overview of stress in the occupational context the standard CBT approach to assessment, formulation and treatment a new schema-focused approach to treating occupational stress. The schema-focused approach presented here provides powerful tools for treating a range of work-related problems for which standard CBT approaches are ineffective. Case studies are presented throughout the book to illustrate the therapeutic approaches described. This book will be of huge benefit to clinical and organizational psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health workers, counsellors and anyone else involved in treating occupational stress. It will also have much to offer those who manage people suffering from stress, human resource workers and those who are experiencing work-related stress.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pweOAgAAQBAJ&dq=Happiness+is+a+Choice:+Moving+from+Depression+and+Anxiety+to+Christ-Centered+Optimism+(Minirth+Meier+New+Life+Clinic+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ehrlich and Torres Essentials of Dental Assisting, 3e","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gN1pAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ehrlich+and+Torres+Essentials+of+Dental+Assisting,+3e&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Paul II: A Marian Treasury","description":"Pope John Paul II has always been profoundly devoted to Mary, the Mother of God.

Drawing heavily on his own experience of living and working in Central America, Nelson-Pallmeyer shows how LIC victimizes the poor through various techniques: disinformation, manipulation of elections, economic exploitation, even--as with the contras in Nicaragua--outright terrorism. Low-intensity conflict does more than disable the poor. It also threatens U.S. democracy and undermines Christian faith. By integrating economic, psychological, diplomatic, and military aspects of war into a \\"unified package\\" designed to manage or block social change in the Third World, U.S. \\"special interests\\" use LIC to protect their elite positions and profits.

The subject of money had, since childhood, been quietly sidestepped, a shadowy factor whose private influence was impolite to discuss. This deliberate denial eventually exacted its price, however, when a sudden divorce left Perle with no home, no job, and a four-year-old with a box of toys. She realized she could no longer afford to leave her murky and fraught relationship with money unexamined. What Perle discovered as she reassembled her life was that almost every woman she knew also subscribed to this strange and emotional code of discretion-even though it laced through their relationships with their parents, lovers, husbands, children, friends, co-workers, and communities. Women who were all too willing to tell each other about their deepest secrets or sexual assets still kept mum when it came to their financial ones. In Money, A Memoir, Perle attempts to break this silence, adding her own story to the anecdotes and insights of psychologists, researchers, and more than 200 \\"ordinary\\" women. It turned out that when money was the topic, most women needed permission to talk. The result is an insightful, unflinching look at the once subtle and commanding influence of money on our every relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EY3iDeNvpzQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feminism-Art-Theory: An Anthology 1968-2000","description":"Hilary Robinson is Dean of the School of Art and Design and Professor of Visual Culture at Middlesex University London, having previously held positions at Carnegie Mellon University, USA, and the University of Ulster, Norhern Ireleand. --Book Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cZ-9BwAAQBAJ&dq=Feminism-Art-Theory:+An+Anthology+1968-2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endangered Species (Operation Phoenix #1) (Hardy Boys Casefiles, Case 64)","description":"Offers brief biographies, annotated listings of each author's works, and suggestions for additional reading","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ubHYRVKquEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets to Exceptional Living: Transforming Your Life Through the Fruit of the Spirit","description":"Do you want to learn the secrets to leading a powerful, effective, fulfilling and rewarding life -- one that will help others achieve their goals as well?

In Desiring Women, Karyn Sproles argues that the two writers in fact 'made' each other. Woolf and Sackville-West produced some of the most vibrant and acclaimed work of their respective careers during their passionate affair, and Sproles demonstrates how this body of work was a collaborative project - a partnership - in which they promised to reinvent one another. Sproles argues that in all they wrote during their affair - essays, criticism, novels, poems, biographies, and personal etters - Woolf and Sackville-West struggled to represent their desire for one another and to resist the social pressures that would deny their passion. At the centre of this literary conversation is Orlando, Woolf's biography of Sackville-West. Sproles restores Orlando to the context of Woolf and Sackville-West's discussion of gender and sexuality and demonstrates its importance in Woolf's oeuvre. Sexy and provocative, Desiring Women re-imagines Woolf and Sackville-West as daring, funny, beautiful, and bent on resisting the repression of women's desires.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEkHQkdmHWkC&dq=Desiring+Women:+The+Partnership+of+Virginia+Woolf+and+Vita+Sackville-West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lonely Crowd","description":"\\"One of the most important books of the twentieth century.\\"--Gideon Lewis-Kraus, New Yorker Considered by many to be one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, The Lonely Crowd opened exciting new dimensions in our understanding of the problems confronting the individual in twentieth-century America.

Effectively, this has helped the US Government camoflague its operations and intentions abroad ever since World War II.

Samuel Bawlf masterfully recounts the drama of this extraordinary expedition within the context of England's struggle to withstand the aggression of Catholic Europe and Drake's ambition for English enterprise in the Pacific. He offers fascinating insight into life at sea in the sixteenth century-from the dangers of mutiny and the lack of knowledge about wind and current to the arduous physical challenges faced every day by Drake's men. A cast of luminous characters runs through The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake: Philip II of Spain, Europe's most powerful monarch; Elizabeth's spymaster and powerful advisor, Francis Walsingham; the encyclopedic cosmographer John Dee; and Abraham Ortelius, the great Dutch mapmaker to whom Drake leaked his Pacific discoveries. In the end, though, it is Francis Drake himself who comes most fully to life through the lens of his epic voyage. Remembered most as a privateer and for his victory over the Spanish Armada, the Drake that emerges from these pages is so much more: a dynamic leader of men, a brilliant navigator and sailor, and surely one of history's most daring explorers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=olzgzqMSWpIC&dq=The+Secret+Voyage+of+Sir+Francis+Drake:+1577-1580&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lucky Sixpence","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Although understanding has increased in virtually all other areas of grief and loss, chronic sorrow has received scant attention. Chronic sorrow is a natural grief reaction to losses that are not final, but continue to be present in the life of the griever. This book views chronic sorrow in a life-span perspective, and reveals the effect on the griever and the people close to them. This book fills a void in the literature; and attempts to develop a comprehensive analysis of chronic sorrow that will secure its position within the field of grief and loss.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bpisAgAAQBAJ&dq=Chronic+Sorrow:+A+Living+Loss+(Series+in+Death,+Dying,+and+Bereavement)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Light Of Western Stars","description":"This eBook features the unabridged text of  The Light of Western Stars by Zane Grey - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)  from the bestselling edition of  The Collected Works of Zane Grey .

It transcends the boundaries between ordinary folk and philosophers and it over- laps with many academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, philosophy and theology. Actually, the quest is not essentially academic; it is a human quest, pursued by persons in every age. With this in mind, philosopher C. Stephen Evans takes a look at the human sciences and their contribution to this self-understanding. Evans first presents a basic problem in these sciences today: the attack on the concept of personhood. He reviews the contemporary understanding of mind and brain: Is a person only a thinking machine or a programmed organism? Then he evaluates the impact of Auguste Comte, Sigmund Freud, J.B. Watson, B.F.

A member of the traditional land-owning class that was rapidly seeing power slip into the hands of outsiders, Juvenal also creates savage portraits of decadent aristocrats  male and female  seeking excitement among the lower orders of actors and gladiators, and of the jumped-up sons of newly-rich former slaves. Constantly comparing the corruption of his own generation with its stern and upright forebears, Juvenal s powers of irony and invective make his work a stunningly satirical and bitter denunciation of the degeneracy of Roman society","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YQHZW9rFLaMC&dq=Satires+of+Juvenal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blank Bible (The Works of Jonathan Edwards Series, Volume 24) (v. 24)","description":"In April 1740, Jonathan Edwards, minister of Northampton, Massachusetts, preached a discourse on Hebrews 12:22-24 comprising eight sermons.

Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lionel: A Century of Classic Toy Trains","description":"Celebrate one of the most beloved toys of the 20th-century - the timeless Lionel train.

Since the ancient times, when manmade baths enhanced the gardens of Egyptian nobles, pools have been built as the ultimate symbols of luxury and leisure, providing a means of capturing one of nature's most elusive elements. Soon after the pool arrived in America in the nineteenth century, California became a mecca for pool owners, where many advances in pool design have been made over the last century. Reflections on the Pool presents 40 perfect pools in 100 brilliant color photographs. These include the vibrant, Mexican-style architectural design of Ricardo Legorreta and the avant-garde, sensational creations of John Lautner, and illustrate the theories of the renowned landscape designers Thomas Church and Isabelle Greene. Each section of the book features a type of pool, or an element of pool design. Pools imitating nature, lap pools, architectural or highly ornamented pools are discussed in detail, as well as historic pools such as Hearst's Neptune Pool at San Simeon or Thomas Church's vanguard kidney-bean-shaped design of 1948, and other early California examples that set precedents for the pools of today. The introduction outlines technical aspects of design, and gives a brief history of the pool, including the influence of Hollywood on its popularity. Whether you own a pool or wish for one, and wherever you live, Reflections on the Pool is a color-infused, fresh, and inspirational display of the boundless possibilities in pool design.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xkVSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reflections+on+the+Pool:+California+Designs+for+Swimming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Your Emotions: Instead of Your Emotions Managing You","description":"This new classic helps readers discover what the Word of God says about our emotions -- and how we can take control of them to claim the victory!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wOwyPAAACAAJ&dq=Managing+Your+Emotions:+Instead+of+Your+Emotions+Managing+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behavior in Organizations","description":"A Theory of Behavior in Organizations develops a theory for organizational behavior, or, more accurately, a theory of individual behavior within organizations of behavior. The book begins by discussing a series of general issues involved in the theory of behavior in organizations. It then describes the theory itself in three stages: first, the general structure of the theory; second, definition of the key variables; and third, the interrelationships between the variables. Subsequent chapters show how the theory deals specifically with such issues as roles, decision making, and motivation. The theory presented is a cognitive theory of behavior. It assumes that man is rational (or at least nonrandom) for the most part, and that as a systematic or nonrandom generator of behavior, man's actions are explained best in terms of conscious, thinking acts on the part of the individual. The theory deals with why the individual chooses certain alternative courses of action in preference to others, and thus it might properly be called a theory of choice behavior. Whereas the emphasis is on the cognitive aspects of behavior, considerable attention has been devoted to external, noncognitive variables in the system that play meaningful roles in the determination of individual behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_OxGBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keepers of the Kingdom: The Ancient Offices of Britain","description":"Describes members of the British court, including the Queen's champion, Yeomen of the Guard, Herb Strewer, and Lord High Chancellor","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8kXXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Keepers+of+the+Kingdom:+The+Ancient+Offices+of+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mind Out of Time (Five Star Science Fiction/Fantasy)","description":"This collection of short stories includes a novella featuring Angus McAran.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PWgWAAAACAAJ&dq=Mind+Out+of+Time+(Five+Star+Science+Fiction/Fantasy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (Text-book series in education)","description":"In this book, Dewey tries to criticize and expand on the educational philosophies of Rousseau and Plato.

The most powerful reflex points on the body are on the sexual organs.

By combining the classic Taoist sexual texts with modern reflexology theory, the author provides a unique opportunity for couples to practice sexual intimacy as an act of healing. Mantak Chia shows how to evaluate a person's sexual energy potential as well as how the size and shape of the sexual organs determine a couple's compatibility.

In his fourth collection, Andre Dubus revisits his central themes of infidelity and fallibility, exploring the minds of his characters with unflinching honesty and unfailing compassion.

Based on authentic history and real possibilities, this unique speculative narrative plays out the dramatic consequences of opportunities taken and examines the grotesque possibilities of a Third Reich triumphant.On 30 September 1941, the Germans fight their way into the ruins of Moscow and the Soviet Union collapses. Although Russian resistance continues, German ambition multiplies after this signal success and offensives are launched in Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Hitler's armies, assured of victory, make their leader's dreams reality and Allied hopes of recovery seem almost hopelessly doomed.David Downing convincingly blends actual history with the stimulating world of alternate events. The Moscow Option is a chilling reminder that history might easily have been very different.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w0dDDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Perfect Wedding (Disney Princess) (Pictureback(R))","description":"Cinderella needs help in planning her wedding, which is scheduled to be quite a big event.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x3T9_I0y1SwC&dq=My+Perfect+Wedding+(Disney+Princess)+(Pictureback(R))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blind Side","description":"\\"Lewis has such a gift for storytelling... he writes as lucidly for sports fans as for those who read him for other reasons.\\"--Janet Maslin, New York Times When we first meet Michael Oher is one of thirteen children by a mother addicted to crack; he does not know his real name, his father, his birthday, or how to read or write.

Therefore, they consistently employed strategies that emphasized the needs of the city as a whole over the wishes of particular groups or neighborhoods.

During services in Christian communities, the members of the congregation stand together to recite the creed, professing in unison the beliefs they share. For most Christians, the creed functions as a sort of  ABC  of what it means to be a Christian and to be part of a worldwide movement. Few people, however, know the source of this litany of beliefs, a topic that is further confused by the fact that there are two different versions: the Apostle s Creed and the Nicene Creed. In The Creed, Luke Timothy Johnson, a New Testament scholar and Catholic theologian, clarifies the history of the creed, discussing its evolution from the first decades of the Christian Church to the present day. By connecting the deep theological conflicts of the early Church with the conflicts and questions facing Christians today, Johnson shows that faith is a dynamic process, not based on a static set of rules. Written in a clear, graceful style and appropriate for Christians of all denominations, The Creed is destined to become a classic of modern writings on spirituality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N96YH3T1qLsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jojo's Story","description":"\\"There aren't any more days.

It's the best memoir I've ever read.   Oprah Winfrey  Will Smith isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . . An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.   USA Today Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Achievement One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smith s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale but it s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2ZNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Will&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wholehearted cooking: Simply delicious low-fat recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PfHaGAAACAAJ&dq=Wholehearted+cooking:+Simply+delicious+low-fat+recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inner Reflections (Calendar)","description":"Inner Reflections is one of the most striking calendars on the market, garnering more industry awards for design and printing than any other calendar.

These archive materials were not only collected by scholars, but also by the ordinary rural populace interested in their own traditions, by performers and their audiences. With its myriad voices, this body of source material thus provides new avenues for the researcher seeking to penetrate popular thought. What does oral tradition tell us about the way its performers think and feel? What sorts of beliefs and ideas are transmitted in traditional songs and narratives? Perspectives from the study of mentalities and cultural cognition research provide a framework for investigating these issues. This collection of articles works from the premise that the cultural models which shape mentalities give rise to manifest expressions of culture, including folklore. These models also become embedded in the representations appearing in folklore, and are handed down from one generation to the next. The topics of the book cover age-old myths and world views, concepts of witchcraft and the Devil stretching back to the Middle Ages, and the values and collective emotions of Finnish and Hungarian agrarian communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SV1wEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening To Abundance: A 31-Day Process Of Self-Discovery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HMffAAAAMAAJ&dq=Opening+To+Abundance:+A+31-Day+Process+Of+Self-Discovery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thought and World: An Austere Portrayal of Truth, Reference, and Semantic Correspondence (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy)","description":"Thought and World presents a theory of the content of semantic notions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u7HSvU-m_1kC&dq=Thought+and+World:+An+Austere+Portrayal+of+Truth,+Reference,+and+Semantic+Correspondence+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aura of Purgatory: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O8IMAAAACAAJ&dq=Aura+of+Purgatory:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After Eden: Facing the Challenge of Gender Reconciliation","description":"Written by an interdisciplinary team of scholars, this substantial volume offers a wide-ranging examination, from a Christian perspective, of the many complexities surrounding gender relations, showing how they have changed and how they still need to change if we are to be the men and women God meant us to be.

During the first 40 years Moses tried to serve God according to his own way which was the way he had learned from the world. So, during the second 40 years of his life, which was spent entirely out in the desert wilderness of Midian, Moses had to unlearn all he had learned previously, and also he had to learn God. Finally, throughout the entire concluding 40-year period of his long life, Moses was used by God as His faithful servant. Let us see that, like Moses, in order to be able to serve God, we must first unlearn all which we have learned from the world. Then, and only then, can anyone serve God. A true servant of God must be selfless and be absolutely obedient to God. He may suffer incessantly from others, but he will be approved by God. And this is all that matters.

Here in his classic debut novel, Wambaugh presents a stunning, raw, and unforgettable depiction of life behind the thin blue line. In a class of new police recruits, Augustus Plebesly is fast and scared. Roy Fehler is full of ideals. And Serge Duran is an ex-marine running away from his Chicano childhood. In a few weeks they'll put on the blue uniform of the LAPD. In months they'll know how to interpret the mad babble of the car radio, smell danger, trap a drug dealer, hide a secret, and-most of all-live with the understanding that cops are different from everyone else. But for these men, these new centurions, time is an enemy. The year is 1960. The streets are burning with rage.

The lists of clan, family and district tartans are as current as can be. The master \\"Tartan-Name\\" list has been revised and expanded by adding thousands of Scottish, Cornish, Welsh, Manx, Irish and non-Celtic surnames. Tartan is a living textile art form with a tradition that began in the Highlands of Scotland about the same time that Europeans discovered both their own minority cultures and the New World. Over the centuries the \\"Pride o' Tartan\\" has grown while the exodus of Scots and Ulster Scots to new homes continues even today. Millions throughout the world look to Scotland, Ireland or other Celtic areas as their point of cultural heritage. Tartan is the living, visible symbol of this identification. Every Scot is \\"color coded.\\" Recently, tartan has become a more universal symbol than purely Scottish. It has become synonymous with \\"identification\\" throughout the world. Tartan is used as corporate logos, by schools and universities, as well as football teams. Personal family tartans abound from Canada to Japan. Although not long associated with the tradition, tartans are now being designed for Irish, Cornish, Manx, Welsh and a variety of non-Celtic surnames and regions. English counties and other Celtic and non-Celtic areas of Europe, America and even China, Russia, and Japan now have \\"national\\" or \\"regional\\" tartans. Four maps supplement the text: a map of district tartan areas, a map of Irish districts, a map of Irish counties, and a map showing the approximate locations of major clans. Information is included on how to locate uncommon tartans, the meaning of color, the recording of tartans, and when to wear a tartan. Surnames are arranged alphabetically, providing quick reference to the right tartan for you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RaowpwAACAAJ&dq=Tartan+for+Me!:+Suggested+Tartans+for+Scottish,+Scotch-irish,+Irish,+and+North+American+Surnames+With+List+of+Clan,+Family+and+District+Tartans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleeper Vol. 2: All False Moves","description":"Ed Brubaker (b. 1966) has emerged as one of the most popular, significant figures in art comics since the 1990s. Most famous as the man who killed Captain America in 2007, Brubaker's work on company-owned properties such as Batman and Captain America and creator-owned series like Criminal and Fatale live up to the usual expectations for the superhero and crime genres. And yet, Brubaker layers his stories with a keen self-awareness, applying his expansive knowledge of American comic book history to invigorate his work and challenge the dividing line between popular entertainment and high art. This collection of interviews explores the sophisticated artist's work, drawing upon the entire length of the award-winning Brubaker's career. With his stints writing Catwoman, Gotham Central, and Daredevil, Brubaker advanced the work of crime comic book writers through superhero stories informed by hard-boiled detective fiction and film noir. During his time on Captain America and his series Sleeper and Incognito, Brubaker revisited the conventions of the espionage thriller. With double agents who lose themselves in their jobs, the stories expose the arbitrary superhero standards of good and evil. In his series Criminal, Brubaker offered complex crime stories and, with a clear sense of the complicated lost world before the Comics Code, rejected crusading critic Fredric Wertham's myth of the innocence of early comics. Overall, Brubaker demonstrates his self-conscious methodology in these often little-known and hard-to-find interviews, worthwhile conversations in their own right as well as objects of study for both scholars and researchers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M0aFCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karl Barth: Against Hegemony (Christian Theology in Context)","description":"Karl Barth was a prolific theologian of the 20th century.

What she learned about them will shatter every assumption you've ever had about the most notorious criminals known to man.Judging by appearances, Dr. Helen Morrison has an ordinary life in the suburbs of a major city. She has a physician husband, two children, and a thriving psychiatric clinic. But her life is much more than that. She is one of the country's leading experts on serial killers, and has spent as many as four hundred hours alone in a room with depraved murderers, digging deep into killers' psyches in ways no profiler before ever has. In My Life Among the Serial Killers, Dr. Morrison relates how she profiled the Mad Biter, Richard Otto Macek, who chewed on his victims' body parts, stalked Dr. Morrison, then believed she was his wife. She did the last interview with Ed Gein, who was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. John Wayne Gacy, the clown-obsessed killer of young men, sent her crazed Christmas cards and gave her his paintings as presents. Then there was Atlanta child killer Wayne Williams; rapist turned murderer Bobby Joe Long; England's Fred and Rosemary West, who killed girls and women in their \\"House of Horrors\\"; and Brazil's deadliest killer of children, Marcelo Costa de Andrade. Dr. Morrison has received hundreds of letters from killers, read their diaries and journals, evaluated crime scenes, testified at their trials, and studied photos of the gruesome carnage. She has interviewed the families of the victims -- and the spouses and parents of the killers -- to gain a deeper understanding of the killer's environment and the public persona he adopts. She has also studied serial killers throughout history and shows how this is not a recent phenomenon with psychological autopsies of the fifteenth-century French war hero Gilles de Rais, the sixteenth-century Hungarian Countess Bathory, H. H. Holmes of the late ninteenth century, and Albert Fish of the Roaring Twenties. Through it all, Dr. Morrison has been on a mission to discover the reasons why serial killers are compelled to murder, how they choose their victims, and what we can do to prevent their crimes in the future. Her provocative conclusions will stun you.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9N5Amj0-V7sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simulation Modeling and Analysis (Mcgraw-Hill International Editions: Industrial Engineering Series)","description":"Since the publication of the first edition in 1982, the goal of Simulation Modeling and Analysis has always been to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art, and technically correct treatment of all important aspects of a simulation study.

In this important new book, Karen Sell examines the disciplines pertinent to vocal pedagogy, tracing the lineage of views from the ancient world to the present day. In the process important diverse roots are exposed, yielding differing and even conflicting tonal ideals which have a bearing on the consideration of different singing methods and the interpretation of songs and arias. Ethics and psychology are identified as central to the entire pedagogical process along with the scientific basis of singing: encompassing acoustics, anatomy and physiology, with special reference to the bearing of the latter two upon vocal health and hygiene. A detailed consideration of singing technique is the centrepiece of the book, and an understanding of good technique and scientific awareness is shown to be fundamental to good vocal pedagogical practice. This leads to a discussion on performance and aesthetics, contributing to the education of the fully equipped singer. No study to date has demonstrated the inter-relationships between all these individual disciplines and the ways in which they influence singing pedagogy. Sells holistic, multi-disciplinary approach will be of particular benefit to singers and voice teachers, and will also appeal to music educationalists and professionals in cognate disciplines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rzMrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Byrne's Book of Great Pool Stories","description":"A unique collection of short stories about pool, billiards, and snooker by such authors as Leo Tolstoy, A.

Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","description":"by Maq Mannan President and CEO, DSM Technologies Chairman of the IEEE 1364 Verilog Standards Group Past Chairman of Open Verilog International One of the major strengths of the Verilog language is the Programming Language Interface (PLI), which allows users and Verilog application developers to infinitely extend the capabilities of the Verilog language and the Verilog simulator. In fact, the overwhelming success of the Verilog language can be partly attributed to the exi- ence of its PLI. Using the PLI, add-on products, such as graphical waveform displays or pre and post simulation analysis tools, can be easily developed. These products can then be used with any Verilog simulator that supports the Verilog PLI. This ability to create thi- party add-on products for Verilog simulators has created new markets and provided the Verilog user base with multiple sources of software tools. Hardware design engineers can, and should, use the Verilog PLI to customize their Verilog simulation environment. A Company that designs graphics chips, for ex- ple, may wish to see the simulation results of a new design in some custom graphical display. The Verilog PLI makes it possible, and even trivial, to integrate custom so- ware, such as a graphical display program, into a Verilog simulator. The simulation results can then dynamically be displayed in the custom format during simulation. And, if the company uses Verilog simulators from multiple simulator vendors, this integrated graphical display will work with all the simulators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3pEMBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1939 the Last Season of Peace","description":"First published in 1989, this is an account of the oldest of traditions. It was called the London Season, and for three centuries it had been a time of fashionable suppers and brilliant balls that introduced England's most aristocratic and eligible girls to society. Though by 1939 the stately gavottes and minuets had long since given way to waltzes and fox-trots, the cream of young womanhood still curtsied low before the Queen and then went out to dance the night away with the young men they would one day marry. But the Season of 1939 was different: it was to be the last. And like many a finale, it lives on in memory as a lovely, enchanted dream, all the more beautiful for the horror and destruction that would follow so soon. Based on a wealth of first-hand reminiscences, press clippings, and memorabilia, 1939: The Last Season of Peace is a fascinating portrait of this fairy tale about to end. It captures the end of an era as it recreates a world whose inhabitants still believed in empire and tradition. It is a vivid picture of a generation suspended in a brief moment of sunlit summer glory, before the gathering storm of World War II swept it all away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q8GZ2yUhvQQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945-1954","description":"in the confusing decade following World War II, comic books were all the rage.

While African national politics, economics, and law are all conducted primarily in the colonial languages, the cultural life of the majority of citizens is conducted in a bewildering Babel of local and regional dialects, making language itself the center of debates over multiculturalism, gender studies, and social theory. In The Power of Babel, the noted Africanist scholar Ali Mazrui and linguist Alamin Mazrui explore this vast territory of African language. The Power of Babel is one of the first comprehensive studies of the complex linguistic constellations of Africa. It draws on Ali Mazrui's earlier work in its examination of the \\"triple heritage\\" of African culture, in which indigenous, Islamic, and Western traditions compete for influence. In bringing the idea of the triple heritage to language, the Mazruis unravel issues of power, culture, and modernity as they are embedded in African linguistic life. The first section of the book takes a global perspective, exploring such issues as the Eurocentrism of much linguistic scholarship on Africa; part two takes an African perspective on a variety of issues from the linguistically disadvantaged position of women in Africa to the relation of language policy and democratic development; the third section presents a set of regional studies, centering on the Swahili language's exemplification of the triple heritage.The Power of Babel unites empirical information with theories of nationalism and pluralism among others to offer the richest contextual account of African languages to date.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6lQTPxdYx8kC&dq=Ceremonies+(African+Heritage)+(Multilingual+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird, Kansas -","description":"Kansas knows how to attract birds.

As a result of this unique combination of natural features, Kansas attracts most of the eastern bird fauna and many of the western and southern species, as well as those northern birds that either winter on the central plains or pass through during their migratory flights.

In art history, this time of artistic fertility is represented above all by the name Giotto, the great Florentine artist around whose work revolved the innovations in the visual arts in Italy, during the trecento, which shaped the course of Western art for centuries to follow. Italian cities flourished especially in the early decades of the century, as ambitious architectural projects were undertaken that demanded equally challenging decorative programs. Communal palaces and princely residences, new cathedrals and the spacious churches of the mendicant orders, all provided new tasks for painting, and especially for mural painting.\\" \\"Italian Frescoes: The Age of Giotto, 1280-1400 illustrates in detail the inspired responses to this challenge by Giotto, his contemporaries, and his successors. They undertook a continuous artistic exploration of new ground - in terms of figurative and narrative style as well as in the shaping of pictorial space and use of color. After an introductory overview, the volume begins with an in-depth presentation of the frescoes at San Francesco in Assisi, which became, in the decades around 1300, the great school of Italian painting, where Giotto, Pietro Lorenzetti, and Simone Martini, among others, created a new kind of painted mural and a new style of pictorial narrative. Expansive treatment is given as well to Giotto's masterful Arena Chapel in Padua, a touchstone of European art for writers and artists from Dante to Marcel Proust and from Ghiberti to Henri Matisse. Among the many other highlights of the volume are the chapels painted by Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, Maso di Banco, Giovanni da Milano, and Agnolo Gaddi in the church of Santa Croce, Florence; Ambrogio Lorenzetti's monumental allegories of good and bad government in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena; Buffalmacco's Triumph of Death and Last Judgment in Pisa's Camposanto; and, toward the end of the century, Altichiero's frescoes for the Saint George Chapel in Padua.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=obMyAQAAIAAJ&dq=Italian+Frescoes:+The+Age+of+Giotto,+1280-1400&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gorilla Hunters","description":"Ballantyne brings back his three principal characters from The Coral Island as young men in this story, where they embark upon a gorilla hunting expedition in Africa.

The palace itself has been radically altered since 1789, and the court was long ago swept away. Versailles sets out to rediscover what is now a vanished world: a great center of power, seat of royal government, and, for thousands, a home both grand and squalid, bound by social codes almost incomprehensible to us today. Using eyewitness testimony as well as the latest historical research, Spawforth offers the first full account of Versailles in English in over thirty years. Blowing away the myths of Versailles, he analyses afresh the politics behind the Sun King's construction of the palace and shows how Versailles worked as the seat of a royal court. He probes the conventional picture of a \\"perpetual house party\\" of courtiers and gives full weight to the darker side: not just the mounting discomfort of the aging buildings but also the intrigue and status anxiety of its aristocrats. The book brings out clearly the fateful consequences for the French monarchy of its relocation to Versailles and also examines the changing place of Versailles in France's national identity since 1789. Many books have told the stories of the royals and artists living in Versailles, but this is the first to turn its focus on the palace itself---from architecture and politics to scandal and restoration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K-Hn72aft-cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darwin's Children","description":"In the decade since women began giving birth to a new human species, Homo sapiens novus, the world has been in turmoil as these \\"new\\" humans battle for survival against those who feel threatened by this leap in evolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RT6Qv2aYdEsC&dq=Darwin%27s+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain Storms!: Out of a Torrential Past Into a Triumphant Future","description":"Co-written by award winning writer Shawn Regan and licensed clinical psychologist, Eleanor S.

For as long as historical records have been kept, the three-generation cycle of boom to bust has been the painful reality for nine out of ten families. Two thousand years ago in China the saying was 'wealth never survives three generations.' A century ago in Brazil it was 'from the stables to the stars to the stables' in three generations. Many cultures, one sad tradition of loss and failure. Watching your family's material assets fade away is bad enough; even worse is witnessing the damage done to individual family member achievement and family unity, in large part because traditional inheritance planning fails to address the Midas Curse. Perry Cochell and Rod Zeeb knew why so many families were failing. For them, the more important question was: what were the 10% of families who continue to thrive and prosper generation after generation doing differently?

From the late 8th to the 2nd century BCE, the oval storage jars typical of Judah were often stamped or otherwise marked: in the late 8th and early 7th century BCE with lmlk stamp impressions, later in the 7th century with concentric circle incisions or rosette stamp impressions, in the 6th century, after the fall of Jerusalem, with lion stamp impressions, and in the Persian, Ptolemaic and Seleucid periods (late 6thlate 2nd centuries BCE) with yhwd stamp impressions. At the same time, several ad hoc systems of stamp impressions appeared:  private  stamp impressions were used on the eve of Sennacherib s campaign, mw?h stamp impressions after the destruction of Jerusalem, and yr?lm impressions after the establishment of the Hasmonean state. While administrative systems that stamped storage jars are known elsewhere in the ancient Near East, the phenomenon in Judah is unparalleled in its scale, variety and continuity, spanning a period of some 600 years without interruption. This is the first attempt to consider the phenomenon as a whole and to develop a unified theory that would explain the function of these stamp impressions and shed new light on the history of Judah during six centuries of subjugation to the empires that ruled the region as a vassal kingdom in the age of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Babylonian empires and as a province under successive Babylonian, Persian, Ptolemaic, and Seleucid rule.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o9EtEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture (Studies of Nationalities)","description":"The first English-language book to present a complete picture of this intriguing East European borderland, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture, illuminates the perennial problems of identity politics and cultural change that the country has endured.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IVV9pZKrP2sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Write Great Fiction - Dialogue (Write Great Fiction Series)","description":"Craft Compelling Dialogue When should your character talk, what should (or shouldn't) he say, and when should he say it?

The book can be used as a textbook for an advanced course in theoretical electrodynamics for physics and mathematics students and, perhaps, for some highly motivated electrical engineering students. We expect from our readers that they know elementary electrodynamics in the conventional (1 + 3)-dimensional form including Maxwell's equations. More over, they should be familiar with linear algebra and elementary analysis, in cluding vector analysis. Some knowledge of differential geometry would help. Our approach rests on the metric-free integral formulation of the conservation laws of electrodynamics in the tradition of F. Kottler (1922), E. Cartan (1923), and D. van Dantzig (1934), and we stress, in particular, the axiomatic point of view. In this manner we are led to an understanding of why the Maxwell equa tions have their specific form. We hope that our book can be seen in the classical tradition of the book by E. J. Post (1962) on the Formal Structure of Electro magnetics and of the chapter \\"Charge and Magnetic Flux\\" of the encyclopedia article on classical field theories by C. Truesdell and R. A. Toupin (1960), in cluding R. A.

Each lesson contains warm-up activities, mini-dialogues, authentic readings, conversational relays, a cultural unit, examples of sentence patterns, and a vocabulary list. Two review lessons are geared specifically toward synthesizing and reinforcing the language and culture skills taught throughout the book, and footnote glossaries assist in reading comprehension. Written by experienced Chinese language instructors, Chaoyue helps students reach the preadvanced proficiency level within two semesters, or approximately 150 to 180 hours of course time. The preadvanced stage is comparable to a fourth-semester college Chinese course, or 250 hours of instruction. Unlike other language texts, Chaoyue is printed in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters, as well as the phonetic systems used in China ( pinyin) and Taiwan ( zhuyin fuhao). It also includes a CD-ROM with additional assignments and review as well as an online teacher manual.

But when Flora Trevelyan visits with her self-absorbed parents in 1926, it s not an escape she finds instead, it s a doorway into a different world, a different life, that she never knew existed. As the years pass, Flora embarks on a journey of discovery, from falling for three very different young men to understanding the follies of an upper class society of which she will never quite be a part to uncovering the difference between true friends and fair-weather companions. Along the way, her own life and those of her new acquaintances will be upended, and as the shadows of World War II fall over Europe, Flora will have to decide what kind of person she wants to be and whether being sensible makes sense. Praised by the Daily Telegraph as  delicious,  Mary Wesley s sharply humorous coming-of-age story weaves a tale of an unloved, neglected child who turns into a fiercely independent woman, both an entertaining romp and an astute glimpse into British society between the two World Wars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QXyNAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Functions and Graphs","description":"This text demonstrates the fundamentals of graph theory.

From two survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting comes a declaration for our times, and an in-depth look at the making of the #NeverAgain movement. On February 14, 2018, seventeen-year-old David Hogg and his fourteen-year-old sister, Lauren, went to school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, like any normal Wednesday. That day, of course, the world changed. By the next morning, with seventeen classmates and faculty dead, they had joined the leadership of a movement to save their own lives, and the lives of all other young people in America. It's a leadership position they did not seek, and did not want--but events gave them no choice. The morning after the massacre, David Hogg told CNN: \\"We're children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together. Get over your politics and get something done.\\" This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America--with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed. With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve. Born just after Columbine and raised amid seemingly endless war and routine active shooter drills, this generation now says, Enough. This book is their statement of purpose, and the story of their lives. It is the essential guide to the #NeverAgain movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7xVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hockey Scouting Report 2000","description":"Get comprehensive, insider assessments of more than 430 active NHL players from all 27 teams.

As he stared in awe at the scores of Soviet military aircrafts jammed into the tiny Riga International Airport he was decidedly less sure about whether joining the first group of Peace Corps Volunteers to serve in the former Soviet Union was the best decision of his life or his worst mistake. Was turning his back on a budding career as an accountant to work as an agricultural advisor in Estonia adventurous or foolhardy? And would he ever be able to fit into this totally alien environment? Armed with 100 pounds of luggage, a fishing pole, and a silent prayer, Douglas Wells sets out to find what had been missing in his life for many years, in search of adventure, in search of romance, in search of his \\"Peace Corps Moment.\\" In Search of the Elusive Peace Corps Moment ~ Destination: Estonia is an anthology of  fish out of water  stories about a young man from America s heartland struggling to find a place for himself in post-Soviet Estonia. Motivated by a will to make a difference in the world, he quickly finds out that doing so is much more difficult than he expected. Throughout his frustrations Douglas is able to maintain a sense of humor about the cultural gaps that must be bridged. Whether he is wrestling a prized sheep named Yeltsin, being stalked by an overzealous traffic cop armed with a new radar gun received as humanitarian aid from Texas, or cringing as a reluctant passenger in a car that is being driven 17 miles across the icy surface of the frozen Baltic Sea, Douglas never fails to recognize the irony of each situation, while at the same time laughing over his own angst. As Wells carries on the search for his elusive \\"Peace Corps Moment\\", he stumbles his way into some extraordinary events. He receives a commendation from the Estonian President for having recovered a national treasure that had been lost for 50 years, writes a song that miraculously finds itself in the number 1 spot on the Estonian pop charts, and marries the woman of his dreams. For many people, any one of these events might be considered life-defining, but in the end Douglas Wells recognizes that the true impact he made as a Peace Corps Volunteer extends far beyond his material accomplishments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_hTCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bedford Basics : A Workbook for Writers (3rd ED 98)","description":"In a workbook format, Bedford Basics incorporates a streamlined version of the text from the highly successful Bedford Handbook with lower-level exercises.

This theory is about extensions-primarily abelian-of \\"local\\" (i.e., complete for a discrete valuation) fields with finite residue field. For example, such fields are obtained by completing an algebraic number field; that is one of the aspects of \\"localisation\\". The chapters are grouped in \\"parts\\". There are three preliminary parts: the first two on the general theory of local fields, the third on group coho mology. Local class field theory, strictly speaking, does not appear until the fourth part. Here is a more precise outline of the contents of these four parts: The first contains basic definitions and results on discrete valuation rings, Dedekind domains (which are their \\"globalisation\\") and the completion process. The prerequisite for this part is a knowledge of elementary notions of algebra and topology, which may be found for instance in Bourbaki. The second part is concerned with ramification phenomena (different, discriminant, ramification groups, Artin representation). Just as in the first part, no assumptions are made here about the residue fields. It is in this setting that the \\"norm\\" map is studied; I have expressed the results in terms of \\"additive polynomials\\" and of \\"multiplicative polynomials\\", since using the language of algebraic geometry would have led me too far astray.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3LAJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That Was the Best Party Ever!

Fradkin read a book about a remote bay on the Gulf of Alaska coast. The noted environmental historian was attracted by the threads of violence woven through the natural and human histories of Lituya Bay. Could these histories be related, and if so, how? The attempt to define the power of this wild place was a tantalizing and, as it turned out, dangerous quest. This compelling and eerie memoir tells of Fradkin's odyssey through recorded human history and eventually to the bay itself, as he explores the dark and unyielding side of nature. Natural forces have always dominated Lituya Bay. Immense storms, powerful earthquakes, huge landslides, and giant waves higher than the world's tallest skyscrapers pound the whale-shaped fjord. Compelling for its deadly beauty, the bay has attracted visitors over time, but it has never been mastered by them. Its seasonal occupants throughout recorded history Tlingit Indians, European explorers, gold miners, and coastal fishermen seeking a harbor of refuge have drowned, gone mad, slaughtered fur-bearing animals with abandon, sifted the black sand beaches for minute particles of gold, and murdered each other. Only a hermit found peace there. Then the author and his small son visited the bay and were haunted by a grizzly bear. As an environmental writer for the Los Angeles Times and western editor of Audubon magazine, Fradkin has traveled from Tierra del Fuego to the North Slope of Alaska. But nothing prepared him for Lituya Bay, a place so powerful it turned one person's hair white. This story resonates with echoes of Melville, Poe, and Conrad as it weaves together the human and natural histories of a beautiful and wild place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-5iCh4OwDbcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Systems from Commercial Components(Paperback)","description":"A principal source of risk in component-based software design, say Wallnau and two other technicians at the institute, Scott A.

Maybe that's why it draws such an eclectic range of people. Certainly it was Big Bend's unexplored remoteness that drew Bill Wright and three high school friends on an Easter break in 1950. Since that earliest visit, he has returned to Big Bend again and again, finding sustenance in its spare, desert landscapes and in friendships with the people who have found a home there. In this book, Wright combines deeply observed photographs with a beautifully written text to offer an intimate portrait of the people and the land of the Big Bend. Covering an almost-fifty-year span, his words and images capture both the timeless quality of the region and the changes that have followed in the wake of increasing tourism and human settlement. The heart of the book is Wright's portraits of the people who have added unique chapters to the Big Bend story. From artist Donald Judd, who found the perfect setting for his work in Marfa, to Terlingua and Lajitas residents who gladly forego urban amenities to the Mexican villagers who have offered him hospitality, Wright explores why so many people have developed an almost mythic attachment to the Big Bend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L0ELAAAAYAAJ&dq=Portraits+from+the+Desert:+Bill+Wright%27s+Big+Bend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Production: Disciplines and Techniques","description":"This popular book introduces readers to the operations underlying video production.

From the reports of mystics to the observations of scientists, these passages have been arranged in this volume to provide brief glimpses into the recesses of artistic being, into the tentative formations in consciousness, the first glimmers of imagination, the distinctive faculties of the creative mind, and the tensions of artistic expression in the workshop and the creative life. Fitzgerald's great contribution has been to gather into a meaningful collection the words of 2,500 years of genius as a resource and inspiration for all those who would break out of creative limitations and take a bold step into the future. Illustrated with the art of the author and others.

The War in the Pacific begins with an examination of events leading up to World War II and compares the Japanese and American economies and societies, as well as the chief combatants' military doctrine, training, war plans, and equipment. The book then chronicles all significant actions - from the early Allied defeats in the Philippines, the East Indies, and New Guinea; through the gradual improvement of the Allied position in the Central and Southwest Pacific regions; to the final agonies of the Japanese people, whose leaders refused to admit defeat until the very end. Gailey gives detailed treatment to much that has been neglected or given only cursory mention in previous surveys. The reader thus gains an unparalleled overview of operations, as well as many fresh insights into the behind-the-scenes bickering between the Allies and the interservice squabbles that dogged MacArthur and Nimitz throughout the war.

If the objective is to explore the new economic map of India, then the distinct contributions in the book could be seen as twofold. The first is the analytical frame whereby the authors deploy a unique Marxist approach consisting of the initial concepts of class process and the developing countries to address India's economic transition. The second contribution is substantive whereby the authors describe India's economic transition as epochal, materializing out of the new emergent triad of neo-liberal globalization, global capitalism and inclusive development. This is how the book theorizes the structural transformation of the Indian economy in the twenty-first century. Through this framework, it interrogates and critiques the given debates, ideas and policies about the economic development of a developing nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jQO-DAAAQBAJ&dq=Transition+and+Development+in+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Ages","description":"National Bestseller This inspiring book by Wayne Dyer, author of the bestselling classics Your Erroneous Zones and Pulling Your Own Strings, delves into the teachings of intellectuals of our past to mine values and wisdom for the present. \\"What do our ancestral scholars, whom we consider the wisest and most spiritually advanced, have to say to us today?\\" asks Dyer. The answer lies in this powerful collection of writings, poems, and sayings by some of the greatest thinkers of the past twenty-five centuries.

Among the contributions are words on inspiration from Pantanjali, author of the Hindu classic Yoga Sutras; teachings about the power of prayer from 13th-century monk St. Francis of Assisi; and thoughts about the importance of action written by Mother Teresa.

They could hardly have been more wrong. The past century has seen the rise of quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, particle physics, and solid-state physics, among other fields. These subjects have fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. They have also transformed daily life, inspiring a technological revolution that has included the development of radio, television, lasers, nuclear power, and computers. In Quantum Generations, Helge Kragh, one of the world's leading historians of physics, presents a sweeping account of these extraordinary achievements of the past one hundred years. The first comprehensive one-volume history of twentieth-century physics, the book takes us from the discovery of X rays in the mid-1890s to superstring theory in the 1990s. Unlike most previous histories of physics, written either from a scientific perspective or from a social and institutional perspective, Quantum Generations combines both approaches. Kragh writes about pure science with the expertise of a trained physicist, while keeping the content accessible to nonspecialists and paying careful attention to practical uses of science, ranging from compact disks to bombs. As a historian, Kragh skillfully outlines the social and economic contexts that have shaped the field in the twentieth century. He writes, for example, about the impact of the two world wars, the fate of physics under Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, the role of military research, the emerging leadership of the United States, and the backlash against science that began in the 1960s. He also shows how the revolutionary discoveries of scientists ranging from Einstein, Planck, and Bohr to Stephen Hawking have been built on the great traditions of earlier centuries. Combining a mastery of detail with a sure sense of the broad contours of historical change, Kragh has written a fitting tribute to the scientists who have played such a decisive role in the making of the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zW3dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melissa Extract: The Natural Remedy for Herpes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q1CePsMdeeQC&dq=Melissa+Extract:+The+Natural+Remedy+for+Herpes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Overpass: A Journey of Faith on the Streets of America","description":"An updated and expanded edition of the gritty, challenging, and utterly captivating portait of the homeless crisis.

The details of Columbus's ships the Santa Maria, Nina and Pinta remain lost to historians, for the ships were built before the first manuals of shipbuilding were written, and no documentation or illustration has survived. Nevertheless, extensive research has allowed the construction of a number of replicas over the years, and those built for the 1992 celebrations are without doubt the most accurate reconstructions yet. Many years of research by Jose Martinez-Hidalgo and his successors into the Naos and caravels of the 15th and 16th centuries has allowed a whole new insight into the design and construction of the famous ships of Columbus. The Anatomy of the Ship series provides the finest documentation of individual ships and ship types ever published.

Needing a chance to recharge and regroup, Lark takes a few hours off to go birdwatching with her friend, Rachel Stanhope. But things go quickly from bad to worse when Lark peers through her scope and witnesses Esther's murder. The police assert that it was a robbery gone wrong, but Lark is convinced her partner's death has something to do with her business affairs. When Esther dies, Lark inherits the coffee company, and soon discovers she may now be a target of the killer. With the help of their birdwatching club, Lark and Rachel set out to unravel the clues.

Was it their fear of Caesar's tyrannical power? Or were these aristocratic senators worried that Caesar's land reforms and leanings toward democracy would upset their own control over the Roman Republic? Parenti (History as Mystery, etc.) narrates a provocative history of the late republic in Rome (100-33 B.C.) to demonstrate that Caesar's death was the culmination of growing class conflict, economic disparity and political corruption. He reconstructs the history of these crucial years from the perspective of the Roman people, the masses of slaves, plebs and poor farmers who possessed no political power. Roughly 99% of the state's wealth was controlled by 1% of the population, according to Parenti. By the 60s B.C., the poor populace had begun to find spokesmen among such leaders as the tribunes Tiberius Gracchus and his younger brother, Gaius. Although the Gracchi attempted to introduce various reforms, they were eventually murdered, and the reform movements withered. Julius Caesar, says Parenti, took up where they left off, introducing laws to improve the condition of the poor, redistributing land and reducing unemployment. As Parenti points out, such efforts threatened the landed aristocracy's power in the Senate and resulted in Caesar's assassination. Parenti's method of telling history from the ''bottom up'' will be controversial, but he recreates the struggles of the late republic with such scintillating storytelling and deeply examined historical insight that his book provides an important alternative to the usual views of Caesar and the Roman Empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PuwDLlf6OXAC&dq=The+Assassination+of+Julius+Caesar:+A+People%27s+History+of+Ancient+Rome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God, Marriage, and Family: Rebuilding the Biblical Foundation","description":"This updated, second edition of K?stenberger and Jones's landmark work tackles the latest debates and cultural challenges to God's plan for marriage and the family and urges a return to a biblical foundation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8l-zDwAAQBAJ&dq=God,+Marriage,+and+Family:+Rebuilding+the+Biblical+Foundation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steal the sun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p1dUAAAACAAJ&dq=Steal+the+sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business","description":"Offering straightforward information and insights for musicians of all level of experience, a thoroughly revised handbook provides up-to-date guidelines on music industry trends, details on pricing and legal issues in the digital age, how-to tips for do-it-yourself and independent musicians, and tips on royalties, advances, live performances, merchandising, and more.

Unfortunately, both sides are guilty of ignoring the individual in favor of the higher moral ground. No more. This book is designed to help people heal from their abortions on an individual level, and to finally be able to put guilt, shame, fear, doubt and other negative feelings behind them forever. Jennifer O'Neill's approach to healing is Christ-centered, showing post-abortive women that God still loves them, and that they should therefore love themselves. She should know--she felt guilt and shame over her own abortion for years. And she is not alone in that pain. This book: presents the symptoms of post-abortion syndrome (experienced by 80 percent of post-abortive women) incorporates a step-by-step, faith-based process for healing that incorporates Scripture provides true stories of women and men who have struggled with the affects of abortion includes resources for help and support Not just for the woman herself, this book is the perfect comfort and guide for people with friends, daughters or loved ones struggling with the after-effects of abortion, whether recent or long in the past. Key Features Focuses on personal stories of healing from more than 25 women, including Jennifer O'Neill herself. Takes women through a series of feeling--guilt, shame, honesty and grieving--that ultimately lead to personal and divine forgiveness. The central tenet is that God always loves you, no matter what happens, a message many post-abortive women don't get from their church communities, but which they desperately need.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGajAgAAQBAJ&dq=You%27re+Not+Alone:+Healing+Through+God%27s+Grace+After+Abortion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Bandits: Putting First Things First (LifeChange Books)","description":"Who Is Stealing Your Time? Each day, there are things you know you have to do. Then there are things you really ought to do, plus things you desperately want to do. But how do we find time for it all? Stuart Briscoe, former senior pastor of Elmbrook Church in Brookfield, Wisconsin, presents an outstanding commentary on evaluating our priorities so that the concerns of this world do not rob us of our valuable time. Prioritizing our lives isn t easy, particularly when we consider the conflict that can arise between doing what is good and being comfortable, popular, and profitable. But Briscoe calls Christians to boldly address any areas of selfishness and to begin to see life through kingdom eyes. When we do, our priorities will change to focus on goodness, righteousness, and truth.  But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.   Jesus (Matthew 6:33 ) It sounds great in theory to seek God s kingdom first, but is it really feasible? So many things rob your precious time that you wonder if you can afford to bump everything else in your life to secondary status. But this is not about prioritizing. This is a matter of heart. While you long for harmony in your harried schedule and significance amidst the busyness, God yearns to give them to you. Stuart Briscoe s insights will guide you to the focused, fulfilling life you long for. Because once you begin seeking the Lord before all else, all else simply falls into place. What are you waiting for? You have no time to waste. Story Behind the Book Stu Briscoe travels more than he is home, so time is a premium for him and his wife, Jill. He has found that the only way to stay focused on his life and ministry is to put first things first and not allow those things that attempt to steal his time to succeed. Upon further study, he has discovered that the right approach to managing his time and priorities is really to put the right things first. By putting God s kingdom first and seeking His will, everything else falls naturally into place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5FNATr5nsGcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pharmaceutical Patent Law","description":"Public health, safety and access to reasonably priced medicine are common policy goals of pharmaceutical regulations.

The contributors to this book, including academics, judges and practitioners from Europe, the US and Japan, explore to what extent patent strategies and life-cycle management practices take advantage of patent laws and health-care regulation and disrupt the necessary balance between incentives for innovation and access to affordable medicine and health care. Addressing fundamental questions in the field of pharmaceutical innovation, this book will appeal to scholars and practitioners in intellectual property, competition law and life sciences regulation, as well as pharmaceutical companies and regulators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yQICAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unscripted: World Wrestling Entertainment","description":"This record of World Wrestling Entertainment explores the inner workings of the WWE and the day-to-day lives of its stars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tlhUzQEACAAJ&dq=Unscripted:+World+Wrestling+Entertainment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mistress for a Night (Harlequin Presents 2094) (Do Not Disturb)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sqAoAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Won't Somebody Play With Me?","description":"A young girl imagines terrible punishments for her three best friends who won't play with her on her birthday.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GsrQAQAACAAJ&dq=Won%27t+Somebody+Play+With+Me%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1947, when all hell broke loose in baseball","description":"The veteran American sportscaster recounts the leading events of a milestone year for major-league baseball--the Yankee-Dodger World Series, Leo Durocher's suspension, and the entry of Jackie Robinson","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AN3tAAAAMAAJ&dq=1947,+when+all+hell+broke+loose+in+baseball&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cars of Pacific Electric, Vol. 1: City & Suburban Cars (Special 28)","description":"This book presents a thorough survey of electric railway development from the earliest days of the London Underground to modern electrified main line trains.

When soldiers found themselves surrounded by privation, disease, and death, many risked their standing in the army, and ultimately their lives, for a warm cup of coffee or pinch of tobacco during a sleepless shift on picket duty, to receive a newspaper from a \\"Yank\\" or \\"Johnny,\\" or to stop the relentless picket fire while in the trenches. In Friendly Enemies Lauren K. Thompson analyzes the relations and fraternization of American soldiers on opposing sides of the battlefield and argues that these interactions represented common soldiers' efforts to fight the war on their own terms. Her study reveals that despite different commanders, terrain, and outcomes on the battlefield, a common thread emerges: soldiers constructed a space to lessen hostilities and make their daily lives more manageable. Fraternization allowed men to escape their situation briefly and did not carry the stigma of cowardice. Because the fraternization was exclusively between white soldiers, it became the prototype for sectional reunion after the war--a model that avoided debates over causation, honored soldiers' shared sacrifice, and promoted white male supremacy. Friendly Enemies demonstrates how relations between opposing sides were an unprecedented yet highly significant consequence of mid-nineteenth-century civil warfare.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GTfsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genetics and the Manipulation of Life: The Forgotten Factor of Context (Renewal in Science)","description":"A provocative work that challenges our common assumptions about nature and science, this book is for all who want to understand the biological revolution of the late twentieth century.

From simple numerology to complex biblical allusions, from deciphering commission names to recognizing parallels in historical texts, Our Man in Judea presents a new or perhaps ancient understanding of Jesus' heritage, mission, and fate.

Lincoln was a marvelous writer from the humblest letter to his great speeches, including his inaugural addresses, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address. His sentences were so memorably crafted that many resonate across the years. \\"Fourscore and seven years ago,\\" begins the Gettysburg Address, \\"our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\" In 1940, the prolific author and historian Philip Van Doren Stern produced this volume as a guide to Lincoln's life through his writings. Stern's \\"Life of Abraham Lincoln\\" is a full biography of the man and includes a detailed chronology. Stern has collected all the essential texts of Lincoln's public life, from his first public address a stump speech in New Salem, Illinois, in 1832 for an election he went on to lose to his last piece of public writing, a pass to a congressman who was to visit the president the day after Lincoln went to Ford's Theater on April 14, 1865. Some 275 such documents are collected and placed in their historical context. Together with the \\"Life\\" and the Introduction, \\"Lincoln in His Writings,\\" by noted historian Allan Nevins, they give a full and vivid picture of Abraham Lincoln.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-GFPijIZDzoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Piece of My Heart: The Stories of 26 American Women Who Served in Vietnam","description":" Records the memories of a war in the words of those women courageous enough to walk into hell.

Superminds are capable of processing information not only at and below the level of Turing machines (standard computers), but above that level (the \\"Turing Limit\\"), as information processing devices that have not yet been (and perhaps can never be) built, but have been mathematically specified; these devices are known as super-Turing machines or hypercomputers. Superminds, as explained herein, also have properties no machine, whether above or below the Turing Limit, can have. The present book is the third and pivotal volume in Bringsjord's supermind quartet; the first two books were What Robots Can and Can't Be (Kluwer) and AI and Literary Creativity (Lawrence Erlbaum). The final chapter of this book offers eight prescriptions for the concrete practice of AI and cognitive science in light of the fact that we are superminds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bqG-BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Season of Reckoning (Mountain War Trilogy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Expendable! The Story of Prairie Bible Institute","description":"How are Baptists distinctive as a Christian denomination? Canadian Baptists, confronted with the question of discovering a common identity from the welter of strands of influence that make up their heritage, may infer several answers from the essays in Memory and Hope. Focussing on Baptist history in central and western Canada, Memory and Hope discusses individuals, institutions and issues that have stirred Baptists in North America for two centuries, including confessionalism and eucharistic theology and fundamentalism vs. modernism. Recurring themes include the Baptist role in education in Canada, the establishment of new churches, overseas missions and social responsibility. Essayists also examine the powerful forces that have influenced Baptist history: immigration, theology and society. Studies of missionary Samuel Stearns Day, fundamentalists Aberhart, Maxwell and Shields and social gospellers Sharpe and Shaw illustrate the diversity of ideas and personalities that have shaped and been shaped by the Baptist Church. Memory and Hope is an important resource for the history of the Baptist Church in Canada. In the issues it raises on the role of churches in the twenty-first century, it will also make a significant contribution to the study of religion in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gUs9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Volkswagen Type 3 Technical Manual: A Comprehensive Technical Manual for Engineers, Mechanics & Owners (Henry Elfrink)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GWddmgEACAAJ&dq=Volkswagen+Type+3+Technical+Manual:+A+Comprehensive+Technical+Manual+for+Engineers,+Mechanics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wandering Soul Murders","description":"Murder is the last thing on Joanne Kilbourn's mind on a perfect morning in May.

From the Danish invasion of Britain in 1016, to the Suez crisis in 1956, the key moments include victories (or defeats) both at home and abroad, plague, reform and even revolutions that have reshaped the British way of life. Each contribution brings the past to life, offering new perspectives and food for debate: did the Battle of Agincourt change England's role in Europe?

In 1940 Hitler sent his troops to execute the Fall of France. A six-week battle with lightning 'blitzkrieg' warfare and combined operations techniques, the offensive ended the Phony War and sent the French forces reeling as their government fled from occupied Paris. For the Axis, it was a dramatic victory. But how was this spectacular result possible? In To Lose a Battle Alistair Horne tells the day-by-day, moment-by-moment story of the battle, sifted from the vast Nazi archives and the fragmentary records of the beaten Allies. Using eye-witness accounts of battle operations and personal memoirs of leading figures on both sides, this book steps far beyond the confines of military accounts to form a major contribution to our understanding of this important period in European history. 'Alistair Horne really brings home the pathos and human folly of war, and he writes brilliantly' The Times 'Horne follows his line unfalteringly. All the details are there: the small, fleeting triumphs, the greater disasters, the bravery, the cowardice, the stupidity and the intelligence ... that make war so fascinating and so terrible' Economist 'Horne completes his masterly trilogy ... the definitive account of one of the most efficient and astonishing campaigns of all time' The Times Literary Supplement One of Britain's greatest historians, Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, is the author of a trilogy on the rivalry between France and Germany, The Price of Glory, The Fall of Paris and To Lose a Battle, as well as a two-volume life of Harold Macmillan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BopPEAAAQBAJ&dq=TO+LOSE+A+BATTLE,+FRANCE+1940&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Syntactic structures (Janua linguarum :)","description":"Noam Chomsky's first book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of scientific theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is understood by experts in those fields.

Between 1785 and 1800 colonization continued with the arrival of Loyalists and other settlers, including a contingent of German mercenaries who fought for George III during the American Revolution. Pioneers continued to come in large numbers to the unsettled areas of the province for the next 75 years and these later settlers often suffered hardships greater than those experienced by the Loyalists. This is the story of these early settlements in Upper Canada. The author, a distinguished Canadian historian, has drawn on contemporary letters, diaries, newspapers, and periodicals; he has consulted all the existing histories, and has supplemented these researches with interviews with persons who had contacts with early life in the province. The numerous illustrations included accurately depict the era. This book was originally part of Early Life in Upper Canada, by far the finest social and economic history of the area yet compiled.

The hatchet, the saw, and the plane are the three primal implements of the carpenter. The value is in knowing how to use them. The institution of Manual Training Schools everywhere is but a tardy recognition of the value of systematic training in the use of tools. There is no branch of industry which needs such diversification, in order to become efficient. The skill of the blacksmith is centered in his ability to forge, to weld, and to temper; that of the machinist depends upon the callipered dimensions of his product; the painter in his taste for harmony; the mason on his ability to cut the stone accurately; and the plasterer to produce a uniform surface. But the carpenter must, in order to be an expert, combine all these qualifications, in a greater or less degree, and his vocation may justly be called the King of Trades. Rightly, therefore, it should be cultivated in order to learn the essentials of manual training work. But there is another feature of the utmost importance and value, which is generally overlooked, and on which there is placed too little stress, even in many of the manual training schools. The training of the mind has been systematized so as to bring into operation the energies of all the brain cells. Manual training to be efficient should, at the same time, be directed into such channels as will most widely stimulate the muscular development of the child, while at the same time cultivating his mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0W7HvAEACAAJ&dq=Carpentry+for+Boys+(The+How-To-Do-It+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spectrum Guide to Ethiopia (The Spectrum Guides Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uSjKAgAACAAJ&dq=Spectrum+Guide+to+Ethiopia+(The+Spectrum+Guides+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All about the stars (Allabout books)","description":"Here is a book explaining how the stars -- including our sun -- influence our lives, how the star network fits together and history of some of the astronomers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pzPTtgAACAAJ&dq=All+about+the+stars+(Allabout+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literary Landscapes: Walking Tours in Great Britain and Ireland","description":"Literary Landscapes is for readers, writers, romantics, and lovers of all things literary, but above all, it will be a source of special pleasure to the tourist of Great Britain and Ireland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MzqaAAAAIAAJ&dq=Literary+Landscapes:+Walking+Tours+in+Great+Britain+and+Ireland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lifeguarding: a Memoir of Secrets, Swimming, and the South","description":"In her sharply observed and ultimately redemptive memoir, Catherine McCall paints a vivid and sometimes heartbreaking portrait of growing up in a complicated Southern family, whose perfect fa?ade hides crippling imperfections.

Rogers, senior baseball writer for the Chicago Tribune, describes the gamble general manager Ken Williams took in breaking up a powerful but plodding team in favor of one built around pitching, speed and defense. A team, in other words, that could play the game the way manager Ozzie Guillen wanted it played. In Guillen, the Sox found themselves a charismatic, live-wire leader whose every move seemed golden. Rogers provides a front-row view of the eccentric genius the second-year manager displayed in delivering Chicago its first World Series since 1959 and its first Series title since 1917. There's the rock-steady Paul Konerko, whose big bat and steely clubhouse presence carried the team through the postseason. There's the unsung third basemen Joe Crede, whose spectacular fielding and timely hitting on baseball's biggest stage stamped him as a rising star. There's the irascible catcher A.J. Pierzynski, the \\"Eddie Haskell\\" of the clubhouse, who found himself smack in the middle of every controversy. There's the fire of Bobby Jenks and the guile of Orlando \\"El Duque\\" Hernandez. And finally there's a deep and talented pitching staff that saw the team through its only rough spot of the regular season and then was simply dominant through all three founds of the postseason. The 2005 White Sox were a uniquely multi-cultural group that reflected their city's ethnic melting pot. They truly were Chicago's team--and they gave their fans a truly magical season.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aXsvAQAAQBAJ&dq=Say+It%27s+So:+The+Chicago+White+Sox%27s+Magical+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Worry, Be Happy","description":"'Don't hurry, don't worry.

Published in 1997, the bestselling Buffettology was written specifically for investors in the midst of a long bull market. Since then we've seen the internet bubble burst, the collapse of Enron, and investors scrambling to move their assets -- what remains of them -- back to the safety of traditional blue chip companies. As price peaks turned into troughs, worried investors wondered if there was any constant in today's volatile market. The answer is yes: Warren Buffett's value investing strategies make money. The New Buffettology is the first guide to Warren Buffett's selective contrarian investment strategy for exploiting down stocks -- a strategy that has made him the nation's second-richest person. Designed to teach investors how to decipher and use financial information the way Buffett himself does, this book guides investors through opportunity-rich bear markets, walking them step-by-step through the equations and formulas Buffett uses to determine what to buy, what to sell -- and when. Authors Mary Buffett and David Clark explore Buffett's recent investments in detail, proving time and again that his strategy has earned enormous profits at a time no one expects them to -- and with almost zero risk to his capital. In short, The New Buffettology is an essential companion to the original Buffettology, a road map to investment success in the worst of times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=COhQRkmYD_sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intrepid Voyagers : Stories of the World's Most Adventurous Sailors","description":"Stories of the World's Most Adventurous SailorsEdited by Tom LochhaasAs vivid and engrossing as great sea fiction, Intrepid Voyagers captures the real-life adventures of fifteen legendary long-distance sailors--men and women who have sailed to the ends of the earth and returned to write about it.

Rubenstein reconstructs the cultural milieu of the rabbinic academy that produced the Babylonian Talmud, or Bavli, which quickly became the authoritative text of rabbinic Judaism and remains so to this day. Unlike the rabbis who had earlier produced the shorter Palestinian Talmud (the Yerushalmi) and who had passed on their teachings to students individually or in small and informal groups, the anonymous redactors of the Bavli were part of a large institution with a distinctive, isolated, and largely undocumented culture. The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud explores the cultural world of these Babylonian rabbis and their students through the prism of the stories they included in the Bavli, showing how their presentation of earlier rabbinic teachings was influenced by their own values and practices. Among the topics explored in this broad-ranging work are the hierarchical structure of the rabbinic academy, the use of dialectics in teaching, the functions of violence and shame within the academy, the role of lineage in rabbinic leadership, the marital and family lives of the rabbis, and the relationship between the rabbis and the rest of the Jewish population. This book provides a unique and new perspective on the formative years of rabbinic Judaism and will be essential reading for all students of the Talmud. -- Michael Satlow, Brown University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GwM5T5YvMTwC&dq=The+Culture+of+the+Babylonian+Talmud&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reality and Mystical Experience","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Writing Talk: Paragraphs and Short Essays With Readings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qI_gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Writing+Talk:+Paragraphs+and+Short+Essays+With+Readings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Like Mary","description":"Even the youngest child can learn from Mary's example.

The book provides a different perspective to admire the best facet of one of the largest cities in South America and to enjoy it with the dignity that only height can provide. From north to south and from east to west, \\"Bogot from the Air\\" is a due homage to the city that is capable of bringing as many emotions as people together. The book is the testimony of an evolutionary model that has turned the city, over the past forty years, into an urban centre in constant growth, improvement and expansion. However, the city's evolution has managed to maintain the individual, the citizen, at the heart of this process. Far from turning the city into a huge stone mass of asphalt and buildings, its development renews it and floods it with vitality, considering the fact that it breathes, feeds and lives. The traditional barrios, parks, historical and cultural centres dress up Bogot in its most splendorous gown to show it from a perspective that its early settlers could have never imagined 500 years ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8sEuS-f0yKQC&dq=Bogota+from+the+Air&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady Chosen (Bastion Club)","description":"Stephanie Laurens # 1 New York Times bestselling author creates an unforgettable tale of love and mystery and introduces that band of former special agents known as the Bastion Club Tristan Wemyss, Earl of Trentham, has a most unexpected challenge: like all men of his class he must find a suitable wife, but within a year, and if he fails he must forfeit his inheritance.

An uneasy mix of scholarship, showbiz, and aggressive marketing, \\"A Modern Bestiary\\" will be a joint venture of the Met and the American Museum of Natural History.

Do your kids understand your money values? Do you and your mate agree on how you spend and invest your money? Do you know if your parents are financially secure? These are the questions that Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz and her father, Charles Schwab, ask at the beginning of this invaluable family financial primer. The authors acknowledge that these are difficult questions but stress that families must grapple with them and come up with answers.

The authors are both working parents with a combined sixty-five years of knowledge and experience in the investment field. In this book they present a road map that every family can follow as they develop and implement an investment strategy and money-management plan. They begin by covering the fundamental principles that every investor needs to understand in order to succeed for the long term, and then they move on to cover joining forces in marriage; building your family s wealth regardless of market conditions; investing for your children s future and raising money-savvy kids; retirement planning; estate planning for you and your parents; and dealing with the unexpected insurance, divorce, and investing a windfall. Throughout the book, the authors offer advice about how to start the often difficult conversations that lead to smart decision-making, as well as how to talk gently, intelligently, and respectfully about the many issues that define and shape our attitudes about money. It does pay to talk.

Sharing the information on the reacquaintance forms along with a two day period of getting to know one another again served as the spark for Bob and Toni to cement their marriage and make a commitment for the future. Follow Bob's easy 48 hour plan and remember why you and your spouse planned to be together forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PfF4SHQKdIoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gerald Massey's Lectures","description":"Includes: The Historical Jesus and Mythical Christ; Paul the Gnostic Opponent of Peter; The 'Logia of the Lord'; Gnostic and Histoic Christianity; The Hebrew and Other Creations; In Reply to Professor A.

New Testament Images","description":"In this follow-up to his popular book What Are We Hoping For? New Testament Images, Daniel J. Harrington extends his reflections on hope in the Scriptures. He draws us into the striking images of the psalms?the mountain, the sun, refuge, the kingdom, sheltering wings, the olive tree, and the shepherd?to lead us to the discovery that hope is the predominant image of the book of Psalms. Even in their darkest laments, the psalmists remind us that God hears us and will never abandon us. In these brief essays, Harrington opens up the language of forty psalms, explores their literary and historical context, and then ties the psalm to our reading as Christians whose ultimate hope is in Jesus Christ. As we read and reflect on the psalms with Harrington?s guidance, we call to mind the ways we experience God and our hopes, both daily and for all time. Drawn into the world of the psalmist and discovering how our experiences often mirror theirs, we too will express our hope in God?s love and mercy and in the coming of God?s kingdom. ?Daniel Harrington once again puts his unparalleled knowledge of the Bible at the disposal of his many readers in order to help them to pray to God who is our hope. This time he helps us to make the psalms our own prayer by showing us how they expressed the hope of the Israelites who wrote them and prayed them. One can only hope that Dan will continue to use his immense scholarship for ?the help of souls,? a favorite phrase of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. I am proud to count Dan as one of my brothers in the Lord.? William A. Barry, SJ Campion Renewal Center Weston, Massachusetts?That a serious biblical scholar can continue to gift us with accessible, devotional and historical-critical studies of important theological ideas is, itself, cause for hope. Few do so as well as Fr. Daniel Harrington. In his christological reading of the Psalms Harrington shows us that hope has a rough side. One of the best features of these fine readings of the Psalms is that Harrington doesn't explain away the raw emotions of those ancient writers who looked to God for hope. What a relief!?

In the first book to explore how memories impact and are affected by faith, bestselling author Dawn Eden offers a guide to the process she used to heal the pain of her past. Through her own story, as well as the examples of St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Peter Faber, and Pope Francis, she shows how the mercy of God, who holds all of events of our life in his own memory, can bring you healing and inner peace. Dawn Eden s My Peace I Give You helped thousands find peace after abuse and established her as the leading Catholic authority on recovering from traumatic stress. In Remembering God s Mercy, Eden who suffered childhood sexual abuse that left her with PTSD describes how she was inspired by the example of Pope Francis, St. Ignatius, and St. Peter Faber, all of whom suffered from their own painful experiences and followed a similar path to healing. Pope Francis has spoken openly about how a life-threatening bout of pneumonia affected his relationship with God, saying that recognizing and accepting the power of memories to color perceptions is essential to seeing God in all things and experiencing inner peace. The pope was influenced by the examples of Ignatius and Faber. Ignatius suffered the loss of his mother at a young age and was sent by his father to live with another family. He also fought as a mercenary soldier as a young man and experienced the trauma of war and physical pain. Faber, a student of Ignatius and among the early members of the Society of Jesus, suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety for years. He wrote in his diary how he applied Ignatius s spiritual practices in a way that enabled him to rise above his mental suffering to grow closer with God. Through the wisdom of these three Jesuits, Eden developed an Ignatian model of healing: Acknowledge your memories. Accept that they change the way you see God, your fate, and other people. Allow God to transform your memories by coloring the past and present with his story of salvation. Eden examines how Jesus  wounds can bring healing to your own hurt through prayer, Mass, the Sacraments (particularly confession), and the life of the Church. In each chapter, she will engage you with specific steps to take using the most famous Ignatian prayer, the Suscipe Latin for  receive  to transform your past traumas into an offering to God that is united with Jesus  own self-offering.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YzpjCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vanishing Tungus;: The story of a remarkable reindeer people","description":"A study of the culture of the Tungus, a nomadic reindeer-herding people of northern Siberia, who depended on cooperation and mutual trust for survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcWnpwAACAAJ&dq=The+vanishing+Tungus%3B:+The+story+of+a+remarkable+reindeer+people&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Whig interpretation of history","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UbcA4vX4VxYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chilton's Repair and Tune Up Guide: Toyota Trucks, 1970-1986 (Chilton's Repair Manual (Model Specific))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mHNYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chilton%27s+Repair+and+Tune+Up+Guide:+Toyota+Trucks,+1970-1986+(Chilton%27s+Repair+Manual+(Model+Specific))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Essential Riffs for Acoustic Guitar (Listen & Learn)","description":"(Guitar Educational).

Originally published in 1950, Fifth Chinese Daughter was one of the most widely read works by an Asian American author in the twentieth century. The US State Department even sent its charismatic young author on a four-month speaking tour throughout Asia. Cited as an influence by prominent Chinese American writers such as Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston, Fifth Chinese Daughter is a foundational work in Asian American literature. It was written at a time when few portraits of Asian American life were available, and no similar works were as popular and broadly appealing. This new edition includes the original illustrations by Kathryn Uhl and features an introduction by Leslie Bow, who critically examines the changing reception and enduring legacy of the book and offers insight into Wong s life as an artist and an ambassador of Chinese American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DiPHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mammography: Pretest Self-Assessment and Review","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=51OdtAEACAAJ&dq=Mammography:+Pretest+Self-Assessment+and+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The non-Christian cross,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AyKCkQzjWhIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Early American Republic, 1789-1829","description":"Johnson composes a single volume text which adeptly synthesizes the literature on the political, social, and cultural historyof the United States from the 1790's through the 1830's.

Typically, the struggles of his characters were about survival, not survival in the context of war or revolution, but survival in the context of the emotional and psychological strength it takes to live within the harsh confines of post-war Vietnamese society. Thiep captured the emotional quality of Vietnamese life in a way no other author had done, and his importance can be recognized today by his enormous influence on younger writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hH5kAAAAMAAJ&dq=Crossing+the+River:+Short+Fiction+by+Nguyen+Huy+Thiep+(Voices+from+Vietnam)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choice Cuts: A Savory Selection of Food Writing from Around the World and Throughout History","description":" Every once in awhile a writer of particular skills takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight.

Lee","description":"A WALL STREET JOURNAL BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR ? From the award-winning historian and best-selling author of Gettysburg comes the definitive biography of Robert E. Lee. An intimate look at the Confederate general in all his complexity his hypocrisy and courage, his inner turmoil and outward calm, his disloyalty and his honor. \\"An important contribution to reconciling the myths with the facts.\\"  New York Times Book Review Robert E. Lee is one of the most confounding figures in American history. Lee betrayed his nation in order to defend his home state and uphold the slave system he claimed to oppose. He was a traitor to the country he swore to serve as an Army officer, and yet he was admired even by his enemies for his composure and leadership. He considered slavery immoral, but benefited from inherited slaves and fought to defend the institution. And behind his genteel demeanor and perfectionism lurked the insecurities of a man haunted by the legacy of a father who stained the family name by declaring bankruptcy and who disappeared when Robert was just six years old. In Robert E. Lee, the award-winning historian Allen Guelzo has written the definitive biography of the general, following him from his refined upbringing in Virginia high society, to his long career in the U.S. Army, his agonized decision to side with Virginia when it seceded from the Union, and his leadership during the Civil War. Above all, Guelzo captures Robert E. Lee in all his complexity--his hypocrisy and courage, his outward calm and inner turmoil, his honor and his disloyalty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vEgREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ophelia's World: The Memiors of a Parisian Shop Girl","description":"In her diary entries for one year, charming Parisian shop co-owner Ophelia discusses her many friends and their activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zpi2d4-fNI8C&dq=Ophelia%27s+World:+The+Memiors+of+a+Parisian+Shop+Girl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Razor","description":"Vida is young, sexy, and naive, until she grows tired of Samara, the leader of The Come Back Honeys, using her body to entertain local hustlers.

Gender development is examined from infancy through adolescence, integrating biological, socialization, and cognitive perspectives. The book s current empirical focus is complemented by a lively and readable style that includes anecdotes about children s everyday experiences. The book s accessibility is further enhanced with the use of bold face to highlight key terms when first introduced along with a complete glossary of these terms. All three of the authors are respected researchers in divergent areas of children s gender role development and each of them teaches a course on the topic. The book s primary focus is on gender role behaviors  how they develop and the roles biological and experiential factors play in their development. The first section of the text introduces the field and outlines its history. Part 2 focuses on the differences between the sexes, including the biology of sex and the latest research on behavioral sex differences, including motor and cognitive behaviors and personality and social behaviors. Contemporary theoretical perspectives on gender development  biological, social and environmental, and cognitive approaches  are explored in Part 3 along with the research supporting these models. The social agents of gender development, including children themselves, family, peers, the media, and schools are addressed in the final part. Cutting-edge and comprehensive, this is the perfect text for those who have been searching for an advanced undergraduate and/or graduate book for courses in gender development, the psychology of sex roles and/or gender and/or women or men, taught in departments of psychology, human development, and educational psychology. Although chapters have been designed to be read sequentially, a full author citation is included the first time a reference is used within an individual chapter rather than only the first time it is used in the book, making it easy to assign chapters in a variety of orders.

Containing music and text of 201 carols, many in more than one setting, the book is organized in two sections: composed carols, ranging from medieval Gregorian chants to modern compositions, and folk carols, including not only traditional Anglo-American songs but Irish, Welsh, German, Czech, Polish, French, Basque, Catalan, Sicilian, and West Indian songs as well. Each carol is set in four-part harmony, with lyrics in both the original language and English. Accompanying each song are detailed scholarly notes on the history of the carol and on performance of the setting presented. The introduction to the volume offers a general history of carols and caroling, and appendices provide scholarly essays on such topics as fifteenth-century pronunciation, English country and United States primitive traditions, and the revival of the English folk carol. The Oxford Book of Carols, published in 1928, is still one of Oxford's best-loved books among scholars, church choristers, and the vast number of people who enjoy singing carols. This volume is not intended to replace this classic but to supplement it. Reflecting significant developments in musicology over the past sixty years, it embodies a radical reappraisal of the repertory and a fresh approach to it. The wealth of information it contains will make it essential for musicologists and other scholars, while the beauty of the carols themselves will enchant general readers and amateur songsters alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hksJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Book+of+Carols:+Music+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tender Rebel","description":"Scottish beauty Roslynn Chadwick needs the safety of marriage to protect her from an unscrupulous cousin and the fortune-hunting scoundrels who covet her wealth.

In this thought-provoking history of a century-long \\"unfinished conversation\\" between the indigenous Indians and the white intruders, paul Sullivan shows how each party to the dialogue shaped the cross-cultural encounters to their own ends. North American anthropologists preferred to see the Mayas as a primitive people and studied them, they claimed, with scientific neutrality. Yet the anthropologists hid their real intentions and lied to the Mayas, pretending to be chicle dealers or explorers, and they also (in certain important cases) worked for the United States government as covert intelligence agents. Similarly, the Mayas had their own hidden agendas wanting guns and money from the Americans to fight the central Mexican government and consequently charged the Americans for the tribal lore and religious secrets they imparted. Sullivan asks us to view the history of Western-Maya dialogue as a Maya would setting the prophecies of his ancestors, the advice of his grandparents, and the events of last week in a long continuum that extends way into the future and can foretell the end of the world. By taking this view, once can see how this particular Central American people has constituted a new life, a new past, and a new future out of the ruins of great suffering and defeat. This surprising, moving, and intellectually stimulating book will remind us how even actions initiated with the best intentions can be perverted when tested by the realities of political violence, acute dependency, mutual ignorance, and fear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8gRNBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Latin Book.","description":"Excerpt from A New Second Latin Book The present volume is a revision of the Miller and Beeson Second Latin Book, which was published in the year 1900. In the Preface to the original edition the following statement of purpose and point of view was made: \\"The right of Caesar to occupy an important place in the early years of the Latin program of secondary schools has not been successfully challenged. His Commentaries will continue to enjoy the prestige which the traditions of centuries have assigned them. And rightly; for no Latin writer has surpassed this literary soldier in the composition of vigorous and luminous prose, which so admirably fits his work to be a medium for the presentation of the form and structure of the Latin language to the young student. \\"But the right of Caesar to occupy not alone the center of the stage but the whole stage as well, in the second year of Latin study, has been justly and successfully challenged. During the last few years a very general call has been heard for an easier, better graded, richer second year program in Latin than the study of Caesar alone affords. Not only have secondary teachers urged this change, but college professors and administrative officers have generally approved the plan, and accepted this more varied program in lieu of their long established requirements in Caesar. \\"The Second Latin Book which is herewith presented to the public, is intended to meet this need. It makes no professions of originality - so far as the plan is concerned of presenting selections from other authors supplementary to Caesar. Its reason for existence lies in the consistent working out of this plan: in the attempt to make the work of this most critical period in the study of Latin so attractive that the student will be drawn on by a real pleasure in the work itself; so well-graded, that he will never find it hopelessly beyond his powers; so varied, that he will never lose interest through the monotony of his task.\\" About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Meanwhile, Sergeant John Cooper and his elite Special Ops team hunt down Palestinian extremists in possession of a new undetectable explosive that will change the  face of terror.

For the men of Task Force Valor life is a blast. A lethal new weapon. Master Sergeant John Cooper and his Special Ops team of explosives-hunters have a mission unlike any they ve ever experienced before. A new undetectable type of explosive has burst onto the scene, and it will change the  face of terror  in the world. Washington wants the manufacturers shut down before it turns up on American soil. A missing sister. A suicide bomber blows up a hotel in Beirut. Liz Fairchild, an American reporter, searches for her sister, Julie, who is presumed dead in the blast until Liz uncovers evidence she might be alive. When signs indicate that time is running out for Julie, Liz is determined to find her regardless of the risks. A stealthy escape. As their separate objectives bring John and Liz together, the path ahead takes twists neither of them counted on.

Daniel Philpott argues that two historical revolutions in ideas are responsible. First, the Protestant Reformation ended medieval Christendom and brought a system of sovereign states in Europe, culminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Second, ideas of equality and colonial nationalism brought a sweeping end to colonial empires around 1960, spreading the sovereign states system to the rest of the globe. In both cases, revolutions in ideas about legitimate political authority profoundly altered the \\"constitution\\" that establishes basic authority in the international system. Ideas exercised influence first by shaping popular identities, then by exercising social power upon the elites who could bring about new international constitutions. Swaths of early modern Europeans, for instance, arrived at Protestant beliefs, then fought against the temporal powers of the Church on behalf of the sovereignty of secular princes, who could overthrow the formidable remains of a unified medieval Christendom. In the second revolution, colonial nationalists, domestic opponents of empire, and rival superpowers pressured European cabinets to relinquish their colonies in the name of equality and nationalism, resulting in a global system of sovereign states. Bringing new theoretical and historical depth to the study of international relations, Philpott demonstrates that while shifts in military, economic, and other forms of material power cannot be overlooked, only ideas can explain how the world came to be organized into a system of sovereign states.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OVa_8zEHjaYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Thessaloniki to Auschwitz and Back: Memories of a Survivor from Thessaloniki","description":"Before WWII there was a thriving Jewish community of some 50,000 people in Thessaloniki, Greece. In 1943, under Nazi occupation, virtually the entire community was deported to Auschwitz extermination camp. That the author, Erika Amariglio, and several members of her family survived is due only to a series of coincidences, including the fact that they were on the first transport ot Auschwitz and that they spoke fluent German. Erika Amariglio's story covers the period before the war in Thessaloniki, the German occupation and the gradual tightening of restrictions, the transportation, the two-and-a-half years spent in Auschwitz, the long death march back to Germany, the Amariglio family's escape to Yugoslavia, and their eventual reunion of the family in Greece. It concludes with the author's return to Auschwitz many years later as a delegate to an international conference on the Holocaust. This book has been previously published in Greek, German, French and Serbian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GsBtAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+Thessaloniki+to+Auschwitz+and+Back:+Memories+of+a+Survivor+from+Thessaloniki&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mournful Demeanour Of Lieutenant Boruvka","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=53RXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Mournful+Demeanour+Of+Lieutenant+Boruvka&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey","description":"The author of Midnight's Children and The Satanic Verses describes his 1986 trip to Nicaragua and shares his impressions of the true Nicaragua--the people, politics, land, poetry, and problems behind the headlines.

It was the first book to receive the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1918. It tells the story of Roger Gale, a man living in New York - widowed and looking after his three adult daughters, Edith, Deborah, and Laura. He struggles to stay close to his daughters amidst the changing society around them. Conflicts arise in the shape of engagements, pregnancies, and the way his daughters spend their free time. Once the First World War happens, Roger's life is in even more upheaval as his business takes losses, creating more hardships for his daughters and grandchildren, and causing tensions between Deborah and Edith, who have very different ideas about family and women's rights. Essentially, as the title of the novel suggests, this is a book about a man trying to hold together his family in the face of what seems at times, overwhelming odds. It was very well received by critics at the time it was published, and was praised for giving a true picture of then present-day Americans. The book's details about life in New York in the 1910's is also significant - referencing the lives of poor immigrants, the fascination with modern ways of doing things, and of course, the impact of the War. Poole had written a book called The Harbour in 1915, before the Pulitzer Prize was a thing, and some felt that in awarding the prize to His Family, the committee were really honouring the writer for his previous book.

Each of us has a \\"virtual reality map\\" imprinted on our brains, which consists of our individual ideologies, opinions, attitudes, values, and beliefs that we've built up over the years. But what if you learned that your reality map was distorted or limited? In Reality Check, David L. Weiner takes us on an entertaining romp through many odd and interesting new findings in various scientific fields - from neurobiology to physics and genetics, describing how difficult it is for these findings to sink in and impact our perspectives. One of the most fascinating topics that Weiner discusses is what neuroscience has found out about certain apelike mechanisms in our brains. These ancient vestiges of evolution can cause turmoil if we don t meet their primitive expectations, and their penchant for pecking order and status can create far-out realities that we think are absolutely true. By opening our minds to what science has discovered about our realities, and what it still considers to be mysteries, we can gain valuable insights and tools for improving the quality of our lives. The fresh and surprising information in this book has ramifications for parents, managers, educators, and everyone else interested in getting the most out of others and themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gh0eAAAACAAJ&dq=Reality+Check:+What+Your+Mind+Knows,+But+Isn%27t+Telling+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Personal traits of Abraham Lincoln,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=asALAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Years Before The Mast-A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea","description":"This book is a fascinating and detailed chronicle of over two years spent in the American merchant service during the early 1800s.

Even more sinister is the discovery that the angry swarms were programmed to kill by a mad, ingenious apiarist named Heregrove. Leave it to one of the village's honey addicts-the hapless, reclusive Sydney Silchester-to stumble unwittingly onto Heregrove's diabolical scheme. Silchester's sweet tooth leads him to the indomitable Mr. Mycroft, a retired beekeeper possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of bees and a Holmesian penchant for sleuthing. By matching wits and strategies, the persnickety Silchester and the determined Mycroft seek to thwart Heregrove and his stinging minions before they strike again. \\"We may know whodunit, but the question of 'why' is altogether more disturbing,\\" writes Stacy Gillis, Ph.D., who contributes a new foreword to this reissue of the 1941 detective-fiction classic, A Taste for Honey.

Until the last few years, there had been quite a lot of bee-keeping in the Ashton Clearwater district. But lately nobody, except the sinister and solitary Heregroves, had managed to make their bees thrive. This was tiresome for Sydney Silchester who had gone to the country to be on his own and undisturbed by friends and garrulous neighbors. It was even more tiresome for him when Mrs. Heregrove was stung to death by her husband's bees. His situation suddenly became fraught with mysterious terror when he met his extraordinary neighbor, Mr. Mycroft, a scientific apiarist who had made discoveries about Heregrove's bees which pointed to murder on wings. Who is Mr. Mycroft? The true identity of this magnificent, inscrutable old gentleman is a deep secret--but there are echoes of Baker Street in his voice, and a familiar gleam in his eyes that miss no clue.

He loves her chestnut hair, watery green eyes, the gap that makes her teeth Kantian and not Platonic, and her views on Heidegger s Being and Time   but he hates her taste in shoes. What makes this book extraordinary is the depth with which the emotions involved in the relationship are analysed. Love comes under the philosophical microscope. Plotting the course of their affair from the initial delirium of infatuation to the depths of suicidal despair, through a fit of anhedonia   defined in medical texts as a disease resulting from the terror brought on by the threat of utter happiness   and finally through the terrorist tactics employed when the beloved begins, inexplicably, to drift away, Essays in Love is filled with profound and witty observations on the pain and exhilaration of love. An entire chapter is devoted to the nuances and subtexts of an initial date, while another chapter mulls over the question of how and when to say  I love you.

Allen knows how to bring you financial success. With his seminars sweeping the nation, Allen is at the cutting edge of strategic wealth creation now more than ever. And in this completely revised edition of his classic bestseller Creating Wealth Allen gives you the basic principles that you need to stop thinking poor and start growing rich. Moving beyond just real estate, Allen goes straight to the core of people's inner motivations and beliefs about money to give you all the fundamentals of wealth creation. By developing a wealthy mind-set, anyone can take off into financial self-reliance -- and Allen shows you how. He explains the ways in which most of us have been programmed to think that only saving is good and debt and risk are bad, so that in our efforts to gain security, we cheat ourselves out of getting rich. The key to changing that mind-set is Allen's unique integration of real estate with other wealth-generating investments. In his trademark, easy-to-understand style Allen spells out all his practical applications and shows you how to: Take advantage of recent tax laws Use leverage to multiply holdings while minimizing risks Benefit from high-yield discount mortgages Acquire long-term profits in gold and silver coins Set up corporations and trusts to protect assets Find the highest rate of return with the greatest liquidity As Robert Allen has proved in his own life -- becoming a multimillionaire well before he was thirty-five -- it doesn't matter how much or how little money you have when you start as long as you understand the right principles -- timeless principles that can make you a fortune.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VbS9GuOKe7sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primary Phonics The Lost Duck Set 3 Book 9","description":"A systematic, phonics-based early reading program that includes: the most practice for every skill, decodable readers for every skill, and reinforcement materials--help struggling students succeed in the regular classroom","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3RKTQAAACAAJ&dq=Primary+Phonics+The+Lost+Duck+Set+3+Book+9&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call Center Operations Profiting from Teleservices","description":"Optimize call center technologies and boost your bottom line.

Born into poverty in 1791 and trained as a bookbinder, Faraday rose through the ranks of the scientific elite even though, at the time, science was restricted to the wealthy or well-connected. During a career that spanned more than four decades, Faraday laid the groundwork of our technological society-notably, inventing the electric generator and electric motor. He also developed theories about space, force, and light that Einstein called the \\"greatest alteration . . . in our conception of the structure of reality since the foundation of theoretical physics by Newton.\\" The Electric Life of Michael Faraday dramatizes Faraday's passion for understanding the dynamics of nature. He manned the barricades against superstition and pseudoscience, and pressed for a scientifically literate populace years before science had been deemed worthy of common study. A friend of Charles Dickens and an inspiration to Thomas Edison, the deeply religious Faraday sought no financial gain from his discoveries, content to reveal God's presence through the design of nature. In The Electric Life of Michael Faraday, Alan Hirshfeld presents a portrait of an icon of science, making Faraday's most significant discoveries about electricity and magnetism readily understandable, and presenting his momentous contributions to the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OJS7uOC2XCoC&dq=Michael+Faraday,:+A+biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medical Office Transcription: An Introduction to Medical Transcription Text-Workbook","description":"Students use this 12-chapter text-workbook and accompanying dictation program to learn to transcribe, proof, and edit a variety of medical documents, including chart notes, history and physical reports, consultations, office procedures notes, x-ray reports, and more.

They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects. With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging. They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on howsoftware ought to be created. Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way. Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members: \\"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide.\\"-- Randal Schwartz \\"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book.\\"-- Peter Scott \\"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of \\"scripting languages\\". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too.\\"-- Andy Lester \\"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years.\\"-- Bill Odom \\"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams.\\"-- Andrew Sundstrom \\"Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers.\\"-- Bennett Todd\\"I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer.\\"-- Paul Fenwick\\"At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues.\\"-- Jacinta Richardson\\"If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it.\\"-- Steven Lembark\\"The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until Perl Best Practices.

At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7KmujotBUwwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The portable Oscar Wilde,","description":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, Salome and The Importance of Being Earnest are accompanied by Wilde's prison memoirs, poems, and selected correspondence","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VqYOAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+portable+Oscar+Wilde,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anti-Terror Checklist: Preparing for the Unthinkable","description":"Will you know what to do?

What sets this volume apart from the large body of literature on cannibalism, both popular and anthropological, is the underlying premise: cannibalism as an alternative to starvation is tacitly condoned by the same biological morality that would condemn cannibalism of other sorts in non-threatening situations. Deep as the taboos may be, the survival instinct runs even deeper. The title of the book reflects the author's belief that cannibalism is not a pathology that erupts in psychotic individuals, but is a universal adaptive strategy that is evolutionarily sound. The cannibal is within all of us, and cannibals are within all cultures, should the circumstances demand cannibalism's appearance and usage. Petrinovich's work is rich in historical detail, and rises to a level of theoretical sophistication in addressing a subject too often dealt with in sensationalist terms. The major instances in which survival cannibalism has occurred convinced the author that there is a consistent pattern and a uniform regularity of order in which different kinds of individuals are consumed. In considering who eats whom, when, and under what circumstances, this regularity appears, and it is consistent with what would be expected on the basis of evolutionary or Darwinian theory. In short, he concludes that starvation cannibalism is not a manifestation of the chaotic, psychotic behavior of individuals who are driven to madness, but reveals underlying characteristics of evolved human beings. Lewis Petrinovich is professor emeritus in the Department of Psychology of the University of California, Riverside and is currently a resident of Berkeley, California.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6L7bToxDZL0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Html: Css/ Javascript/ Dhtml (I Performance Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YSXO_bBpVQUC&dq=Html:+Css/+Javascript/+Dhtml+(I+Performance+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seth The Doll Who Was Afraid Of Everything","description":"This is a classic story of one small doll's search for courage.

It accomplished, far beyond his expectations, his lifelong goal of putting the environment onto the nation's and the world's political agendas. The life of Nelson, a small-town boy who learned his values and progressive political principles at an early age, is woven through the political history of the twentieth century. Nelson's story intersects at times with Fighting Bob La Follette, Joe McCarthy, and Bill Proxmire in Wisconsin, and with George McGovem, Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Russell Long, Walter Mondale, John F.

This book offers an honest and rigorous exploration of what Jensen refers to as the depraved nature of whiteness in the United States. Mixing personal experience with data and theory, Jensen faces down the difficult realities of race, racism, and white privilege. He argues that any system that denies non-white people their full humanity also keeps white people from fully accessing their own. The Heart of Whiteness is both a cautionary tale for those who believe that they have transcended racism, and also an expression of the hope for genuine transcendence. \\"Very few white writers have been able to point out the pathological nature of white privilege and supremacy with the eloquence of Robert Jensen. In The Heart of Whiteness, Jensen demonstrates not only immense wisdom on the issue of race, but does so in the kind of direct and accessible fashion that separates him from virtually any other academic scholar, or journalist, writing on these subjects today.\\" Tim Wise, author of Dear White America \\"With radical honesty, hard facts, and an abundance of insight and compassion, Robert Jensen lays out strategies for recognizing and dismantling white privilege and helping others to do the same. This text is more than just important; it's useful. Jensen demonstrates again that he is a leading voice in the American quest for justice.\\" Adam Mansbach, author of Angry Black White Boy and Go the Fuck to Sleep \\"Jensen's spotlight on the gaps separating the American promise of liberty and justice from the reality is accessible, powerful and moving. In short, it is a terrific piece of anti-racist writing.\\" Eleanor Bader, The Brooklyn Rail","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2lvuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete Works of Lewis Carroll (Collected Works of Lewis Carroll)","description":"Musaicum Books presents to you this meticulously edited Lewis Carroll collection.

The implied purpose of the book is to recover argument from its current status among teachers, who often view composition as a merely personal exercise, with an emphasis upon \\"invention\\" (now the most important part of so-called \\"process\\" writing). It attempts to provide a framework for understanding discourse and its position and function in a democratic society. In addition to calling for a return to reason, Recovering Argument suggests new models and approaches to the teaching of writing. A model of communication (a \\"humanistic\\" model) is offered as a replacement for the widely-accepted analogy that would turn writer and audience into radio transmitters and receivers. A new treatment of \\"audience\\" clearly and succinctly demonstrates that the writer does not need to be a slave to demographics, but rather that the writer of any argument must search for truth, however unpalatable that truth may be to the audience. A much-needed review of the differences between spoken and written language is provided herein, and the reader is shown the placement of argument within the Western rhetorical tradition and the importance of the continuing dialogue that began with Plato and Aristotle. This brief text could be used in a college or upper-level high school course in rhetoric or writing as a supplementary text or as the core text in addition to supplementary readings. The freshness of the material is sure to stimulate thought and discussion. The examples of argument in the appendix provide a foundation for individual response and for further study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9F9bigkeLIkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychic Academy, Vol. 10","description":"Ai Shiomi reluctantly agrees to attend the Psychic Academy, a school for those with special aura powers where his brother teaches, where he struggles to find out what his powers are and copes with girl problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nnR7AAAACAAJ&dq=Psychic+Academy,+Vol.+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Journey Into Imagination: The Adventure Begins","description":"With fantasy and imagination, the possibilities are endless.

Only after he cut one-third from it was it accepted. This new edition not only brings Porius back into print, but makes the original book at last available to readers.\\" \\"Set in the geographic confines of Powys's own homeland of Northern Wales, Porius takes place in the course of a mere eight October days in 499 A.D., when King Arthur - a key character in the novel, along with Myrddin Wyllt, or Merlin - was attempting to persuade the people of Britian to repel the barbaric Saxon invaders. Porius, the only child of Prince Einion of Edeyrnion, is the main character who is sent on a journey that is both historical melodrama and satirical allegory.\\" \\"A complex novel, Porius is a mixture of mystery and philosophy on a huge narrative scale, as if Nabokov or Pynchon tried to compress Dostoevsky into a Ulyssean mold. Writing in The New Yorker, George Steiner has said of the abridged Porius that it \\"combines [a] Shakespearean-epic sweep of historicity with a Jamesian finesse of psychological detail and acuity. Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!, which I believe to be the American masterpiece after Melville, is a smaller thing by comparison.\\"\\" \\"This new, and first complete, edition of the novel substantiates both Steiner's judgement and Powys's claim for Porius as his masterpiece.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Both Buddhist and Brahmanical authors sought to clarify and classify their central concerns, and dharma proved a means of thinking through and articulating those concerns. Alf Hiltebeitel shows the different ways in which dharma was interpreted during that formative period: from the grand cosmic chronometries of kalpas and yugas to narratives about divine plans, gendered nuances of genealogical time, royal biography (even autobiography, in the case of the emperor Asoka), and guidelines for daily life, including meditation. He reveals the vital role dharma has played across political, religious, legal, literary, ethical, and philosophical domains and discourses about what holds life together. Through dharma, these traditions have articulated their distinct visions of the good and well-rewarded life. This insightful study explores the diverse and changing significance of dharma in classical India in nine major dharma texts, as well some shorter ones. Dharma proves to be a term by which to make a fresh cut through these texts, and to reconsider their own chronology, their import, and their relation to each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZUaeAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The water house","description":"Irresistible interiors that capture the essence of seaside living.
