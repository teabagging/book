Despite the social progress Spain has made extending equal rights to all citizens, particularly in the wake of the Franco regime and radically liberating Transici n, the fact remains that not all subjects particularly, women, immigrants, and queers possess equal autonomy. The book exposes visible shifts in power dynamics within the nation s largest urban capitals Madrid and Barcelona and takes a hard look at more peripheral bedroom communities as all of these spaces reflect the discontent of a post-nationalistic, economically unstable Spain. As the contributors problematize notions of public and private space and disrupt gender binaries related with these, they aspire to engender discussion around civic status, the administration of space and the place of all citizens in a global world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UD5FDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP5 (Programmer to Programmer)","description":"What is this book about?

Future Men is a Christian guide to raising strong, virtuous sons, contrary to the effeminacy and sentimentalism of contemporary culture. When Theodore Roosevelt taught Sunday school for a time, a boy showed up one Sunday with a black eye. He admitted he had been fighting and on a Sunday too. He told the future president that a bigger boy had been pinching his sister, and so he fought him. TR told him that he had done perfectly right and gave him a dollar. The stodgy vestrymen thought this was a bit much, and so they let their exuberant Sunday school teacher go. What a loss. Unbelief cannot look past surfaces. Unbelief squashes; faith teaches. Faith takes a boy aside and tells him that this part of what he did was good, while the other part of what he did got in the way. \\"And this is how to do it better next time.\\" As we look to Scripture for patterns of masculinity for our sons, we find them manifested perfectly in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

He sees and talks clearly: he uses no rhetoric nor mannered striving for effect, but instead the simple statement that in nine lines can embody a mood, reveal a profound truth, illuminate in an important way the inward and hidden life. This is a poet of the modern world, thoroughly aware of the complexities of the moment but equally mindful of the great stream of life all life of which mankind is only a part.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uE4oMhs8ZnAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Politics or Christ","description":"New York Times bestselling author and Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson exposes the destructive nature of American politics and calls on Christians to actively participate in advancing the Kingdom of heaven on earth. We live in a fractured country, a country in which identity politics, creeping socialist policies, toxic social media, and the vast partisan divide threaten the very fabric of America. After decades of political decay and of losing sight of our first principles, the American people are suffering from runaway debt, increased rates of depression, broken families, moral decay, and more. In Jesus Politics, Phil Robertson provides an alternate path: a radical call for Christians to use their freedoms to advance the agenda of the King and win back the divided soul of America. Exploring the problems facing our country and how Jesus would respond to each, Robertson offers a clear strategy, showing us how to do good by King Jesus, bringing the kingdom of heaven to our homes, neighborhoods, churches, communities, and country. Robertson also gives you the tools you need to apply the lessons of Jesus Politics in the voting booth and in our everyday lives, reminding us that above all, we're called to: Love God Love our neighbors Do whatever it takes to bring, maintain, and protect his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven Join Robertson as he takes a closer look at the problems facing America and shares how we can use our time, talents, resources, and votes to solve them as members of the kingdom. Explore a new way of thinking and acting, a way that protects and advances the policies of the King. And, if enough of us do, maybe we can become a nation that proclaims, \\"In the King we trust.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fLy-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Genetic Algorithms: Industrial Applications (International Series on Computational Intelligence)","description":"Artificial neural networks can mimic the biological information-processing mechanism in - a very limited sense. Fuzzy logic provides a basis for representing uncertain and imprecise knowledge and forms a basis for human reasoning. Neural networks display genuine promise in solving problems, but a definitive theoretical basis does not yet exist for their design. Fusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Genetic Algorithms integrates neural net, fuzzy system, and evolutionary computing in system design that enables its readers to handle complexity - offsetting the demerits of one paradigm by the merits of another. This book presents specific projects where fusion techniques have been applied. The chapters start with the design of a new fuzzy-neural controller. Remaining chapters discuss the application of expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy control, and evolutionary computing techniques in modern engineering systems. These specific applications include: direct frequency converters electro-hydraulic systems motor control toaster control speech recognition vehicle routing fault diagnosis Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communications networks telephones for hard-of-hearing people control of gas turbine aero-engines telecommunications systems design Fusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Genetic Algorithms covers the spectrum of applications - comprehensively demonstrating the advantages of fusion techniques in industrial applications.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PXjNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multiple Sclerosis (By Appointment Only)","description":"Multiple Sclerosis is recognised as a growing problem. In some Scandinavian countries, Holland, Britain and North America, the number of sufferers is rising by the day. In the UK alone, it is estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 people suffer from this debilitating disease; in the USA figures of 350,000 are quoted. What are the causes of the problem? And what can be done about it? Could it be possible to prevent MS? When we look at the countries where there is no occurrence of MS whatsoever; the immediate answer is YES. Jan de Vries has studied and treated Multiple Sclerosis for over 45 years. He has learned that every MS patient is different and that their problems must be treated individually. He emphasises the importance of diet and environment sufferers must build up their immune system. Even the smallest interference with that delicate mechanism, the human body, can trigger off problems out of all proportion to the cause. For example, silver mercury amalgam fillings in teeth can affect your health. This book draws attention to a variety of factors and explains how they can be dealt with to improve the quality of life for all MS sufferers. It is a relevant and important alternative approach to the problem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vrv3LK5Vz2oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Franklin's Medicine","description":"Selected by Choice magazine as an Outstanding Academic Title Among his many accomplishments, Benjamin Franklin was instrumental in founding the first major civilian hospital and medical school and in the American colonies. He studied the efficacy of smallpox inoculation and investigated the causes of the common cold. His inventions including bifocal lenses and a \\"long arm\\" that extended the user's reach made life easier for the aged and afflicted. In Doctor Franklin's Medicine, Stanley Finger uncovers the instrumental role that this scientist, inventor, publisher, and statesman played in the development of the healing arts enhancing preventive and bedside medicine, hospital care, and even personal hygiene in ways that changed the face of medical care in both America and Europe. As Finger shows, Franklin approached medicine in the spirit of the Enlightenment and with the mindset of an experimental natural philosopher, seeking cures for diseases and methods of alleviating symptoms of illnesses. He was one of the first people to try to use electrical shocks to help treat paralytic strokes and hysteria, and even suggested applying shocks to the head to treat depressive disorders. He also strove to topple one of the greatest fads in eighteenth-century medicine: mesmerism. Doctor Franklin's Medicine looks at these and the many other contributions that Franklin made to the progress of medical knowledge, including a look at how Franklin approached his own chronic illnesses of painful gout and a large bladder stone. Written in accessible prose and filled with new information on the breadth of Franklin's interests and activities, Doctor Franklin's Medicine reveals the impressive medical legacy of this Founding Father.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RpvrPsUhW7wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TIMELESS STORIES FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW: Putzi; Heartburn; Note for the Milkman; None Before Me; Enormous Radio; Portable Phonograph; Hour After Westerly; Glass Eye; Sound Machine; Mr Death and the Redheaded Woman; Laocoon Complex; Demon Lover; Cocoon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IbKRvwEACAAJ&dq=TIMELESS+STORIES+FOR+TODAY+AND+TOMORROW:+Putzi%3B+Heartburn%3B+Note+for+the+Milkman%3B+None+Before+Me%3B+Enormous+Radio%3B+Portable+Phonograph%3B+Hour+After+Westerly%3B+Glass+Eye%3B+Sound+Machine%3B+Mr+Death+and+the+Redheaded+Woman%3B+Laocoon+Complex%3B+Demon+Lover%3B+Cocoon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L.

Placing Methodism's rise in the ideological context of the American Revolution and the complex social setting of the greater Middle Atlantic where it was first introduced, Dee Andrews argues that this new religion provided an alternative to the exclusionary politics of Revolutionary America. With its call to missionary preaching, its enthusiastic revivals, and its prolific religious societies, Methodism competed with republicanism for a place at the center of American culture. Based on rare archival sources and a wealth of Wesleyan literature, this book examines all aspects of the early movement. From Methodism's Wesleyan beginnings to the prominence of women in local societies, the construction of African Methodism, the diverse social profile of Methodist men, and contests over the movement's future, Andrews charts Methodism's metamorphosis from a British missionary organization to a fully Americanized church. Weaving together narrative and analysis, Andrews explains Methodism's extraordinary popular appeal in rich and compelling new detail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EEZ2ODvhbg4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Biochemistry","description":"Tough Test Questions?

Database programming is therefore a natural fit for Perl, not only for business applications but also for CGI-based web and intranet applications.The primary interface for database programming in Perl is DBI. DBI is a database-independent package that provides a consistent set of routines regardless of what database product you use--Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, Informix, you name it. The design of DBI is to separate the actual database drivers (DBDs) from the programmer's API, so any DBI program can work with any database, or even with multiple databases by different vendors simultaneously.Programming the Perl DBI is coauthored by Alligator Descartes, one of the most active members of the DBI community, and by Tim Bunce, the inventor of DBI. For the uninitiated, the book explains the architecture of DBI and shows you how to write DBI-based programs. For the experienced DBI dabbler, this book reveals DBI's nuances and the peculiarities of each individual DBD.The book includes: An introduction to DBI and its design How to construct queries and bind parameters Working with database, driver, and statement handles Debugging techniques Coverage of each existing DBD A complete reference to DBI This is the definitive book for database programming in Perl.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZ2veZPxMZ0C&dq=Perl+Database+Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder","description":"A detective seeking his long-lost daughter encounters a serial killer and is compelled to help conceal her crimes. \\"A pivotal work in the history of mystery fiction.\\"   The Guardian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Hd1DwAAQBAJ&dq=Eye+of+the+Beholder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Staying Sober: A Guide for Relapse Prevention- Based Upon the CENAPS Model of Treatment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rt2zHAAACAAJ&dq=Staying+Sober:+A+Guide+for+Relapse+Prevention-+Based+Upon+the+CENAPS+Model+of+Treatment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tell Them Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Japanese No Dramas (Penguin Classics)","description":"Japanese n? theatre or the drama of 'perfected art' flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries largely through the genius of the dramatist Zeami.

Selected for their literary merit, the twenty-four plays in this volume dramatize such ideas as the relationship between men and the gods, brother and sister, parent and child, lover and beloved, and the power of greed and desire.

Such missions are based at best on educated guesses as to the enemy situation and probable reaction. Success, failure, confusion, outstanding behavior, as pictured here, illustrate battle as it did, and often can, take place. The viewpoint of the participants at the time is hard to re-create in spite of what is known of the circumstances that surrounded the engagement. What now seems to be obvious was then obscure. The participants were continually faced with questions which can be reduced in number only by thorough training: What do I do next? Where shall I fire? Who is now in charge? Shall I fire? Will firing expose my position? Shall I wait for orders? To us who comfortably read accounts of the engagement the answers may seem evident. We must remember that confusion, like fog, envelops the whole battlefield, including the enemy. Initiative, any clear-cut aggressive action, tends to dispel it. In battle the terrain is the board on which the game is played. The chessmen are the small units of infantry, of armor, and the various supporting weapons each with different capabilities, all designed for the coordinated action which makes for victory. No one piece is capable of carrying the entire burden. Each must help the other. Above all, the human mind must comprehend which, for the instant, has the leading role. There is no time out in battle. Teams must be prepared to function in spite of shortages in both personnel and equipment. They must be practiced and drilled in getting and retaining the order necessary to overcome the confusion forever present on the battlefield. This is the outstanding lesson of these pages. If heeded they will have most beneficial effect on our Army. We, the victors in this war, can ill afford not to examine our training methods continually. Do we drill as we would fight? Do we instill in the soldier discipline and a knowledge of how to get order out of battle confusion? If not, victory will cost too much.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hNJFjgEACAAJ&dq=Three+Battles:+Arnaville,+Altuzzo+and+Schmidt+(United+States+Army+in+World+War+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seduction of Place","description":"No other place on earth is as full both of promise and of dread as the city; it is at once alienating and exciting. These concentrations of people have not, however, come about as the result of vast immutable, impersonal forces, but because of human choices. The worsening or betterment of urban life will also be the result of choices. Our choices. That cities display and represent the personal desires of their inhabitants is central to Joseph Rykwert s argument in The Seduction of Place. Insisting that they are the physical constructs of communities, he travels through history to trace their roots in ancient times and outlines current attempts and future possibilities to improve the metropolis. Rykwert includes a broad range of urban landscapes: 18th-and 19th-century Paris and London, the current sprawl of Mexico City and Cairo, planned cities like Brasilia, and, finally, New York, the world capital. Always opinionated and often controversial, Rykwert assesses how and why urban projects from the past succeeded or failed and what lessons can be drawn from them for the future. Ultimately, The Seduction of Place is a deeply felt and powerfully reasoned call for a commitment by every citizen to the creation of a more humane place to live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iaxRAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomorrow By Design: A Regional Design Process for Sustainability (Wiley Series in Sustainable Design)","description":"\\"We must continue to respond to the desire of Americans to foster and protect the means of survival. The economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. That applies equally in all places. We can't afford to pay the rent by selling the store. \\"The application of simple analytical methods and an interdisciplinary approach can yield the means of identifying for every state and region the range of resource priorities and the most immediate threats to those resources. In the vast reaches of our mountains, forests, plains, deserts, wetlands, lakes, and waterways; in constricted ranges of endangered habitats; and in the tiny crevices in the mud where frogs winter, is the source of our country's future life.\\" From the Foreword by Gaylord Nelson Former Governor and U.S. Senator from Wisconsin Founder of Earth Day \\"Once we recognize where all the known resources in a region are, we can see the patterns in which they occur. These patterns can guide how and where future growth can be placed to avoid destroying the essential resources that sustain life.\\" From the author's Introduction The power and influence of Philip H. Lewis's ideas on landscape planning and design are well known among landscape architects, students, environmentalists, government officials, and the general public. Lewis has spent more than four decades developing and refining his Regional Design Process a method that guides development toward less fragile lands and preserves cores of natural resources within developed areas. He has proven this system of sustainable design through projects in Wisconsin, the Upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes basin, Alaska, and elsewhere. Those who have attended his lectures and speeches or read his articles are well aware of his enthusiasm, his clarity, and the broad scope of his vision. In Tomorrow by Design, Lewis offers the first comprehensive, unified presentation of his ideas along with proven methods to ensure their successful implementation on a regional, national, or international scale. This book answers the ever-more-compelling question, \\"How can we manage and develop our land in a way that encourages economic growth without destroying life-giving resources for future generations?\\" Lewis begins by examining the need for an overview that accounts for all of a region's resources and views those resources in the context of both environmental concerns and human needs. Problems such as pollution, population growth, and decreasing biodiversity are viewed in the context of the ongoing human needs for housing, transportation, energy, food, and economic growth. This holistic approach leads directly to the concept of sustainability reliance on resources that can be replenished or restored, development of adequate substitutes for nonrenewable resources, and preservation of resources wherever possible without great detriment to humanity or its surroundings. Lewis provides new ways of looking at national patterns of urbanization and communicating national, regional, and local values and visions. He presents numerous case studies and hundreds of illustrations that demonstrate both the process of regional design and specific techniques that can be applied on a range of scales from neighborhood to national. This book is must reading for anyone who is concerned about the interaction of society with the natural world. Landscape architects, environmentalists, and students will gain the skills and training they need to construct a holistic approach to developing, protecting, and enhancing resources. Government officials at all levels will find help in developing policy for land use and resource preservation, and all readers will discover a vision of hope and expanding possibilities that links the vigor and dynamism of humanity with the continued well-being of the natural world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dbJPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tomorrow+By+Design:+A+Regional+Design+Process+for+Sustainability+(Wiley+Series+in+Sustainable+Design)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Foremost Guide to Uncle Sam Collectibles","description":"Illustrated guide to Uncle Sam collectibles with values for collectors and historians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GWgKAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Foremost+Guide+to+Uncle+Sam+Collectibles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Runaway Girl","description":" Riveting . . .

Set in the early 1920s, the book centers on Augustine, a young man from an aristocratic Welsh family who has come of age in the aftermath of World War I. Unjustly suspected of having had a hand in the murder of a young girl, Augustine takes refuge in the remote castle of Bavarian relatives. There his hopeless love for his devout cousin Mitzi blinds him to the hate that will lead to the rise of German fascism. The book reaches a climax with a brilliant description of the Munich putsch and a disturbingly intimate portrait of Adolph Hitler. The Fox in the Attic, like its no less remarkable sequel The Wooden Shepherdess, offers a richly detailed, Tolstoyan overview of the modern world in upheaval. At once a novel of ideas and an exploration of the dark spaces of the heart, it is a book in which the past returns in all its original uncertainty and strangeness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9AGVGNifMLYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Bambi gets lost","description":"Bambi and Thumper get lost in the woods and must ask directions several times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z3pHMijydegC&dq=Walt+Disney%27s+Bambi+gets+lost&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shark hunters","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The House of Kuragin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E5qjtwEACAAJ&dq=The+House+of+Kuragin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cfsCAAAACAAJ&dq=Gurps+Steampunk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Defense of Sin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","description":"Due to the sheer number of Wicca 101 books on the market, many newcomers to the Craft find themselves piecing together their Wiccan education by reading a chapter from one book, a few pages from another.

And what she wanted was  little Gloria.  The leading characters: Gloria Morgan, who was one of the fabled Morgan Twins (invented by society reporter  Cholly  Knickerbocker as the quintessential Caf  Society beauties) and who, as a shy, stammering eighteen-year-old, living on nothing a year, did what she was raised to do, becoming the wife of . . . Reggie Vanderbilt, at forty-three a worn-out alcoholic who had managed to go through almost $25 million in fourteen years and who died only two years after his marriage to Gloria, leaving his beautiful young widow nothing but their baby, their baby s untouchable trust fund, and the Vanderbilt name . . . Gloria Morgan s twin, Thelma, who, as Lady Furness, was for years the mistress of the Prince of Wales (until she introduced him to her  best friend  Wallis Simpson) . . . Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Reginald s sister, a formidable Society woman, a sculptor and the founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art, a woman who conformed on the surface to everything expected of American royalty and yet lived a hidden second life as a passionate bohemian . . . And the child little Gloria herself shunted out of her mother s life, carted around Europe, depending for her existence on her neurotically overprotective nurse, Dodo, who never left her for a single day, and her mad Morgan grandmother, who insisted that her own daughter might murder the child for the Vanderbilt millions. Deserted,  dressed in rags,  neglected, she became an almost mythic incarnation of  the poor little rich girl.  This child, who was to grow up to become a world-famous fashion designer, her name Gloria Vanderbilt a household word. We come to understand and care about this child as we observe, close up, the astonishing lives and intrigues surrounding her. We see her at the age of ten brought to the courthouse, rushed through mobs of spectators, reporters, photographers. We follow a courtroom drama of sensation after sensation, the judge ultimately banning both public and press, the final scandalous testimony reaching to the heart of the English royal family. We listen to the parade of witnesses servants, millionaires, society celebrities, aristocrats, family retainers. We watch the judge himself a classic Tammany pol becoming another of the many victims of the case, reviled on all sides. And finally we see little Gloria pushed to choose between her mother and her aunt, making the decision that will affect her whole life with nobody ever asking her the basic question,  Why are you afraid?  For the first time, the thousands of pages of documents and sealed court testimony have been unearthed and explored. Hundreds of people have been interviewed. And a writer completely knowing about society and the period has used all this material to create a compelling narrative of vitality, resonance, and fascination.

The ill-prepared and under-resourced Russian forces were forced to retreat. Gradually, the balance of the war swung in favour of the Russian forces, whose strength both in numbers and equipment proved decisive in the ultimate defeat of the German forces in the east. Critical in the Soviet victory was its armour; tanks such as the T-34 proving the equal, if not better than, some of the tanks available to the Germans. This authoritative history of the Soviet forces before and during World War 2, reveals the development of their tactics in the early post-revolutionary era right through to the ultimate victory in Berlin in May 1945. The dramatic struggle of the tank crews against the German advance is told through some 200 contemporary photographs, many of which have never been seen before.The photographs include images of tank training in the 1920s and 1930s, on active service, and many compelling pictures from some of the major tank battles of the day. Over the past five years, aided by the opening up of archives in Russia previously closed to western experts, there has been a massive growth in interest in the events that occurred on the Eastern Front. Russian Tanks is an important addition to the literature currently available, exploring as it does, the vitally important Soviet armour of the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hSohAQAAIAAJ&dq=Russian+Tanks+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","description":"C.W.

We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold; of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete.

Among the simplest and most readily comprehended of Kierkegaard's books, the two works are part of the signed direct communications, as distinguished from his earlier pseudonymous writings. The lucidity and pithiness, and the earnestness and power, of For Self-Examination and Judge for Yourself! are enhanced when, as Kierkegaard requested, they are read aloud. They contain the well-known passages on Socrates' defense speech, how to read, the lover's letter, the royal coachman and the carriage team, and the painter's relation to his painting. The aim of awakening and inward deepening is signaled by the opening section on Socrates in For Self-Examination and is pursued in the context of the relations of Christian ideality, grace, and response. The secondary aim, a critique of the established order, links the works to the final polemical writings that appear later after a four-year period of silence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bbSeHAAACAAJ&dq=For+Self-Examination/Judge+for+Yourselves+:+Kierkegaard%27s+Writings,+Vol+21&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fashion Photography Now","description":"Capturing contemporary trends and forecasting the look of the future, this dazzling anthology collects the work of the most cutting-edge photographers working today, this volume is an essential compilation of the most important photographic trends of the age of social media and digital publication. The interaction between photography and fashion has always been compelling--how can artists balance commercial viability against their own creative vision? Anti-Glossy collects some of the most innovative photographers working in the field of fashion, exploring the way new media is influencing the direction of photography for print. As the notion of the \\"fashion photographer\\" becomes less distinct, the industry is benefitting from the talents of artists whose influence leads the genre into a multitude of surprising, often shocking, directions. In this collection of new fashion photography, full-page color and black-and-white photographs represent an incredible range of styles and techniques. From the evolving vision of masters of the form such as Juergen Teller and Glen Luchford, to the ironic work of Sebastian Kim, to the challenges posed by young female voices like Annemarieke Van Drimmelen, Charlotte Wales, Sarah Piantadosi, Joanna Piotrowska, and Karen Knorr, the photographers featured in this exciting collection represent a cutting-edge trend in all its diversity. Paris-based author and editor Patrick Remy has selected over twenty photographers from emerging talents that hold the prospect of creating enduring fashion images and influencing the cultural and style trends of tomorrow to established figures exploring new directions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kOeODwAAQBAJ&dq=Fashion+Photography+Now&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","description":"Linking feminine advocacy to growing gender antagonism in American politics, this provocative look at the women's movement in today's society challenges the assumption that basic differences between the sexes are unbridgeable. 17,500 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r8e1AAAAIAAJ&dq=Ceasefire!:+Why+Women+and+Men+Must+Join+Forces+to+Achieve+True+Equality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Witch Doctor's Dance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wlIJAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Witch+Doctor%27s+Dance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Knows Life Gets Hard: 10 Tips for Tough Times","description":"Practical suggestions and shared stories of others explain how to accept feelings of doubt and fear, depend on your community of loved ones, and overcome adversities you face during difficult times.

The calendar used in the West today is just one of a multitude of systems for parcelling up time and naming its divisions. Each of its days has over the centuries acquired its own peculiar significance: the feast day of a saint, the celebration of a historical event, the subject of prose or poetry, the commemoration of a significant historical figure. And for these feasts and seasons there has grown up a rich body of traditions, beliefs, and superstitions, many of them only half-remembered today. Now, for the first time, this body of knowledge is combined with a wide-ranging survey of calendars in an authoritative, absorbing Companion. The first section of The Oxford Companion to the Year is a day-by-day survey of the calendar year, revealing the history, literature, legend, and lore associated with each season, month, and date. The second part is a broader study of time-reckoning: historical and modern calendars, religious and civil, are explained, with handy tables for the conversion of dates between various systems, and special attention is given to the calculation of Easter. There is a helpful index to facilitate speedy reference. This is a unique reference source, an indispensable aid for all historians and antiquarians, and a rich mine of information, inspiration, and delight for browsers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ApWLQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+the+Year:+An+Exploration+of+Calendar+Customs+and+Time-Reckoning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Your Own Bar and Tavern (Start Your Own Bar & Club)","description":"Live your dream selling the good life!

Although the seeds were sown in earlier eras, it was at this point that the constitution was transformed to a system of representative parliamentary government. Changes at the practical level of the constitution were accompanied by a wealth of ideas on constitutions written from different - and often competing - perspectives. Hobbes and Locke, Harrington, Hume, and Bentham, Coke, the Levellers, and Blackstone were all engaged in the constitutional affairs of the day, and their writings influenced the direction and outcome of constitutional thought and development. They treated themes of a universal and timeless character and as such have established themselves of lasting interest and importance in the history of constitutional thought. Examining their works we can follow the shaping of contemporary ideas of constitutions, and the design of constitutional texts. At the same time major constitutional change and upheaval were taking place in America and France. This was an era of intense discussion, examination, and constitution-making. The new nation of the United States looked to authors such as Locke, Hume, Harrington, and Sydney for guidance in their search for a new republicanism, adding to the development of constitutional thought and practice. This collection includes chapters examining the influences of Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Adams. In France the influence of Rousseau was apparent in the revolutionary constitution, and Sieyes was an active participant in its discussion and design. Montesquieu and de Maistre reflected on the nature of constitutions and constitutional government, and these French writers drew on, engaged with, and challenged the British and American writers. The essays in this volume reveal a previously unexplored dynamic relationship between the authors of the three nations, explaining the intimate connection between ruler and ruled.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eDrKBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Soy: Vegetarian Cartoons","description":"The Joy of Soy, the world's first (and funniest) collection of vegetarian cartoons, pokes fun at meat-eaters and vegans alike -- anyone, explains cartoonist Vance Lehmkuhl, who draws their ethical line above or below where he does.

Bush s  most essential advisor  (ABC News). An inside look at the life of Bush s most respected aide and confidante, as she balanced her role as one of the most influential women ever to set foot in the White House against her role as a wife and mother.  The rule of thumb in any White House is that nobody is indispensable except the president,  said The New York Times,  But Karen Hughes has come as close to that description as any recent presidential aide.  Ten Minutes from Normal is the often humorous, disarmingly down-to-earth, and politically fascinating journey of her time in Bush s inner circle. As Counselor to the President for his first eighteen months in the White House and as his communications director since he first ran for Governor of Texas in 1994, Hughes was a crucial influence. When he first moved to Washington, Bush told members of the White House staff that he wanted Karen in the room whenever any major decisions were made. Being a journalist, she was fascinated by politics and inspired by people who sought elective office to improve their communities. When she married and became the instant mother of a nine-year-old stepdaughter, she realized her priorities had changed: Family mattered, and she didn t want to live as if it didn t. Thus her life became one of balancing her career ambitions and her deeply felt sense of service and duty with her responsibilities and love for her family. In various Republican campaigns in Texas, she worked from home with her young son, Robert, beside her. She planned the 1990 Republican State Convention from her driveway while Robert played in the dirt at her feet. Karen tried to bring the perspective of a working mom to the White House, often asking the question she first learned as a reporter:  What does this mean to the average person?  Her exhilarating life in Washington was unlike anything she had experienced before, yet the lack of balance between her service to the President and country and her service to her family was a daily struggle. By the spring of 2002, Karen found herself in turmoil. She knew the president needed her, but her family needed her, too. Her son was not happy in Washington; neither was her husband. After much soul-searching, she concluded that she could do a better job of serving the president from Texas than of serving her family from Washington.  I love you, Mr. President,  she told him,  but I have to move my family back to Texas.  She continued to serve Bush from her home in Austin and laughed about the so-called  balance  she found. When she looked at the wall calendar in her kitchen, she found the State of the Union address side by side with her son s orthodontist appointments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1MnXT5P4FdgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","description":"Recounts the author's special friendship with an exuberant, precocious, little runaway orphan, whom he came upon when she was four years old and who explored life with unparalleled gusto until her death three and a half years later.

This fascinating work of theological scholarship offers an exceptionally broad scope and powerfully unifying theme. Gaspar Martinez first offers penetrating interpretations of three major contemporary theologians working on three continents, in quite dissimilar historical, cultural, social, and economic situations. Then he goes on to illustrate how Johannes Metz, Gustavo GutiTrrez, and David Tracy each had a tensive ongoing relationship to the mid-twentieth century theologians and movements that formed them-Karl Rahner, nouvelle theologie, and Bernard Lonergan, respectively. Martinez brilliantly contextualizes each of these thinkers. In broad strokes, he sketches postwar Germany, postcolonial Peru, and the American century and shows how each man was formed by his era. He also examines the lines of influence and relationship between these theologians and some of their nontheological contemporaries: Metz and Adorno, Bloch, and Benjamin; GutiTrrez and Paulo Freire, JosT Carlos Mariategui, and the novelist JosT Marfa Arguedas; and Tracy and thinkers from Eliade and Ricoeur to Gadamer and Derrida.Martinez convincingly illustrates how each of these theologians in recent years has focused more directly on the mystery of God, entailing greater emphasis on spirituality and mysticism, with the consequence that the more properly theological their theologies have become the more they have become negative theologies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3ahV3Cde2TgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autogenic Methods","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBcWmwEACAAJ&dq=Autogenic+Methods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home & Dry in Normandy: A Memoir of Eternal Optimism in Rural France","description":"Glory Boughton has returned to Gilead to care for her dying father. soon her brother, Jack the prodigal son of the family, gone for twenty years comes home too, looking for refuge and trying to make peace with a past littered with torment and pain.

Moving from the nineteenth century and the works of Shelley, Stevenson, Stoker, and Wilde to contemporary horror film exemplified by such movies as Silence of the Lambs, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Candyman, Skin Shows understands the Gothic as a versatile technology, a means of producing monsters that is constantly being rewritten by historically and culturally conditioned fears generated by a shared sense of otherness and difference. Deploying feminist and queer approaches to the monstrous body, Halberstam views the Gothic as a broad-based cultural phenomenon that supports and sustains the economic, social, and sexual hierarchies of the time. She resists familiar psychoanalytic critiques and cautions against any interpretive attempt to reduce the affective power of the monstrous to a single factor. The nineteenth-century monster is shown, for example, as configuring otherness as an amalgam of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Invoking Foucault, Halberstam describes the history of monsters in terms of its shifting relation to the body and its representations. As a result, her readings of familiar texts are radically new. She locates psychoanalysis itself within the gothic tradition and sees sexuality as a beast created in nineteenth century literature. Excessive interpretability, Halberstam argues, whether in film, literature, or in the culture at large, is the actual hallmark of monstrosity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q10CzrWdwfEC&dq=Skin+Shows:+Gothic+Horror+and+the+Technology+of+Monsters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese Regional Cooking","description":"Presents background information on the various regional cuisines of China and provides recipes for every part of the menu","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BxNHAAAAYAAJ&dq=Chinese+Regional+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A layman's guide to Protestant theology","description":"The events of the twentieth century have led to a rebirth of Protestant theology.

His influence on English literature, both direct and indirect, has been immense.\\" \\"From Elizabethan times, writers like Jonson, Herrick, Cowley and Byron translated (or adapted to the London of their day) Martial's portraits of poseurs, prostitutes and philosophers, legacy hunters and social climbers. His urbanity and sharply polished wit helped inspire Pope's heroic couplets and Swift's savage irony. Although Romantics and Victorians tended to react against Martial's obscenity and fulsome flattery of his imperial masters, he always retained a reputation as an underground classic and then became an important model for Ezra Pound. Recent poets, as J. P. Sullivan and A. J. Boyle explain in their Introduction, have also found in his work 'a fully realized, if sometimes sombre world, which alternately fascinates and disquiets'.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Yet, as a subject of psychoanalytic inquiry, the world of work has largely been ignored. In this innovative book, William M. Czander demonstrates that applying depth psychology to the organization and its employees provides a deeper understanding of the American workplace than traditional industrial psychology has offered. Using a psychoanalytic framework, Czander examines such issues as interactions between employees and management, the conscious and unconscious forces that bind fellow employees together, and the role of autonomy in people's lives. Most important, he details a means of intervention in the form of organizational consultation based on this more profound conceptualization of the dynamics of the workplace. The first section of the book presents theoretical background, and the second applies theory to specific cases. Czander presents three major theories of psychoanalysis as they relate to work and the organization: Freudian and classical psychoanalytic theory, object relations theory, and self psychology theory. He explores how a psychoanalyst thinks about work and how work and the organization interact with the employees' unconscious motivations and ideation. He then applies these theories to actual case studies of organizational consultations. The consultation process is explained, including how a particular diagnosis and rationale for intervention is obtained. Czander concludes with a discussion of the practice of psychoanalytic consulting and its utility and relevance to the world of contemporary organizations. Providing illuminating discussion on myriad issues related to the psychology of the workplace, this book is an ideal resource for a variety of mental health professionals: psychoanalysts especially interested in organizational consulting, organizational psychologists desiring a new perspective on their work, and clinicians from different disciplines whose clients are struggling with issues surrounding their work environments. It serves as an advanced text for courses in industrial organization, clinical and social work, and business management.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaNerQXm5JQC&dq=The+Psychodynamics+Of+Work+And+Organizations:+Theory+And+Application&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Citizen's Guide To Stopping Suicide Attackers: Secrets of an Israeli Counterterrorist","description":"Airline hijackers, suicide bombers, fanatical gunmen, homicidal drivers, hostage takers - for decades, these types of terroristshave endangered the lives of innocent citizens worldwideBut are we helpless in the face of this threat?Itay Gil - a veteran of Israel's premier counterterrorist unit and still an active operator in the War on Terror - says no!

In the years following the 1952 revolution, wealthy patrons of the arts disappeared from Egypt's cosmopolitan art world and were replaced by the state, which by the 1960s exercised full control over all cultural activities, including the arts. In the 1990s, as elsewhere throughout the world, Egyptian art was affected by general shifts in culture brought about by globalization. The disruption of a sense of place and feelings of belonging were a response to the influx of the challenging, and at times, disquieting information available to whole cultures and communities through new media. Examining the work of over 70 artists from 1910 until the present day, Liliane Karnouk traces the parallel steps of modern Egyptian art and the social and political environment in which that art was and continues to be created. Fully illustrated with over 280 color and black-and-white illustrations, this comprehensive volume is both a feast for the eyes and a mine of information for artists and non-specialists alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=86pPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Modern+Egyptian+Art+1910-2003&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brave Little Jack","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Belle Harbor Skeletons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbN7MQAACAAJ&dq=Belle+Harbor+Skeletons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rochambeau,","description":"Step back in time and travel with Rochambeau as he rides through the night to the Palace of Versailles, answering a summons from King Louis XVI.

Hence, this book has been published as a testimonial - an indispensable resource not only with respect to mining, but also to the humanities, religion, ethnography, anthropology and the arts in the broadest sense. The American mining engineer and jurist, Professor Koehler S. Stout, Chairman, Engineering Division, Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, Butte, Mt., sums it up this way, \\"MINING LORE..., a monumental document on miners' contribution to mankind, and, at the same time, 'a monument of personal achievement.'\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OyhAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Mining+lore%3B:+An+illustrated+composition+and+documentary+compilation+with+emphasis+on+the+spirit+and+history+of+mining&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Investor: The People and Ideas That Make Modern Investment","description":"This book is a resource guide to the world's most acclaimed investment thinkers.

Prescott was the first American historian to achieve international recognition with his critically acclaimed History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. Plagued by poor vision and chronic health issues, he was determined to make his mark as a historian. His follow-up work, The History of the Conquest of Mexico, is considered his masterpiece. Prescott went on to write A History of the Conquest of Peru, History of the Reign of Philip II and a 200-page addendum to William Robertson's History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V.

At that time, there were shortages, but informal trade in both goods and foreign exchange was common, and holdings of foreign currency were substantial. Household money demand in this environment is first examined at the theoretical level: a representative household\`s holding of domestic and foreign money is analyzed in a cash-in-advance model in which domestic currency is needed to purchase goods in the official shops while either domestic or foreign currency can be used in the black market. This model gives rise to a formulation of money demand which is then estimated using household-level data from 1979 to 1988.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SqvnzgEACAAJ&dq=Household+demand+for+money+in+Poland:+Theory+and+evidence+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Au Bonheur des Dames (Les Rougon-Macquart)","description":"Zola's prophetic celebration of unbridled commerce and consumerism, The Ladies' Paradise (Au bonheur des dames, 1883) recounts the frenzied transformations that made late nineteenth-century Paris the fashion capital of the world. The novel's capitalist hero, Octave Mouret, creates a giant department store that devours the dusty, outmoded boutiques surrounding it. Paralleling the story of commercial triumph is the love story between Mouret and the innocent Denise Baudu, who comes to work in The Ladies' Paradise. She provides the crucial link between Mouret and the three essential social groups in the novel: the female clientele, the shopgirls, and the petit bourgeois shopkeepers of the neighborhood. But the store itself plays the leading role. Zola celebrates capitalism, commerce, and consumerism with a kind of prophetic optimism, calling this novel \\"a poem of modern activity.\\" The work's interest for readers in feminist, cultural, and social history and theory is made abundantly clear in the introduction by Kristin Ross, and the fiction is reproduced in its colorful, 1886 English translation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KaMwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Au+Bonheur+des+Dames+(Les+Rougon-Macquart)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arguing with the Troubadour: Poems","description":"This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself  in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4i4tDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Other peoples money, and how the bankers use it","description":"The great monopoly in this country is money.

Thousands of species of nonnative flora and fauna have taken up residence within U.S. borders. Our lawns sprout African grasses, our roadsides flower with European weeds, and our homes harbor Asian, European, and African pests. Misguided enthusiasts deliberately introduced carp, kudzu, and starlings. And the American cowboy spread such alien life forms as cows, horses, tumbleweed, and anthrax, supplanting and supplementing the often unexpected ways \\"Native\\" Americans influenced the environment. Aliens in the Backyard recounts the origins and impacts of these and other nonindigenous species on our environment and pays overdue tribute to the resolve of nature to survive in the face of challenge and change. In considering the new home that imported species have made for themselves on the continent, John Leland departs from those environmentalists who universally decry the invasion of outsiders. Instead Leland finds that uncovering stories of alien arrivals and assimilation is a more intriguing and ultimately more beneficial endeavor. Mixing natural history with engaging anecdotes, Leland cuts through problematic myths coloring our grasp of the natural world and suggests that how these alien species have reshaped our landscape is now as much a part of our shared heritage as tales of our presidents and politics. Simultaneously he poses questions about which of our accepted icons are truly American (not apple pie or Kentucky bluegrass; not Idaho potatoes or Boston ivy). Leland's ode to survival reveals how plant and animal immigrants have made the country as much an environmental melting pot as its famed melding of human cultures, and he invites us to reconsider what it means to be American.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hSwUCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Music: The Transformation of Self and Society through Musical Energy","description":"This study of the hidden side of music and its subtle effects is one of the most detailed books ever written on the subject.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HcZ6QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+Power+of+Music:+The+Transformation+of+Self+and+Society+through+Musical+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radical Dreaming: Use Your Dreams to Change Your Life","description":"In a stunning departure from \\"cookie-cutter\\" dream dictionaries, psychotherapist Dr. John D.

Appealing to a range of practitioners within corporate finance including investors, managers, and business analysts, this book is the first to specifically address the challenges facing those who are not professional accountants and auditors when examining corporate financial reports. Corporate financial reports are used widely by managers, investors, creditors, and government agencies to examine company performance and evaluate potential risks. However, although seemingly an invaluable source of information for managerial decision-making, financial reports are often based on rough simplifications of a very complex reality. With no way of avoiding deliberate manipulations and fraudulent activity, these statements cannot be relied on completely when selecting stocks or evaluating credit risk, and therefore poor analysis can lead to potentially disastrous investment decisions. The author suggests that in order to effectively interpret corporate financial reports, we must 'read between the lines' to accurately assess a company's economic performance and predict its long-term viability.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n8cLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healthcare Professional Guides: Diseases","description":"Organized around disease clusters, this comprehensive guide to disease information, ranging from causes, signs and symptoms, and diagnosis through treatment and special considerations, has been updated with the latest in original research and practice guidelines and designed to provide a brief yet comprehensive overview of a large array of disease processes. --from publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NLfwvQEACAAJ&dq=Healthcare+Professional+Guides:+Diseases&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Become a Personal Chef: An Introduction to the Industry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Boudoir: Creating the Bedroom of Your Dreams","description":"Creating an sumptuous atmosphere for the bedroom is the basis for this guidebook, which presents more than 20 styles and themes for bedroom decor, and tips on the most effective ways to combine colors, patterns, and textures to create the most indulgent surroundings.

Watching his condition deteriorate over that long summer is almost more than she can bear. Then, in the midst of her struggle, she finds herself the center of attention for three young men. Leo, Commander Rodney's son, turns to her as an old friend seeking comfort but longing for romance. Zachary, whose attempted suicide inadvertently caused Commander Rodney's death, sees her as the one sane and normal person who can give some meaning to his life. And Adam, a serious young student working at the nearby marine-biology station, discovers Vicky, his friend's little sister, incipient telepathic powers that can help him with his experiments in dolphin communications. Vicky finds solace and brief moments of peace in her poetry, but life goes on around her, and the strain intensifies as she confronts matters of love and of death, of dependence and of responsibility, universal concerns that we all must face. The inevitable crisis comes and Vicky must rely on openness, sensitivity, and the love of others to overcome her private grief. Once again, Madeleine L'Engle has written a story that revels in the drama of vividly portrayed characters and events of the spiritual and moral dimensions of common human experiences.

Today, such significant feminine rituals are missing, but these transitions still profoundly affect a woman's body, mind, and soul. Offering a compelling vision of psychotherapy as a sacred space for women's rites of passage, Jungian analyst Virginia Beane Rutter brilliantly illuminates the emotional lives of women. \\"Woman-to-woman therapy\\", writes Beane Rutter, \\"is the ritual container for the lost feminine in our culture\\". Modeling on intrinsically female pattern of change, woman-to-woman therapy is a process involving stages of containment, transformation, and emergence. It is a place for a woman to uncover and make conscious the motivating stories and myths in her individual psyche. Here, a woman has the opportunity to listen to her own voice perhaps for the first time. With insight and understanding, Beane Rutter connects the practices, myths, and archetypal images of cultures post and present (the Navajo, Neolithic Catal Huyuk, and Ancient Greek) to the life experiences, dreams, and therapeutic processes of three contemporary women. In so doing, she traces the emotional, physical, and spiritual journey of the \\"cultural heroine\\" who, through her individual process of initiation, transformation, healing, and self-awareness, courageously takes up the task of all women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yvIpAAAAYAAJ&dq=Woman+Changing+Woman:+Feminine+Psychology+Re-Conceived+Through+Myth+and+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Brothers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BFscxuKjzGEC&dq=Little+Brothers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Of The Wine","description":"Athens and Sparta, the mighty city states of ancient Greece, locked together in a quarter century of conflict: the Peloponnesian War.

It is important to teach physicians that all technologies now in use for diagnosing cardiovascular disorders, such as echocardiography, can have false positive and false negative results. It is not always wise to rely on these technologies alone; indeed, they may not even be available in some settings. Even when the full panoply of up-to-date techniques is at the physician's disposal, the patient may not be a good candidate for an echocardiogram, or the technician or reader may not be well qualified, or the equipment itself may be substandard. Technology must be combined with physical examination to decide what is true and what is false. The practice of expert history taking and physical examination returns the physician to the actual patient, where the physician can feel like a \\"real doctor\\" rather than a mere interpreter of laboratory data. Essentials of Bedside Cardiology, Second Edition, strives to teach and not simply to tell the facts, relying on three basic methods derived from the psychology of teaching and learning: 1.

Marc Mauer and Ashley Nellis of The Sentencing Project argue that there is no practical or moral justification for a sentence longer than twenty years. Harsher sentences have been shown to have little effect on crime rates, since people  age out  of crime meaning that we re spending a fortune on geriatric care for older prisoners who pose little threat to public safety. Extreme punishment for serious crime also has an inflationary effect on sentences across the spectrum, helping to account for severe mandatory minimums and other harsh punishments. A thoughtful and stirring call to action, The Meaning of Life also features moving profiles of a half dozen people affected by life sentences, written by former  lifer  and award-winning writer Kerry Myers. The book will tie in to a campaign spearheaded by The Sentencing Project and offers a much-needed road map to a more humane criminal justice system.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KWhNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Spooktacular Party Ideas","description":"Planning a Halloween Party has never been easier!

If all goes well, human history is just beginning. Our species could survive for billions of years - enough time to end disease, poverty, and injustice, and to flourish in ways unimaginable today. But this vast future is at risk. With the advent of nuclear weapons, humanity entered a new age, where we face existential catastrophes - those from which we could never come back. Since then, these dangers have only multiplied, from climate change to engineered pathogens and artificial intelligence. If we do not act fast to reach a place of safety, it will soon be too late. Drawing on over a decade of research, The Precipice explores the cutting-edge science behind the risks we face. It puts them in the context of the greater story of humanity: showing how ending these risks is among the most pressing moral issues of our time. And it points the way forward, to the actions and strategies that can safeguard humanity. An Oxford philosopher committed to putting ideas into action, Toby Ord has advised the US National Intelligence Council, the UK Prime Minister's Office, and the World Bank on the biggest questions facing humanity. In The Precipice, he offers a startling reassessment of human history, the future we are failing to protect, and the steps we must take to ensure that our generation is not the last. \\"A book that seems made for the present moment.\\"  New Yorker","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3aSiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unfolding (Stories from McKenzie Street #1)","description":"Baptists in New Zealand have built few lasting denominational institutions.

Before The Computational Brain was published in 1992, conceptual frameworks for brain function were based on the behavior of single neurons, applied globally. In The Computational Brain, Patricia Churchland and Terrence Sejnowski developed a different conceptual framework, based on large populations of neurons. They did this by showing that patterns of activities among the units in trained artificial neural network models had properties that resembled those recorded from populations of neurons recorded one at a time. It is one of the first books to bring together computational concepts and behavioral data within a neurobiological framework. Aimed at a broad audience of neuroscientists, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, The Computational Brain is written for both expert and novice. This anniversary edition offers a new preface by the authors that puts the book in the context of current research. This approach influenced a generation of researchers. Even today, when neuroscientists can routinely record from hundreds of neurons using optics rather than electricity, and the 2013 White House BRAIN initiative heralded a new era in innovative neurotechnologies, the main message of The Computational Brain is still relevant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z4pfDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Computational+Brain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darkwater","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OkhLAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tito: A Biography (Biography & Memoirs)","description":"In this, the first post-communist biography of Tito, the renowned historian Geoffrey Swain paints a new picture of this famous figure.

This introductory textbook offers a distinctive blend of the modern and the historical, seeking to encourage an appreciation for the history of dynamics while also presenting a framework for future learning. The text presents engineering mechanics as a unified field, emphasizing dynamics but integrating topics from other disciplines, including design and the humanities. The book begins with a history of mechanics, suitable for an undergraduate overview. Subsequent chapters cover such topics as three-dimensional kinematics; the direct approach, also known as vectorial mechanics or the momentum approach; the indirect approach, also called lagrangian dynamics or variational dynamics; an expansion of the momentum and lagrangian formulations to extended bodies; lumped-parameter electrical and electromagnetic devices; and equations of motion for one-dimensional continuum models. The book is noteworthy in covering both lagrangian dynamics and vibration analysis. The principles covered are relatively few and easy to articulate; the examples are rich and broad. Summary tables, often in the form of flowcharts, appear throughout. End-of-chapter problems begin at an elementary level and become increasingly difficult. Appendixes provide theoretical and mathematical support for the main text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=axPGDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fundamentals+of+Applied+Dynamics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politics of Sacred Space: The Old City of Jerusalem in the Middle East Conflict","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","description":"Ever since the shocking revelations of the fascist ties of Martin Heidegger and Paul de Man, postmodernism has been haunted by the specter of a compromised past. In this intellectual genealogy of the postmodern spirit, Richard Wolin shows that postmodernism s infatuation with fascism has been extensive and widespread. He questions postmodernism s claim to have inherited the mantle of the Left, suggesting instead that it has long been enamored with the opposite end of the political spectrum. Wolin reveals how, during in the 1930s, C. G. Jung, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot were seduced by fascism's promise of political regeneration and how this misapprehension affected the intellectual core of their work. The result is a compelling and unsettling reinterpretation of the history of modern thought. In a new preface, Wolin revisits this illiberal intellectual lineage in light of the contemporary resurgence of political authoritarianism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TX5_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Seduction+of+Unreason:+The+Intellectual+Romance+with+Fascism+from+Nietzsche+to+Postmodernism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The presence of Siva (Mythos)","description":"One of the three great gods of Hinduism, Siva is a living god. The most sacred and most ancient book of India, The Rg Veda, evokes his presence in its hymns; Vedic myths, rituals, and even astronomy testify to his existence from the dawn of time. In a lively meditation on Siva--based on original Sanskrit texts, many translated here for the first time--Stella Kramrisch ponders the metaphysics, ontology, and myths of Siva from the Vedas and the Puranas. Who is Siva? Who is this god whose being comprises and transcends everything? From the dawn of creation, the Wild God, the Great Yogi, the sum of all opposites, has been guardian of the absolute. By retelling and interweaving the many myths that keep Siva alive in India today, Kramrisch reveals the paradoxes in Siva's nature and thus in the nature of consciousness itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OzQGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kittyhawk Down (Inspector Challis Mysteries)","description":"With a missing toddler, an unidentified drowning victim, arson, and possible murder Homicide Squad Inspector Hal Challis and his team are on the scene to solve the case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p2p6uGL2fZcC&dq=Kittyhawk+Down+(Inspector+Challis+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lange Smart Charts Physiology (LANGE Basic Science)","description":"Composed entirely of tables and diagrams this book presents a complete review of physiology for medical students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z2MzRlCV3oEC&dq=Lange+Smart+Charts+Physiology+(LANGE+Basic+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When War Played Through : Golf During World War II","description":"World War II transformed the American home front, and golf was no exception. The world-famous Masters course at Augusta National became a farm to ease food shortages. Ben Hogan and Sam Snead were drafted, and Bobby Jones enlisted. Rubber rationing forced pros and amateurs alike to play with well-worn golf balls and created a black market for new ones. The 1942 U.S. Open was canceled, replaced by the Hale American Open whose winner Ben Hogan was awarded $1000 in war bonds while golfers across the country raised millions of dollars for the war effort. When War Played Through brings to life these little-known aspects of an endlessly fascinating period in golf s history. Bestselling golf author John Strege s narrative extends overseas, to captured soldiers in Germany who constructed golf courses in a POW camp and English golfers who devised rules for playing around bomb craters and shrapnel during the Blitz. Many golfers returned home from battle with commendations for valor, finding unmatched solace on the links after a dark time. When War Played Through is the compelling story of how an elite sport became a selfless one and how golf became, for a nation at war, much more than a game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6QP9_XoJnkoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Breach of Privilege: Cilley Family Letters, 1820-1867","description":"Unique collection of never before published letters from Congressman Jonathan Cilley, his wife, Deborah, their children, and family members.

Any poor relief available was provided through local taxes, and these funds were quickly exhausted. By the end of the century, state and national taxes levied to help pay for the Revolutionary War further strained municipal budgets. In order to control homelessness, vagrancy, and poverty, New England towns relied heavily on the \\"warning out\\" system inherited from English law. This was a process in which community leaders determined the legitimate hometown of unwanted persons or families in order to force them to leave, ostensibly to return to where they could receive care. The warning-out system alleviated the expense and responsibility for the general welfare of the poor in any community, and placed the burden on each town to look after its own. But homelessness and poverty were problems as onerous in early America as they are today, and the system of warning out did little to address the fundamental causes of social disorder. Ultimately the warning-out system gave way to the establishment of general poorhouses and other charities. But the documents that recorded details about the lives of those who were warned out provide an extraordinary and until now forgotten history of people on the margin. Unwelcome Americans puts a human face on poverty in early America by recovering the stories of forty New Englanders who were forced to leave various communities in Rhode Island. Rhode Island towns kept better and more complete warning-out records than other areas in New England, and because the official records include those who had migrated to Rhode Island from other places, these documents can be relied upon to describe the experiences of poor people across the region. The stories are organized from birth to death, beginning with the lives of poor children and young adults, followed by families and single adults, and ending with the testimonies of the elderly and dying. Through meticulous research of historical records, Herndon has managed to recover voices that have not been heard for more than two hundred years, in the process painting a dramatically different picture of family and community life in early New England. These life stories tell us that those who were warned out were predominantly unmarried women with or without children, Native Americans, African Americans, and destitute families. Through this remarkable reconstruction, Herndon provides a corrective to the narratives of the privileged that have dominated the conversation in this crucial period of American history, and the lives she chronicles give greater depth and a richer dimension to our understanding of the growth of American social responsibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X8dtDVPTgmoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HATFIELDS AND THE MCCOYS","description":"The Hatfield-McCoy feud has long been the most famous vendetta of the southern Appalachians. Over the years it has become encrusted with myth and error. Scores of writers have produced accounts of it, but few have made any real effort to separate fact from fiction. Novelists, motion picture producers, television script writers, and others have sensationalized events that needed no embellishment. Using court records, public documents, official correspondence, and other documentary evident, Otis K. Rice presents an account that frees, as much as possible, fact from fiction, event from legend. He weighs the evidence carefully, avoiding the partisanship and the attitude of condescension and condemnation that have characterized many of the writings concerning the feud. He sets the feud in the social, political, economic, and cultural context of eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By examining the legacy of the Civil War, the weakness of institutions such as the church and education system, the exaggerated importance of family, the impotence of the law, and the isolation of the mountain folk, Rice gives new meaning to the origins and progress of the feud. These conditions help explain why the Hatfield and McCoy families, which have produced so many fine citizens, could engage in such a bitter and prolonged vendetta","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hpye9S4LQ5YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","description":"The Social Network gets a romantic twist in this fresh and engaging new read from the author of Frat Girl, Kiley Roache.

Since it began operating in 1914, the Federal Reserve has played a crucial role in determining American financial policy and practice. It is largely an entity unto itself, operating independently, rarely subject to the political machinations of Congress or the presidency. Yet few Americans know how it works, and even fewer know anything of its history. This history of the Federal Reserve begins by giving an overview of American banking practices before the Federal Reserve's formation. The events leading to the Reserve's creation, and its early trials and tribulations, are then documented. Subsequent chapters track the Federal Reserve's history: its role during times of financial and military crisis, its relationship to each presidential administration, and the Fed's evolution as its leadership has changed over the years. The history wraps up with the Alan Greenspan era, explaining major changes in the institution's operating procedures since the 1980s.

The framed image of a female body, hung on the walls of an art gallery, is an icon of Western culture, a symbol of civilization and accomplishment. But how and why did the female nude acquire this status? The Female Nude brings together, in an entirely new way, analysis of the historical tradition of the female nude and discussion of recent feminist art, and by exploring the ways in which acceptable and unacceptable images of the female body are produced and maintained, renews recent debates on high culture and pornography. The Female Nude represents the first feminist survey of the most significant subject in Western art. It reveals how the female nude is now both at the centre and at the margins of high culture. At the centre, and within art historical discourse, the female nude is seen as the visual culmination of enlightenment aesthetics; at the edge, it risks losing its repectability and spilling over into the obscene.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A2uIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Your Own Personal Concierge Service (Start Your Own Personal Concierge Business)","description":"Your complete step-by-step guide to starting a profitable senior concierge service in just 30 days.

These are just a few of the numerous claims to psychic foreknowledge of the ship's sinking. Within days of the widely-publicised disaster of 1912, stories began circulating of extraordinary omens and individuals who supposedly had supernatural premonitions of the disaster. Furthermore, four fictional works  one dating as far back as twenty-six years  came to be seen as anticipating the disaster. Between 1960 and 2006, five major commentators published extended analyses of the alleged premonitions, none of which is now easily accessible to an English readership. This book examines them all in detail. The whole treatment of the matter opens up fascinating questions concerning the paranormal, but also raises and leaves unresolved crucial issues specific to premonitions and how they can be legitimately examined.

In Who Will Feed China: Wake-up Call for a Small Planet, Lester Brown shows that even as water becomes more scarce in a land where 80 percent of the grain crop is irrigated, as per-acre yield gains are erased by the loss of cropland to industrialization, and as food production stagnates, China still increases its population by the equivalent of a new Beijing each year. When Japan, a nation of just 125 million, began to import food, world grain markets rejoiced. But when China, a market ten times bigger, starts importing, there may not be enough grain in the world to meet that need - and food prices will rise steeply for everyone. Analysts foresaw that the recent four-year doubling of income for China's 1.2 billion consumers would increase food demand, especially for meat, eggs, and beer. But these analysts assumed that food production would rise to meet those demands. Brown shows that cropland losses are heavy in countries that are densely populated before industrialization, and that these countries quickly become net grain importers. We can see that process now in newspaper accounts from China as the government struggles with this problem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6iOzze3X0QC&dq=Who+Will+Feed+China%3F:+Wake-Up+Call+for+a+Small+Planet+(Worldwatch+Environmental+Alert+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Planet","description":"This is what the boy is told: - He woke up on planet Trucon, inside of a fence line he shouldn't have been able to cross. - He has an annirad blaster wound to the back of his head. - He has no memory. - He is now under the protection of a mysterious benefactor. - His name is Chase Garrety.

How did this come about? To answer that question, Mark Oppenheimer set out across America to attend the most distinctive b'nai mitzvah he could find, and Thirteen and a Day is the story of what he found- an altogether fresh look at American Jews today. Beginning with the image of a party of gaudy excess, Oppenheimer then goes farther afield in the great tradition of literary journalists from Joseph Mitchell to Ian Frazier and Susan Orlean. The two dozen Jews of Fayetteville, Arkansas, he finds, open their synagogue to eccentrics from all over the Ozarks. Those of Lake Charles, Louisiana, pass the hat to cover the expenses of their potluck dinner. And in Anchorage, Alaska, a Hasidic boy's bar mitzvah in a snowed-in hotel becomes a striking image of how far the Jewish diaspora has spread. In these people's company, privy to their soul-searching about their religious heritage, Oppenheimer finds that the day is full of wonder and significance. Part travelogue, part spiritual voyage, Thirteen and a Day is a lyrical, entertaining, even revelatory look at American Jews and one of the most original books of literary journalism to appear in some years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WkotK1u9xnwC&dq=Thirteen+and+a+Day:+The+Bar+and+Bat+Mitzvah+Across+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Electronic Trading","description":"This book tackles the concepts, technical architecture, recent developments, and future opportunities in the new field of \\"direct access\\" electronic markets.

In the icy whiteness of dead winter, Nameless has nothing to do but search his memory. Who is his captor? When did their paths cross? And what could he have done to warrant such revenge?

Patton Jr, an inspirational leader and outstanding tactician, has intrigued and confounded his biographers. Utilising untapped archival materials in both the USA and UK, government documents, family papers, and oral histories, Hirshson creates the most balanced portrait of Patton ever written. It reveals Patton as a complex soldier capable of brilliant military manoeuvres but also of inspiring his troops with fiery speeches that resulted in horrendous acts, such as the massacres of Italian civilians. It explains Patton's belief in a soldier's Valhalla, connects the family's wealth to one of America's bitterest labour strikes, and disputes the usual interpretation of Patton's relief from command of the Third Army. In investigating this complex man, Hirshson has uncovered surprising material about a series of civilian massacres in Sicily, about the two slapping incidents, about attempts to exploit Patton's diary after his death, and about Patton's relations with top Allied generals. Patton emerges as a soldier of great imagination and courage, and his military campaigns make for edgeoftheseat reading. All the drama of Patton's life comes alive in this meticulously documented volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mN6IunkMP1EC&dq=General+Patton:+A+Soldier%27s+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Profiting from Fine-Art Collecting: A Book to Inspire and Promote Art Collecting","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The art of EKG interpretation: A self-instructional text : with special sections on antiarrhythmic and thrombolitic drug therapy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JsynGQAACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+EKG+interpretation:+A+self-instructional+text+:+with+special+sections+on+antiarrhythmic+and+thrombolitic+drug+therapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruise of the Snark","description":"The Cruise of the Snark is a non-fictional, illustrated book by Jack London chronicling his sailing adventure in 1907 across the south Pacific in his ketch the Snark.

In the first place, the priest of to-day, no less than his counterpart of yesterday, must never forget for one moment the words spoken by Christ: \\"Make it your first care to find the kingdom or God, and his approval, and all these things (i.e. food and clothing) shall be yours without the asking\\" (Matt. vi, 33). In other words, the end of all our endeavours must not be a mere earthly happiness for the human race freed from every form of oppression, but eternal life-the Kingdom of God. True, it is the final thing to be obtained, but it must always be the foremost of all our intents and purposes. A certain amount of temporal well-being will help us along the road towards eternal life but it must always be subordinate to the final end. The second point I want to emphasize in the course of this work is that Christ the Saviour and high priest of mankind came on earth for the special purpose of revealing God's love for his creatures who stood in need of redemption. He came \\"so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly,\\" to put within their grasp the perfect life of eternity as the full flowering of sanctifying grace, the seed of glory. This abundant life is f lr and away superior to any earthly happiness and begins for the faithful follower of Christ even here amidst the difficulties of his present life in the following way (although the communist is violently opposed to such an idea): \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, the patient, those who mourn; blessed are the merciful, the clean of heart, the peace-makers and even those who suffer persecution in the cause of right.\\" These have received already an abundance of life as the prelude to eternal life. And thirdly, I want to point out that Christ desires to live in us as his members-especially in his priests-as a means of showing God's love for men in their need of salvation. Therefore the priest should never forget to live day in and day out and at every moment of the day in an ever-deepening union with Christ, whether he is celebrating Mass, hearing confessions, directing souls, or preaching, so that in all his work he is another Christ, the minister of Christ. Never should he be a mere functionary of the Church, since Christ himself has that ardent desire to live in him for his own sanctification and for the salvation of souls.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTVUrgEACAAJ&dq=The+priest+in+union+with+Christ,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last immortal","description":"Percy Jackson meets The League of Extraordinary Gentleman meets Sherlock In Victorian London, 13-year-old Luke Frankenstein dreams of joining The Immortals - a supernatural crime-fighting squad, founded by his father Victor.

These attacks are carried out by violent anti-minority activists, many of them provoked by what they perceive to be a Christian propensity for aggressive proselytization, or by rumored or real conversions to the faith. Pentecostals are disproportionately targeted. Drawing on extensive interviews, ethnographic work, and a vast scholarly literature on interreligious violence, Hindu nationalism, and Christianity in India, Chad Bauman examines this phenomenon. While some of the factors in the targeting of Pentecostals are obvious and expected-their relatively greater evangelical assertiveness, for instance-other significant factors are less acknowledged and more surprising: marginalization of Pentecostals by \\"mainstream\\" Christians, the social location of Pentecostal Christians, and transnational flows of missionary personnel, theories, and funds. A detailed analysis of Indian Christian history, contemporary Indian politics, Indian social and cultural characteristics, and Pentecostal belief and practice, this volume sheds important light on a troubling fact of contemporary Indian life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mOaZBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundation Vibration Analysis: A Strength of Materials Approach","description":"Structural analysis is usually carried out by a strength-of-materials approach that allows complex 3-D structures to be modelled adequately for design needs in a single dimension. However, this approach is not extensively used in geotechnical engineering, partly because 3-D media (soil, rock) are present, but more importantly because until recently the methods necessary to carry out this form of analysis did not exist. In the last ten years efforts at modelling practical problems in foundation analysis using a strength-of-materials approach have developed the concept of the conical bar or beam as a tool. Such cone models can be used to model a foundation in a dynamic soil-structure interaction analysis with a variation of the properties with depth. This book develops this new approach from scratch in a readable and accessible manner. A systematic evaluation for a wide range of actual sites demonstrates sufficient engineering accuracy. A short computer program written in MATLAB and a user-friendly executable program are provided, while practical examples ensure a clear understanding of the topic.

Were the racist attitudes that fueled the Atlantic slave trade firmly in place 700 years before the European discovery of sub-Saharan Africa? In this groundbreaking book, David Goldenberg seeks to discover how dark-skinned peoples, especially black Africans, were portrayed in the Bible and by those who interpreted the Bible--Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Unprecedented in rigor and breadth, his investigation covers a 1,500-year period, from ancient Israel (around 800 B.C.E.) to the eighth century C.E., after the birth of Islam. By tracing the development of anti-Black sentiment during this time, Goldenberg uncovers views about race, color, and slavery that took shape over the centuries--most centrally, the belief that the biblical Ham and his descendants, the black Africans, had been cursed by God with eternal slavery. Goldenberg begins by examining a host of references to black Africans in biblical and postbiblical Jewish literature. From there he moves the inquiry from Black as an ethnic group to black as color, and early Jewish attitudes toward dark skin color. He goes on to ask when the black African first became identified as slave in the Near East, and, in a powerful culmination, discusses the resounding influence of this identification on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thinking, noting each tradition's exegetical treatment of pertinent biblical passages. Authoritative, fluidly written, and situated at a richly illuminating nexus of images, attitudes, and history, The Curse of Ham is sure to have a profound and lasting impact on the perennial debate over the roots of racism and slavery, and on the study of early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1MS9AiZ74MoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wanted: The Search for Nazis in America","description":"Accounts of four Nazi war criminals who entered the United States after World War II, the lives they led here, and the men who hunted them down","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lj-BAAAAIAAJ&dq=Wanted:+The+Search+for+Nazis+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Jersey law enforcement handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EvPItAEACAAJ&dq=New+Jersey+law+enforcement+handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff (Curiosities Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Becoming the Person You Can Become: The Complete Guide to Self-Transformation","description":"Drawing from the humanistic traditions of Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Eugene Gendlin, this guide presents a method for tapping emotions as a vehicle for personal growth.

Now, after serving as a Reagan White House staffer, the managing editor of Policy Review, and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, he addresses the next generation in Letters to a Young Conservative. Drawing on his own colorful experiences, both within the conservative world and while skirmishing with the left, D'Souza aims to enlighten and inspire young conservatives and give them weapons for the intellectual battles that they face in high school, college, and everyday life. Letters to a Young Conservative also illuminates the enduring themes that for D'Souza anchor the conservative position: not \\"family values\\" or patriotism, but a philosophy based on natural rights and a belief in universal moral truths.With a light touch, D'Souza shows that conservatism needn't be stodgy or defensive, even though it is based on preserving the status quo. To the contrary, when a conservative has to expose basic liberal assumptions to scrutiny, he or she must become a kind of imaginative, fun-loving, forward-looking guerrilla--philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical.Among the topics Dinesh D'Souza covers in Letters to a Young Conservative: Fighting Political CorrectnessAuthentic vs. Bogus MulticulturalismWhy Government Is the ProblemWhen the Rich Get RicherHow Affirmative Action Hurts BlacksThe Feminist MistakeAll the News That FitsHow to Harpoon a LiberalThe Self-Esteem HoaxA Republican Realignment?Why Conservatives Should Be Cheerful","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gp-rkv2jKcIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Worried All the Time: Rediscovering the Joy in Parenthood in an Age of Anxiety","description":"A much-needed book for parents about themselves. In the tradition of Dr. Benjamin Spock, who in 1946 revolutionized parenting with the famous opening words of his classic child-rearing guide, \\"You know more than you think you know,\\" child and family therapist David Anderegg reminds contemporary parents that \\"parenting is not rocket science. It's not even Chem 101.\\" So why do those of us with children worry so much? Whether they're thinking about school violence or getting a child into the right college, American moms and dads are a pretty worried crowd. Even though most American families are safer and healthier today than at any other time in our history, studies show that parental worrying has, in recent years, reached an all-time high. In Worried All the Time, Dr. Anderegg draws on social science research and his more than twenty years' experience as a therapist treating both parents and their children to clarify facts and fantasies about kids' lives today and the key issues that preoccupy parents. In the process, he offers a comforting and useful message: Parents are suffering needlessly -- and there are things they can do to take the edge off and focus on what their children really need. In Worried All the Time, Dr. Anderegg identifies some of the causes of worry in contemporary American families, including fewer children, exaggerated fear of competition, and overblown media reports of children at risk. Anderegg calls this the \\"tabloidization of children\\" and critiques the fashion for media portrayals of \\"children in crisis.\\" One at a time, he takes on the hot-button issues of our times: ? the use of day care and nannies ? overexposure to media ? school violence ? overscheduling ? experimentation with drugs and looks a little closer to see the facts and the fantasies beneath the hysteria. Calling himself a \\"crisis agnostic,\\" Anderegg persuasively argues that needless worry has negative consequences for families and for our culture as a whole. The cardinal rules of good parenting -- moderation, empathy, and temperamental accommodation with one's child -- are simple, he says, and are not likely to be improved upon by the latest scientific findings. Anderegg helps parents to understand the difference between wise vigilance and potentially crippling anxiety and to gain the confidence to trust their own common sense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bIno7L1P1fIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of the Mongol Conquests","description":"The Mongol conquests, culminating with the invasion of Europe in the middle of the thirteenth century, were of a scope and range never equaled. These nomadic peoples from central Asia briefly held sway over an empire that stretched across Asia to the frontiers of Germany and the shores of the Adriatic. Surprisingly little has been written on this vast and immensely influential empire, known chiefly through the charismatic leaders, Chingis Khan and Kublai Khan. J. J. Saunders's landmark book, first published in 1972, is a carefully documented introductory history of the rise and fall of the great Mongol empire. Saunders sets the historical stage with a discussion of nomad groups and cultures at the dawn of the second millennium, and then traces the rise of the Mongol conquests through the earlier Turkish expansion into Asia between the eighth and twelfth centuries. Beginning in the early 1200s, the Mongols led by Chingis Khan began their insatiable assault on all the kingdoms and peoples around them, erasing whole cities, killing entire populations, forcing mass migrations, and permanently changing the distribution of the world's major religions. The Mongols were finally checked along the edges of Europe and forced out of the Middle East by rejuvenated Muslim factions. As Saunders concludes, one of the major legacies of the Mongol conquests was the transfer of intellectual and scientific primacy of the Old World from Islamic societies to Western Europe, paving the way for the Renaissance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&dq=The+History+of+the+Mongol+Conquests&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds Theory, and Pedagogy (Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Literacy and Culture)","description":"Connors provides a history of composition and its pedagogical approaches to form, genre, and correctness.

For the first time, Dr. Benoit presents the traditional doctrine of Zen Buddhism in a language that is understandable to the Western world,  says one of his Indian admirers, Swami Siddheswarananda. The author does not advocate a  conversion  to Eastern religion and philosophy. Rather, he would have Western psychological thinking and reasoning meet with oriental wisdom on an intellectual plane, in order to make it participate in the oriental understanding of the state of man in general.  I do not need to burn the Gospels in order to read Hui-neng,  says Dr. Benoit. Zen, to be quite exact, is not so much a doctrine as a hygiene of intelligent living. As such it is presented by the author, a practicing psychoanalyst. It is a way of breaking the deadlock into which the faulty functioning of our civilization has led us, of liberating us from the prevalent contemporary sickness, anxiety. This book provides the elements for reaching  satori,  that modification of the internal functioning of man which can be described as a state of unassailable serenity. This state, Dr. Benoit makes clear, is he truly  normal  one. How to develop intelligence and will so that this transformation of life can be achieved is the subject of this book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sQw5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cherry Blossoms","description":"This book is a stunningly beautiful record of the nation's biggest springtime festival.

Benchlearning combines operations and the human element in a win/win-situation. The employers achieve increased efficiency and the employees attain a richer work life. The book contains both the theories in management and pedagogics as well as practical examples from actual projects. Benchlearning change peoples mind-set towards increased awareness and a higher degree of participation and renewal. Chef \\"Management issues mostly focus on the executive perspective. The authors instead emphasise the role of the employees and Benchlearning as a method to develop the \\"learning organisation\\". There is substantial new pedagogical thinking and the book constitutes a good example of creative innovation in Swedish management thinking.\\" Dagens Industri Following the success of his previous book, Benchmarking - A Signpost to Excellence in Quality Productivity, Bengt Karl?f creates a new concept - Benchlearning - by combining the practical technique of benchmarking with the more abstract ideas of Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning. Benchlearning details a completely new way of thinking which provides insights, methods and tools which deal with the continually increasing importance of the human element in organisational development, acknowledges existing theories of knowledge formation and provides case histories (such as Ericsson) and methods with which these new Benchlearning concepts can be applied. The main feature of the book is how to combine efficiency with organisational learning. Using examples from different organisations Benchlearning shows how to monitor efficiency, provide inspiration for a development drive, and illustrate how people's attitudes can be influenced. This emphasis on learning from other people's experience is a key point for successful development. The application of the authors concepts promotes a win-win-win situation - Employee performance improves as they learn to develop, customers gain more value and choice and owners benefit from a more competitive organisation.

The dynasty quickly crumbled, however, and the team found itself in a seemingly never-ending freefall. One embarrassing episode after another befell the once-mighty Islanders: Kirk Muller balked at being traded to the team; the team's classic logo was replaced with one that was vehemently ridiculed, earning the team the nickname \\"Fish Sticks\\"; a slick con artist managed to buy the team with nothing more than his charm; the team failed to make the playoffs seven seasons in a row as miserly owners purged players salaries; Hall of Fame great Bryan Trottier feuded with the team and blocked the retirement of his jersey; embattled general manager \\"Mad Mike\\" Milbury couldn't do anything to get himself fired. Yet, having finally hit bottom after enduring countless trials and near-unbelievable tribulations, the team has begun its climb to the top. New owner Charles Wang has brought not only a desire to return the Islanders to their place of pride, but also the money to do it. The team experienced a remarkable resurgence during the 2001-02 season. Ticket sales have skyrocketed since that breakthrough success, with the team expecting to fight its way back into the playoffs for a second straight season.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yy803cx0zhYC&dq=Fish+Sticks:+The+Fall+and+Rise+of+the+New+York+Islanders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Continental Philosophy since 1750: The Rise and Fall of the Self (A History of Western Philosophy, Vol. 7)","description":"The explosion of creative and speculative philosophy that emerged in Europe in the second half of the eighteenth century is a thrilling intellectual adventure story, as well as an essential chapter in the history of philosophy. The main theme of this story is the rise and fall of the Self. The Self in question is no ordinary self - no individual personality nor even one of the many heroic or mock-heroic personalities of the early nineteenth century. The Self is the Transcendental Self, whose nature and ambitions are unprecedently arrogant, cosmic and often obscure. In modest terms, this universal self is human nature. In less modest terms, the Transcendental Self is nothing less than God. This thesis is what Solomon terms the Transcendental Pretence. The book is an accessible introduction to the difficult authors of modern European philosophy. The major figures and movements are treated in an integrated narrative, free of jargon.

In highly accessible, energetic prose, Lynn Willoughby takes readers down the Lower Chattahoochee River and through the centuries. On this journey, the author begins by examining the first encounters between Native Americans and European explorers and the international contest for control of the region in the 17th and 19th centuries.Throughout the book pays particular attention to the Chattahoochee's crucial role in the economic development of the area. In the early to mid-nineteenth century--the beginning of the age of the steamboat and a period of rapid growth for towns along the river--the river was a major waterway for the cotton trade. The centrality of the river to commerce is exemplified by the Confederacy's efforts to protect it from Federal forces during the Civil War. Once railroads and highways took the place of river travel, the economic importance of the river shifted to the building of dams and power plants. This subsequently led to the expansion of the textile industry. In the last three decades, the river has been the focus of environmental concerns and the subject of \\"water wars\\" because of the rapid growth of Atlanta. Written for the armchair historian and the scholar, the book provides the first comprehensive social, economic, and environmental history of this important Alabama-Georgia-Florida river. Historic photographs and maps help bring the river's fascinating story to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jeFTh2xSZ8sC&dq=RIVER+THROUGH+TIME&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Book of Investment Quotations (The Ultimate Series)","description":"\\"He's called a broker because after dealing with him you are.\\" Anon The Ultimate Book of Investment Quotations contains the collected investment wisdom of Shakespeare, the Bible, Hollywood, Oprah Winfrey and thousands of others who have something to say about other people's money.

Immigration to the Great Lakes region and, more specifically, to Michigan was differentially influenced during each of these times. The oppressive historical roots of the Irish in both Ireland and nineteenth century America are important to understand in gaining an appreciation for their concern with socioeconomic status. The Irish first entered the Great Lakes by way of the Ohio River and Appalachian passes, spreading north along the expanding frontier. After the War of 1812, the Irish were heavily represented in frontier military garrisons. Many Irish moved into the Detroit metropolitan area as well as to farming areas throughout Michigan. In the 1840s, a number of Irish began fishing in the waters off Beaver Island, Mackinac Island, Bay City, Saginaw, and Alpena. From 1853 to 1854, Irish emigrants from the Great Starvation dug the Ste. Marie Canal while others dug canals in Grand Rapids and Saginaw. Irish nationalism in both Michigan and the United States has been closely linked with the labor movement in which Irish Americans were among the earliest organizers and leaders. Irish American nationalism forced the Irish regardless of their local Irish origins to assume a larger Irish identity. Irish Americans have a long history of involvement in the struggle for Irish Freedom dating from the 1840s. As Patrick Ford, editor of Irish World has said, America led the Irish from the \\"littleness of countyism into a broad feeling of nationalism.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hEF5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Hungarians+in+Michigan+(Discovering+the+Peoples+of+Michigan)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaizen Desk Reference Standard","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kEENMQAACAAJ&dq=Kaizen+Desk+Reference+Standard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yLRLPgAACAAJ&dq=Mission-Critical+Security+Planner:+When+Hackers+Won%27t+Take+No+for+an+Answer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Would Unbraid Her Hair : the Legend of Annie Mae","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Luminous Life : How to Shine Like the Sun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=113nAAAACAAJ&dq=Luminous+Life+:+How+to+Shine+Like+the+Sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","description":"A young woman gardner Gwen Davis flees to the Devon countryside where she will be in charge of a Land Army group of young girls who are to plant food crops on a country estate.

At its center are two sisters: Yuri, a fashion model sleeping her way into oblivion; and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny s into lives radically alien to her own: those of a jazz trombonist who claims they ve met before; a burly female  love hotel  manager and her maidstaff; and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These  night people  are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Yuri s slumbermysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime  will either restore or annihilate her. After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency  the interplay between self-expression and understanding, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. Murakami s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.  Eyes mark the shape of the city. Through the eyes of a high-flying night bird, we take in the scene from midair. In our broad sweep, the city looks like a single gigantic creatureor more, like a single collective entity created by many intertwining organisms. Countless arteries stretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cells, sending out new data and collecting the old, sending out new consumables and collecting the old, sending out new contradictions and collecting the old. To the rhythm of its pulsing, all parts of the body flicker and flare up and squirm. Midnight is approaching, and while the peak of activity has indeed passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city s moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises nor falls but is pregnant with foreboding.   from After Dark","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T28ABqCQxIUC&dq=After+Dark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Political Economy: 2-volume set","description":"This groundbreaking Encyclopedia is the very first fully-refereed A-Z compendium of the main principles, concepts, problems, institutions, schools and policies associated with political economy.

During that long span of time a cultural evolution took place which saw a high development of the arts and literature, the formulation of complex religious doctrines, systems of education, and diverse political and social organization. The rich documentation concerning these people, commonly called Aztecs, includes, in addition to a few codices written before the Conquest, thousands of folios in the Nahuatl or Aztec language written by natives after the Conquest. Adapting the Latin alphabet, which they had been taught by the missionary friars, to their native tongue, they recorded poems, chronicles, and traditions. The fundamental concepts of ancient Mexico presented and examined in this book have been taken from more than ninety original Aztec documents. They concern the origin of the universe and of life, conjectures on the mystery of God, the possibility of comprehending things beyond the realm of experience, life after death, and the meaning of education, history, and art. The philosophy of the Nahuatl wise men, which probably stemmed from the ancient doctrines and traditions of the Teotihuacans and Toltecs, quite often reveals profound intuition and in some instances is remarkably  modern.  This English edition is not a direct translation of the original Spanish, but an adaptation and rewriting of the text for the English-speaking reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_pkSygmzNUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","description":"\\"ABSORBING...COMPELLING...HIGHLY SATISFYING.\\" --San Francisco Chronicle \\"TRULY ENGAGING...Campbell has a storyteller's ear for dialogue and the visual sense of painting a picture and a place....There's a steam that keeps the story moving as the characters, and later their children, wrestle through racial, personal and cultural crisis.\\" --Los Angeles Times Book Review \\"REMARKABLE...POWERFUL.\\" --Time \\"YOUR BLUES AIN'T LIKE MINE is rich, lush fiction set in rural Mississippi beginning in the mid-'50s.

In The Japanese and the War, Michael Lucken details how World War II manifested in the literature, art, film, funerary practices, and education reform of the time. Concentrating on the years immediately before and after (1937 to 1952), Lucken explores the creation of an idea of Japanese identity that still resonates in everything from soap operas to the response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Lucken defines three distinct layers of Japan's memory of World War II: the population's expectations at the beginning, the trauma caused by conflict and defeat, and the politics of memory that arose after Japan lost to the Allied powers. Emphasizing Japanese-language sources, Lucken writes a narrative of the making of Japanese cultural memory that moves away from Western historical modes and perspectives. His approach also paints a new portrait of the U.S. occupation, while still maintaining a cultural focus. Lucken sets out to capture the many ways people engage with war, but particularly the full range of Japan's experiences, which, he argues, the Japanese state has yet to fully confront, leading to a range of tensions at home and abroad.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8MkdDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travels in San Francisco","description":"Immerse yourself in the San Francisco scene with this insider's e-guide Home to waterfront esplanades, major museums, and a nightlife scene like no other, this cultural city is endlessly enticing.

This uniquely contemporary guide to understanding the timeless message of Buddhism, and in particular its relevance in actual human relations, was inspired by Shantideva s Guide to the Bodhisattva s Way Of Life, which the author translated into English, the oral instructions of living Buddhist masters, Heidegger s classic Being and Time, and the writings of the Christian theologians Paul Tillich and John MacQuarrie.  The text is written with unusual clarity of style, making difficult matters readily accessible . . . It fills a serious gap in the dialogue between East and West, and does so in the most sensitive, most intelligent, and most careful way . . . Batchelor s strategy to use the Western disciplines in order to make Buddhism accessible to the Westerner is, I think, highly successful. The book makes a fine introduction.   David Michael Levin, Department of Philosophy, Northwestern University  Magnificent-inspiring! . . . This excellent book has come to me personally as an illuminating text, despite my close on sixty years  concern with Buddhism . . . [Batchelor s] approach is likely to appeal to many categories of readers who have hitherto never considered Buddhism as having great relevance to themselves.

Although counterintuitive, Everett's revolutionary formulation of quantum mechanics offers the most direct solution to the infamous quantum measurement problem--that is, how and why the singular world of our experience emerges from the multiplicities of alternatives available in the quantum world. The many-worlds interpretation postulates the existence of multiple universes. Whenever a measurement-like interaction occurs, the universe branches into relative states, one for each possible outcome of the measurement, and the world in which we find ourselves is but one of these many, but equally real, possibilities. Everett's challenge to the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics was met with scorn from Niels Bohr and other leading physicists, and Everett subsequently abandoned academia to conduct military operations research. Today, however, Everett's formulation of quantum mechanics is widely recognized as one of the most controversial but promising physical theories of the last century. In this book, Jeffrey Barrett and Peter Byrne present the long and short versions of Everett's thesis along with a collection of his explanatory writings and correspondence. These primary source documents, many of them newly discovered and most unpublished until now, reveal how Everett's thinking evolved from his days as a graduate student to his untimely death in 1982. This definitive volume also features Barrett and Byrne's introductory essays, notes, and commentary that put Everett's extraordinary theory into historical and scientific perspective and discuss the puzzles that still remain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dowpli7i6TgC&dq=The+Everett&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anticipating Change: Secrets Behind the SAP Empire","description":"Written by co-founder of SAP, this book discusses how and why SAP was develop.

Freehling, University of Kentucky \\"Shows clearly that the Solid South was not solid at all [and] demonstrates that the war encompassed much more than military strategy and tactics . . . it was fought at home as well as on the battlefield.\\"--Wayne K. Durrill, University of Cincinnati This compelling and engaging book sheds new light on how planter self-interest, government indifference, and the very nature of southern society produced a rising tide of dissent and disaffection among Georgia's plain folk during the Civil War. The authors make extensive use of local newspapers, court records, manuscript collections, and other firsthand accounts to tell a story of latent class resentment that emerged full force under wartime pressures and undermined southern support for the Confederacy. More directly than any previous historians, the authors make clear the connections between the causes of class resentment and their impact. Planters produced far too much cotton and avoided the draft at will. Speculators hoarded scarce goods and brought on spiraling inflation. Government officials turned a blind eye to the infractions of the rich, and were often bribed to do so. Women left to go hungry took matters into their own hands, stealing livestock in rural areas and rioting for food in every major city in Georgia. The hardships of families back home weighed heavily on soldiers in the field, contributing to rampant desertion. Deserters banded together, sometimes with draft dodgers and blacks escaping enslavement, to defend themselves or to go on the offensive against Confederate authorities. Some whites even planned and participated in slave resistance, a joining of forces that previous historians have long dismissed as highly improbable. So violent did Georgia's inner civil war become that one resident commented, \\"We are fighting each other harder than we ever fought the enemy.\\" This work stresses more forcefully than any before it that plain folk in the Deep South were far from united behind the Confederate war effort. That lack of unity, brought on largely by class resentment, helped to ensure that the Confederacy's cause would, in the end, be lost.

As well documented as this phenomenon was, it remains largely unexplained. John Mueller provides an account of the complex relationship between American policy and public opinion during the Gulf crisis. Mueller analyzes key issues: the actual shallowness of public support for war; the effect of public opinion on the media (rather than the other way around); the use and misuse of polls by policy makers; the American popular focus on Hussein's ouster as a central purpose of the War; and the War's short-lived impact on voting. Of particular interest is Mueller's conclusion that Bush succeeded in leading the country to war by increasingly convincing the public that it was inevitable, rather than right or wise. Throughout, Mueller, author of War, Presidents, and Public Opinion, an analysis of public opinion during the Korean and Vietnam wars, places this analysis of the Gulf crisis in a broad political and military context, making comparisons to wars in Panama, Vietnam, Korea, and the Falklands, as well as to World War II and even the War of 1812. The book also collects nearly 300 tables charting public opinion through the Gulf crisis, making Policy and Opinion in the Gulf War an essential reference for anyone interested in recent American politics, foreign policy, public opinion, and survey research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ImNBenfouYC&dq=Policy+and+Opinion+in+the+Gulf+War+(American+Politics+and+Political+Economy+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel Tears","description":"My name is Serena Rogers.

Paris Armstrong never saw it coming. With two grown children and a lovely home in Connecticut, Paris was happy with her marriage, her family, her life. So when her husband of twenty-four years said they needed to talk, Paris couldn  t imagine what he was about to say.  I want a divorce,  Peter tells her. Just like that, the husband she adored had dumped her for a younger woman. And just like that, Peter and his thirty-one-year-old lover had made their plans for their future, leaving Paris to pick up the pieces of a shattered life. Within days, Peter was gone. And Paris was left to figure out how she intended to get through the next day, let alone the rest of her life. The task could not have been more painful. First came the tears. Then the excruciating attempts by well-meaning friends to  fix her up  with men who paled in comparison to Peter. Worse yet, she still loved him. Finally, Paris realized she was in a fight for her very survival. Drastic measures were called for. Even her shrink agreed. It was time to move as far away as possible, just after Peter remarried. Paris had never felt, or been, more alone. Saying good-bye to the world she knew and loved, Paris heads west, to San Francisco, and discovers being single in a world full of men who were too young, too old, too married, or too good to be true. For Paris, the list seemed endless...the charming commitment-phobe...the drunken Neanderthal...the young Frenchman so adorably sexy she almost forgot about his age, and did, for a while. With her dating track record veering between disappointing and disastrous, and her daughter now engaged to a man Paris s age, Paris finally comes to the conclusion that romance is not in her future. That s when her small circle of offbeat, loving friends becomes more important than ever before. And a decision Paris makes only for herself changes her life once more. The secret, she discovers finally, is in finding the gifts in life s unexpected twists and turns, and turning despair into freedom and loss into joy. In a poignant, wickedly funny novel about getting dumped and getting over it, about tackling life with both courage and laughter, Danielle Steel explores what it means to start over, whether you wanted to or not, and finding something better than you had before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L3_mHzgMmHMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Terrible Game","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Armageddon 2419 A.

Focusing on and expanding the major section of the original Handbook, it provides information on traditional printed works, describes new guides and updated versions of old ones, notes the availability of reference works and of some full-text sources in electronic form, and discusses the usefulness to researchers of different kinds of material and the forms in which they are available. Extensive cross-referencing and a detailed index that includes authors, subjects, and titles enhance the book's usefulness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VY0dMXGd32wC&dq=American+Indian+Studies:+A+Bibliographic+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilgrimage to the Nagas","description":"Life and culture in northeast India.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lVI8AAAAMAAJ&dq=Pilgrimage+to+the+Nagas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collecting Plastic Jewelry: A Handbook and Price Guide","description":"With over 440 color photos, this easy-to-use handbook and price guide is designed to be taken into the field.

In the course of her in-depth analysis of this scroll dating from the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, G lru Necipo?lu throws new light on the conceptualization, recording, and transmission of architectural design in the Islamic world between the tenth and sixteenth centuries. Her text has particularly far-reaching implications for recent discussions on vision, subjectivity, and the semiotics of abstract representation. She also compares the Islamic understanding of geometry with that found in medieval Western art, making this book particularly valuable for all historians and critics of architecture. The scroll, with its 114 individual geometric patterns for wall surfaces and vaulting, is reproduced entirely in color in this elegant, large-format volume. An extensive catalogue includes illustrations showing the underlying geometries (in the form of incised  dead  drawings) from which the individual patterns are generated. An essay by Mohammad al-Asad discusses the geometry of the muqarnas and demonstrates by means of CAD drawings how one of the scroll s patterns could be used co design a three-dimensional vault.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xHXEDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Rose+Tattoo+(Signet+1236:+Movie+Tie-In)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composing Music with Computers (Music Technology)","description":"Focuses on the role of the computer as a generative tool for music composition.

He has long since accrued some interest in Rayne Waters, a bank employee who's too beautiful to be true -- and too beautiful to be single. At least that's what Yardley believes, which is why he has never approached her. Little does he know that Rayne is anything but taken. Not for want of trying, of course. But after barely surviving a dating disaster with her hairdresser's brother and then falling for a member of her church band who, it turns out, is celibate, she's on the verge of giving up. That is, until Yardley -- discouraged by his own slew of dead-end romances -- finally works up the courage to give her a try. The true craziness, however, is just beginning, thanks to a cast of characters who seem bent on botching the young couple's relationship. There's Rayne's erratic mother, who constantly boasts about being a \\"good whore\\"; Yardley's playboy buddies, always trolling for sex; and, worst of all, past lovers who make a habit of popping up and ruining things as only old flames (or previous mistakes) can.

The influence of these works, which have been feted around the world, has been immense, and Almod var on Almod var tells the personal story of the man and his wonderfully vivid and outrageous vision. Almod var came of age during an austere time in rural Spain: the 1950s, the age of the Cold War, of mambo, of Balenciaga, of the Korean War, of the Hungarian Revolution, of the death of Stalin. But none of these events bore any impact on his village. In response, Almod var proceeded to carve for himself a unique niche in contemporary cinema with films bursting with vibrant energy and vivid, primary colors each frame saturated with passions, releasing a pure, visual, visceral emotion. In these frank and passionate conversations, Almod var discusses his astonishing life and career with a humor that is distinctly his own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O5zJwAEACAAJ&dq=Almodovar+on+Almodovar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating Details : Projects and Ideas for a More Comfortable, More Beautiful Home","description":"Provides instructions for making picture frames, tables, stools, lamps and shades, shelves, screens, mirrors, pillows, and throws","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3nJAEzSCuCIC&dq=Decorating+Details+:+Projects+and+Ideas+for+a+More+Comfortable,+More+Beautiful+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Whispers: Bedtime Bible Stories for Women","description":"Reintroduces ten Bible stories to today's women in an evening devotional format, with dramatic retellings and suggested life-changing applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CjWEHUT99X0C&dq=Night+Whispers:+Bedtime+Bible+Stories+for+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collector's Guide to Dollhouses and Dollhouse Miniatures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3jsAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Collector%27s+Guide+to+Dollhouses+and+Dollhouse+Miniatures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Field Theory and Its Classical Problems (Carus Mathematical Monographs)","description":"An introduction to the classical notions behind modern Galois theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5s1p0CyafnEC&dq=Field+Theory+and+Its+Classical+Problems+(Carus+Mathematical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unplugged at last!

As the author shares her personal odyssey of becoming unplugged and how it affected her mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually--she entertains, encourages and enlightens, making this more than just another memoir.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xCVwAAAACAAJ&dq=Unplugged+at+last!+The+Flipside+of+Midlife+Madness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chronicle Of Baseball: A Century of Major League Action","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Art Of Illuminated Manuscripts: Illustrations Of","description":"Reproduces 50 of the most important Holy Scriptures, including the Hebrew Pentateuch and the Book of Kells","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01beAAAACAAJ&dq=Art+Of+Illuminated+Manuscripts:+Illustrations+Of&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War and remembrance","description":"These two classic works capture the tide of world events even as they unfold the compelling tale of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom.

In this parody the conservative Christian author allows humor to reveal the more ridiculous assumptions driving the original book. Each chapter of the original is turned inside out so that we can really see what's being said. Though the parody is rather ruthless in its humor, it is not hopelessly cynical just for the sake of mockery. It points to a more constructive vision, a vision of Christianity's inherent riches of truth, beauty, and goodness that the original Jabez book passively trivializes.

Williams and was named a Caldecott Honor Book by the American Library Association. \\"A tender knockout. It's rare to find much vitality, spontaneity, and depth of feeling in such a simple, young book.\\" Kirkus Reviews Vera Williams tells of a young girl who, along with her waitress mother, saves coins in a big jar in hopes that they can someday buy a new chair for their apartment, the kind of chair her mother deserves after being on her feet all day in the Blue Tile Diner. Into the jar also goes the money Grandma saves whenever she gets a bargain at the market. There hasn't been a comfortable place to sit in the apartment since a fire in their previous apartment burned everything to \\"charcoal and ashes.\\" Friends and neighbors brought furniture to their new apartment downstairs, but no one brought anything big or soft or comfortable. Finally the jar is full, the coins are rolled, and in the book's crowning moment, mother, daughter, and Grandma search four different furniture stores, and after carefully trying several chairs, like Goldilocks, they find the chair they've been dreaming of at last. Vera Williams enhances this story about family, community, and the power of working together toward a common goal with her signature folk art-inspired paintings. A Chair for My Mother has sold more than a million copies and is an ideal choice for reading and sharing at home and in the classroom. \\"A superbly conceived picture book expressing the joyful spirit of a loving family.\\" The Horn Book Vera B.

Christmas approaches and the town is gripped by the worst blizzards in living memory.

The weather has trapped many travellers in the town, including Matthew's erstwhile love, Philippa. She and her wealthy husband are invited to Michaelhouse for the main feast, and Matthew is horrified that he does not immediately recognise the over-weight, sulky woman who once stole his heart. In some ways he is relieved to accept Brother Michael's orders to identify a man found dead, apparently from exposure, in a nearby church, but the success of his mission brings him closer to Philippa's circle, for the man was her husband's servant. And then the husband himself is dead, victim of an accident on the treacherous ice of the fens - or was it a more sinister death, somehow linked to the death of one of his business rivals months earlier in London?

The emergence of formidable Republican strength in the previously solid Democratic South has generated a novel and highly competitive national battle for control of Congress. Tracing the slow and difficult rise of Republicans in the South over five decades, Earl and Merle Black tell the remarkable story of political upheaval. The Rise of Southern Republicans provides a compelling account of growing competitiveness in Southern party politics and elections. Through extraordinary research and analysis, the authors track Southern voters' shifting economic, cultural, and religious loyalties, black/white conflicts and interests during and after federal civil rights intervention, and the struggles and adaptations of congressional candidates and officials. A newly competitive South, the authors argue, means a newly competitive and revitalized America. The story of how the South became a two-party region is ultimately the story of two-party politics in America at the end of the twentieth century. Earl and Merle Black have written a bible for anyone who wants to understand regional and national congressional politics over the past half-century. Because the South is now at the epicenter of Republican and Democratic strategies to control Congress, The Rise of Southern Republicans is essential to understanding the dynamics of current American politics. Table of Contents: 1. The Southern Transformation 2. Confronting the Democratic Juggernaut 3. The Promising Peripheral South 4. The Impenetrable Deep South 5. The Democratic Smother 6. The Democratic Domination 7. Reagan's Realignment of White Southerners 8. A New Party System in the South 9. The Peripheral South Breakthrough 10. The Deep South Challenge 11. The Republican Surge 12. Competitive South, Competitive America Notes Index Reviews of this book: These two leading scholars of Southern politics present a rigorous investigation of how voting in the peripheral South (Florida, Arkansas, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee) and the Deep South (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina) was realigned since Ronald Reagan was first elected president in 1980. --Karl Helicher, Library Journal With publication of their latest book, The Rise of Southern Republicans the Blacks, both 60, have produced a trilogy that traces an almost geologic-style evolution in the South's political landscape. They've analyzed the whys and what-fors of a region, that in the past 50 years, has gone from impenetrably Democratic to competitively Republican. Their overarching conclusion: the two-party warfare that defines the South defines the nation...The Blacks' work--a mix of political wonkery and historical perspective, cut with the deliciously illuminating anecdote--is read by academics in various disciplines and political junkies of all stripes. The books are valued for their coolly dissecting insights...Because their writing swells beyond the data-crunching lab work of most political scientists--though new readers beware: The books are littered with scary-looking charts and graphs--it travels beyond academia. Party strategists are steeped in the work. \\"The Blacks wrote the book on how academic political science can illuminate practical politics,\\" says Republican pollster Whit Ayers. --Drew Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution The South's political identity has been transformed in the last half-century from a region of Democratic hegemony to a region of Republican majority. Earl and Merle Black...sedulously examine this remarkable change...This is a work of serious scholarship that lacks any hint of a partisan purpose. Committed readers will increase their understanding of both Southern and national politics. The Blacks' effort may well be the definitive statement on Southern politics over the 20th century. --Publishers Weekly Not since 1872, Earl Black and Merle Black point out in their third book on Southern politics, had the Republicans constructed majorities from both the North and the South in both houses, and it was the national character of their victory that made the 1994 election such a landmark...In The Rise of Southern Republicans, the Black brothers chronicle the party's history from the 1930s to the present, election by election. They illuminate the economic, racial and political dynamics that gradually moved the South toward the Republican Party, while also warning that the Republicans do not by any means own the region in the way the Democrats once did. --Kevin Sack, New York Times Book Review In The Rise of Southern Republicans brothers Earl and Merle Black explain the partisan realignment that has brought the South into the national political mainstream. The Blacks...focus most of their attention on the congressional arena, where voting patterns reflect long-term partisan loyalty more closely than at the presidential level...[T]he story the authors of The Rise of Southern Republicans tell is a fascinating one, with implications for American politics that are both profound and uncertain. --David Lowe, Weekly Standard The rise of southern Republicans is one of the most consequential stories in modern American politics. For political reporters of a certain generation...the Democratic dominance of Southern congressional politics is barely understood. The Black brothers make it all very clear. --Major Garrett, Washington Monthly This superb analysis of Southern politics by Earl Black...and his brother Merle Black...not only tracks the recent rise of Republicans in the South but explains why party realignment along ideological lines was so long in coming to that region...The Rise of Southern Republicans is already being rightly hailed as a political science classic. Its strength is the thorough and systematic manner in which it examines the changing ways a wide variety of factors have affected Southern voting patterns over the past four decades. The data and the rigor of the analysis are truly impressive. --James D. Fairbanks, Houston Chronicle This extraordinary book by the country's two leading scholarly experts on the politics of the American South could accurately have been titled \\"Everything you wanted to know about Southern politics, as well as everything you could ever imagine asking about it\\"...Their knowledge of the intricacies of particular congressional districts across the region is amazing, and their analysis of the larger partisan trends in the region makes this the most important book on Southern politics. --Stephen J. Farnsworth, Richmond Times-Dispatch The Black brothers have done it again. The Rise of Southern Republicans is without question the most important book ever written on the role of the South in Congress and the partisan consequences for our national legislature. Far and away the most comprehensive updating of the V.O. Key classic Southern Politics. This is a major work by extremely talented scholars. --Charles S. Bullock, University of Georgia The dramatic rise of the Republican Party in the South is the single most important factor in the transformation of American politics since the 1960s. Earl and Merle Black have described this process in a book that is witty, always filled with insight, and readable to the last page. The Rise of Southern Republicans is indispensable reading for anyone interested in American politics - past, present or future. --Dan T. Carter, author of The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics This marvelous book captures - with authority and readability - the big story of post-New Deal party politics in the United States. It is a surefire classic of political science and politics. --Richard F.

Hence, it is no wonder that electric machines have occupied a large and revered space in the field of electrical engineering. Such an important topic requires a careful approach, and Charles A. Gross' Electric Machines offers the most balanced, application-oriented, and modern perspective on electromagnetic machines available. Written in a style that is both accessible and authoritative, this book explores all aspects of electromagnetic-mechanical (EM) machines. Rather than viewing the EM machine in isolation, the author treats the machine as part of an integrated system of source, controller, motor, and load. The discussion progresses systematically through basic machine physics and principles of operation to real-world applications and relevant control issues for each type of machine presented. Coverage ranges from DC, induction, and synchronous machines to specialized machines such as transformers, translational machines, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Stimulating example applications include electric vehicles, wind energy, and vertical transportation. Numerous example problems illustrate and reinforce the concepts discussed. Along with appendices filled with unit conversions and background material, Electric Machines is a succinct, in-depth, and complete guide to understanding electric machines for novel applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_LhFxN7sUXEC&dq=Electric+Machines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angel Whispered Danger","description":"Journeying to her family home in North Carolina to attend a reunion, Kate McBride finds the celebration interrupted by the murder of a housekeeper, a case for which she finds help from Augusta Goodnight and a bumbling young apprentice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xWg9NkUmDkoC&dq=The+Angel+Whispered+Danger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Your Own Specialty Travel & Tour Business (Start Your Own Specialty Travel & Tour Business)","description":"Pack Your Bags Full of Profits!

It's fair to say that most scientists today will tell you that time travel is impossible. Three of today's top physicists - Charles Liu, Brian Green and Michio Kaku - all hold that time travel is, if not impossible, unlikely in the extreme. However, one of the most brilliant minds of our time, physicist Stephen Hawking, disagrees - although only partially. He believes that time travel is theoretically possible, but only into the future.  . But What Do Real People Experience? The opinion of science, however, has never stopped thousands of people around the world from reporting what they firmly believe are actual experiences of spontaneous time travel! Still others insist that time travel is not only possible, but they have already done it as part of top secret government programmes. Claims for time travel range from the highly flaky to the astoundingly believable. They are especially difficult to dismiss when time travel reports come from absolutely ordinary, rock-solid people who have nothing to gain by proclaiming they travelled in time. Many people who report time travel experiences don't necessarily believe it themselves. What happened to them was so strange, so unexpected, yet so real; they simply have no other good explanation for their experience. You will meet a number of such individuals in this book, most of their stories straight out of the headline of local newspapers. No doubt, a story or two will strike the reader as pure balderdash. On the other hand, some of these cases of time travel are tantalizing and unexplainable. They also come with a certain amount of solid evidence, such as stopped clocks, frozen machines and electromagnetic devices acting in inexplicable ways. Physicist and NASA scientist Tom Campbell said that scientific advances always 'come from the fringe.' Thus, even if you consider some of these stories stepping dangerously 'out there' onto that fringy edge, remember that many of yesterday's fringe theories are today's scientific fact. At the very least, it doesn't hurt to approach the idea of time travel with an open mind and a sense of wonder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E837rQEACAAJ&dq=True+Stories+in+the+News&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables (Signet Classics)","description":"203 of Aesop's most enduring and popular fables, translated into readable, modern American English and beautifully illustrated with 50 classic woodcuts by the great French artist J.J.

However, Pannenberg's work has also been criticized for not taking seriously the postmodern challenge to traditional conceptions of rationality and truth. This volume by F. LeRon Shults argues that the popular \\"foundationalist\\" reading of Pannenberg is a misinterpretation of his methodology and shows that, in fact, the structural dynamics of Pannenberg's approach offer significant resources for the postfoundationalist task of theology in our postmodern culture. Shults begins by laying out the first comprehensive summary and interpretation of the emerging postfoundationalist model of theological rationality. He then revisits Pannenberg's theological method and finds the German theologian to be a surprising ally in the quest to reconstruct a theological rationality along postfoundationalist lines. In the course of his discussion, Shults challenges views that see the future, reason, or history as the central concept of Pannenberg's thought and offers instead a new interpretation of Pannenberg's basic theological principle as understanding and explaining all things sub ratione Dei (under the aspect of the relation to God)-an interpretation endorsed by Pannenberg himself in the book's foreword. Shults also focuses on Pannenberg's unique way of linking philosophical and systematic theology and demonstrates how the underlying reciprocity of this method can carry over into the postfoundational concern to link hermeneutics and epistemology in the postmodern context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_XbDW_mCPqgC&dq=The+Postfoundationalist+Task+of+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Compass of the Heart: Embodying Medicine Wheel Teachings","description":"\\"How we live as human beings is intrinsic to how we develop spiritually.

Jones describes how, in 1839, Joseph Cinqu  led a revolt on the Spanish slave ship, the Amistad, in the Caribbean. The seizure of the ship by an American naval vessel near Montauk, Long Island, the arrest of the Africans in Connecticut, and the Spanish protest against the violation of their property rights created an international controversy. The Amistad affair united Lewis Tappan and other abolitionists who put the \\"law of nature\\" on trial in the United States by their refusal to accept a legal system that claimed to dispense justice while permitting artificial distinctions based on race or color. The mutiny resulted in a trial before the U.S. Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams against the federal government. Jones vividly recaptures this compelling drama--the most famous slavery case before Dred Scott--that climaxed in the court's ruling to free the captives and allow them to return to Africa.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XIBJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Meat Club Cookbook: For Gals Who Love Their Meat!","description":"The rules of the Meat Club: - You have to be a girl - You have to eat meat (any kind) - You have to love to talk about meat - What's said in the Meat Club, stays in the Meat ClubTired of eating Caesar salads and poached chicken breasts every time they got together with the girls, Vanessa, Gemma, and Kristina confided their guilty secret to each other (for what, after all, are girlfriends for?): What they really wanted to eat was meat.

By understanding the physical basis of how instruments are used to make music, one hopes ultimately to be able to give physical criteria to distinguish a fine instrument from a mediocre one. At that point science may be able to come to the aid of art in improving the design and performance of musical instruments. As yet, many of the subtleties in musical sounds of which instrument makers and musicians are aware remain beyond the reach of modern acoustic measurements. This book describes the results of such acoustical investigations - fascinating intellectual and practical exercises. Addressed to readers with a reasonable grasp of physics who are not put off by a little mathematics, this book discusses most of the traditional instruments currently in use in Western music. A guide for all who have an interest in music and how it is produced, as well as serving as a comprehensive reference for those undertaking research in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6qAEkgAACAAJ&dq=The+Physics+of+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eat, Drink and Sleep Smoke-Free (Headway Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wq3TNAAACAAJ&dq=Eat,+Drink+and+Sleep+Smoke-Free+(Headway+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture","description":"\\"A look at the story of cruising, this book documents a whole range of onboard experiences from the interwar heyday of liner transport right through to the present age of the ship as 'floating city'.

As an infant, Alice Thorton was discovered in Kettleborough, New Hampshire, in a boathouse by the lake; adopted by a young, childless couple; raised with no knowledge of the women who came before her: Eleonora, who brought her family to Bear Island, the nearly uninhabitable scrap of land in Kettleborough s lake; Signe, the maiden aunt who nearly drowned in the lake, ashamed of her heart; Sophie, the grandmother who turned a blind eye to her unwanted granddaughter. Alice grows up aching for an acceptance she can t quite imagine, trying to find it first with an older man, then with one who can t love her back, and finally in the love she feels for one she has never met. And all the while she feels a mysterious pull to the lake.

Few realize how much the domination of a  white male  American literary canon was a product not of long history, but of the Cold War. Suzanne Clark describes here how the Cold War excluded women writers on several levels, together with others African American, Native American, poor, men as well as women who were ignored in the struggle over white male identity. Clark first shows how defining national/individual/American identity in the Cold War involved a brand new configuration of cultural history. At the same time, it called upon the nostalgia for the old discourses of the West (the national manliness asserted by Theodore Roosevelt) to claim that there was and always had been only one real American identity. By subverting the claims of a national identity, Clark finds, many male writers risked falling outside the boundaries not only of public rhetoric but also of the literary world: men as different from one another as the determinedly masculine Ernest Hemingway and the antiheroic storyteller of the everyday, Bernard Malamud. Equally vocal and contentious, Cold War women writers were unwilling to be silenced, as Clark demonstrates in her discussion of the work of Mari Sandoz and Ursula Le Guin. The book concludes with a discussion of how the silencing of gender, race, and class in Cold War writing maintained its discipline until the eruptions of the sixties. By questioning the identity politics of manliness in the Cold War context of persecution and trial, Clark finds that the involvement of men in identity politics set the stage for our subsequent cultural history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9trgvNHupVoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","description":"In this classic thriller, two American tourists find more adventure than they bargained for when they get involved with Chinese gun smugglers and Muslim revolutionaries, learning first hand about the intrigue of the post-colonial world.

Included are 75 places shortlisted between 2009 and 2013. Each has been visited by a team of Academicians who have spent time in the place, talked to officials and local people and sought to understand what it is that makes them special and how they have achieved what they have achieved. The Academy also commissions a poem, a drawing and a figure ground plan to understand and interpret the place. David Rudlin, Rob Thompson and Sarah Jarvis have drawn on this treasure trove of material to tell the story of these 75 places. In doing so they have created the most comprehensive compendium of great urban places to have been published for many years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pQR0swEACAAJ&dq=Public+Places+-+Urban+Spaces&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","description":"In the battle of Lincoln, the sheriff of Shropshire is captured, and the king himself is detained by his enemies.

(LEISURE BY W.H. DAVIES) Loneliness and criminality determined William Henry Davies  childhood and teenage-years. At the age of 22 he decided to leave Wales for America to chance his luck abroad. But getting there was not as easy as expected. At that point in time, he became a tramp. In his best-known work THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SUPER-TRAMP, Davies tells the story of his lifetime. He explains in a very intimate and touching way what it is like to grow up in Great Britain at the end of the 19th century. Furthermore, he describes how he felt during his vagabond life and what made him settle back in the UK. After all, Davies develops into the most popular poet of his time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vbVbAAAAQBAJ&dq=Autobiography+of+a+super-tramp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roller Derby Classics...and more!","description":"A look back, through rare and never before seen photos, at the original Roller Derby and the many outlaw leagues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cBrhwAEACAAJ&dq=Roller+Derby+Classics...and+more!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Asked the Moon to Dinner?","description":"Noticing that the Moon seems lonely, Isaac invites him to dinner without realizing that his friend knows nothing about how to be a polite guest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TrQAPgAACAAJ&dq=Who+Asked+the+Moon+to+Dinner%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John M.

He remained a Celt, moving from Scotland to Cornwall where he found seascapes without urban clutter, just an occasional ruined tin-mine with its human echo. In the 1950s and 1960s he became a key member of the artistic scene in St Ives. A friend of T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, Edwin Morgan, Roger Hilton, Peter Lanyon and many others, he could be demanding, but he gave back generously. A prolific letter-writer, he is first heard here in the passionate apprentice years, then writing from and of Fitzrovia, the Apocalypse, and his years in Cornwall after The Nightfishing (1955). We come at last to his apotheosis in the brilliance and wry wisdom of his late work. Dedication and commitment to his craft produced an extraordinary body of work during a life lived wildly and to the full. These letters (interspersed with poems and drawings) are a testament to the close intellectual and spiritual bonds with nourished his writing over many years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i6xaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nightfisherman:+Selected+Letters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embraces: Dark Erotica","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Living Bible Story Book","description":"A retelling of more than 70 well-known Bible stories from the Old and New Testaments.

As the value of this continued policy comes increasingly into question, Nieto argues for the need to evaluate the alarming precedent set in Latin America: the institution of client dictatorships, the roles played by the interests of U.S. corporations, the enormous tolls taken on civilian populations, and the irreversible disruption of regional stability. Drawing from an impressive array of documents and sources as well as from her unique first-hand insights as a participant in crucial meetings and negotiations in the region from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s, Nieto chronicles the Cuban Revolution, the CIA-sponsored coup against popularly elected President Allende in Chile, the U.S. invasions of Panama and Grenada, U.S. support for the cultivation and training of paramilitary death squads in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Colombia, as well as similarly severe but less well-known situations in other countries such as Uruguay, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, and Guatemala. Masters of War offers, from an informed perspective, perhaps for the first time, a distanced, objective analysis of recent Latin American history. Clara Nieto s depth of knowledge and understanding is an invaluable resource at a time when the media is seen as unapologetically aligned with the interests of major corporations and policymakers, and the American public has reached a new height of apprehension regarding the intentions behind and consequences of its government s policies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGrB5guKEnAC&dq=Masters+of+War:+Latin+America+and+U.S.+Agression+From+the+Cuban+Revolution+Through+the+Clinton+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MAGICAL MELONS","description":"Fourteen tales relating the further adventures of ten-year-old Caddie and her six siblings living on the Wisconsin frontier in the 1860's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jAO_xAEACAAJ&dq=MAGICAL+MELONS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Frank Lloyd Wright Collection of Surimono","description":"Surimono are Japanese woodblock prints issued in very limited editions for special occasions.

Artfully posed with classical architecture or in flirtatious dishabille with stockings and lingerie, the winking models embody the erotic fantasies of a repressed society. Some of the women shown are demure and shy, wearing a slip or low-cut blouse-a great tease in an age when showing an ankle was scandalous. Their daring glimpses of decolletage carry a particular charge, so rare in today's world of overexposure. These cards were sold, often in packets, at street kiosks and under tabac counters, hush-hush but nevertheless ubiquitous. As foreigners flooded the city in the early part of the 20th-century, the cards became cherished souvenirs that were secretly collected and shared among men abroad. This is when the phrase \\"French postcards\\" became a euphemistic code for erotic nude images. These lovely ladies evoke a campy nostalgia that celebrates a healthy, voluptuous ideal of sensual feminine beauty. More retro than raunchy, French Postcards has the saucy fun of a naughty valentine, sure to charm and entertain a friend or lover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vN5hAAAACAAJ&dq=French+Postcards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eugenics and Sex Harmony: The Sexes, Their Relations and Problems, Including Recent Fascinating Medical Discoveries, Prevention of Disease, and Special Advice for Common Disorders","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOTkHESavWAC&dq=Eugenics+and+Sex+Harmony:+The+Sexes,+Their+Relations+and+Problems,+Including+Recent+Fascinating+Medical+Discoveries,+Prevention+of+Disease,+and+Special+Advice+for+Common+Disorders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uttaratantra, or Ratnagotravibhaga: Sublime Science of the Great Vehical to Salvation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Assassin of Gor (The Chronicles of Counter-Earth Volume 5)","description":"Welcome to Gor, a parallel Earth where social norms are exotic and the way of life is brutal.

Or does it lead to fragmentation and disintegration? In Saving Leonardo, best-selling award-winning author Nancy Pearcey (Total Truth, coauthor How Now Shall We Live?) makes a compelling case that secularism is destructive and dehumanizing. Pearcey depicts the revolutionary thinkers and artists, the ideas and events, leading step by step to the unleashing of secular worldviews that undermine human dignity and liberty. She crafts a fresh approach that exposes the real-world impact of ideas in philosophy, science, art, literature, and film--voices that surround us in the classroom, in the movie theater, and in our living rooms. A former agnostic, Pearcey offers a persuasive case for historic Christianity as a holistic and humane alternative. She equips readers to counter the life-denying worldviews that are radically restructuring society and pervading our daily lives. Whether you are a devoted Christian, determined secularist, or don't know quite where you stand, reading Saving Leonardo will unsettle established views and topple ideological idols. Includes more than 100 art reproductions and illustrations that bring the book's themes to life. Praise for Saving Leonardo: \\"A feast for the mind and for the eye. Nancy Pearcey not only is a trustworthy guide for a nuanced discussion on the relationship between culture and the gospel, but she is a gifted teacher as well . . . Saving Leonardo is a rare, precious gift to the churches and universities alike.\\" Makoto Fujimura, artist and author of Refractions: A Journey of Faith, Art, and Culture \\"Nancy Pearcey has done it again and better than ever. She has taken the complex sophistication of the best cultural analysis and laid it out for any person to grasp, enjoy and use to live out their daily lives honoring Christ. An astounding accomplishment!\\" James W. Sire, author of The Universe Next Door \\"G. K. Chesterton said 'the danger when Men stop believing in God is not that they'll believe in nothing; but that they will believe in anything.' Nancy Pearcey understands where believing in anything leads and in this book she reveals where a secular philosophy is taking us. A balanced, fair, and impacting work!\\" Cal Thomas, syndicated and USA Today columnist \\"Nancy Pearcey helps a new generation of evangelicals to understand the worldview challenges we now face and to develop an intelligent and articulate Christian understanding . . . Saving Leonardo should be put in the hands of all those who should always be ready to give an answer--and that means all of us.\\" R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary \\"Nancy Pearcey is an intellectual prophet in our day and one of Evangelicalism's foremost cultural observers. Saving Leonardo is a tour de force. In it, Pearcey provides a penetrating analysis of the nature of contemporary secularism, a helpful exposition of how we got to the present situation, and a well-crafted strategy for changing the situation. This is her best effort yet . . . a must read.\\" J. P. Moreland, distinguished professor of Philosophy, Biola University and author of The God Question \\"Nancy Pearcey is unsurpassed in the current generation of Christian thinkers . . . The magic continues with this book. Pearcey's virtues as a writer and thinker are once again fully evident in the range of material that she has mastered, the encyclopedic collection of data that she presents, and the analytic rigor with which she separates truth from error in worldviews. She is a prophetic voice for contemporary Christians.\\" Leland Ryken, Clyde S. Kilby professor of English, Wheaton College \\"Brilliant . . . The book brings complex, abstract ideas down-to-earth -- or rather, down-to-life. . . . Saving Leonardo bridges the gaps between the arts and the sciences, the theoretical and the practical. The book not only argues for the unity of Christian truth but exemplifies that unity and shows it in action.\\" Gene Edward Veith, provost, Patrick Henry College","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yq-4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","description":"A behind-the-scenes collector's look at the hit television series begins before the first filming and is lavishly illustrated with exclusive phtographs.

This book provides a collection of sources for an important and influential group of women in medieval England, and examines changes in their role and activities between 1066 and 1500. For most noble and gentry-women, early marriage led to responsibilities for family and household, and, in the absence of their husbands, for the family estates and retainers. Widowhood enabled them to take control of their affairs and to play an independent part in the local community and sometimes further afield. Although many women's lives followed a conventional pattern, great variety existed within family relationships, and individuality can also be seen in religious practices and patronage. Piety could take a number of different forms, whether a woman became a nun, a vowess or a noted philanthropist and benefactor to religious institutions. This volume provides a broad-ranging and accessible coverage of the role of noble women in medieval society. It highlights the significant role played by these women within their families, households, estates and communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SW8CEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The best nature writing of Joseph Wood Krutch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vd7aAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+best+nature+writing+of+Joseph+Wood+Krutch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silver Anniversary Murder: A Christine Bennett Mystery (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","description":"A phone call warning Christine Bennett that a body will be found is traced to the apartment of an attractive couple about to celebrate their 25th wedding... read The Silver Anniversary Murder to find out more!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9vf9e3IxyFkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion: Alien Influences on Earth's Destiny","description":"Early traditions speak of the arrival of \\"radiant beings from heaven,\\" self-sacrificing guardians of the human race who have reincarnated as pivotal figures in the panorama of human history to assist in the work of evolution.

Pr logo por John Zachman: El libro es una recopilaci n exhaustiva de todos los temas y casos posibles que merecen consideraci n para iniciar y ejecutar u responsabilidades de gesti n de datos en una empresa moderna. Es impresionante en su integralidad. No s lo identifica las metas y los objetivos de todos los temas de gesti n de datos y las responsabilidades sino tambi n sugiere de manera natural los participantes en la organizaci n y los resultados finales que se deben esperar. La publicaci n comenz  como una recopilaci n trascendente muy necesaria de art culos y hechos sustantivos acerca del poco entendimiento del tema de la gesti n de datos organizada por algunas personas de la secci n Chicago de DAMA. Este material fue  nico en su momento por la carencia de informaci n relacionada a este tema.

Hay una gran cantidad de informaci n para el principiante de datos, pero tambi n es de gran valor para el experto utiliz ndolo como una lista de comprobaci n y validaci n de sus conocimientos y responsabilidades para asegurar que nada se le ha olvidado. Es impresionante su amplitud y exhaustividad. La gu a DAMA-DMBOK merece un lugar en cada estanter a de libros de profesionistas de gesti n de datos y para un gerente general servir  como gu a para establecer expectativas y para asignar responsabilidades para la gesti n y la pr ctica de lo que se ha convertido en el recurso m s cr tico de la empresa que ha progresado en la era de la informaci n: DATOS!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7FdNCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","description":"After the Aztec empire falls to the Spaniards, a young Aztec named Tenamaxtli begins recruiting from among his fellow survivors of the Conquest to once again challenge the Spaniards and restore the Aztec empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q3TxwYGI8-EC&dq=Aztec+Autumn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When I Was Old.","description":"'For personal reasons, or for reasons I don't know myself, I began feeling old, and I began keeping notebooks. I was nearing the age of sixty' Georges Simenon's autobiographical notebooks, in which he recorded his observations, experiences, anxieties and 'all the silly ideas that pass through my head', are one of the most candid self-portraits of a writer ever put to paper. Here, as the celebrated author ruthlessly examines his tortuous writing methods, his past, his fame, his intimate relationships and his fears of ageing, the result is an unsparing, often painfully revealing insight into a man trying both to find and to escape himself. 'As revealed in these notebooks, Simenon's is a shrewd, lucid mind ... the balance tips toward the real, the immediate, the mysteries of human complexity above all ...

Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment.

There s nothing unusual about her except that Antoinette s seen her somewhere before. And that her death won t stay in its neat by-numbers box.

From birth to maturity, they were the stuff of which dreams are made.  I m three and you re four,  the future Queen, then a child, imperiously informed her sister. The younger girl, not understanding this reference to their position in the succession, proudly countered,  No, you re not. I m three, you re seven.  The royal sisters had no choice in their historic positions, but behind the palace gates and within the all-too-human confines of their personalities, they displayed tremendous individuality and suffered the usual symptoms of sibling rivalry. Royal Sisters provides an unprecedented and intimate portrait of these most famous siblings during their formative and dramatic youthful years. It is also one of the twentieth century s most fascinating stories of sisterly loyalty. Edwards s book is an honest look at how the royal sisters feel toward each other, their parents, their close relations and the men whom they have loved. It openly discusses, with new insights and information, the romance of Elizabeth and Philip and the tragic aborted love affair between Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend, and it has a cast of characters ranging from the youthful sisters  suitors to Winston Churchill and the entire Royal Family. It is also the story of the making of a queen, of the high drama of her situation in the Townsend affair, of the real effect their uncle s abdication had on the sisters  lives, and of the internecine feuds that have brewed within the Royal Family since that time. Brought vividly to life through the many personal interviews of close royal associates, filled with new facts, previously unpublished anecdotes and photographs, Royal Sisters is a never-before-glimpsed look at the relationship of the Queen and Princess Margaret.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STEmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LOST HIGHWAY.","description":"This masterful explorationof American roots music--country, rockabilly, and the blues--spotlights the artists who created a distinctly American sound, including Ernest Tubb, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, and Sleepy LaBeef.

Even among Andy Warhol s orbit of dramatic personas and colorful characters in the sixties and seventies, Curtis stood out. Whether done up in drag or portraying James Dean to whom he bore an uncanny resemblance he dazzled in films, plays, and cabarets. Friends fondly recall how he brought his onstage eccentricities to everyday life, holding court in the backroom of the iconic nightclub Max s Kansas City wearing tattered thirties housedresses, torn stockings, fabulous wigs, and glittering makeup. Curtis died of a drug overdose in 1985, but not before leaving an indelible mark on New York City s underground art scene. More than just a performer, Curtis translated his fixation on fame and its trappings into his own poetry and outrageous plays, such as Glamour, Glory and Gold and Vain Victory. With snippets of his work alongside colorful recollections from his friends and acquaintances including Lily Tomlin, Michael Musto, Holly Woodlawn, Harvey Fierstein, and Paul Morrissey this is a fitting and touching tribute that evokes the spirited, creative energy that radiated from Jackie Curtis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AMizCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","description":"Reprint of the 1991 Free Press edition, with Ely's (history, College of William and Mary) new eight-page preface. c.

Sensitive, bighearted, and achingly self-conscious, forty-year-old Aaron Englund long ago escaped the confinements of his Midwestern hometown, but he still feels like an outcast. After twenty years under the Pygmalion-like care of his older partner, Walter, Aaron at last decides it is time to take control of his own fate. But soon after establishing himself in San Francisco, Aaron sees that real freedom will not come until he has made peace with his memories of Mortonville, Minnesota: a cramped town whose four hundred souls form a constellation of Aaron s childhood heartbreaks and hopes. After Aaron s father died in the town parade, it was the larger-than life misfits of his childhood who helped Aaron find his place in a world hostile to difference. But Aaron s sense of rejection runs deep: when Aaron was seventeen, Dolores his loving yet selfish and enigmatic mother vanished one night. And when, all these years later, a new friend in San Francisco offers Aaron a way to locate his mother, his past and present collide, forcing Aaron to rethink his place in the world.  Touching and often hilarious Ostlund writes with acuity and refreshing honesty about the messy complexity of being a social animal in today s world   (Booklist, starred review).

Curran offers the first comprehensive analysis and criticism of the development of modern Catholic social teaching from the perspective of theology, ethics, and church history. Curran studies the methodology and content of the documents of Catholic social teaching, generally understood as comprising twelve papal letters beginning with Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum, two documents from Vatican II, and two pastoral letters of the U.S. bishops. He contends that the fundamental basis for this body of teaching comes from an anthropological perspective that recognizes both the inherent dignity and the social nature of the human person thus do the church's teachings on political and economic matters chart a middle course between the two extremes of individualism and collectivism. The documents themselves tend to downplay any discontinuities with previous documents, but Curran's systematic analysis reveals the significant historical developments that have occurred over the course of more than a century. Although greatly appreciative of the many strengths of this teaching, Curran also points out the weaknesses and continuing tensions in Catholic social teaching today. Intended for scholars and students of Catholic social ethics, as well as those involved in Catholic social ministry, this volume will also appeal to non-Catholic readers interested in an understanding and evaluation of Catholic social teaching.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xb6uGCcNlU8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dastardly Murder of Dirty Pete","description":"While traveling to the west coast, two sisters and their father have many adventures when they get lost and find a ghost town.

Shannon demonstrates that the likeness of sex and station urged in friendship enabled a civic parity not present in other social forms. Early modern friendship was nothing less than a utopian political discourse. It preceded the advent of liberal thought, and it made its case in the terms of gender, eroticism, counsel, and kingship. To show the power of friendship in early modernity, Shannon ranges widely among translations of classical essays; the works of Elizabeth I, Montaigne, Donne, and Bacon; and popular literature, to focus finally on the plays of Shakespeare. Her study will interest scholars of literature, history, gender, sexuality, and political thought, and anyone interested in a general account of the English Renaissance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=epeeatDwcHUC&dq=Sovereign+Amity:+Figures+of+Friendship+in+Shakespearean+Contexts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stray Lady (Harlequin Presents)","description":"Could she ever prove her innocence?

Among the most promising of these new computational finance techniques is the finite difference method-yet, to date, no single resource has presented a quality, comprehensive overview of this revolutionary quantitative approach to risk management. Pricing Financial Instruments, researched and written by Domingo Tavella and Curt Randall, two of the chief proponents of the finite difference method, presents a logical framework for applying the method of finite difference to the pricing of financial derivatives. Detailing the algorithmic and numerical procedures that are the foundation of both modern mathematical finance and the creation of financial products-while purposely keeping mathematical complexity to a minimum-this long-awaited book demonstrates how the techniques described can be used to accurately price simple and complex derivative structures. From a summary of stochastic pricing processes and arbitrage pricing arguments, through the analysis of numerical schemes and the implications of discretization-and ending with case studies that are simple yet detailed enough to demonstrate the capabilities of the methodology-Pricing Financial Instruments explores areas that include: * Pricing equations and the relationship between European and American derivatives * Detailed analyses of different stability analysis approaches * Continuous and discrete sampling models for path dependent options * One-dimensional and multi-dimensional coordinate transformations * Numerical examples of barrier options, Asian options, forward swaps, and more With an emphasis on how numerical solutions work and how the approximations involved affect the accuracy of the solutions, Pricing Financial Instruments takes us through doors opened wide by Black, Scholes, and Merton-and the arbitrage pricing principles they introduced in the early 1970s-to provide a step-by-step outline for sensibly interpreting the output of standard numerical schemes. It covers the understanding and application of today's finite difference method, and takes the reader to the next level of pricing financial instruments and managing financial risk.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e-9cCgAAQBAJ&dq=Pricing+Financial+Instruments:+The+Finite+Difference+Method&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audel Practical Electricity (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"AP United States History Flash Cards (Barron's Ap)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Persons and masks of the law: Cardozo, Holmes, Jefferson, and Wythe as makers of the masks","description":"\\"Noonan discusses how the concept of property, applied to a person, is a perfect mask since no trace of human identity remains.

Offering a feminist perspective on the status of animals, this unique volume argues persuasively that both the social construction and oppressions of women are inextricably connected to the ways in which we comprehend and abuse other species. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such a focus does not distract from the struggle for women s rights, but rather contributes to it. This wide-ranging multidisciplinary anthology presents original material from scholars in a variety of fields, as well as a rare, early article by Virginia Woolf. Exploring the leading edge of the species/gender boundary, it addresses such issues as the relationship between abortion rights and animal rights, the connection between woman-battering and animal abuse, and the speciesist basis for much sexist language. Also considered are the ways in which animals have been regarded by science, literature, and the environmentalist movement. A striking meditation on women and wolves is presented, as is an examination of sexual harassment and the taxonomy of hunters and hunting. Finally, this compelling collection suggests that the subordination and degradation of women is a prototype for other forms of abuse, and that to deny this connection is to participate in the continued mistreatment of animals and women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iJSuTkFlpyIC&dq=Animals+and+Women:+Feminist+Theoretical+Explorations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relentless Growth: How Silicon Valley Innovation Strategies Can Work in Your Business","description":"How can companies integrate and balance innovation with the operating pressures that executives deal with every day?

In it, McNeill challenges the Spengler-Toynbee view that a number of separate civilizations pursued essentially independent careers, and argues instead that human cultures interacted at every stage of their history. The author suggests that from the Neolithic beginnings of grain agriculture to the present major social changes in all parts of the world were triggered by new or newly important foreign stimuli, and he presents a persuasive narrative of world history to support this claim. In a retrospective essay titled \\"The Rise of the West after Twenty-five Years,\\" McNeill shows how his book was shaped by the time and place in which it was written (1954-63). He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the world's past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes. \\"This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

England, 1337: Edward III is beset on all sides, plagued by debt and surrounded by doubters. He refuses to pay homage to the newly crowned Philip Valois of France and seeks to secure his French holdings, but he's outmanned. Philip can put 50,000 men in the field, but he is having his own problems: he has summoned the angels themselves to fight for France, but the angels refuse to fight. Both kings send priests far and wide, seeking holy relics and heavenly beings to take up the cause of their country, but God remains stubbornly silent, refusing to grant favor to either side. Meanwhile, among the poor and downtrodden, heretical whispers are taking hold: what if God who has never been seen to do anything for them is not the rightful leader of the heavens after all? And as Edward s situation becomes increasingly desperate, even his counselors begin to believe that if God won t listen, perhaps they can find a savior not from Heaven, but from Hell. In a sweeping tale packed with courtiers and kings, knights and priests, and devils and angels, Mark Alder breathes fresh and imaginative life into the Hundred Years War in this unique historical epic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nRVtCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Your Own Lawn Care Business (Start Your Own Lawn Care or Landscaping Business)","description":"Revision of: Third edition, by Entrepreneur Press and Ciree Linsenmann, 2011.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EjiHDAAAQBAJ&dq=Start+Your+Own+Lawn+Care+Business+(Start+Your+Own+Lawn+Care+or+Landscaping+Business)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","description":"Describes the factors involved in sketching the human form in various positions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hkoEKeO7fVoC&dq=Bridgmans+Life+Drawing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of the town of Livingston, Alabama","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d-91zQEACAAJ&dq=A+history+of+the+town+of+Livingston,+Alabama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","description":"Presents a theory of competition that challenges the methods of Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy, arguing that a competitor's ease in entering or expanding in a given market is the only essential factor in determining advantage, in a guide that also provides a range of examples and application lessons.

This book provides a collection of sources for an important and influential group of women in medieval England, and examines changes in their role and activities between 1066 and 1500. For most noble and gentry-women, early marriage led to responsibilities for family and household, and, in the absence of their husbands, for the family estates and retainers. Widowhood enabled them to take control of their affairs and to play an independent part in the local community and sometimes further afield. Although many women's lives followed a conventional pattern, great variety existed within family relationships, and individuality can also be seen in religious practices and patronage. Piety could take a number of different forms, whether a woman became a nun, a vowess or a noted philanthropist and benefactor to religious institutions. This volume provides a broad-ranging and accessible coverage of the role of noble women in medieval society. It highlights the significant role played by these women within their families, households, estates and communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SW8CEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Popular Arts of Mexico: 1850-1950","description":"One hundred years worth of quality Mexican popular art, including pottery, clay figures, marionettes, straw mosaics, Talavera, clay banks, coconut banks, laquerware, wood panels and rugs, from 1850-1950, is covered here, with over 370 color photographs illustrating over 675 objects.

The final section examines the musical, lyrical, or visual content in popular songs, genres, or videos as a point of departure for addressing broader issues and contexts. Each chapter contains notes and a bibliography, and two comprehensive appendixes list popular song examples for teaching harmony, melody, and rhythm.

The brutal modern-day lynching stunned people across America and left everyone at a loss to explain how such a heinous crime could possibly happen in our more racially enlightened times. Many eventually found an answer in the fact that two of the three men convicted of the murder had ties to the white supremacist Confederate Knights of America. In the ex-convict ringleader, Bill King, whose body was covered in racist and satanic tattoos, people saw the ultimate monster, someone so inhuman that his crime could be easily explained as the act of a racist psychopath. Few, if any, asked or cared what long dark road of life experiences had turned Bill King into someone capable of committing such a crime. In this gripping account of the murder and its aftermath, Ricardo Ainslie builds an unprecedented psychological profile of Bill King that provides the fullest possible explanation of how a man who was not raised in a racist family, who had African American friends in childhood, could end up on death row for viciously killing a black man. Ainslie draws on exclusive in-prison interviews with King, as well as with Shawn Berry (another of the perpetrators), King's father, Jasper residents, and law enforcement and judicial officials, to lay bare the psychological and social forces as well as mere chance that converged in a murder on that June night. Ainslie delves into the whole of King's life to discover how his unstable family relationships and emotional vulnerability made him especially susceptible to the white supremacist ideology he adopted while in jail for lesser crimes. With its depth of insight, Long Dark Road not only answers the question of why such a racially motivated murder happened in our time, but it also offers a frightening, cautionary tale of the urgent need to intervene in troubled young lives and to reform our violent, racist-breeding prisons. As Ainslie chillingly concludes, far from being an inhuman monster whom we can simply dismiss, \\"Bill King may be more like the rest of us than we care to believe.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6b57AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nightscape (Roswell)","description":"When Liz has a vision of Maria being chased in an old house, the van in which she and her friends are traveling suddenly breaks down in front of a similar place, making them wonder about their destinies after leaving Roswell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QV1ZJgmLqYC&dq=Nightscape+(Roswell)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Envious Casca","description":"'Tis the Season-for murder...

These were traditionally seen as distinct andseparate developments, and explained in terms of the problems whichtheir victims presented to medieval society. In this stimulatingbook, first published in 1987 and now widely regarded as a aclassic in medieval history, R. I. Moore argues that thecoincidences in the treatment of these and other minority groupscannot be explained independently, and that all are part of apattern of persecution which now appeared for the first time tomake Europe become, as it has remained, a persecutingsociety. In this new edition, R. I. Moore updates and extends his originalargument with a new, final chapter, \\"A Persecuting Society\\".

Harley, Jr. is the highly successful author of many books on marriage, including the best-selling His Needs, Her Needs. In his latest book, Buyers, Renters, and Freeloaders, he turns his attention for the first time to singles who are tired of revolving-door romances and are looking for a lasting, meaningful relationship. The key to starting a successful, lifelong relationship, according to Dr. Harley, lies in discovering whether you (and your partner) are Freeloaders, Renters, or Buyers. Much like freeloading roommates who won't pay their fair share, relationship freeloaders are unwilling to put much effort into caring for someone. Renters are people who view a relationship as tentative and are only willing to provide care as long as terms are fair or until they find something better. The ideal partner, a Buyer, is someone who regards a relationship as he or she does a home-permanent and exclusive. Buyers, Renters, and Freeloaders shows readers how to measure their Romantic Relationship Attitude and offers practical advice for transforming Freeloaders and Renters into fully committed Buyers. It also includes a Personal History Questionnaire to help readers better understand themselves and their partner and Four Guidelines for Successful Negotiation to assist couples in maintaining Buyer behavior. Together these tools will help singles create a satisfying, exclusive, and permanent romantic union destined to last a lifetime.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QTClNBdXA-MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilles (Folio) (French Edition)","description":"Fotos fra Iran taget i perioden december 1979 til januar 1980","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8kBkQgAACAAJ&dq=Gilles+(Folio)+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The three ways of the spiritual life;","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Its centrepiece was the most expensive diamond necklace ever assembled, and the tangle of fraud, folly, blindness and self-delusion it provoked. The humiliation the affair brought on the royal family contributed to their appalling deaths in the Revolution just four years later. In this unusual, witty and often surprising version of the story, the great Hungarian novelist Antal Szerb takes the narrative as a standpoint from which to survey the entire age including aspects of it seldom considered by more orthodox historians.

Yet he was also respected as a ferocious competitor, one who pitched with his arm and his head, one who could be depended upon when his team needed a victory, and one who refused to quit, even when faced with a blacklisting, crippling injuries, and advanced age. Off the field, he was an amiable man. This work chronicles the life and career of the man and the player: his unspectacular minor league career, his 1945 debut with Mel Ott's New York Giants, his blacklisting by organized baseball for playing in Jorge Pasquel's Mexican League, and his rejoining the Giants in 1950 at the age of 33. He thereupon established himself as a bona fide big league pitcher, and went on to have a stellar career in the majors that included stints with the Cleveland Indians, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals. Game-by-game analyses of Maglie's professional career, intimate portraits of the men Maglie played with and against--Mel Ott, Eddie Stanky, Monte Irvin, Jackie Robinson, Carl Furillo, Willie Mays, among others--and a look at baseball as it was played in the 1940s and 1950s are features of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&dq=Close+Shave:+The+Life+and+Times+of+Baseball%27s+Sal+Maglie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible: New King James Believer's Study Bible","description":"Christians who want in-depth answers, practical applications, and trustworthy scholarship from the study Bible will appreciate The Believer's Study Bible.

Bombay toBloomsbury examines the lives of Lytton Strachey, a well-known member of the Bloomsbury set, his nine siblings, and his parents. Richard Strachey worked in India, marrying Jane, the daughter of the Indian Chief Justice, in 1859. A successful imperial couple, they were progressive, following the ideas of Auguste Comte and J. S. Mill, and the teachings of science. Their ten children were born over a period of 27 years andreflect the development and changes in a Victorian society moving to modernity. The richness of their letters provides a fascinating picture of a large, complex, and diverse family where attitudes to the family name, gender tensions, differing views on sexuality, ideas on modernity, and varyingdegrees of support for feminism all played a part. Dick Strachey, the eldest son, had an unsuccessful military career in India but a loving marriage, whereas Oliver announced to horrified parents that he wished to learn the piano and give music lessons, eventually finding success as a code-breaker in both world wars. Elinor, married to a man ofwealth and position, devoted her life exclusively to family and social life, whilst Ralph, Chief Surveyor in India, married a woman who suffered emotional and nervous collapses and was unable to manage a family. Pippa, a full-time suffrage organizer and, in all but name, head of the family, combinedthe Victorian devoted single daughter with the twentieth-century independent career woman, and James, a homosexual in adolescence, married Alix, one of the Bloomsbury cropheads who embraced sexual experimentation, psychoanalysis, and new patterns of domestic life. The remaining children, includingLytton, all had lives no less absorbing, and it is the examination of these lives, as well as relating the issues which they faced to wider society, which make Barbara Caine's study so captivating and intriguing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qgZJLU4sHgAC&dq=Bombay+to+Bloomsbury:+A+Biography+of+the+Strachey+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film As Social Practice","description":"This fourth edition of our bestselling text has been comprehensively updated and revised to include contemporary film analysis and recent films.

Historian John Hardman disputes both these versions in a fascinating new biography of the ill-fated monarch. Based in part on new scholarship that has emerged over the past two decades, Hardman's illuminating study describes a highly educated ruler who, though indecisive, possessed sharp political insight and a talent for foreign policy; who often saw the dangers ahead but could not or would not prevent them; and whose great misfortune was to be caught in the violent center of a major turning point in history. Hardman's dramatic reassessment of the reign of Louis XVI sheds a bold new light on the man, his actions, his world, and his policies, including the king's support for America's War of Independence, the intricate workings of his court, the disastrous Diamond Necklace Affair, and Louis's famous dash to Varennes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ro0aDAAAQBAJ&dq=Hardman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1000 Best Casino Gambling Secrets","description":"Beat the casinos at their own game!

It is a culmination of Cage's work up to that point, incorporating notation techniques he had spent the past decade developing - techniques which remain radical to this day. But despite Cage's vitality to the musical development of the twentieth century, and the Concert's centrality to his career, the work is still rarely performed and even more rarely examined in detail. In this volume, Martin Iddon and Philip Thomas provide a rich and critical examination of this enormously significant piece, tracing its many contexts and influences - particularly Schoenberg, jazz, and Cage's own compositional practice - through a wide and previously untapped range of archival sources. Iddon and Thomas explain the Concert through a reading of its many histories, especially in performance - from the legendary performer disobedience and audience disorder of its 1958 New York premiere to a no less disastrous European premiere later the same year. They also highlight the importance of the piano soloist who premiered the piece, David Tudor, and its use alongside choreographer Merce Cunningham's Antic Meet. A careful examination of an apparently bewildering piece, the book explores the critical response to the Concert's performances, re-interrogates the mythology surrounding it, and finally turns to the music itself, in all its component parts, to see what it truly asks of performers and listeners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fMnhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mahabharata","description":"In this exciting rendition of the renowned classic, Krishna Dharma retells this epic as a fast-paced novel, but fully retains the majestic mood of the original.

The revised and updated Eighth Edition adds to past knowledge while providing exciting new perspectives on the provision of retirement income. This new edition is organized into six main sections dealing with a variety of separable pension issues. Section I provides an introductory discussion on the historical evolution of the pension movement and how pensions fit into the patchwork of the whole retirement income security system in the United States. It includes a discussion about the economics of the tax incentives that have played a role in stimulating pension offerings and in the structure of the benefits provided. Section 2 lays out the regulatory environment in which private pension plans operate. Section 3 investigates the various forms of retirement plans that are available to workers to determine how they are structured in practical terms. Section 4 focuses on the economics of pensions. Several of the chapters in this section update and refine material from the prior. New chapters in this volume describe the conversion of some traditional pensions to new hybrid forms, including cash balance and pension equity plans, and the growing phenomenon of phased retirement and the issues raised for employer-sponsored pensions. Section 5 explores the funding and accounting environments in which private employer-sponsored retirement plans operate. The concluding section investigates the handling of assets in employer-sponsored plans and their valuation as well as the insurance provision behind the benefit promises implied by the plans.

The point of the book is that it may succeed in giving you a fair idea of where you stand in relation to the continuum of culture, and help you understand in what further direction you need to proceed.  Ashley Montagu, Ph. D. This provocative book, first published in 1958, is an inquiry into, and an answer to, three very important questions: 1) What is a cultured man? 2) What does  culture  mean in America? 3) What is YOUR  culture quotient ? Dr. Montagu analyzes and evaluations the first two questions above in a brilliant opening essay. He then provides 50 tests (1,500 questions with answers) which explore YOUR knowledge and attitudes and which enable you not only to determine where you stand as a truly cultured person but also to find out precisely in what directions you need to move to improve your  culture quotient.  From ballet to biology, from psychology to sex, this is an instructive test of your own intellectual status, a challenge and a guide to self-improvement. Dr. Montagu was a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University before retiring in order to devote all his time to writing. He was well-known for his TV and radio appearances, and became a renowned author.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnZUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creative Corporate Writer","description":"Writers talk about their work in many ways: as an art, as a calling, as a lifestyle.

This paper shows that, while the relative quality of teachers is declining, this decline is a result of technical change, which improves the specialized knowledge of skilled workers outside teaching, but not the general knowledge of schoolteachers. This raises the price of skilled teachers, but not their productivity. Schools respond by lowering the relative skill of teachers and raising teacher quantity. On the other hand, college professors, who teach specialized knowledge, are predicted to experience increases in skill relative to schoolteachers. Finally, the lagging productivity of primary schools is predicted to raise the unit cost of primary education. These predictions appear consistent with the data. Analysis of US Census microdata suggests that, from the 1900 birth cohort to the 1950 birth cohort, the relative schooling of teachers has declined by about three years, and the human capital of teachers may have declined in value relative to that of college graduates by as much as thirty percent, but the teacher-student ratio has more than doubled over the last half century in a wide array of developed countries. Moreover, the per student cost of primary school education in the US has also risen dramatically over the past 50 years.

Spanning the ferment of academic and social thought that erupted in those turbulent times in America, the Chicago pragmatists earned widespread attention and respect for many decades. They were a central force in philosophy, contesting realism and idealism for supremacy in metaphysics, epistemology and value theory. Their functionalist views formed the Chicago school of religion, which sparked intense scrutiny into the real meaning of theism, religious experience and the role of religious values in society. Their social standpoint on psychology generated the Chicago school of sociology, social psychology and symbolic interactionism that dominated the social sciences until the 1960s. Their educational philosophy was a major component of progressivism, aiming to make schools more responsive to the democratic and industrial character of the country. In economics, labour issues, civil rights and liberal politics, the Chicago school was also impossible to ignore This four-volume set focuses on the cornerstones of the thought grounding such intellectual activism: their philosophies of human nature, intelligence, values and social purpose. While other collections of the writings of the most prominent Chicago pragmatists (John Dewey, George Mead and James Tufts) offer some of their own individual work, no other collection captures the entire breadth and depth of the movement as a whole. Key writings of these major philosophers are set in their proper context of important writings of James Angell, Edward Ames, Addison Moore, and of many of their graduates who had significant careers, including Ella Flagg Young, H. Heath Bawden, Arthur Rogers, Irving King, Kate Gordon, Douglas Macintosh, William Wright, Clarence Ayres and Charles Morris. Also included are their debates with many critics, such as James Mark Baldwin, George Santayana, William Montague, Roy Wood Sellars and William Hocking. Spanning roughly fifty years, the 130 pieces are brought together from several dozens of now obscure and increasingly rare books, journals and archival sources. This collection will be indispensable for the study of American intellectual history, and especially the evolution of American philosophy, psychology, sociology, religion, education and politics. --130 articles gathered into an indispensable collection covering the entire Chicago pragmatism movement --all materials are reset, annotated, indexed and enhanced by new editorial introductions --includes a wealth of obscure, rare and hard-to-find original materials --indispensable for the study of American intellectual history, and especially the evolution of American philosophy, psychology, sociology, religion, education and politics","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r_7m4ezYklIC&dq=Chicago+School+Pragmatism+(History+of+American+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","description":"Hilarious send-up of the publishing industry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=16ghAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Great+Pursuit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A special trick;","description":"Olivia is a little girl who is learning to go potty at the right time.

Gorky was born in Nizhny Novgorod and became an orphan at the age of eleven. Gorky was brought up by his grandmother. In 1880, at the age of twelve, he ran away from home. After an attempt at suicide in December 1887, he travelled on foot across the Russian Empire for five years, changing jobs and accumulating impressions used later in his writing. As a journalist working for provincial newspapers, he wrote under the pseudonym Jehudiel Khlamida. The name is suggestive of \\"cloak-and-dagger\\" by the similarity to the Greek chlamys, \\"cloak\\". He began using the pseudonym \\"Gorky\\" (from literally \\"bitter\\") in 1892, while working in Tiflis for the newspaper The Caucasus. The name reflected his simmering anger about life in Russia and a determination to speak the bitter truth. Gorky's first book Essays and Stories in 1898 enjoyed a sensational success, and his career as a writer began. Gorky wrote incessantly, viewing literature less as an aesthetic practice (though he worked hard on style and form) than as a moral and political act that could change the world. He described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalisation, but also their inward spark of humanity. Gorky's reputation grew as a unique literary voice from the bottom strata of society and as a fervent advocate of Russia's social, political, and cultural transformation. By 1899, he was openly associating with the emerging Marxist social-democratic movement, which helped make him a celebrity among both the intelligentsia and the growing numbers of \\"conscious\\" workers. At the heart of all his work was a belief in the inherent worth and potential of the human person ('lichnost'). In his writing, he counterposed individuals, aware of their natural dignity, and inspired by energy and will, with people who succumb to the degrading conditions of life around them. Both his writings and his letters reveal a \\"restless man\\" (a frequent self-description) struggling to resolve contradictory feelings of faith and scepticism, love of life and disgust at the vulgarity and pettiness of the human world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UapJrgEACAAJ&dq=Mother:+The+Great+Revolutionary+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The people's choice;: How the voter makes up his mind in a presidential campaign, (A Columbia paperback, 83)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vy4hAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens's Hard Times (Barron's Book Notes)","description":"A guide to reading \\"Hard Times\\" with a critical and appreciative mind encouraging analysis of plot, style, form, and structure.

Focusing on poetry about birds and birdwatching, this book argues that attending to specific details about the physical world when reading environmentally conscious poetry invites a critical humility in the face of environmental crises and evolutionary history. The poetry and poetics of Don McKay provide Ornithologies of Desire with its primary subject matter, which is predicated on attention to ornithological knowledge and avian metaphors. This focus on birds enables a consideration of more broadly ecological relations and concerns, since an awareness of birds in their habitats insists on awareness of plants, insects, mammals, rocks, and all else that constitutes place. The book s chapters are organized according to: apparatus (that is, science as ecocritical tool), flight, and song. Reading McKay s work alongside ecology and ornithology, through flight and birdsong, both challenges assumptions regarding humans  place in the earth system and celebrates the sheer virtuosity of lyric poetry rich with associative as well as scientific details. The resulting chapters, interchapter, and concordance of birds that appear in McKay s poetry encourage amateurs and specialists, birdwatchers and poetry readers, to reconsider birds in English literature on the page and in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k4vZAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night She Died","description":"Julie Holmes has always held a seductive power over men.

This book is designed to introduce a student to some of the important ideas of algebraic topology by emphasizing the re lations of these ideas with other areas of mathematics. Rather than choosing one point of view of modem topology (homotopy theory, simplicial complexes, singular theory, axiomatic homology, differ ential topology, etc.), we concentrate our attention on concrete prob lems in low dimensions, introducing only as much algebraic machin ery as necessary for the problems we meet. This makes it possible to see a wider variety of important features of the subject than is usual in a beginning text. The book is designed for students of mathematics or science who are not aiming to become practicing algebraic topol ogists-without, we hope, discouraging budding topologists. We also feel that this approach is in better harmony with the historical devel opment of the subject. What would we like a student to know after a first course in to pology (assuming we reject the answer: half of what one would like the student to know after a second course in topology)? Our answers to this have guided the choice of material, which includes: under standing the relation between homology and integration, first on plane domains, later on Riemann surfaces and in higher dimensions; wind ing numbers and degrees of mappings, fixed-point theorems; appli cations such as the Jordan curve theorem, invariance of domain; in dices of vector fields and Euler characteristics; fundamental groups","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8-OPBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surgical Mayo Set-Ups","description":"SURGICAL MAYO SETUPS, 2nd Edition is the reliable, detailed resource students and practicing operating room personnel need for success in any operating room.

The spring is fairly with us now. Outside my laboratory window the great chestnut-tree is all covered with the big, glutinous, gummy buds, some of which have already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks. As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them-everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! I can see it without, and I can feel it within. We also have our spring when the little arterioles dilate, the lymph flows in a brisker stream, the glands work harder, winnowing and straining. Every year nature readjusts the whole machine. I can feel the ferment in my blood at this very moment, and as the cool sunshine pours through my window I could dance about in it like a gnat. So I should, only that Charles Sadler would rush upstairs to know what was the matter. Besides, I must remember that I am Professor Gilroy.

Why does this ghost of the southern swamps arouse such an obsessive level of passion in its devotees, who range from respected researchers to the flakiest Loch Ness monster fanatics and Elvis chasers? Since the early twentieth century, scientists have been trying their best to prove that the ivory-bill is extinct. But every time they think they've finally closed the door, the bird makes an unexpected appearance. To unravel the mystery, author Tim Gallagher heads south, deep into the eerie swamps and bayous of the vast Mississippi Delta, searching for people who claim to have seen this rarest of birds and following up sometimes more than thirty years after the fact on their sightings. What follows is his own Eureka moment with his buddy Bobby Harrison, a true son of the South from Alabama. A huge woodpecker flies in front of their canoe, and they both cry out,  Ivory-bill!  This sighting the first time since 1944 that two qualified observers positively identify an ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States quickly leads to the largest search ever launched to find a rare bird, as researchers fan out across the bayou, hoping to document the existence of this most iconic of birds.

Beginning with the legacies of Greek and Roman life and thought, Rommen traces the natural law tradition to its displacement by legal positivism and concludes with what the author calls 'the reappearance' of natural law thought in more recent times. In the seven chapters Rommen explores 'The History of the Idea of Natural Law' and 'The Philosophy and Content of the Natural Law'. In his introduction, Russell Hittinger places Rommen's work in the context of contemporary debate on the relevance of natural law to philosophical inquiry and constitutional interpretation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0gM6AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Natural+Law:+A+Study+in+Legal+and+Social+History+and+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","description":"Re-creates the colorful and dramatic life of William Shakespeare, detailing the youth, marriage, and theatrical career of the legendary bard","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dFE_YgEACAAJ&dq=William+Shakespeare:+The+Man+Behind+the+Genius&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get Wise!

In the first place, the priest of to-day, no less than his counterpart of yesterday, must never forget for one moment the words spoken by Christ: \\"Make it your first care to find the kingdom or God, and his approval, and all these things (i.e. food and clothing) shall be yours without the asking\\" (Matt. vi, 33). In other words, the end of all our endeavours must not be a mere earthly happiness for the human race freed from every form of oppression, but eternal life-the Kingdom of God. True, it is the final thing to be obtained, but it must always be the foremost of all our intents and purposes. A certain amount of temporal well-being will help us along the road towards eternal life but it must always be subordinate to the final end. The second point I want to emphasize in the course of this work is that Christ the Saviour and high priest of mankind came on earth for the special purpose of revealing God's love for his creatures who stood in need of redemption. He came \\"so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly,\\" to put within their grasp the perfect life of eternity as the full flowering of sanctifying grace, the seed of glory. This abundant life is f lr and away superior to any earthly happiness and begins for the faithful follower of Christ even here amidst the difficulties of his present life in the following way (although the communist is violently opposed to such an idea): \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, the patient, those who mourn; blessed are the merciful, the clean of heart, the peace-makers and even those who suffer persecution in the cause of right.\\" These have received already an abundance of life as the prelude to eternal life. And thirdly, I want to point out that Christ desires to live in us as his members-especially in his priests-as a means of showing God's love for men in their need of salvation. Therefore the priest should never forget to live day in and day out and at every moment of the day in an ever-deepening union with Christ, whether he is celebrating Mass, hearing confessions, directing souls, or preaching, so that in all his work he is another Christ, the minister of Christ. Never should he be a mere functionary of the Church, since Christ himself has that ardent desire to live in him for his own sanctification and for the salvation of souls.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTVUrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Priest+in+Union+with+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yellow butterflies","description":"Yellow Butterflies (1922)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DPgsAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U27xzQEACAAJ&dq=The+life+of+Charlemagne+(Ann+Arbor+paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sven-Goran Eriksson on Football","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEfeAAAACAAJ&dq=Sven-Goran+Eriksson+on+Football&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","description":"Soon to be a Netflix original series!

Composed of thousands of men from the two states, the Missouri-Kansas Division entered the great battle of the Meuse-Argonne with no battle experience and only a small amount of training, a few weeks of garrisoning in a quiet sector in Alsace. The division fell apart in five days, and the question Robert Ferrell attempts to answer is why. The Thirty-fifth Division was based at Camp Doniphan on the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma and was trained essentially for stationary, or trench, warfare. In March 1918, the German army launched a series of offensives that nearly turned the tide on the Western Front. The tactics were those of open warfare, quick penetrations by massive forces, backed by heavy artillery and machine guns. The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commanded by Gen. John J. Pershing were unprepared for this change in tactics. When the Thirty-fifth Division was placed in the opening attack in the Meuse-Argonne on September 26, 1918, it quickly fell. In addition to the Thirty-fifth Division s lack of experience, its problems were compounded by the necessary confusions of turning National Guard units into a modern assemblage of men and machines. Although the U.S. Army utilized observers during the initial years of World War I, their dispatches had piled up in the War College offices in Washington and, unfortunately, were never studied. The Thirty-fifth Division was also under the command of an incompetent major general and an incompetent artillery brigadier. The result was a debacle in five days, with the division line pushed backward and held only by the 110th Engineer Regiment of twelve hundred men, bolstered by what retreating men could be shoved into the line, some of them at gunpoint. Although three divisions got into trouble at the outset of the Meuse-Argonne, the Thirty-fifth s failure was the worst. After the collapse, the Red Cross representative of the division, Henry J. Allen, became governor of Kansas and instigated investigations by both houses of Congress. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker testified in an effort to limit the political damage. But the hullabaloo gradually died down, and the whole sad episode passed into the darker corridors of history. By focusing on a single event in history, Collapse at Meuse-Argonne offers a unique glimpse into one of the most critical battles of World War I. Historians, as well as the general reader, will find this new perspective on what really happened to the Thirty-fifth Division fascinating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ph4pYaZyb0EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maxwell's Conundrum: A Serious But Not Ponderous Book About Relativity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Let Me Count the Ways","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EMFNAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Niche and Grow Rich","description":"The Sanders maintain that starting a niche business could be the answer for dissatisfied employees who want to be their own boss.

These are the memoirs of a teacher from England who became headmaster of Garrynemonie School in South Uist in the 1890s.

Roads were no more than rough tracks. Gaelic was the majority language, although children had to learn their lessons in English and few allowances were made for bilingual teaching. Epidemics were frequent, and the school had to close its doors because of outbreaks of smallpox, whooping cough, scarlet fever, mumps, and measles. F.G. Rea s memoirs show how he strove to meet these difficulties his pupils would recall him as a sincere, hard-working man and an excellent teacher.

The Confessions of Nat Turner is William Styron s complex and richly drawn imagining of Nat Turner, the leader of the 1831 slave rebellion in Virginia that led to the deaths of almost sixty men, women, and children. Published at the height of the civil rights movement, the novel draws upon the historical Nat Turner s confession to his attorney, made as he awaited execution in a Virginia jail. This powerful narrative, steeped in the brutal and tragic history of American slavery, reveals a Turner who is neither a hero nor a demon, but rather a man driven to exact vengeance for the centuries of injustice inflicted upon his people. Nat Turner is a galvanizing portrayal of the crushing institution of slavery, and Styron s deeply layered characterization is a stunning rendering of one man s violent struggle against oppression.

But a short spell in prison helped propel Nail onwards and upwards.

Unlike the Hiss or Rosenberg case, it did not lead to an epic courtroom confrontation or the imprisonment or execution of any of the principals, and perhaps for this reason, it has been largely ignored by historians. Harvey Klehr and Ronald Radosh provide a full-scale history of the first public drama featuring charges that respectable American citizens had spied for the Communists. It is a story with few heroes, many villains, and more than a few knaves. In June 1945, six people associated with the magazine Amerasia were arrested by the FBI and accused of espionage on behalf of the Chinese Communists. But only Philip Jaffe, editor of Amerasia, and Emmanuel Larsen, a government employee, were convicted of any offense, and their convictions were merely for unauthorized possession of government documents. Klehr and Radosh are the first researchers to have obtained the FBI files on the Amerasia case, including transcripts of wiretaps on the telephones, homes, and hotel rooms of the suspects, and they use this material to re-create the actual words and actions of the defendants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfrTpBLdl50C&dq=Amerasia+Spy+Case:+Prelude+to+McCarthyism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Night, Everybody ...and Be Kind","description":"Autobiography of a Duluth media personality who began his career in radio at age 19 and who has anchored the WDIO-TV news since 1970.

Our universe is carefully designed to allow life and human development. The universe started with a \\"Big Bang,\\" the beginning of space and time. There is no 'before' before the Bang, and science does not know what caused it. Darwin's Theory of Evolution appears to do away with God, but there is enormous controversy among Darwin scientists as to how evolution works. Other scientists raise critical objections. Darwinism is not proven. Scientists don't know how life got started, because living matter, even single-celled forms, have been found to be extremely complex. This book proposes, for those who have faith in God and for those who have chosen not to accept God on faith, if they study scientific discoveries they will find overwhelming evidence of the Hand of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1cNWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Science+vs.+Religion:+The+500-Year+War,+Finding+God+in+the+Heat+of+the+Battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The war of the worlds, The time machine, and selected short stories","description":"In three classic works, a time traveler finds a strange new world in the year 802,700; a scientist attempts to fulfill his evil desires after becoming invisible; and an astronomer fights for survival after Martians invade Earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RwWxrAxYvCUC&dq=The+war+of+the+worlds,+The+time+machine,+and+selected+short+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hook A Fish, Catch A Mountain","description":"After catching a cutthroat, a vanishing species of fish in the Snake River, Spinner Shafter and her cousin Alligator do some ecological detecting to determine where the fish came from and how he had survived.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7RwtAgAACAAJ&dq=Hook+A+Fish,+Catch+A+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eminent Historians: Their Technology, Their Line, Their Fraud","description":"'Shourie has the anecdotal reasoning of Nirad Chaudhuri married to the writing style of Robert Ludlum. Both are in ample evidence in this book.' - India Today In this incisive commentary, Arun Shourie documents the ways in which our history textbooks have been doctored by leftist historians. Thoroughly researched and riveting, this study brings to light the techniques and frauds that a cabal of some of our best-known academicians has used to promote themselves, and to acquire control over institutions. And then to put these supposedly academic institutions to use. Shourie shows how, in the process, this cabal has perverted India's historical narrative, and thereby vitiated the country's public discourse. Two new chapters bring to light recent developments in the field: how, with their holy scriptures having been repudiated in their holy cities, these 'historians' strive to retain their perches by dominating niche domains; how these efforts are bound to fail; but how their trajectory holds vital lessons for those who seek to replace them.

The Social Contract helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. The Social Contract argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate.

During those 270 days, clashing factions -- the occupying Germans, the Allies, the growing resistance movement, and the Pope -- contended for control over the destiny of the Eternal City. In The Battle for Rome, Robert Katz vividly recreates the drama of the occupation and offers new information from recently declassified documents to explain the intentions of the rival forces. One of the enduring myths of World War II is the legend that Rome was an \\"open city,\\" free from military activity. In fact the German occupation was brutal, beginning almost immediately with the first roundup of Jews in Italy. Rome was a strategic prize that the Germans and the Allies fought bitterly to win. The Allied advance up the Italian peninsula from Salerno and Anzio in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war was designed to capture the Italian capital. Dominating the city in his own way was Pope Pius XII, who used his authority in a ceaseless effort to spare Rome, especially the Vatican and the papal properties, from destruction. But historical documents demonstrate that the Pope was as concerned about the Partisans as he was about the Nazis, regarding the Partisans as harbingers of Communism in the Eternal City. The Roman Resistance was a coalition of political parties that agreed on little beyond liberating Rome, but the Partisans, the organized military arm of the coalition, became increasingly active and effective as the occupation lengthened. Katz tells the story of two young Partisans, Elena and Paolo, who fought side by side, became lovers, and later played a central role in the most significant guerrilla action of the occupation. In retaliation for this action, the Germans committed the Ardeatine Caves Massacre, slaying hundreds of Roman men and boys. The Pope's decision not to intervene in that atrocity has been a source of controversy and debate among historians for decades, but drawing on Vatican documents, Katz authoritatively examines the matter. Katz takes readers into the occupied city to witness the desperate efforts of the key actors: OSS undercover agent Peter Tompkins, struggling to forge an effective spy network among the Partisans; German diplomats, working against their own government to save Rome even as they condoned the Nazi repression of its citizens; Pope Pius XII, anxiously trying to protect the Vatican at the risk of depending on the occupying Germans, who maintained order by increasingly draconian measures; and the U.S. and British commanders, who disagreed about the best way to engage the enemy, turning the final advance into a race to be first to take Rome. The Battle for Rome is a landmark work that draws on newly released documents and firsthand testimony gathered over decades to offer the finest account yet of one of the most dramatic episodes of World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cVMxPVXEKRMC&dq=TRAINING+YOUR+RETRIEVER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks San Juan Islands: Including Victoria and the Southern Gulf Islands","description":"Travel writer and ecologist Don Pitcher knows the best way to experience the San Juan Islands, from sea kayaking off Orcas Island to whale-watching near Victoria.

A lively compendium of dispatches from the far reaches of today s computer savvy avant-garde , Escape Velocity explores the dawn of the Information Age, and the high-tech subcultures that celebrated, critiqued, and gave birth to our wired world and a counterculture digital underground (The New York Times Book Review). Poised between technological rapture and social rupture, Escape Velocity poses the fundamental question of our time: Is technology liberating or enslaving us in the twenty-first century? Mark Dery takes us on an electrifying tour of the high-tech underground. Investigating the shadowy byways of cyberculture, we meet would-be cyborgs who believe the body is obsolete and dream of downloading their minds into computers, cyberhippies who boost their brainpower with smart drugs and mind machines, techno-primitives who sport  biomechanical  tattoos of computer circuitry, and cyberpunk roboticists whose dystopian contraptions duel to the death before howling crowds.  Re-prov[ing] Dery an astute and trustworthy patrolman of the cultural and social borderland between science fiction and non-fiction , Escape Velocity stands alone as the first truly critical inquiry into cyberculture (Wired). Shifting the focus of our conversation about technology from the corridors of power to disparate voices on the cultural fringes, Dery wires it into the power politics and social issues of the moment. It is essential reading for everyone interested in computer culture and the shape of things to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_riKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The haunted universe: A psychic look at miracles, UFOs and mysteries of nature","description":"Breaking through the inhibitions of the field of parapsychology, D.

Kimura's neutral theory, first presented in 1968, challenged the notion that natural selection was the sole directive force in evolution. Arguing that mutations and random drift account for variations at the level of DNA and amino acids, Kimura advanced a theory of evolutionary change that was strongly challenged at first and that eventually earned the respect and interest of evolutionary biologists throughout the world. This volume includes the seminal papers on the neutral theory, as well as many others that cover such topics as population structure, variable selection intensity, the genetics of quantitative characters, inbreeding systems, and reversibility of changes by random drift.

The book is designed based on a fourteen-week curriculum, with fourteen chapters that provide easy and simple guidance for working through the course. Each week addresses a topic and assembles the core cases, statutes, or rules that students and the professor reasonably may study in four hours of class time. In addition to the book's fourteen-week structure, the text also offers materials for alternative weeks that may be substituted for topics covered in the main text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hbRPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Civil+Procedure+(American+Casebook+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","description":"The Satyricon is one of the most outrageous and strikingly modern works to have survived from the ancient world. Most likely written by an advisor of Nero, it recounts the adventures of Encolpius and his companions as they travel around Italy, encountering courtesans, priestesses, con men, brothel-keepers, pompous professors and, above all, Trimalchio, the nouveau riche millionaire whose debauched feasting and pretentious vulgarity make him one of the great comic characters in literature. Estimated to date from 63 - 65 AD, and only surviving in fragments, The Satyricon nevertheless offers an unmatched satirical portrait of the age of Nero, in all its excesses and chaos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mUjf-zCUczsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","description":"A story based on the saga by Marion Zimmer Bradley follows the Avalon characters' predecessors, the exiled high priestess Tiriki and royal acolyte Damisa, who escape from Atlantis to the mist-shrouded isle of Britain, where their duties conflict with their hearts.
