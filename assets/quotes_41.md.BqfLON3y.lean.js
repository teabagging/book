I read it in fifth grade which might have been too young for even me, but it was great!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five \\"books\\", each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: \\"Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It's growing out of sour earth. And it's strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong\\" (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919.After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as \\"serene\\", and quoting Francie's observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie's parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie's sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny's brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father's death, and sees her mother's newest pregnancy, which is Johnny's child. She recognizes her mother's apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat.Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie's new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie's new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self.Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary. I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. \\"The tree hadn't died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again...It lived! And nothing could destroy it\\" (483)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has a way of being able to transport you right to the place and time.

At the time, it was just a book I saw on a clearance rack at Barnes and Noble. I knew it was a classic and I just wanted to read it quick and cross it off on the book list I was building. I didn't know that when I began reading it that I would finish it in less than a week, and then go back and re-read passages.The book tells the story of Francie Nolan, a girl growing up in early 1900's Brooklyn. Francie's story weaves through themes of poverty, pride, family, and just the wonders, heartbreak, and humor of childhood and teen years. There's great dialogue and colorful characters to love and hate. It's amazing to be able to relate to a character, when the time gap between is about 100 years.This book is awesome, wondrous, beautiful... I just finished re-reading it again after years of not touching it, and I was reminded why it is one of my favorite books, it still resonates with me today. This should be required reading for kids in school, and their parents :) Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Although this appears under my husband's account because he gifted me the Kindle and set up the account, I am the one who read this book as a young girl of approximately ten years old.

I encourage others to experience the story of a young girl coming of age in NYC.

Completely fell in love with young Francie Nolan and her family, immigrants who strived to make a better life for their children in poverty-stricken Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, this book had me both smiling and fighting back tears many times. As I reached the final pages, I slowed down my reading, because I just didn't want to say good-bye to the characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As is stated in this book's forward, this story isn't about one thing. There isn't one topic, one climax, one point. It meanders quietly, yet poignantly through the growing up years of a young girl living in the poverty stricken tenements of 1912 Brooklyn, NY. To describe the plot is impossible if one wants to do it justice. There's just too much that would have to be left out and that that would be a shame. Suffice it to say it keeps one's attention to the elimination of everything else.Upon research, I found it is actually an autobiography of the author (which makes it even more moving and unforgettable) who, upon request turned it into a story. I also learned while it became a huge best-seller when originally published in 1942, it was also hugely controversial. People didn't want to see poverty and injustice, reality in their stories. Looking in that mirror could be just too uncomfortable. Honesty is fine - up to a point - but truth is sometimes awfully hard to stomach. Taking from the book:\\" Honesty is casting bright light on your own experience; truth is casting it on the experiences of all\\"And, that's what Ms. Smith did so well. In her story we see bits of ourselves, for good or bad. We relate to the too-skinny girl who doesn't fit in. We remember the cruel children, the harsh teachers, the humiliating situations that coat the human experience. We also remember the joys that make childhood magical, the dreams that make growing up an adventure, no matter one's social class. Francie's life is filled with life - humanities. It's a story of living among the desperately poor through the eyes of one who knows nothing else. But, lest one think it is depressing and dark, it's also a story of love, of family, of the infallible will to do better in a country where better is always promised but sometimes disappoints. It's innocence shines through even while its hideousness is obvious. It is a quiet, heart-wrenching, soul-felt, yet ultimately hopeful story. It accepts weakness but inspires greatness. It admits ugliness while searching for beauty. It acknowledges great despair while encouraging great hope. All with a clear, simple voice of an 11 year old girl"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this story and I plan to make my girls read it as soon as they are old enough.

Incredible to think of life exactly 100 years ago. Things were so different. 100 years from now? Makes me wonder!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was originally published in 1943, it was a huge success, and Betty Smith's book became an instant classic. It is about several years in the life of the Nolan family in the early 20th century and it is mostly about the coming-of-age of the main character, Francie Nolan. It is that rare novel that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.This book very definitely has its own style, I think partly because it was written as a memoir and changed into a novel. Smith obviously poured her heart into this book. Her other novels are charming, but they don't have the depth of this book. Because Smith could fictionalize apparently real people, she could flesh out the characters until they seem like real people, not characters in a novel. Sometimes even minor characters are given thoughts and feelings, as how they relate to the main characters in the book.A strong point of the novel is its sense of place. Smith even describes in detail the neighborhood. the neighbors and everyday life until you feel are actually in the Brooklyn of 100 years ago. The novel opens by describing Brooklyn in 1912:\\"Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only word for it; especially on a Saturday afternoon in the summer.\\"The women are the stronger people in the book. Many of the male characters are weak-willed, while the women persevere. Francie Nolan, the main character, is the daughter of Johnny and Katie Nolan and the sister of Neeley. Francie is a fully-realized character. Francie is a strong person, who you know will do well in life.Katie, the mother, is very hard-working. She cleans apartment buildings for a living. She is scrubbing floors when she is an advanced state of pregnancy. Katie refuses anything that smacks of \\"charity.\\" One wonders what she would think of Section 8, food stamps, free school lunches, and WIC. Sometimes there is no food in the house, and the children go hungry.Johnny Nolan, the father, is a singing waiter, but has no steady job. He mostly works at one-shot jobs like weddings and parties. Johnny is an alcoholic. There was little understanding or treatment of alcoholism when Smith wrote the book. We now know that alcoholism is a disease, with both powerful psychological as well as physical components. So even though Johnny is lovable, and really loves his children, he is perceived as weak and a loser. Johnny comes from a long line of alcoholics; perhaps his problems were at least partially due to a genetic disposition toward the disease.Francie senses that her mother loves Neeley more, but she eventually comes to peace with it. This does not mean that her mother doesn't love her, of course she does. It is partly because Neeley is reminiscent of the father and Katie does not want him to turn out the same way. Francie is like her mother in that she is strong and smart, but she has also inherited her father's creative ability and his dreaminess. One of the main differences between Francie and her father is that Francie takes action, and Katie admires that. Francie works hard at school and at her various jobs, and in improving upon her hardscrabble beginnings.The novel does have flaws. Some of the psychoanalyzing and character analysis is quite dated. Women are thwarted by \\"starved love instincts.\\" However, I find the book to be mostly very strong, especially about the characterization of Francie. She is a completely realized character. You feel as if you know her. The book takes her from an eleven-year-old child to a young woman about to leave Brooklyn and start new adventures. Even though she is going far away, she will never really leave Brooklyn behind:\\"She might get rid of her Brooklyn accent that way. But Francie didn't want to get rid of it any more than she wanted to get rid of her name. It meant that she belonged some place. She was a Brooklyn girl with a Brooklyn name and a Brooklyn accent. She didn't want to change into a bit of this and a bit of that.\\"You just wish that there had been a sequel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Sweet. Real. Honest. This coming of age story helped lull me to sleep throughout my childhood and I can't help but reread it yearly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am 11 years old,and think this book is amazing!!!I cannot get over how detailed and brutally true to life this piece is. Really inspiring and beautiful. So many good scenes encased in the pages, like Francy(the main character)having to buy the saturday night meat from a surly butcher,and how they got there big green Christmas tree and getting several bumps and scrapes in the process,or how aunt Sissy got her baby............in a very pratical way. All of them impeccably vivid and startling the way a little 11 year old saw the world in Broooklyn,New York in 1912 and then moving on to when Francy is 14,In 1915. It is great in audio(Kate Burton dose a fantastic emotinal reading!!!) or paper back.Has some sexual themes, but its all done in a very human and nataral way,nothing sleazy.This book is perfect for a slow rainy afternoon with a hot cup of mint tea!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A beautiful and extraordinary book I first read some 60 years ago.

I read this book in the sixth grade because my mom had been trying to get me interested in reading, but up to that point, nothing had clicked with me. She said she was going to read it along with me and quiz me after each chapter. It wasn't long before I didn't want to put it down. From then on, I would read just about anything I could get my hands on. I have such a fondness for this touching story and I plan to read it with my sixth grade students as the time frame and subject matter correlate with my state's social studies standards."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some good books are good because of excellent writing. Some are good because of engrossing storytelling. Some are good because of fantastic character development. One characteristic that I had always overlooked was the setting, that is, until I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this book, the author seamlessly transported me from my living room couch to the streets of pre-WWI Brooklyn. She made me nostalgic for a world that I had never experienced.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic coming of age book. It opens in 1912 with 11 year old Francie Nolan scampering about the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is a book about survival, overcoming adversity, and embracing life. Through her adolescent years, Francie Nolan copes with poverty, hunger, and her father's alcoholism. She is a strong, endearing character and you just can't help rooting for her.I have no doubt that the author herself lived through the same pre-WWI Brooklyn setting. No one could have created such a vivid setting without having lived through it. I was impressed by the incredible detail that she devoted to describing the setting. And I'm not talking about insanely boring details like the arch of every leaf. I'm referring to the little details about life that many authors overlook and don't even begin to think about describing.For example, I loved the author's inclusion of the milkman's horse in describing the times. At the start of the novel, the end of the horse-drawn carriage days was imminent, but it had not yet arrived. Milk was still delivered daily by a horse-drawn wagon. For some reason, the milkman's horse didn't like the milkman, but he seemed to like everyone else. In this detail, the author showed that horses had personality. For all the benefits that cars could bring, cars didn't have personality. This is the sort of detail that brings the pre-WWI world to life and makes you experience a world that has long past. Someone today imagining what life was like in pre-WWI might never think to describe horses in the way that Betty Smith did. Unless the story was specifically a horse story, a writer of today might just describe a horse as white or brown, tall or short, because for the most part, one horse would be just as good as another. Including details such as the personality of the milkman's horse was what made the setting of this book so realistic.In recent years, the young adult genre has gained quite a lot of traction. It's become popular and profitable. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a perfect novel for young adults, but I hesitate to call it a \\"young adult\\" novel. It doesn't obey by any of the characteristics of a modern \\"young adult\\" novel. It is not fast-paced. It is not plot-driven. And it is not part of a series. Instead, it is introspective, slow, and thoughtful. It is a book that any adult can appreciate without ever thinking that it is juvenile. And yet, it tackles the very same adolescent issues that everyone experiences in their transition from child to adult."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a member of that very small, elite club \\"My Favorite Books of All Time;\\" these are the books I have read numerous times, and will doubtless read numerous times again before I die. From the very first time I read ATGIB at age 11, it was firmly ensconsed as one of my all-time faves, and that position has remained unshaken in the ensuing 30+ years.I first obtained ATGIB through a free book give-away program at the poor, rural school I attended (back in the 1970s), and I can still remember so much about that very first reading -- for instance, that much of it was on a 10-hour long Greyhound bus ride. It was an impressionable and difficult age for me, which no doubt accounts for the very strong and indelible impression that ATGIB made on my psyche. I connected and identified strongly with Francie Nolan, and identified her parents with my own (and still do even now).I honestly don't know how many times I've read ATGIB: enough that I have most of the scenes and narrative practically memorized. It is a beautiful story, if a melancholy and bittersweet one, from beginning to end. Amazingly, I identify Francie and her family with me and my own even more now as an adult than I did as a young girl. I find the book more poignant and touching every time I read it.A few years ago I obtained this audio version (which I am now listening to for the second time) and it is superb. Kate Burton's narration is incredibly good, and she makes this wonderful classic even better. She captures the myriad of accents -- German, Irish, Brooklynese -- with perfect pitch.I can't recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn enough; although I think it might be primarily a women's book, I do think it could have some appeal for men, as well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a beautiful title as it highlights the tree that continues to grow through the cracks in the concrete despite harsh conditions. It's such a beautiful metaphor for Francie who continues to blossom and even thrive through her difficult childhood with her alcoholic father, severe poverty, and the other harsh realities of her life. The tree continues to grow, despite all efforts to destroy it and is a strong symbol of overcoming adversity. I love that Francie is a reader and that her books help her transcend and escape from the world around her.Francie's innocence and perseverance was amazing. One would think she was gentle and passive as she would delight in the smallest things such as the beauty of the flowers. Don't let her fool you, though. When it was important, she would stand right up and do what she felt was right. She even found and lied her way into a school that would provide her with a far superior education to the one she was receiving from the school in her neighborhood where the teacher regarded her as worthless because she was poor.The touching and beautiful tale is a tribute to hope."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you loved Angela's Ashes?

I can identify with Francie Nolan more than with any other character I have encountered in literature. The story itself is very entertaining and engaging, even as it focuses on the ordinary lives and struggles of everyday, working class people in immigrant rich Brooklyn. The beginning was a little slow, but it quickly became interesting when a background was provided for it. I found everyone of the members of the Nolan family endearing or likeable in some aspect, even the mother. I would definitely recommend this book, its one of my favorites now!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith sure has a way of making the reader connect with the characters. I was very moved by this book. The characters were very likable, especially Francine and her little brother. Reading this brings me back to my childhood years.

Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about twelve years old, and I decided to give it a whirl once again. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it because the magic of reading it is as wonderful and beautiful in your adult years as it was when you were a child. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different and interesting effect on the reader, or at least it had a different effect on me this time around. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in 1912 Brooklyn. Although her life is a constant struggle over money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and beautiful story that people of all ages will love. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree Grows in Brookly will always have a special place in my heart, it along with Maggie-now was given to me by my late grandmother when I was younger.

It is perfect for middle and highschool kids to read, it don't have all the bad behavior that's in so many coming of age stories today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've been singing the praises of the book (and movie) now for many years. It's about time Oprah and everyone else realized what an American classic this is. The story touched me long before I ever lived in Brooklyn, having moved there from the South. It's timeless and so beautifully crafted that you'd be more than a little off not to be moved by it.I actually found the character of the mother more likeable in book than the movie. She came off as a bit too hard and cold for me in the film, but then the policeman came off better in the movie than the book. Both are great--don't get me wrong--but I always enjoy creating the characters in my mind, with the help of the author. And in this case, it wasn't hard to do.The movie often veers dangerously close to something sappy, but is pulled back just in time by a wonderful cast. I didn't experience these problems when reading the book, possibly because I wasn't forced into the pacing of the film.At any rate, the style of writing of this book is excellent and the characters (even the tree!) will stay with you long after you've put it down. Another reviewer was right: \\"They don't make 'em like this anymore.\\"Also recommended: McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood and Fall on Your Knees"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school and only recently read it again. It is (along with Harper Lee's masterpiece) my favorite novel. Betty Smith captures the essence of coming of age in a tough world. She found both the humor and warmth in a life and environment viewed by most as joyless and poor. Francie is a character to be envied, finding and making the best out of a hard life; she stands up to the world and prentends to be nothing but herself. Smith writes with such vividness that every detail and character is a superb imaginitive feat. This book will be a treasure for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's certainly easy to see why this book is a classic. The haunting story of Francie Nolan, a young girl living in poverty in Brooklyn, strikes a chord deep within all of us. Beautifully told, this story draws us into Francie's early-20th century life-her father's drunkenness, her mother's disillusionment with life, her deep love of books- and makes us respond with empathy. This is certainly one of those books that trascends descriptions-it is simply a book about life that has become a classic because of its enduring truths. Betty Smith's strong main character, keen and startlingly truthful observations about life, and stark descriptions make this an unforgettable read-deserving many more than five &quot;stars.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Smith uses the descriptive style to depict Francie Nolan's story about her life well. Throughout the novel, readers are able to get a vivid picture of the struggles, hardships, and joys in the life of Francie. As the novel progresses, Francie faces the usual struggles of a poor family, worrying about where the money for food for the week will come from, and if her as well as her brother Neely Nolan will be able to acquire a higher education. An example of this is when the Nolan's are at the soda shop Katie Nolan, says, &quot;They never had enough to eat, never had right cloths. The best I could do wasn't enough&quot; (351). This passage shows that the Nolan's do not have enough money for everything needed and at times their family would struggle making Katie feel that she had not done enough for her children. Smith enables Francie to tell her coming of age story in a way that makes the reader know just as much about Francie and Francie herself does. When Francie speaks it seems that she is speaking to you and wants you to understand her pain, and joys allowing Smith to let the world know just how life was for some families growing up. Even though the Nolan family had nothing in the beginning, through hard work and some suffering, their family was able to gain a higher status than the generations before them, thus showing the reader that if you have strong determination, good will, and a sense of direction about where you want your life to take you, you will succeed and gain even greater happiness. Throughout the novel, Smith captures the readers mind as she takes them on a journey through the life of a child in Brooklyn, as seen through the eyes of Francie. Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, as an astonishing descriptive style. For that reason, the reader is able to make a connection with Francie as if they were her very own best friend and she was confiding in then all the memories of her childhood and teen life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In Betty Smith's novel, Francie Nolan is a poor Brooklyn girl, growing up at the turn of the century.

It is so depressing and made me so sad that I wish I'd never read it.

I've read a decent percentage of the &quot;great books&quot; and &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; deserves to be on the list.It can be read and enjoyed by young people, but so can &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Like &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; this book is even more rewarding to the adult reader.I read it for the first time at age 47 and was blown away. The characters, even the minor ones, truly leap out from the page, they're so real. The writing is seemingly effortless (which we all know is the hardest thing to do!); nearly every word is perfect. The insights into human relations and human pscyhology are startling and profound.The book is also incredibly modern. Published in 1943, describing life in the 1910's, yet, like any true classic, the dilemmas are timeless and the author's viewpoint, especially about women, speaks to us powerfully even today.Among its many strengths, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a completely truthful portrait of the effect of alcoholism on a family. It also tells us about how poverty really affects people and about the immigrant experience.I can't speak to how men will respond to this book, but I believe that any woman of any age will be thrilled by it.Don't miss it. And if you read it as a teenager, read it again and rediscover one of the greatest books of 20th century American literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the best book I've ever read!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is superbly realistic and worth reading over and over again!

This book is at the top of my Book List of Favorites and is perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.I don't want to spoil even one page of this miraculous novel for the new reader, so I won't divulge any particulars. (I find the less I know about a book, the more charming and surprising it's potential is.) I will say it is a young adult novel about a girl and her family in the poorest of New York neighborhoods around the turn of the 20th century. Mrs. Smith parlays feelings of innocence, yearning, grief, love, loss, hope, beauty, joy, childhood, family dynamics and how it feels to live in poverty so deftly, one can never forget this book.In our current \\"recession culture\\" this book is more timely than ever. Families are being ripped apart and children are growing up faster than before due to economic strains. While this book is set almost one hundred years ago, and some of the situations seem slightly archaic, the feelings are all still the same. The ability to protect a child and provide them with a happy and safe childhood is every parent's aspiration and the inability to do so is devastating. But as with any good book, it shows the the dark and light sides of any situation. Simply put, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.Read this book as soon as you can. It is the bitterest of sweet and sends the message that hope, as symbolized in the tree, sprouts eternal."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book...I bought this in Oregon at Powell's Books a few years ago on sale and I thought the writing was fantastic as well as the reader (Kate Burton). She was able to do so many accents for various characters and they sounded so good! This is how much I was a fan...when I first bought it, CD #11 didn't work...there are only 12 CDs so I was so frustrated. I really wanted to finish this with the reader I had started with! I call Powell's and they sent me a new set...and of course CD 11 didn't work. I ordered it off Amazon, and CD 11 didn't work. Finally, I called the publisher and begged and pleaded not just for a replacement but for someone to ensure that CD 11 worked before it came. They sent it for free and FINALLY FINALLY CD 11 worked and it was worth it. So yes, now I have 4 copies of this audio book which is a bit crazy, but hey, it was a great book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How have I never read this book before? Why didn't my high school force me to read it, as they did other novels that so impacted my life, like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or The Great Gatsby? I wish that someone had made me read this book long ago, but I'm also excited to have discovered the beauty of Smith's book on my own, as an adult, when I could appreciate it for its own merits and not because I was supposed to.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \`to read' list for the last year or so, and I have to admit I was kind of dreading reading it. Sometimes \\"classics\\" do that to me. I finally picked it up on audio, considering that to be a compromise - I could listen to it in my car driving to and from work without devoting my full reading time and attention to the novel.From the very first words that narrator Barbara Rosenblat spoke, I was completely hooked. Smith's story follows the life of Francie Nolan, a little girl growing up in Brooklyn during the early part of the 20th century. Though mainly a coming-of-age novel, the book winds its way throughout decades backwards and forwards, and into the lives of Francie's parents and extended family.Although Francie grew up poor in Brooklyn, concerned with the entry of the U.S. into the first World War, her father's alcoholism and where her next meal would come from, she is a character that can still be related to today. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic, and would whole-heartedly recommend the audio version."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was one of my best reads of the year.

I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Oh my what a trip into the past this was. I read this book several times as a child. In fact, I was about Francie's age when I first read it. My only memory was of a girl in a window and a tree. For some reason that image stayed with me more than the story.I can't say that the story came back to me as I read, it did not. This was good, in that it was like reading and discovering it all over again. No wonder I read it time after time. In so many ways my own life mirrored Francie's.Even to the picking up of trash ( bottles) along the roads ( alleys) and turning them in for money for treats.We, too were less than wealthy, but such is life. Better times came for us. As for Francie? Life is what you make it, don't you think? And Francie was a strong young girl, who grew into a strong and intelligent young woman. She came form a family of strong women, who knew how to keep family together and how to do whatever needed to be done. The poor can't afford much, and being squeamish is one of those things.I'd like to lift a glass to the Francie the woman, and the women around her who taught her how to be the best she could be. We can overcome a lot if we put our minds to it. This story was dated in some ways, but oh so current in others. After all these years there are still children who don't know where their next meal will come from, men who just don't have it in them to stand strong and do what is needed and women who make up the difference and stand with their shoulders against the door to keep out the wolf called hunger and keep in the warm called love.highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have wanted to read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" for some time and I finally did so. This is a heartwarming story about a little 11 year old girl called Francie and her truly wonderful family. The book covers about 4 years (from age 11- 16) with quite a few flashbacks to Francie's earlier life. It is set in Brooklyn in the early 1900's (about 1915-1918) and the story is about living in Brooklyn at this time of the 20 century. Francie lives with her mother and father and her one year younger brother in a poor tenement in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn. The family is poor but they do manage to eke out a living for themselves with lots of hard work and sacrifice. Francie is an imaginative 11 year old who finds beauty in the simplest things. She loves her family while at the same time being quite aware of their failings. But these failings only make her and her family stronger and the bond between them tighter. Francie loves to read and to learn and she gains a maturity far beyond her years because of her insatiable quest for knowledge, her effective observation skills, and because of the hard life she lives. When I looked at Ms. Smith's bio it appears that she herself lived in Brooklyn as a young girl at the time of the setting of this book. I am sure that she has put a lot of herself into the story, and her love of Brooklyn comes through on every page. And she obviously loved her characters as her writing makes them appear to live and breathe on the pages. It is easy to see why this book is considered an American classic. The writing and the characterizations are very well done indeed. It is a wonderful story about a precocious little girl as she grows up in a big American city at the beginning of the 20 century. I will miss Francie and her brother Nealey very much now that I've finished the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Ive always loved this book, so now I love having it conveniently on my iPad so I can take it anywhere with me"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very nice story. I think my Wife bought it for our Grand Daughter because she and our Daughter both loved it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an amazing novel, a kind of New York To Kill a Mockingbird. Beginning in 1912 but then flashing back to the early 1900s, it is the story of Francie Nolan, the daughter in a poor family. Her mother, Kate, is determined to get the best for her son, Neely, who is a year younger than Francie. Their father, Johnny, is handsome and funny and flamboyant, and also drinks way too much. And Francie loves to go the library. She's working her way through the books, from A to Z. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of the Rommely and the Nolan families' lives, centering on Francie. The title comes from a tree that grows in the yard.It's hard to pin-point what's so great about this novel. I read it 2 years ago, and loved it. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is less compelling than To Kill a Mockingbird, less deep, I guess you would say, but it's still a classic in its own right, and written much earlier. And it is pretty deep, whatever that actually means.Betty Smith brings to life the squalor and poverty of Brooklyn, New York, with her elegant prose. She creates wonderful, memorable characters and scenes. I loved reading about the various things that Francie and Neely did to earn a bit of candy money (though obviously, it was kind of sad), and reading about the various eccentricities of everyone in the neighborhood. You can certainly tell that Betty Smith was knowledgeable about Brooklyn; I'm pretty sure this book is based upon her own childhood at the turn of the century, and it shows. It feels realistic.I also loved the way that school was portrayed. A lot of the kids are awful to one another; even after they go through something, they tease other kids for having the same thing happen to them. The teachers ignore when the children need to use the bathroom, and bullying is rampant. And yet, there are moments of brightness: when the music teacher comes, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) intercedes for her. Francie actually really does like school.A thing I found interesting was that even though Manhattan isn't that far away, it seems so foreign to Francie, a whole other world that she can't even imagine.The characters were amazing. Katie, Johnny, Francie, Neely, Sissy...all of them and more felt realistic and were really fun to read about. Francie, particularly. She's an avid reader much like myself, \\"on that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\" I can identify with that, and I would highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a story that lingers in the minds of young adults worldwide. It is wrong, farfetched even, to say that this book is just about a girl and her life in New York City. This is a story about life at its limit and a girl that learns to grow up. Fragile threads of a seemingly dull existence and the tragedies of poor family are what holds the bindings of the book together. It is the rich past that makes it suddenly an adventure worth reading. The peace in it provides the finally perfect piece for the restless minds of people like me, who read this story. It teaches me that no matter how wrong the start, there is always a conclusion that fits incredibly well, despite the trail of sharp and cutting glass that a shattered mirror leaves behind. This is a journey spun beautifully by Betty Smith through her concise but stunning words, woven to life by her cunning twists of characters. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a journey of life, misfortunes, and maturity, will become a towering figure that roots deep into your conscious mind."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book had interesting insights into life in Brooklyn years ago.

The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie.

Life for the Nolans was very harsh in the sense that they didn't have much in the sense of money. The father, an alcoholic who at best brought occasional income was a charming lad who was very well loved by his family, up until the bitter end, when he died, leaving a posthumous child. The mother is a strong woman, steady, responsible, and caring. The heroine in this book, however, is Francie Nolan, who loves to write. In the end, she doesn't become a published writer, but she did keep her stories real, describing how life in poverty really is, and stands for herself when an ignorant teacher tells her that her writings are sad and ugly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Loved this book the characters are like an extented family.

On the other hand, the book has a lot of historical significance and does an excellent job describing immigrant's lives in this period of time"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I doubt that I'd have ever read this book were it not for my Kindle.

It goes on and on about what is happening in Francie Nolan's life, and the whole time I think \\"What does this have to do with anything? I really don't care that Francie saw old men when she was buying bread. Does this have to do with some sort of ending that might happen after 550 pages of boring writing?\\" I appreciate and respect that this book is a classic, and it isn't really written in the style as most books are now - a - days, but I just didn't like it AT ALL."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan, the sweet and heartbreaking main character in Betty Smith's \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" details her life in turn of the century Brooklyn. The daughter of an enchanting but alcoholic father and an industrious but distant mother, Francie is a dreamy child with lofty ambitions despite the poverty in which she lives. Francie provides a sad, but moving description of life as she knows it and the tragedy and fortune that befalls her and her family.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is a very hard novel to review. It's about more than just one little girl and her family. This novel is about abject poverty, immigrants and their status in their own neighborhood and new country, alcoholism, and above all else, this novel is about carving out a place for oneself in the world. I absolutely adored this novel. It definitely ranks in my top 10 all time favorite novels. The imagery and the story are woven in such a fantastic way that this book will be one that lingers in the mind, long after you have finished it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In this classic book, Betty Smith creates a world with such realistic characters and vivid scenes that it invites the reader in and doesn't let go until the final page. The main character is Francie, a young girl who is a romantic like her father and yet a realist like her mother. She loves to read and longs for an education so that she can overcome the squalid conditions in which she is growing up. She is a survivor and does whatever it takes to get along in her world while having a rich life on the inside which no one else knows about. Her father is an alcoholic who causes severe financial problems for his family but still shows Francie love in a way that her serious and responsible mother never can. Her younger brother Neely is her constant companion and she loves him despite the fact that her mother favors him over Francie. This book was written during the time that my mother was growing up and yet I can relate to many of the timeless scenes in it, such as the magical moments when Francie learns to read. This is a wonderful book that should be taken off the shelf every few years and re-read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn, indeed: a tree by the name of Francie Nolan.Francie Nolan is an eleven year-old turn of the century heroine. Times are tough for her family. Her father, although very loving, is an alcoholic who can not hold down a steady job. Her uneducated mother who only wants a better future for her children scrubs floors for a living even while heavily pregnant. Her Aunt who only wants someone to love has a long line of \\"Johns\\" endlessly filling her void.From collecting garbage out of the gutters to sell for pennies, Francie vows to read a book everyday so that she will not be a product of her environment.

I'm an avid reader and have probably read thousands of books, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn continues to be my favorite. I think this book should be required reading for all high school and college students, and I'm always surprised it's not on more summer reading lists."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Frankly I prefer story driven books over character driven books. But not in this case. I feel like I know these people - that I could hear Johnny singing just around the corner on his way home from work. This is an honest and insightful story and I hope it doesn't get overlooked in American Lit classes. There are lines and images that have stayed with me for over 40 years and it just doesn't get better than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Readers who come to \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" looking for a fast-paced or action-packed storyline should look elsewhere: Betty Smith's perennial coming-of-age novel is more like a stroll through the forgotten alleyways and tenements of Brooklyn at the turn of the century.Influenced by Smith's work with the WPA during the Great Depression, the story ties issues of social injustice, gender, and class to a narrative of the childhood and youth of Francie Nolan, a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn. The novel is rich with vivid descriptions of tenement life, from clothing to food to the variety of ethnicities crammed together in busy Brooklyn.What's wonderful about this book is that it is accessible to all age ranges due to a cast of unique characters and has as much for the teen reader as the older reader who seeks a historical overview of the very specific period. Offering intense emotions, unforgettable characters and a broad appeal, \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an often-overlooked masterpiece of American literature of the last century."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an amazing book, by Betty Smith. The story is centered around Francie Nolan's life in Brooklyn, in the early twentieth century. The wealth of detail surrounding the characters in this book is simply amazing. It describes the people so avidly, that I feel like I knew them my whole life.It takes a great author to make you feel the emotions of characters in the book, and Betty Smith does it without a flaw. This book will leave you elated, sad, scared, and touched. Overall, a wonderful journey that takes us back to the early 1900s, and forces us to feel all of Francie's emotions."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read this book more than once and I own old hardback originals as well as the recent edition.I absolutely love to read of the extremes the human spirit can endure and survive. We know now that children like Francie Nolan would be called resilient children, because they bounce back like the fabled tree growing thrugh the harsh concrete jungles of the brooklyn 'ghetto'. Unfortunately, we have way too many children who can survive such hardship with a resilient spirit.It isn't merely the storyline that is engrossing, it is the tone and voice, the narrative nuances captured by the writer, Betty Smith, that allow you to see with your mind, but identify with Francie and her plight with your heart.Even more inspiring is the triumphant spirit of this little girl under duress. It makes one proud to be human. I work in domestic violence field and I have given this gift as an inspiration to particularly challenged children and even ten and twelve year olds can appreciate A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it becomes emotional meat for their bones and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How I wish I could have been a child like Francie Nolan! Yes, her family was poor and grief striken, but she enjoyed every day of her life! She made the good times seem magnificent and had a wonderful way of perceiving the bad times! The simpleness of her eating jello with whipped topping for the first time and the way she described that experience brought me to tears! How she craved education and new experiences! I hope from now on that when I encounter a new day that I look upon them the way Francie did! I believe that everyone experiences this book differently and that's what makes it such a jewel of literature!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book this year, my freshman year.

If I had to compare it to another book to someone else, I would say it compares to Angela's Ashes, though I enjoyed this one more.I did not like this particular book though because it has rough cut pages where the each page edge is different. I just don't care for that, and had I known that this edition was like that, I would have bought a different copy.But you can't go wrong with the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn. Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter. Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money. Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling. The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living. She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food. She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on. She is happy in the way only a child can be.As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many. She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own. Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful. I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances. I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though. I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest. When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is by Betty Smith. Francie is growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. The book takes place from 1902 all the way through 1919. Betty Smith has a very detailed way of writing. She can take a little subject, like a rose and turn it into a two page story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's been two or three years since I've read this book, but what's prompting me to write a review on it, is that I've just read Joy in the Morning by Betty Smith and I could remember all to well, how much I loved her first book, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.I remember first hearing about the book and thinking, \\"Well, this probably wont be interesting to me since it's not like the books I read,\\" but I was wrong...after reading the first twenty pages, I was hooked!!

It is an amazing body of work, by Betty Smith. It was her first novel and was written in 1943. It is the story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, learning the tough lessons in life under the most difficult of circumstances. It is about living life and learning the lessons that are thrown in your path. One of the aspects of this book is that the characters hold themselves responsible for the choices they make, good and bad, and rarely do those that love them throw their mistakes in their face. It is about facing life in the worst situations with dignity and pride and trying to improve your situation through hardwork, education, determination and an ability to continue on and not give in, no matter what may come. It is about a time when self reliability, hard work and family were highly valued, as opposed to an entitlement mentality, by those families like the Nolan's. This is a classic American tale that will be appreciated by discerning readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school, and thought it would be dull, despite its good reviews. As it turns out, it really interested me about New York during the time of World War I, and it was really hard for me to put it down. I reccomend it to any one of any age."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has a depth of themes and characterisation sufficient for composition of a thesis on the topic, cleverly hidden in the depiction of banal, every day happenings. In the relationships depicted, one gains a deep picture of every form of love, with no minimising of the joy, pain, sacrifice, or strength which each presents. Heroine Francie is an intriguing character - both a dreamer, who always is looking for the happy ending, and a creature of habit in the midst of an otherwise individualistic family. She is a curious lonely child who realises, always after the fact, that her isolation was entirely her own doing. One can practically feel Francie's conflicts, for example in that, where she knows she should think her mother is noble and her father &quot;no good,&quot; she so favours Papa (and the reader can certainly see why.) I shall admit that one prominent theme kept me wondering - and this perhaps was the author's intention. There is much excessive patriotism in this book, as if everything is best just by being American (particularly if one was born in the States rather than an immigrant.) Francie's mother, Katie, is the sort of &quot;noble&quot; poor woman who would be acceptable to those believing in the American dream - totally hard-working, and ultimately rewarded by a marriage to a wealthy politician. Yet it is all too clear that Katie, the tolerable poor lady who insists she'll kill herself and her children before she'll take a basket from the Catholic Charities, is often the very source of her children's sufferings. Her pride has a very dark side which her dedication to hard work does not lessen - she would let her children starve, or leave a pleasant home for a dismal one, entirely because she needs to be superior, not equal to, those of her own class and background. Without giving away the ending to new readers, I must add that it has its paradoxical elements. The supposedly immense good fortune of the conclusion concurrently makes it clear that these people will be isolated from people and places which they had loved and enjoyed. In fact, the single poor point in the book's development is the trite rags to riches theme. These are only a few of many examples of the sort of gritty realism, countered by warmth and humour, which make this book so fascinating. It is easy and engaging reading on one level, but enormousely insightful and complex. There is no stock &quot;good and evil&quot; or &quot;right and wrong,&quot; nor are situations resolved in any fashion neater than that of &quot;true life.&quot; It is true that there is no actual plot, but I believe that this is key. Betty Smith is giving us much truth about life and love, which never fits into a clean story line. Even the minor characters provide strong depictions of the beauty, weakness, and complexity of human nature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a slow read for me so far. I'm not finished reading it yet. But I'm curious to know what the hoopla is all about"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is a character who will long be remembered by anyone who reads &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Bright but lonely, poor but resourceful, Francie Nolan is captured from ages 11 to 16 with poignancy and love. Francie is her daddy's &quot;prima donna&quot; and she treasures his love while fighting to win her mother's. Although she never achieves the place in her mother's heart that her brother holds, her strength and sheer perserverance guide her through difficult times. Like the sturdy tree that grows outside her window and survives all catastrophes, Francie Nolan survives poverty, lack of formal education, sexual assault, extreme loneliness, and lost love.The reader first meets Francie at age 11 when, as an inquisitive young girl, her favorite time of the day is on Saturday when she can go to the library then rush home with her treasure and read the afternoon away on the fire escape of her Brooklyn tenement. As a young girl, she feels &quot;rich&quot; when she receives bits of chalk and stubby pencils her mother and father bring home from their janitoring job at a local school. She finds simple pleasures in her life, like being allowed to sleep in the front room on Saturday night and watch the busy street below. You will ache to go back in time and be Francie's best friend as she battles loneliness and rejection by her peers but learns to live a solitary life. But, like the tree, she is ready to burst into bloom and when she does it is beautiful to read about.This book is a wonderful description of life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and a strong statement on the hope offered to the immigrants who came to the United States. The story emphasizes quite clearly the value of reading and a good education, but most importantly the strength of family and the dreams that sustain people. As Francie learns, &quot;there had to be the dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it flashing glory.&quot; Young teens and mature women alike will relish Francie's story and hold its message in their hearts forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am in total awe after reading this book. In the beginning I thought it was going to be a boring and long novel. But throughout my reading I became to grow more attached to the story. The main character Francie was an intriguing and delightful creation that anyone would want as their best friend, should she not be a fictional person. I enjoyed reading how the poor family made ends meet and continued surviving when it seemed they couldn't hang on much longer. It seems that you shouldn't find it entertaining to read of suffering, but the author writes it in such a ingenious way as to that you're really reading about the magnificence of life, living, and death. As the family encounters dilemma after dilemma you find yourself encased in the wonder of how they do it. Throughout all the sadness and suffering the Nolans are still kind and considerate, loving and caring, fair and just; overall good people! Don't get me wrong, this is not a sad story, although some parts are on the sadder side. This is a marvelous writing about why people live and how. It shows a young girl growing up and changing into a woman. I was so in tune with the story I found myself laughing, crying, cheering, and feeling scared! The Nolans are resourceful and caring people, although they do have their faults. You learn about them from birth to middle aged and curiously watch them change, grow, and develop their ways. You see where each person gets their character traits from and why they do certain things. The setting is early twentieth century Brooklyn, NY. The Nolans live in a neighborhood of old flats. Electricity has not yet been invented and the value of the dollar is way higher than the present. Its interesting reading about how their insurance was twenty-five cents and that four people could eat on ten cents a day! The author provides you with outstanding descriptions of looks, feelings, and mood as to that you feel you are really there. You feel as if you have known the characters forever and are close friends with all of them. This is because you learn more about them throughout the story as if you really were their friends, and they were alive and you got to know them better as time goes on. While you read this book, you will discover how lucky we are, and what some people went through to cope with the daily mandatory needs of humans. I am completely convinced anyone who reads this book will fall in love with the gentle rhythym of the flowing sentences. When I finished I didn't want it to end, the author could've kept writing until Francie died and you would've ever get bored. Yet all books have to end. With a touch of history, I am positive anyone who reads this will be more than satisfied. This novel definitely deserves more than five stars!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In the first page of this book, Betty Smith writes very gently and calmly of Francie Nolan, a pre-teenager just beginning to step out on the edge of adulthood. And Smith ties the book up neatly at the end as if she's giving a present to the reader ... which she is. This is one of the sweetest, most eloquently written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn with her brother Neely, mom Katie and dad Johnny. It is in the early 1900s where the book is set. The family is poor ~~ living almost on the edge of starvation. Francie has taken to reading like a duck takes to water ... once she discovered the joy of reading, she becomes a big bookworm. She is also a keen observer of life around her ~~ her thoughts are often witty and funny as she observes the strange behavior of her mother's sisters and their lives, the neighbors, her brother Neely, her mother and father's relationships with one another. Till Francie grows up to be this amazing woman set on the path of her destiny.Betty Smith takes you along for a wonderful story-filled walk in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. She introduces the smells of old Brooklyn, the noise, the joys and sorrows of being in a poverty-stricken family ~~ the hopes and dreams of the immigrants that left the old country because there was nothing there for them. The hopes and dreams of the parents for their children to have better lives than they did ... falling in love with one another ... the disappointments of being disappointed by life, the wonder of finding joy in anything new or rediscovering something old. Betty Smith has captured the nuances of life and shares a bit of her soul for us readers to find.What I like most about this book is how much I can relate to Francie and her reading habits and her growing up years. She is full of insecurities and questions, loves to read and takes such joy in reading ... especially when she promised herself that she was going to read every book in the local library, starting from a to z. And Smith captures that longing perfectly, as if she has had the same dreams and desires when she was 11.I can rave about this book forever, but it isn't as much fun as reading this book.

In this book she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge into the human soul. All her words come strait from the heart to make a book that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to craw up to a better station in live against tremendous odds as well as forces working against them. A tree Grows in Brooklyn touches every ones hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father, yet this father somehow always make her feel so special and unique. She lives with her father, a severely realistic mother, and a brother who is always favored. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\"; Francie was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type. In fast she entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself that one day read all the books in the library, she started this goal by reading a book-a-day. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, doesn't help this division at all; she feels even more disconnected and different from the rest of the world at Neeley birth, fore he is the favored son and get all the attention that Francie lacked growing up. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division is society caused by money and education. Because of this division and favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the death of her father. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today this is a requirement from everyone, but at this point in time very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Nothing can stop Francie from getting her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better live for everyone. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While many novels offer an escape through some fantastical storyline set in a faraway place, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the kind of novel that makes you realize the universality of common feelings, frustrations, and hopes--and the role that sorrow and sacrifice play in the development of character. One of my favorite scenes is that of the Charity Party, when Francie is torn between her desperate longing for the doll being offered to any &quot;poor child named Mary&quot; and her resentment towards the manner in which affluent individuals approach giving. The author allows Francie to be a child--she lies in order to receive the charity doll, knowing that on the stage in front of her neighborhood peers she is both pathetic for taking charity as well as envied for owning such a rich toy. However, despite giving in to her desire, Francie is also a spirit beyond her years. She walks home both clutching her doll and cursing the insensitive givers, cyring out that for once, people should give to the poor without having to say, &quot;I am rich and you are poor.&quot; Another remarkable aspect of the book, further demonstrating it's stark realism, was the fact that Francie never places moral judgement on her father. If we contrast A Tree Grows in Brooklyn with Angela's Ashes, we see two opposing manners in which families respond to alcolohic fathers. Francie's strength, we may surmise, is most likely a product of her genuine belief that she led a happy childhood with two loving parents that had her best interests in mind. While she may later look back and realize her father's problems robbed her of some opportunity, her sense of security and love for her father would still remain intact, and judging from the role her father played in the household, Francie seemed to need a tender male role model to counter her mother's harsh pragmatism towards her children. We also see this in Francie's reaction to her ignorant writing teacher's claim that Francie's stories were &quot;ugly,&quot; as Francie recognized that these tales (which were about her relationship with her father) were important and beautiful enough to be saved.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book that provides deep insight as to how individuals can be stronger, wiser, and more grounded. Above all else, it is an essay on love, trust, and suffering as it relates to the character strength humans need to be survivors. It was after reading this book that I realized for the first time in my life that suffering, though difficult to ride through, really is one of the most positive influences an individual can experience."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend of mine once said, &quot;A classic is a book which has never finished saying what is has to.&quot; This book is definitely a classic, one that I will read every year I'm sure.&quot;Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York.&quot; If that opening line doesn't hook you in, keep reading. With each word, sentence, phrase...it just keeps getting better. Smith writes beautifully, her words magically making something out of the life of a child who could have been a nobody. This story is moving and beautiful-a must read for anyone who loves books and an inspirational story.The story follows the life of little Francie Nolan, poor child of a penniless singer-waiter-drunkard Johnny, and hardworking-penny pincher-beautiful Katie. Francie is a smart child who loves to read. Her life is by turns happy, sad, melancholy and poignant. With parents determined to see her and her brother Neeley to do better in life than they did, she moves through school and into the working life of her teens. Her life is never easy, but one of her best characteristics is her ability to find beauty is the smallest things. One of my favorite examples of this is, upon a visit to the old, shabby library, she sees in a plain brown bowl &quot;...nasturtiums! Red, yellow, gold, and ivory-white. A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sigh. It was something to be remembered all her life. (page, 21-chapter 2).&quot;I laughed, cried and cheered with this tiny child, desperate to make something of herself and find love. Smith gives the lives of these poor, desperate, sometimes even starving people a measure of pride and beauty that is unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read many classic books, but \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is by far the best work of literature I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. As a sixteen year old young woman from suburban America, many may question how I can possibly relate to the unfortunate life led by Francie Nolan. However, this is the beauty of Betty Smith's masterpiece, for EVERY young woman is capable of relating to many of the scenes found in this timeless classic. These include Francie's sexual assault, the favoritism Francie's mother has for brother Neeley, and the close relationship Fancie has with her father, whose alcoholism ultimately leads to his untimely death.Despite the hardships Francie is faced with, she perseveres, acquiring a job in order to help her family survive. Although her education must be put on hold for the time being, Francie remains hopeful that the day will come in which she, like her brother, Neeley, will be capable of going off to school.Not only is the ongoing story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn simply timeless, but the metaphor of the tree outside Francie's window that has grown through unfortunate circumstances is absolutely perfect. The tree had been cut down and was even the victim of a bonfire, but it continued to grow and blossom. Just like Francie, the tree beat the odds and rose from nothingness to beauty and strength.Never have I read anything and cried at the end simply because it was over. As you read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", you become wrapped up in Francie's life until you feel as though she and you are one in the same. The fact that I have only read this book once astonishes me, and I can guarantee you that I will read it again this summer.

Francie doesn't last very long in the school though. The teacher is mean towards the poorer children, and Francie is one of them. While taking a walk one day, she sees another school, one that looks much nicer and more fun. She gets her dad to write a letter to the principal of her school, saying that she is going to live with some relatives, and go to another school. He writes that Neeley will continue to go to this same school. She loves this new school and with lots of encouragement from her teachers, has found that she loves to write.I would definitely recommend this book. The book has lots of detail and the author does a good job putting into words kind of how it is like to be poor with a father who is drunk a lot the time. There are a lot of good adjectives and I felt like I was actually there.This is a contemporary fiction book and I give it 5 stars.Morgan Budihas"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had always meant to read this book and, at age 22, I finally got around to it. Making this purchase was an excellent decision.This is the heartwarming story of a little girl growing up in--where else?--Brooklyn with her older brother, her overworked mother, and her deadbeat, drunken father. It follows her over a significant period of her life, making it one of the earliest &quot;coming of age&quot; stories which focuses on a girl. You grow up with Francie and experience her heartbreak along with her in different aspects, from life in general to, at a little older, love.Not only did the author do a great job of telling the story of a family, she also informs the reader about what it was like to grow up at the turn of the century in New York as a poor family. It makes the reader (or at least it did for this reader) appreciate everything that they have in light of such poverty. However, it shows that, even in such dire poverty, children can still have happy and cherished memories of their childhoods.The book is a bit lengthy and does ramble on at times, but it does not fail to keep you interested and turning the pages. It is also easy reading, although it may look intimidating--I managed to get through it within a few days, and would definitely read it again. It is a great addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a novel to be read and enjoyed for many different reasons. As an initial matter, it paints a portrait of Brooklyn at the turn of the twentieth century. Many books contain descriptions, but this book contains something more. I could hear the chaos on the streets, including the noisy children, horses and vendors. I could smell and taste the coffee that Francie's mother left boiling on the stove at all hours of the day and night. It went beyond mere description--this novel involved all of my senses and made me truly feel what it was like to live in that time and place.Beyond the amazing imagery is a somewhat simple story of a family in crisis. Johnny, the father, drinks too much and can't hold a job but is the light and life of the family. Katie, the mother, loves her family ferociously, but has been imbittered by the strain that Johnny and their perpetual state of poverty places upon her. The story truly belongs to Francie and Neely, the two children, who survive by staying together, inventing stories and games for each other, and finding joy in their meager surroundings.The most noteworthy aspect of the novel, to me, was its utter anger. I have heard Steinbeck's Travels with Charley described as &quot;an angry book&quot;. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was much angrier. Francie's childlike but astute observations concerning how society ignores the needs and struggles of the working poor explode with anger. Francie's shining moment is when she shames the doctor who comments in front of her that all poor people are dirty, without thinking that she and her brother can understand him. Sissy's shining moment is when she shames Francie's teacher who ignores poor children to the point that she fails to release them to use the bathroom, causing them to have humiliating accidents. Even Francie's and Neely's victories contain an undercurrent of anger. They catch the leftover Christmas tree, warming the heart of the peddler who threw it. But because he is poor, he cannot openly be happy for them, and has to throw curses after them as they parade home with their prize.This book contains magic and heartbreak, heroics and cowardice, beauty and hideousness. It describes what it was like to be a poor child in Brooklyn in 1908. Above all, it reminds us that poverty and human behavior is universal. Shamefully, children and adults are still going through what Francie and her family went through 100 years ago."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the most tedious novel I have ever read. Not only does it spend too much time with detail, it seems to drag on FOREVER. A complete waste of time. Smith spends so much time on character development yet none of the characters are interesting or intelligent. And it never ends! If you are suicidal, do not read this book--it's too depressing. This is the first book I have actually hated. When I read it I daydreamed at least 50 times a page. I though I would never finish. This book is for sensative, emotional girls who cried during Titanic. Boys who like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction will want to burn this book after reading ten pages. Trust me. A lot of people like it because they can &quot;relate&quot; to it. But that's not what literature is about. Literature is about telling an interesting story in a manner that provokes thought, not about spending three-quarters of the book getting people &quot;attached&quot; to the characters and then at the end put them through a tragedy that makes sensative people cry and delute themselves into thinking the book was &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. Take my word for it, this book is wordy and poorly though out."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I hate this book and wish I was not forced to read it.

It was absolutley HORRIBLE.

I read it again recently, over 10 years later and I think I love it more then I did then. I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. Smith is so observant of life. Although Francie is the main character, I love how she gets into the minds of some of the other characters. For example, the scene where she retells how Johnny and Katie met, and how Katie was willing to give up everything to look at him and love him for the rest of her life. Aunt Sissy is one of my all time favorite characters. I love how multi-faceted she is. How she is so good and \\"bad\\" at the same time. However, of course, I love Francie, and her amazing observations of life: how she loves how Jewish women are proud when they are pregnant, how she wants to read every book in the library, and how excited she is to go to school. Another reader mentioned how this book is like an old friend, and I can't agree more. I open it and reread passages in dark times. I haven't written many reviews, but this book compels me to recommend it to as many people as possible."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was seriously deprived as an adolescent. I never even heard of Betty Smith's classic novel \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,\\" let alone read it. And I was an avid reader who lived relatively close to Brooklyn. Whatever the reason for this significant omission in my early literary development, I remedied the situation recently, (yes, it took me a while). I can only echo here what millions of other readers have said since the book's publication in 1943, this is an extraordinary novel which enriches and delights. I can understand why The New York Public Library chose it as one of the \\"Books of the Century.\\"Ms. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and drew from her own experiences to portray the hardships of the Nolans, a tenement family living in that borough's Williamsburg slums during the early part of the 20th century. Teenage Francie Nolan is an avid reader who wants to become a writer. She adores her father John, an alcoholic with a multitude of pipe dreams. He, in turn, loves his children and tries to be a good father, but he is not able to carry out his responsibilities. Nolan has become a dissipated man due to his alcohol addiction. Francie believes in him regardless, (and she's the only one), because they're soul-mates. Although it seems contradictory, the girl also possesses a strong practical streak. Her mother, Katie, abandoned all illusions for a better life long ago. She is rendered almost emotionless by a surfeit of her husband's grand schemes. However she stresses to her children that education is the only path out of the tenements. Grandma Rommely, Katie's mother, also reinforces the importance of education.There is a single ordinary tree visible from the Nolan's tenement window. It grows doggedly through the cement, in spite of harsh conditions which thwart it's development. Yet, it perseveres. For Francie and her father the tree symbolizes hope - the blossoming of life against all odds. It is like a beacon of of light in the darkness of their daily lives. Francie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams. Unlike her father, she has the inner strength and resourcefulness to make them come true.The author poignantly depicts the Nolan's struggles to survive and grow in a world of poverty, hunger, class prejudice and tremendous loss. Francie, a courageous girl, of strong character, comes of age here under extremely difficult circumstances. The portrait of her family members and her relationship with them is beautifully drawn, especially her relationship with her brother Neely. And turn-of-the-century Williamsburg is brought vividly to life. Broader topics are also introduced which enhance the narrative tremendously, such as, WWI, immigration, and politics of the period. Smith's characters are strong and well developed. She uses flashbacks to tell the fascinating story of John Nolan's courtship of Katie, their marriage and early years together.\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a heartfelt, moving novel which touched me deeply. Betty Smith's prose is powerful, as are her storyline and characters. This is a book I will keep to reread in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I bought this book mainly because I had always seen it on high school book lists but never read it while I was in high school, and thought I should read it. It turned out to be so much better than I'd expected! I couldn't put it down - loved it. Francie is a great character. It's both very interesting to read about her life in Brooklyn in the early 1900's and hear about her conflicts with her mother as she gets older and more independent - a timeless theme. Francie's aunt is probably the most colorful, standout character. Many (particularly in that era) would disapprove of much of her behavior, but she is in the end far more generous and loving than many \\"religious\\" people who frown on her.The book also has the potential to get kids (and adults too) to think about how they would have coped with the life and situations in the book. For example, how would they feel had they been completely responsible for younger siblings when they themselves were only five years old? Would they have been strong-willed enough to find a way to get to college while still helping her family as Francie did? Some great discussion points. It could also be a good way to connect to family stories from the older generations. (\\"Wow, Grandma did that too, huh?\\")The book is definitely most appropriate for mature middle school children, high schoolers or adults. Although the language level is not all that difficult, the book is long (although a quick read) and deals with some \\"adult situations\\" - the pain of childbirth, sex out-of-wedlock, even a brief touch on methods of ending an unwanted pregnancy, etc. But for all those reasons, it makes a fabulous read.Get the book for the rich descriptions of both the neighborhood and the characters, and just overall a great read. (And if you like stories such as this, visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City if ever you're there!)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a touching, coming of age story, about little Francie Nolan, growing up in poverty-stricken Brooklyn. I believe that what makes a novel a classic, is when it can be enjoyed and understood whether it is read one day after it is written or 50 years after it's release. Such is the case for Betty Smith's master piece. There isn't a lot of action and comotion in this novel, but there is a lot of life. It has it's moments of sadness, happiness and humor. There are issues that a young girl shouldn't have to deal with such as alcoholism, death...poverty but as in life the novel has it's ups and downs. It is impossible not to fall in love with delightful little Francie Nolan. A true relection of the highs and lows and the cracks and glitter of life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's ATGIB is an astounding masterpiece. The novel is a collection of life stories and hardships that will never be forgotten. This storie of Francie, a young girl who lives her life in Brooklyn, New York, in poverty and coming from a fairly uneducated family and overcoming hardships such as starvation and drunkeness, and suffering losses like the death of her Father. You come to love each character as if they lived in your life. Her mother Katie, is well displayed as a strong hold who keeps the family together. She is a strong character who should be admired for her courage. Her father, Johnny, however, isn't as strong, and with his drinking and then his death he fades from the story line. This book is completely relatable. Smith wrote with an uncanny knowing as if she had actually lived each and every event. WE would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It has a little bit of everything... danger, romance, family, history, struggle, suspense. To read this book is to read about life and is as close as you can get to actually living it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm entering the 9th grade this September, and am almost 14 years old. When I first saw this book on the reading list, it came along with Little Women and Tom Sawyer. I had to read 2 of them, so first I chose Tom Sawyer, and was going to read Little Women. As I was on my way out of the library (they had no books from the list there), I bumped into one of my mom's friends. She looked at the list, and saw A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and told me how much she loves the book, and that I must read it! I looked at it and first thought, 1912? How can THIS be interesting? So I started to read, and then couldn't put the book down. I began seeing how much the girl, Francie, is just like me, even though we grew up 74 years apart. I even learned some lessons in the book, and will defninitly give it to my sisters, and future children to read. I love that book so much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this story is about a terribly poor family living in Brooklyn, New York, at the turn of the 19th century. As technology advances and the American industry booms, a quiet, profound little girl called Francie Nolan lives in the slums of Brooklyn with her brother Neeley and her parents, Johnny and Katie.the novel begins with a view into Francie's world, of pennies saved and trash collected to earn them, the thin food and delightful stores; the libraries, the other tenants in Francie's apartment building.Betty Smith tells as much about Francie's parents, Johnny and Katie, as about Francie herself. We learn about how Johnny and Katie met, their whirlwind romance, soon falling out of the light as Katie bears children. Johnny, who is a kind, merry,friendly, impossibly handsome boy, starts abusing alcohol as domestic pressures fall upon his shoulders. Katie, a pretty girl, is much tougher than Johnny, and works from dawn to dusk in order to support her family, as Johnny, as lovable and sweet as he is, is not the main breadwinner of the house.We learn about Katie's sisters, Sissy and Evy, Francie's beloved aunts, pretty and tender and smart. Sissy, the man-crazy but fun and fantastically compassionate, and Evy, capable and refined, fun, and a wonderful storyteller of past events. Mary Rommely, their mother, who is saintly and understanding, clever and wise. Betty Smith tells everything about these girls, the Rommely girls, with their soft voices and the \\"invisible steel\\" in them, about their past and present situations, and they all play major roles in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.Francie is a smart, resourceful child and an avid reader. She is a talented writer, and is the favorite of her father. On the other hand, is her little brother Neeley, the favorite of their mother since his birth. They grow together, and you'll read about their exploits, and what everyone, even random people, think as they pass in and out of the Nolans' lives. What the tree-man thinks when he throws a tree at Francie and Neeley, what little boys think as they watch a horse, what Katie feels about her chidren, making plans about their unbringing and telling herself that she must not let Francie see that she loves Neeley much more than Francie, whom she only loves as a dutiful mother. (which, by the way, she fails miserably. About letting Francie know, i mean.)The books protrays Francie from the time she is born to when she is nearly seventeen and leaving for college. About her academic life, the bitterness and grief when Johnny dies, the Nolans' fears about money and food.Betty Smith is an expert on the perspectives of people. She has a wonderful idea of what people think, and why they do things. An great example of this is when she tells us about Joanna, a girl who gives birth to an illegitimate child, and the real reason why women despised her.This was a fantastic book, and i definitely recommend it to readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read tons of classic novels so I was surprised that it took me so long to discover this gem, which belongs on any list of classics.Betty Smith is a masterful storyteller with a gift for exposing human nature and illuminating the most meaningful nuances of relationships.I gave it a four-star rating only because it was a slow start for me. I pushed through based on friends' recommendations, and I was glad I did.After I got sucked in, I couldn't put it down. The story is touching, poignant, deep, moving, and profound. It made me more appreciative of the beauty of simplicity and the joy of relationships.To me the theme revolves around these two passages:\\"'Dear God,' she prayed, 'let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry...have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere--be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.'\\"\\"'People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,' thought Francie, 'something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains--a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone--just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\""},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I know it's horrible, but I JUST read this and I can't believe it took me this long. Lately I've been laying off the real reads and sticking to mags, blogs, and thrillers...with a few nonfiction pieces thrown in for good measure. I picked this up because it's the only mass market I own (someone gave it to me) and I was headed on a trip.I couldn't figure out why, but I couldn't put this book down. There's no big suspense, no mysteries to figure out, no major plot twists (or big plot, for that matter), but I couldn't stop reading it.This book reminded me what reading used to mean to me before I let myself get so caught up in reading current events and career-related stuff. This book is about hope. The characters are amazing and you grow to love them all. Then you keep the turning the pages because you can't bear to give up hope that everything will come out all right.

I really wanted to give the book five stars, and the only reason I didn't was because when I first started reading it, I had a hard time staying with it through the first few chapters. Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. I think perhaps Betty Smith was ahead of her time in her writing. The book had mistakes, but they were few and far between. I thought Smith did an excellent job of portraying her characters and I felt a warm connection to each one of them. When Smith describes how the family lived in poverty and the buying coal for the stove, I remembered my own childhood and the hard times my own family had. I recommend this book to anyone.

This is a beautiful novel, but beware, it requires more patience than others do. I can understand the complaints of some readers, in that the &quot;story goes nowhere&quot;. In a sense, this book is like a written photograph of the life of Francie, from the time she is 11 until she goes off to college. Betty Smith created her character and her environment and started crafting a tale about her life in exquisite detail. I enjoyed the &quot;mundane&quot; explanations and descriptions of what she sees or does in her everyday life. I have never been to Brooklyn, but i bet the author is extremely accurate in all her depictions, both of place and people.

I was expecting a sweet tale about a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, and yes, on the surface, that is what you could say this tale is about. But even moreso, I found this book to be a good, entertaining read, and it has an edge to it. This story is surprisingly unsentimental, and surprisingly enought, it's extremely frank in its depiction of adultery, sexuality, and alcoholism. This is not to say that it's explicit, but the lack of moral judgements make this a refreshingly non-biased look at the girls childhood, and we see things through HER eyes, and not the author's. This novel is very entertaining, and shows a city in the midst of change, with the influx of immigrants and faces that was slowly changing the face of early 20th century america. This is a fun, entertaining and moving book, and one you shouldn't miss.

I first read this novel as a child and still enjoy it each time I read it.It is one of the few novels that I make a point of reading at least once a year. Each time I read it, I come away with a feeling of hope and sadness. Hope because Smith expresses the concept that any dream is possible as long as you apply yourself, no matter how bad your circumstances are. I also have a feeling of sadness that the novel has ended. But I guess that is a sign of a truely great and timeless novel. I were to pick 5 of my favorite novels of all time, this book would definately make the list. The characters are timeless. Even though it was written in 1943, it still can be read today and have the same impact. Smith's characterization captures the feelings of a child growing into a woman. It also gives the reader a sense of hope. It expresses the feeling that a person can a accomplish anything that he or she wants. One of the best passages proclaims that Francie is a reader. I take this saying to heart. As a true reader, I find this novel to be a must in anyone's library. Anyone reading this review, should do themselves a favor and read a novel that will capture one's heart and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i fell in an anti-reading mood for a while in 8th grade, but a lot of people encouraged me to read because it really helps in writing. i went to the library 3 days ago and copied down some titles that incoming freshmen were required to read before fall. &quot;a tree in brooklyn&quot; was the first one on the list that still had plenty of copies on the shelves (i think the thickness discouraged some people). i opened it up that night and started reading; it's really interesting! some mysteries of life (some basic things like laughing in a new environment) are explained and in such a way so it isn't boring at all."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not a great reader of books, but when I read this book for high school, I got hooked.

My mother suggested it over 20 years ago and I started it and never finished it. I read this book and cried, and laughed, and cried, and just passed it on to my 15-year-old daughter to read.

But it dismays me to read complaints about grammatical errors and misspellings. I have a Master's in English Language and composition and have taught English at the college level for many years. I have read this book a dozen times and have never seen grammatical errors other than intentional ones in the characters' dialogue. And for heaven's sake, if there are misspelling in your edition, they are typos created by someone who is not Betty Smith! Write a letter to the publishing company and they will make corrections in the next edition.

Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.

The story is of an Irish Catholic family bringing up their children in the heart of Brooklyn during the beginning of the century. Francie and her brother Neeley are characters that you will take away with you, never to be forgotten.Life is hard and times are poor, but love of family and a good moral upbringing by the ever-present, yet distant mother Katie, gets them through. Life in Brooklyn struggles along with a laugh and a song from their drunken father Johnny who tries his best. With love and respect they watch their father&#65533;s decline over the years. Life is a roller coaster of emotions, trials, and tribulations, all layed out by the author in a manner that will keep you reading late into the night.This book was written back in the 40&#65533;s and is as much a classic today as it ever was. It continues to reach people into the new millennium. Though the century may change the lessons remain the same, love of family, strength of character, honesty, and hard work. The American Dream is there for the having and this book exemplifies it. Bravo a truly worthwhile read for everyone.

I took an old book from an old set off the shelf and there it sat for a few years, under various plants. That book happened to travel with me, unread, for another 15 years from apartment, to home, to home, until someone gave me a list of the Top Ten Life-Changing American books. Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family. I don't think I was ever required to read it. I never saw the movie - didn't even know there was one. To me, it is the most wonderful best-kept secret I have ever had right under my nose."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was eleven years old I first began reading this wonderful novel. It tells the story of a poor young girl named Francie Nolan who lives in Brooklyn in the earliest years of the Twentieth Century. No work of fiction before or since has to me so captured the wondering observations of a child who lives his life in emotional isolation. The shabby, mean, and colorless streets and tenements of Williamsburg are to Francie a playground of colors, mysteries, and adventures. Francie bears a passionate love for her hopeless, drunken, dreaming father. In contrast, she struggles to love her practical, hardened, and unsentimental mother. This conflict leads to a climax that forces Francie to achieve a balance between the dreams of her father and the practicality of her mother. If you enjoy fiction that allows you to see the world through a child's eyes, this one's for you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really liked this book about a young girl growing up in early nineteenth century Brooklyn. Francie is a memorable, real character and one who is intelligent and very aware of her situation and surroundings as she goes about life day to day - collecting junk to sell with her brother, observing the neighbors and each of their idiosyncrasies, reading one book a day, and most of all trying to win the love of her mother. This book paints a very lifelike feel to this time period in Brooklyn including union sentiments, prohibition talk, war rumors and overwhelming class distinction. It makes you feel like you were there looking through the eyes of Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade. It seemed to be the world's best book then. Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book. One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew more mature as Francie grew up. It makes this book a 'happening book', and draws its readers well into the book while reading. Another excellent technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl. It is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The most amazing aspect of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is its universal appealto readers of any age, any race. Opening the covers of this book is likestepping into a time machine and visiting the squalor of 1920's Brooklyn, N.Y.Here Betty Smith's descriptive magic plunges you into the ugliness of povertyand the beauty of the people who fought to overcome it...Francie Nolan, a dreamy child who finds her escape in books...Johnny Nolan, her handsome young father, who finds his escape --and ultimate tragedy -- in the bottle... and Katie Nolan, her beautiful,hardened mother, who realizes that education is the only way her childrencan escape the life she is forced to endure.Although this novel was written many decades ago, modern readers will findthe prose to be shockingly frank and as realistic as it is descriptive.The only fault with the book, which covers the span of Francie's life frombirth until college, is that it eventually has to end.No history text can make the past come alive the way &quot;A Tree Grows inBrooklyn&quot; can...no movie can leave its audience with more satisfactionfrom a story well-told. I dare anyone to read this book and not comeaway a different person...it is, in fact, a true work of art."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in BrooklynBy Betty SmithHave you ever been so poor that you had to save pennies just to have enough money to put food on the table? A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith describes the life of a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the 1920s. Johnny Nolan, her father, was a drunk and always became quiet and depressed when he drank, while Katie Nolan, her mother, worked late and didn't see her family much. Yet, you can tell because of the way Smith describes Katie that she deeply loves her family. Betty Smith talks about Francie's courage to seek a better life. This happens to be my favorite part of the book. In elementary school, on her own initiative, Francie switched schools to get away from the bullies and succeeded to make herself happier.I love how Francie Nolan has a passion to write and wrote many mythical stories of flowers and rainbows. After her father died, she started writing stories about poverty and people starving. Francie is a unique character for many reasons: I can picture her as she used to run down to get paper dickie shirt collars for her father, and she drank coffee when she was only 10. Although she went through many of life's hardships, she still turned out to be a very nice lady.I recommend \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", A New York Public Library \\"Book of the Century\\" to anyone and everyone as it was enthralling and interesting, too. It was such a good read that I just couldn't put it down.-Olivia Fleming"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I ended up reading this book for a book report at school. I chose it beacuse of a quotable quote from Reader's Digest. Because of its length, I almost gave up. However, I stuck with it and was taken into Francie's world and could imagine myself in her position. It gave me a new outlook on the beauty of everyday life. Because Francie had little experience outside of Brooklyn, she did not realize her poverty and being poor did not bother her. I was profoundly moved by every section and feel that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very life-changing book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the greatest books of all time! I completely relate to Francie, not in an exact, economical sense, but as a 15-year-old girl; I have gone through the same emotional situations as Francie. She is a modern heroine who does not rely on anyone except for her own strength and will to survive. The lavish descriptions about her family's life will touch the heart of any reader. Betty Smith must have been a genius to come up with such a compelling, heart-warming story in a time when such graphic images of poverty were condemned."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"We listened to all 18 hours of Anna Fields' reading while on an automobile trip: mom, dad, sons age 10 and 8.

Hmmm, how can I explain myself better. I live in such a sheltered world. I am middle class, have never experienced hunger, and have cable. I also live in an imaginary world.This book finally presented reality to me... and it presented the idea that it IS possible to live in the real world. And it showed that even when things bad or sad happen, if you deal with it the right way, you become a better person for it. But it was not a book with a definate moral. It didn't follow the norm in books, no flowery language or silly romance. It was just straight out &quot;this is how it is, &amp; this is one way to deal with it, &amp; it is possible to be strong even when you are weak, or especially from your weaknesses&quot;. The impressive thing is how old it is, yet it dealt with issues that are still very prevalent today - the so-called disfunctional family (I so far have not yet met a functional one); alcoholism; idolatry of those you love; sexuality; fidelity; poverty; morality; mortality. In other words LIFE. This book is a must read for those who are daily forced to meet reality's gritty face as well as those who deny it, because you will hear an empathitic voice and even find hope, because after all... Trees grow in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious.

All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived.

Francie, whom the book mainly focuses on, is the oldest. she is very imaginative and smart, and learns a lot about her self over the course of the book.

Even though it was tough for the family, Francie was kept in school until High School so that she would become educated and not have to wash floors for a living like her mother.

The book's focal character is Francie, we are introduced to her aged eleven and follow her on a, sometimes turbulent, journey into adulthood as she gains wisdom and an understanding of the world.I found this book poignant, witty extremely wise and deeply moving. Betty Smith offers some wonderful insights into the human condition and gives a vivid description of what it was like to be poor and living in the slums of Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century america.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look into the heart and soul of an era, I was deeply touched by the sheer brilliance and wisdom in this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always heard of this book but never read it or saw the movie.

At 58 and one who reads a lot I don't know how I missed this charming book about Francie Nolan (or is it about Brooklyn?). I loved every word. It was one of those books that I knew did not have an engrossing plot that chilled my nerve ends, I didn't care where it led me because I was living alongside a girl growing up in poverty who was teaching me about life. It is a story that both shamed me for my cavalier approach to material goods and gave me a renewed deep appreciation for the depth of the human spirit. If you have ever read Stegner you will love this book. The development of the characters, the easy flow of the narrative and at times, nodding your head in approval.

I stayed up until 4 in the morning reading because I didn't want to put it down. It was the first book that really ever made me cry, and I cried and cried because I think everyone can relate to a lot of different aspects of the story, I know that I could. I got through this book in 2 days, and it's not a short story. I was even inspired to read Betty Smith's other novel, &quot;A Joy in the morning&quot;, which by the way, if you like this one, I highly recommend.

The main character, Francie, is quite an intellect and would rather read a book than play with other girls any day. Throughout the story we see Francie change from a girl to a woman. Along the way we meet two of the major characters of the novel; Francie's alcoholic father and hardworking mother. I would suggest this book to any girl age thirteen years and older. Although, I do not want to discourage anyone else from reading A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, I feel that girls over the age of fourteen would be able to relate to this book better than anyone else. This novel was not very original in setting, but the content and deep analysis of each character and situation by Betty Smith is quite unique. The narration was, for the most part the third person limited perspective. Betty Smith sets a very realistic story, though a sad one at times. I think this book is quite a timeless classic. It is an absolutely wonderful story in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. It will be just as wonderful a novel fifty years from now as it was fifty years ago. It has a timeless essence that I could relate to in 1998, and some young girl will in the year 2048. I loved this book because it was a fastpaced book and kept me reading until the very end. I hope you will decide to read A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, By Betty Smith, and love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a treasure, and it seems somehow shameful, that you can even get it in paperback. It's a keeper. My parents bought it for me when I was quite young, and now at the age of 51, I have just finished reading it again. For perhaps the twentieth time. There are few books that I read more than twice. My children will get the book soon, and perhaps they will treat it kindly, and pass it on to their children also. If they do not, there is not doubt in my mind that they will buy the hard cover copy. A paperback is fine, but if you can handle the price, by all means, go that way, so you know it will hold up for the many times you will want to reread it, and share it with others.This book will provoke so many different emotions in you, and I promise, you will never be the same again. If BOYS TOWN, A STONE FOR DANNY FISHER, and KNOCK ON ANY DOOR, brought all of your emotions to surface, then prepare yourself to reach new heights with these same feelings.

I like this book because the characters go on throughout their hardships, an inspiration."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I understand why many would not. This is a historical novel and one where if you don't understand the language and descriptions used, you will not get much out of it. Also, this book requires a lot of reading in between the lines and critical thinking. This is why \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is so often required reading material and also why most adolescents don't like or understand it. This novel is about a girl living in poverty in the early 1900s. Simply put, this is about her life and the observations she makes about why people behave the way they do.There are many historical aspects to the story. There are references made to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, and frankly, if you don't know much about the history of the country during this time, you will miss even more still. If you do not have at least some background and interest in reading 'classic literature' and even history, this probably isn't the book for you.But if you do enjoy reading good literature, then this is definately the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and got a lot out of it. The characters are interesting, and it's an interesting look into human behavior which, despite the times of the novel, still hold true today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" tells the story of a young Irish-American girl growing up at the turn of the 20th century. Her father is a romantic man, with musical gifts and a tendency to drink. Her mother is a practical woman, who raises her children with tough love, and works as a janitor. The protagonist, Francie, is part of an extended family each member richly drawn, and as she matures, her world evolves from the stoop of her tenement to school to college and the workplace, all seen with her unique slant.I first read this book in fourth grade, and it is one that say, unlike \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" matures nicely. What moved me then, moves me now, and the author does that rare thing, gives each and every character his/her humanity. While the book is chock full of \\"Oprah\\" topics, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse and poverty, the characters are drawn as more than their various vices, far more. The protagonist at one point is chided for writing about \\"sordid\\" subjects by her English teacher, yet she quickly realizes that honesty as a writer is more important than fancy phrases and made up fantasies. So does the author.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found out about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" from Oprah. I didn't think a woman worth 40 billion would have time for a 60-year-old book about a poor New York tenement family at the turn-of-the-century. I was wrong. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an epic, detailed history of a destitute Irish family in 1912 big-city America. Father Johnny Nolan is a some-times singing waiter, mother Katie washes floors, and little Neely and Francie joust with cruel teachers, two-faced policemen, and self-serving neighbors. Dinner consists of stale bread and onion soup. They celebrate on Saturday night, when five bucks buys a mutton dinner. But \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is not all sad. It's filled with the love and tenderness only struggling family life can provide. Late one night, Johnny comes home tipsy, singing enchanting Irish tunes. Little Francie meets him at the door. He smiles, he winks, he gives her a tune. She turns away and faces the wall. A hot tear runs down her face. She doesn't want her father to know how much she really loves him...If you're tired of Stephen King mind-games and over-rated \\"How To\\" books, diversify into a heart-felt love-fest with this famous classic by Betty Smith. Somewhere in nineteenth century America, a little girl struggles for love and recognition. A tiny root pushes through cracks in the cement. A brave slender branch juts up, searching for the sun-light. A single vine might survive until the rain comes. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\"."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"FRANCIE IS REALI first read this book when I was ten.

Kathy Blondin-Stone"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. I'm anxious to read the rest of the books by Betty Smith. I was surprised to learn that this book is actually the author's life. I love any story written in this Era."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was really moving for me. I read it in 8th grade and still remember it. I especially loved the symbolism of the tree, that was very moving. The characters are very memorable and the language very easy to understand. Some parts get a little tedious but still a great read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I First read this book when I was about 10 years old and was deeply affected by it. Now,as an adult,I feel the same.In fact,I found the story even more wonderful. With her simple yet eloquent writing,Betty Smith takes you on an emotional journey that holds you from the first page to the last. Francie(her alter ego) is a very real,sensitive young heroine,and her family,even with all it's problems is a lovable one.(we could all use an Aunt Sissy!) Her father,though he has a severe drinking problem(and this was long before AA) is a sympathic charactor who truly loves his family,especially his daughter who adores him in spite of his illness,however she's not blind to it,which shows how intelligent she is. There is alot of humor too,which provides a balance thats just right. A beautiful story about growing up and life itself."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was barely a teen, and now 7 years later, I'm still loving this book. Brings to life the world of a family growing in the 1910s. The novel provides a critical view of class relations, without moralizing the actions of the main characters. The novel, one might say, claims only to paint a portrait of a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn before WWI. While I cannot attest to the novel's authenticity in representation of the lifestyle of people in that neighborhood during that time period, I would argue that Smith opens a window to another world, and leaves the reader emotionally attached to Francie and her story. I must admit this novel caused a tear to fall down my cheek more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"At first this book seems a little slow, but once you read into the second chapter you are mezmorized. I love this book so much, and i think it is a must read for everyone out there. This book is about a young girl who you see grow up throughout the book. She overcomes difficult times in her life with her family. This book is in a way inspirational. I have recommended this book to soo many people and they all have loved it, from male to female, and everyone else inbetween. Read this book, trust me, you wont regret it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book in 5th grade and have read it again every few years since. Now, even after having majored in English in college and become an English teacher, this remains my favorite book of any genre, any time. It is the kind of book you can enjoy as a child and enjoy even more as an adult, appreciating nuances you hadn't noticed before. The characters are so well-developed, so vividly portrayed, so multi-faceted, and so REAL that they become a part of you. This may be a work of fiction, but it is most definitely a \\"true\\" story, if you know what I mean. Don't miss this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book who's characters stay with you a long time. One of the few books I can re-read and enjoy just as much (if not more) than the first time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a great touching story of a young girl growing up in poverty stricken early 20th century Brooklyn, New York. This girls name is Francie and the story is about her life from birth to her late teenage years. During this time, the book tells us many stories such as her school, her writings, and her family. The reader also gets to know Francie inside and out, basically from the little details the writer includes that normally would not be important in a story. We learn to sympathize with Francie and relate to her. This book also describes greatly the horrors of poverty for anyone. All in all, this is a wonderful piece of fiction that anyone can learn/relate to in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was first introduced to this book by my mother at the tender age of 10. Since then, I have read it countless times, and find myself picking it up and reading sections of it from time to time. The Nolans became like family to me, and I find myself thinking about the characters--particularly Sissy and Katie--at inopportune times. These extremely well-written characters don't just get in your head, they immerse themselves in your soul, and if you read this book once you will read it 1,000 times. Betty Smith is not the best writer of the 20th century, but she writes stories like no one else and managed to create timeless characters, both in this novel and in Joy In the Morning. No one should miss reading this book at least three or four times. Trust me, if you read it it will become one of your favorites, and the characters will work their way into your heart.Sissy is my favorite character in the novel. Her lust for life, coupled with the unusual scenarios in the book, makes her unforgettable. I love Francie, of course, and who could help but love the good-for-nothing &quot;sweet singer of sweet songs&quot; himself, Johnny Nolan?This movie desperately needs to be re-made as a major Hollywood film. The 1940s version was good in its own right, but it was not entirely faithful to the novel. Think of all the charming actors who could play Johnny. Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Chris O'Donnell...the list goes on and on.Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Shortly after reading this book, I have come to realize why A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is considered a true literature classic. The story illustrates a beautiful picture of Brooklyn, New York during the turn of the twentieth century, and the types of lifestyles the working poor lived. The story is focused on the life of Francie and Neely Nolan, the children of a sweet but heartbreaking couple, Katie and Johnny Nolan. The mother, Katie Nolan, is brutally honest, never one to publicly express emotion or sugar-coat things for her family or friends. The father, Johnny Nolan, is a charming young man who serves as the backbone for the family, but has a terrible problem: alcoholism. Smith gives some of the most common problems of children, yet is able to elaborate on them to develop the characters and give the reader a real understanding of them. For young Francie and Neely, their lives are subject to poverty, and they soon learn how valuable every cent is. As poor children growing up in a rural neighborhood, they learn to cope with teasing of their social status and their given situation in life.With the sudden death of Johnny, the family learns to cope with an even tougher life, and the story begins to unfold. It begins to tell of the physical and emotional changes of Francie as she grows older, and her trials and tribulations as she goes from a successful student to a vulnerable factory worker. As life goes on for this family, we begin to sympathize for it, and come to gain respect for all that they must pull together for to get through whatever life throws their way.Not only will the story appeal to the reader, but also the writing style that Betty Smith takes on. The setting descriptions that she gives of the beautifully constructed buildings, blooming flowers, passers-bys, and the whirlwind of life that Francie is observing are amazing and cause the reader to have an early fondness for the book. Imagery also plays another part in the development of the characters and the story. You could feel the warmth of the sun beating down through the windows of the bakery Francie made multiple visits to for cheap, day old bread. You could smell the coffee that Katie had brewed the day before, and tasted the freshly cut rye bread to go along with it.Through the experiences Smith put the characters in, and the development of the tale of this unfortunate family, the reader is able to understand that many endless themes and messages are interwoven within the story. Hope, survival, and courage are all included with these themes, and are illustrated through the way that Francie and Neely live their everyday lives. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book recommended for any classic collection, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by people everywhere. This heartwarming story is sure to touch all hearts of those who read it, and will give them a new view on life, and how lucky they are to live in the world they do today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn takes you back to a great time in the past.The characters are so real and interesting. It gives you a wonderful view of Brooklyn and the people living at that period. You feel like the main character is you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"An old classic, beautiful writing. She puts you right into that world in the first paragraph. You are deeply involved with an 11year old girl growing up in a very poor existence with lots of love to help her grow."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Classic I read in my teens (1953)...and worth reading again in another 60 years..Smith wrote this as her life story..it is heartfelt..deep and rich in Humanity..and struggles..a story you think about long after your Kindle goes blank"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Beautifully written. The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of those literary classics I'd always known about, but never got around to reading till I was an adult. This book was well worth the wait. Perhaps I loved and enjoyed it even more as an adult instead of a teenager. It has all the hallmarks of the classic fiction I love--well-developed, rich, complex characters you feel like you're friends with by the end, a rich backstory for each character, wonderful historical details, a well-described historical backdrop that yet doesn't overwhelm the reader by constantly calling attention to the past era, an episodic structure instead of being plot-centric, the now-underused third-person omniscient POV, a slower pace that develops the story bit by delicious bit instead of racing from Point A to Point B within 288 pages, and a story focused more on characters than stakes, action, and some kind of formulaic three-part act.While in many respects, the world Francie grows up in has advantages over the modern world (a slower pace of life, valuing family more, kids who love reading from an early age, understanding the value of money), in many ways, I'm glad to know this is history. It was so emotionally difficult to read about things like the treatment of Francie's neighbor Joanna, a 17-year-old single mom who dared to go out in public with her baby and show her love; Francie being shamed out of the special gift of left-handedness by her own mother, and never questioning why her natural inclination was wrong; a doctor and nurse who think poor children are sub-human; teachers who mistreat students simply for being poor; and hard-working people having a hard time catching a financial break.Initially I was kind of disappointed that the pace picked up so much later in the book, going through important historical events and long stretches of time so relatively quickly, but I guess that it makes sense, since Francie was a teenager by then. Time seems to pass more slowly when we're kids, and then passes more quickly as we get older. I do wish there'd been more coverage of things like the influenza epidemic and World War I, but the purpose of the story wasn't to be a historical epic. It's a Bildungsroman about a poor girl and her family as they experience life during some historic times. The only really negative moment I had in the book was the part where Francie had an instalove of sorts with a young soldier. It just didn't seem to fit with her well-established character. I was glad when that storyline was over.It really strikes me how a book like this would have a hard time getting published these days, because it's so slow-paced and quiet, focused on character over action, doesn't really have a plot structure, Part II is the backstory of Francie's parents and grandparents, tells more than shows, and doesn't really have any stakes other than the Nolans wanting to get out of poverty. And yet those are the things that make it such a classic and wonderful book. This is the type of book that wasn't written for people with a ten-minute attention span. It was written for people who enjoy a slow, well-crafted story that takes us through the ups and downs of life with beautifully-written characters. It's not meant for people who want to be hooked in the first line or who won't read anything that doesn't have a lot of action or high stakes. I think this is going to be one of those books I remember in detail years later, as though I just read it for the first time yesterday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would love to teach a literature class on historical fiction that was actually written a long time ago. It's so interesting to see how writers from a particular period saw an era that came before them.For example, The Last of the Mohicans was written in 1826, but takes place in the 1750s. To Kill A Mockingbird was written during the Civil Rights Movement, but takes place in the Depression. And now, I just finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It's a great book that holds up incredibly well, but one of my favorite things is how the novel is a view of life in 1912 that's written from the perspective of someone in 1947. You can see both eras--the one being written about as well as the beliefs of the writer who came later.This novel is an absolute work of genius. It's completely addictive, beautifully written, funny and sad. The characters are so real that I felt as if I knew them, and while they don't always do what's right, they are heartbreakingly human and vulnerable. A truly fantastic read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have wanted to read this since high school. Now I'm 41! Almost forgot that I was reading a classic! Please do yourself a favor and read this one!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To say I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. I was looking to get out of my reading comfort zone as a 48-year-old man. It more than lives up to its billing as a classic. I draw a parallel between it and \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck. It just says so much about so many things over the course of the story (roughly set in the years 1900-1918).The commonality shared by this book and \\"The Good Earth\\" -- besides being a story that is told over a period of years -- is family and enduring times of hardship and poverty through hard work. Whereas Wang Lung (in \\"The Good Earth\\") was connected to the land (in China), young, lonely and intelligent Francie Nolan is ambivalently connected to her neighborhood in Manhattan.Both books show the cruelty of fate and other people (especially the young in this book) to the poor and downtrodden and both serve to educate the reader to different times. There is also a lot a dynamic perception of family in both.I'm used to more immediate, dialogue- and action-driven stories and wanting to change that is what drove me to this book.At times the story appears as if there is no plot or trajectory, but that is where Betty Smith's craft took over. All of the seemingly disparate events depicted over time fit together like a jigsaw, building and enhancing characterization of its literary denizens along the way. It leaves the reader filled with hope and the feeling of love -- again, something I'm not normally gushing about. Which says a lot about the quality of the book. It's filled with truth.If you are into superficial action books, stay away from it. If you want to look at a unique time and place and enlarge your literary boundaries, then by all means buy it. I don't think one needs to be a young student to get the most out of it, though it serves well in that capacity. I think one just should want to look into humanity and a different time and place (and the more things change, the more they stay the same). To be clear, I never thought I'd find a book of this kind nearly as good as \\"The Good Earth.\\" This is right up there. Truly inspiring and poignant. I highly recommend it. It will stick with you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written in the third person, this certainly is Francie's story. The reader gets drawn into the poverty culture of the immigrants of Brooklyn during the years prior to WWI. The characteristics of the tree matches the strengths of the women especially Francie, her mother, Aunts and grandmother. It is a well written story, although perhaps a bit sterotypical. A story of courage and determination. A good read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even though this book was written in 1943, I found it to be relevant today. How did I miss reading it earlier in my life?"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn was a pleasant read for a classic. By saying that I mean that some of the classics we have read in the past have just been hard reads - hard to understand and hard to get into. This books writing was smooth and I could follow the story easily. The book is centered around Francie and her family in the back drop of World War One. Told from the perspective of Francie, I quickly was engrossed in the absolute and utter level of poverty they were.Food is a big theme in this book and while they had very little, Francie's mom Katie could work wonders with it. There is always stale bread and crushed pies, and bone marrow to spread on bread as a treat after the bone has been used in soups. Meat was a rare treat. This book reminded me a bit of The Book Thief as far as the poverty and making the best of what they have.I enjoyed the theme of the book, yet found it for the most part non eventful. The book goes page by page through Francie's life, what she sees in her parents (her dad drinks too much and her mom works hard cleaning homes to make ends meet). You see Francie is school and you learn her love for books and for learning. The book carries you through Francie's life and through this I see comparable to the tree that grows outside their home... the tree seems to represent Francie - strong and yet with struggles, continuing to grow.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn was published in 1943. The book sold 300,000 copies in the first six weeks after it was published. How amazing is that! I find it astonishing that I have never read this book before. This as well as most of the other greats were never required reading in our local schools."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have been collecting old classics, and found this on Amazon.

I sure think so after finally reading it, 30-years after my fingers first laid touch to its bindings. I'm sorry that I did not discover this insightful, understated work years earlier. This is easily on par with \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"The Good Earth;\\" perhaps even superior because it infuses humor into the salt-of-the-earth characters and storylines.A tree does grow in Brooklyn; and it soars with redwood-stature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Why did I wait all these years to read this book.

Well deserved 5 starts."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was 12, 13 years old, back when I was still in junior high. Even then, I love it. The prose is clear, simple, and truthful, but there are phrases in it that give off beauty--like the passages that describe Francie's imaginings, or her simple awe at the simplest things. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is truly like life.I grew so attached to the characters that when Francie worked to gain a measure of her mother's love for Neeley, I felt my heart hurt the way hers would have. When Johnny died, I cried (and still do, even after all these years). I love that everyone in the novel, from Francie and her family to the simplest store owner, has depth, and weaknesses and strengths like anyone else.I highly recommend it to anyone, adult or child!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a great story and so eloquently written.

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful book, and I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven, and it profoundly influenced both how I see the world and my awareness of inner experience. In the past fifteen years, I have read the novel at least eight times and it has shaped the way I approach my chosen career fields of Psychology and Sociology. Each time I flip through, I draw new connections from the story about the development of America's white immigrant population, women's roles in society, and the advantages and challenges that sprout from public education. However, my gut emotional reaction to the book never changes; it will always make me laugh and cry!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"One of the best stories I have ever read. The book is amazing throughout, as Francie and the Nolans struggle through life in the Willamsburg tenaments. Francie is an amazing character, one of the most complex I have ever read about. She offers a completely different perspective on the world, one of innocence.The story itself is complete. Very well written, with great descriptions and complete thoughts."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,&quot; by Betty Smith, is a wonderful example of teenage hardships and a girl's struggle in her coming of age. Francie Nolan serves as an illustration of these hardships. In the novel, Francie is seen growing up. We are privileged to be given a window into Francies heart and the Nolan home. The novel shows Francies struggles with her family and school life, her fight to overcome the poverty that she was born into and to become a success.Francie was not born into the ideal family. The Nolans were poor, but they survived. They had love and enough money to have food, clothing and shelter. Francie's father, Johnny Nolan, was a fun-loving gentleman. Francie loved how he referred to her as his \\"prima donna,\\" and she cherished the relationship that they had. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother, was not as fun-loving as Johnny, but she loved her children and provided for them. Francie thought that she was not loved by her mother, but Katie instilled responsibility and independance in Francie, even though she did not think of this as love at the time. Katie was a very hardworking mother. Her job as a janitor kept her very busy and it gave her a very rough appearance. Neeley, Francies younger brother kept himself very busy by collecting recycling products to make a little extra money for himself and for his family.To Francie, reading and writing were the basis of life. She lived for weekend mornings when she could read, and she got so much joy out of going to the library and finding a new book. When Francie came home with a new book, she would read it on the fire-escape and indulge her active imagination. Francie applied her imagination to everyday experiences. She loved watching her neighbor get dressed up for her dates and she fantasized that the girls' dates were not coming for her, but for Francie. Francie got pleasure out of very simple and ordinary things, like her friend Frank's horse. Francie did not have an ideal school life, even though she imagined that she did. She battled solitude and loneliness throughout her school career. Her education, however did lead to better things for her.Francie's struggles in her life and her ability to endure show a strength that people long for today. Francie was able to overcome poverty, death, sexual abuse, and stress of adolescence. \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a wonderful book that I advise every woman, regardless of age, to read. It is a book that everyone can relate to in one aspect or another and Betty Smith truly gave us a masterpiece that will remain in our hearts forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know anyone who did not enjoy this book. It is definetly the greatest book I ever read. It deals with themes like hope, poverty, finding your faith, pride, family issues, patriotism, political issues, and growing up. I was hooked on the first page, it may be 425 pages long, but it felt like 90! I read the book so fast, and I couldn't put it down!!! After reading the last page, I just held onto the book. The story was so moving and it's unforgettable. I'm gonna require all my children to read it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book, plainly put, is about the beauty of living. It is about waking up in the morning and seeing the beauty of life before you. It's about living with dignity and taking pride in what you are. It's about taking things as they come and not letting anything, no matter how hurtful, defeat you. But it's also about pain, living with pain and rejection. This is a beautiful book that is not read. It is lived. I will never forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had to read this book for Battle of the Books and I was not looking foward to it, but I'm glad that I had to read it because I would have missed out on one heck of a story! This book is about a girl, Francie, and her growing up in a town called Brooklyn. It talks about her as a little baby and the troubles she went through (such as being a sickly little baby and having a younger brother that was liked more than she was) and it talks about her and her growing into a woman and the things she wants and the things that she has to do, the jobs that she has and her troubles with college ( i.e. getting in since she did not graduate from high school) and, to me the most important, how her family pulls together in hard times (like when there is hardly any food, how they pay bills and how they keep money) This book is truley a great book to read on a &quot;fire escape and looking out onto a tree&quot;. Don't waste your time, hurry up and enjoy this book because, believe me, it is totally worth your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best I've ever read.

(Read the book to understand that reference) This book covers the entire emotional spectrum for both characters and readers. I read it looking for a simple story, but when I was asked what it was about, I couldn't find simple words for it, though the hours spent reading it flew by. I wish this beautiful story hadn't ended.

I knew it featured an urban family in 1900 NYC, and my understanding stopped there. One day Audible.com had a \\"classics\\" sale and I picked this up and stashed it away on my MP3 player. Eventually I listened. In short orded I double-bought this magnificent novel for my Kindle and read along as I listen. Then I shared my Kindle edition with all my friends and family, who were equally impressed. There is no stopping this book. I delivers history like no textbook ever will, and human insight, depth and drama, that no film ever could."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"An easy and heartfelt read, so well written. So relevant across all times, to all sorts of people. Francie is an amazing character that anyone can relate to"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a pleasure to review this book on the centennary of its story-time (the book begins in 1912). Yes, this is a coming-of-age story, but it is also a portrait of urban poverty that speaks directly to the present. Tales of kids collecting the lead from liquor bottlenecks and cigarette-pack foil to redeem along with the family rags at the junk man's--an extra penny for a pinch, for girls who can stand it--sheds light on the way we live now, and on what might yet lie ahead for us, as people once again start salvaging fat from restaurants (now to run their cars, rather than to make soap, as back then).The characters are surprisingly bold. The emotions of sexual desire, exploitation, pleasure, pain, and trust are explicitly portrayed, without prurience, and it is refreshing, compared to the present, that the urges are shown to stem from the desire to procreate and also to be thwarted by their own success! There is no prettying up of either women or men, children or aged, and the 'deadbeat' father referred to in other reviews is a man of talent and longing as well as weakness.If it weren't for his complexity, and the main character's loyal brother, the male sex might seem the weaker in this book, but Betty Smith was bigger than that.

She lives in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the last century. Her mother has to work as a janitor to make up for the money her kindly but alcoholic father drinks away. Francie herself collects junk to sell to the junk man just to help buy food. Despite the obstacles Francie faces, she is fiercely determined to break her family's cycle of poverty and ignorance. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn chronicles her life as she grows from a child into a young woman, learning about family, dreams, love--and herself.Betty Smith's largely autobiographical novel doesn't sugar-coat the hardships of urban poverty in early-twentieth-century New York. The reader sees how want and ignorance can dehumanize anyone. Smith's narrative follows first Mrs. Nolan and then Francie as they make mistakes--and leaves the reader with room to learn from the characters' mistakes with them. As Francie and the Nolans slowly lift themselves out of poverty, they never forget to be grateful for what they have and most especially for each other."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I enjoyed this book, it opened my eyes on how hard the Times were back then.

Although set in the early 20th century, the lessons still ring true."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an essential read for teen girls learning about their surroundings. This historical fiction, set in early 1900s Brooklyn, leaves readers feeling like they have grown by reading the book. The plot centers around Francie, a girl who grows up with and learns to navigate a dark world.The beginning of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn establishes the poverty Francie Nolan, the protagonist, faces. Evidence of the Nolans' poverty can be found when Smith writes about how Francie enjoys \\"their one great luxury,\\" wasting coffee: \\"From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink... Mama explained: \`...I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging'\\"(14). Since Francie's mother, Katie Nolan, likens being wealthy to not worrying about scrounging, you could infer that her family is poor. A middle-class person would think it was normal to live without scrounging. The poverty, and other problems such as Francie's frequently drunken father, creates a challenge for Francie's growth.One of Betty Smith's messages is that in order to grow up, you must understand the world in which you are growing. The tree foreshadows this theme in the beginning. Smith writes about that type of tree, \\"You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first\\"(6). This detail suggests the tree understands poor habitats and that is why it thrives in these places. In the contrast, Francie is initially too innocent to understand the darkness of her life. Her navet&eacute; is demonstrated in the passage, \\"Francie made Mama watch while she put the eight cents in the tin-can bank. They had a pleasant five minutes conjecturing about how much was in the bank. Francie thought there must be nearly a hundred dollars. Mama said eight dollars would be nearer right\\"(12). Francie is too nave at this point to see that her family is poor. She will have to understand the circumstances if she is to succeed as she gets older. The tree symbolizes this requirement and, in that way, sets the stage for Francie's story.Teenage girls who are beginning to understand the realities of life and enjoy pondering these discoveries should read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is about a girl who is challenged to face the facts of her life. The plot would be attractive to another girl facing similar challenges because she could relate to Francie and would learn more about life. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn helps develop readers by vividly portraying Francie's development."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK HAS SO MUCH MORE THAT WAS NOT FEATURED IN IT. JUST A GREAT READ FOR ALL AGES!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I like the book but after reading a few chapters I realized I had seen the movie. I couldn't keep the faces of the actors out of my head. There were many stories of this nature at this time in history and my own life was reflected in many ways in this book.Susie"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"So much has already been written about this book, that there really is not much more that I can add. I am rather surprised that some people gave it a one-star rating. If/when you do listen to this audio of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I believe you will understand why I am a bit confused by the one-star ratings.Our Book Club had this as our February 2013 book to read. One of the things mentioned in our discussion was that what you felt about the book might depend a great deal upon the age at which you read/listened to it. Several of our members read the book in school. Now as older adults, with life experiences and having children of their own, the book meant more to them. I am so very pleased that I had the opportunity to listen to this book. There is a reason that it was named one of the books of the century by the New York Public Library. If you have never read it before, or even if you have, I believe this audio version is one which you will appreciate very much.I highly recommend this book and, in particular, this audio rendition by Carrington MacDuffie. She brought the book to life for me. And, for those of you with a busy life style, having the audio to listen to while you drive, walk, or just rest (and listen to it with your eyes closed), is a great way to experience the book.I will not soon forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book covers it all.

The length and depressing periods could NOT in the slightest hold this story back!! I was amazed by the way that a full grown author like Betty Smith could show so perfectly what adolescent girls feel and think, and the anecdotes in the story stay with you forever and ever, The simple events like going shopping and searching for scrap metal makes being poor seem much more interesting than middle-class life, by FAR. I think every teenager should read this book for PLEASURE because it made me think in a totally different way than I ever had before."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the best books ever read. I believe that Betty Smith wrote this story very much like her own life. She may not have lived in Brooklyn, but she did live during the same time period. I believe it paralleled her own life. What she wrote was fabulous. Her uses of words is wonderful. She's one of my favorite authors now, and that says a lot.This book is about the life of a tiny girl in Brooklyn. She grows up with her brother, mother, father, and a baby sister in the poor section of Brooklyn. She grows up very well. She refuses to do badly in anything. She has a spark for life, a zest for it. She works hard to get the things she wants, including going to a good school, elementary and college. I admire her perseverence."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not as eloquent as the other readers here who have so enthusiastically recommended this book, but let me tell you; the surprise at Francie's graduation made me cry like a baby.

Betty Smith's poignancy and bravado breathe life into the story's central character, the utterly sweet, daring and soulful Francie. Francie, the little girl to whom we can all identify...for in some way, no matter how small,parts of her live inside us all. I first read this on entering my teens on my Mother's recommendation and we have delighted in the joy of this rich classic ever since. I collect as many lovingly used editions as I can find.........although I wonder how anybody could ever part with a Betty Smith novel! I own a few old copies of Maggie Now, with which I have been tormenting myself for more than a decade......I am waiting for the right moment to indulge, for although I know I shall read it time and time again.........that first anticipation of turning page one in a Betty Smith book, holds such excitement!

I had read the book many times when I was Francie's age, but had never seen the movie. Seeing the movie led me back to the book, which I had not read in twenty years.What a wonderful experience I had in meeting the Nolans all over again. There were parts of the book that had been tucked in my memory, i.e. the part where Francie decides to read all the books in the library in alphabetical order. Every time I go to the library, I have that same idea. I just had forgotten where I first got the idea. It was like a light bulb illuminating a dusty part of my brain.Katie Nolan has become an even more important part of the story to me now. I think this was helped by Dorothy McGuire's exquisite performance as practical Katie. Being a mother of two myself, I appreciate the way Smith captured the gradations of Katie's feeling towards each child and her inability to express them to the children themselves.Goota go; my copy of MAGGIE-NOW is calling to me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"it's a touching story of a girl named francie who live in a pauperous family .

If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War.

Well, a friend of mine suggested I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and, my being a skepticist, I said &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot; is right! This is one of the best books I've read since I was five years old when I started to read. It is, as I've said, negatively veritable, and I am a great fan and avid reader of real, in-your-face publications. Usually I read macabre, gory mystery, and basically ghoulish stuff, but when I read this book, my point of view did a total 180*. Macabre may be physically gory, but wonderful, realistic books like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are emotionally and mentally &quot;gory&quot;. Emotional depression is, at least I think, the backbone of marvelous, expressive writing; I believe that this book is one of the only of its kind to provide that backbone in a way that separates it from unreal story-telling.

It also is what they call a real page turner.If I were to tell someone of a good book to read this would definately be the one I recomend to them"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a timeless classic. This is a book that warrants more than one reading, it is a keeper, with a special place of it's own. The metaphor of the tree that kept surviving is highly appropriate and mirrors the life of the novel's heroine, Francie Nolan. This tree, not unlike Francie herself, has been subject to harsh conditions, but it continued to grow and bloom. Both the tree and Francie are able to rise above the adversity and thrive.The characters are lively and real. The main character, Francie, who is articulate and bright, desperately seeks affection from her mother. Katie Nolan, is a mother that can not recripricate that love to her daughter. Instead, Katie directs her energy and affection to her son. Neeley. Francie is drawn to her father, a local drunkard, who pays her much attention. The reader expereinces the pain of growing and reconciling her relationships with her family.Francie Nolan is a survivor. The reader will follow Francie as she faces numerous challenges and diversions in life. We watch as she learns and becomes resourceful. We struggle with her during the hard and traumatic times in her life. Most importantly, we see her resiliancy and perserverance shine through.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel that should be read more than once in a lifetime. It's poignant message speaks volumes to all readers. I encourage you to read this book and share it with others."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Hello! ...I've read most of the reviews on here.

The main plot follows an Irish-Austrian-American girl as she grows up in a slum in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Subplots focus on her family members. There is a lot of nostalgic detail on life at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I imagine that this book would appeal to people who grew up at that time... but there are few such people alive. Other themes include the cruelty of people to one another, the rapaciousness of private enterprise, and female strength and resilience. This wasn't a bad book but there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest, and eventually it became a chore to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN came with such rave reviews that i just had to read it and see what i was missing. i cannot say that i find myself any more enriched by this story. it is the early 1900's in brooklyn, NY and francie and her family are forever struggling to make ends meet. it is interesting to see what things the family had to endure and i stuck with it only because i was curious to see how francie's life would unfold. but the story was extremely slow paced and not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Overall the book is a worthwhile read, especially if you are interested in beautifully presented American history. The main character, Francie, born at the beginning of the twentieth century, shares the story of her Brooklyn childhood in vivid and realistic detail. You can just tell, from reading this work, that the main character bore more than a hefty overlap with the author. The book is just too emotionally connected and detailed to be anything else. This is a book that is strongly, perhaps almost entirely, character driven -- and the sympathetic nature of the main character is what makes the book so endearing. I admit, I was sad when it ended. I would have kept on reading this fictional girl's life story -- probably to her death. I had a grandmother born less than ten years after Francie, and although I spent a lot of time with my grandmother over the 35 years I knew her, I feel I knew Francie better. To me, this speaks volumes about the author's gift.I did, however, have a few gripes. Allow me to list them.1) At times some of the characters or scenarios came across as cheesy. For instance, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) kept naming her new husbands John, regardless of their real names, it quickly got old, especially when the author reminded us of the renaming about ten times. Although this book detail may have been based on a real character, and probably was, to me it failed to translate well into the novel.2) There were some internal inconsistencies in the book, and that is a pet peeve of mine. For instance, on page 42 (first paragraph of chapter 5) the narrator tells about Sissy having given birth to ten children who all died shortly after birth. Then, on page 64-65 (a few pages into chapter 7), the narrator tells about Sissy's first child having been stillborn (as opposed to dying after birth), and the following three born dead as well. So which was it? Although you might consider me picky, a good editor wouldn't, and nor would a young mother who just lost her baby -- a stillbirth and a baby who lived an hour or two and then died are profoundly different things.3) Too much idealization of Francie's rotten parents. Yes, there was some criticism of them, but almost all of it, even from the author's perspective, was couched in a parent-protecting attitude. I personally felt enraged when Francie's mother put Francie to work and sent the younger brother to high school -- while she herself popped out another baby by her loser, alcoholic non-father of a husband, who, incidentally, had just died. I get tired of narrators or authors who side too much with awful parents.4) The author had a sort of proto-feminist attitude that too often (to tie it in with my last criticism) equated to siding with women who displayed awful or very disappointing behavior.And one final point, not exactly a criticism: I was surprised the book never mentioned that the hardy \\"tree of heaven,\\" upon which this book was based, and to which the main character was compared, actually has a horrible odor. If you crush one of its leaves in your hand you'll find this out quickly. The fact that this was never mentioned suggested to me that the author didn't know this tree as well as she might have let on. I used to love these trees for all the reasons the author did mention, until I actually smelled one. Hard to idealize them then.But all this said, overall still a powerful book -- brought to life an important time and place in such a special way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book provided an authentic look at life in turn of the century New York city, among the working poor immigrant class. The descriptions of school, home, family life and relationships among the neighborhood were wonderful, rich and colorful. I highly recommend this book to anyone 12 years and older."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I liked the story about an poor, Irish family living in New York in the early part of this century. They had and inspiring sense of survival. It is true that alcoholism was a blight to society even then."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this was well worth the read, although it was not a book that i felt i could rush. there was no real story line, so to speak, almost written in the fashion of many short stories. it was much more of a character and culture development book, with a meandering connection that loosely carries the book throughout.through some very serious topics, such as war, poverty, love and death, this book follows a young girl through her childhood in a tragic, poetic and heartfelt tale of experience. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the patience to really settle back and enjoy the subtle depths of this modern classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought the book took a little time to get going, but was certainly worth plugging along through the first 50 to 100 pages. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it, but there was one piece of the book (at the very end) that I thought was a bit contrived and not developed as well as the rest of the book. It almost seemed like the author had gotten tired of writing and was just trying to finish. It was a minor part of the end of the book and certainly didn't impact my overall impression."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful story that is one I have enjoyed reading over and over from the time I was 15 to now in my fifties.

Her other book, Maggie Now, is great also."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first picked up A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I had my doubts about it, since we had to read it for highschool, and we don't always read the best books for school. However, with every page that I read, I became more absorbed in it. It thoroughly described the hardships that Francie Nolan had to go through while living in the poorer parts of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. All the sad things that Francie had to put up with, all her fun times, and all her problems just touched me so much. It made me realize how lucky I am, how lucky we all are, to be living in such a time as this, with so much more fortune. It touched my heart as much as my grandparents' stories of the old country did, like Grandma Rommely, Francie's grandmother, had described (excepting that I did not come from Europe as they had). It was an amazing book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I had just turned 14. Before that time, I was not an overly emotional person - didn't cry at movies, etc. Let me tell you, if you wish to be involved in the characters you are reading about, to have a touching story stick with you through life or to just have a classic read that is very enjoyable, read this book. Since I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I have better learned to stay in touch with my compassionate, nurturing and sensitive side. I am 24 now and have been known to cry on subway rides because I am so involved in the novels I am reading. This book will surely do that to you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic.

The reflections of the main character, Francie, create what for me is a whole other world; kind of a real-life science fiction. This is better than sci-fi or fantasy, though, because it is a glimpse of a real time &amp; place that existed nearly a century ago. Betty Smith writes from the heart about a place that, while holding no appearant beauty to outsiders, is glorious in the author's recollections. It also reminds readers of what the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really made of. The situations are wrought with love, and the characters are very real, multi-dimensional people. I would especially recommend this book to women of all ages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When i began reading the novel A tree grows in Brooklyn i immediatly realted to the characters and felt their suffering and joys just as they did. From Johnny to Francie i began to love these characters and the story they were a part of. Betty Smith creates a world in this book in which the reader gets to feel what it was like to be poor and what it was like to not always have what you wanted and needed. This story also brought out so many emotions and was it truly became a heart-wrenching and tear-jerking moment for me whenever i sat down with this heavy hardcover in my lap. I didn't ever stop and think to be grateful for what i had but after reading this i see how it is to have to suffer and work and not have money and now i am much more apreciative for what i am so lucky to have been given.

I read it during the summmer of 99 and I must say that it was one of the best books I have ever read. It was a story about a girl who was coming of age in the world in 1912. She goes threw, and experiences many things that every one has to go threw in life. She has to learn about sorrow, why things happen and the good and bad advantages of growing up. She changes her oppinions and intrest as she grows older. All in all it is a really good book. One of my favorites and I think that any one looking for a good book should read this. It is exiting, sad, heart warming and very intresting (in a good way)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn By Betty SmithBetty Smith isn't well known for her many works, but the one book that almost everyone has heard about, is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this novel she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge; she gives us a peek into the complex human soul. All her words come straight from the heart to make a story that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to move up to a better station in life even though there are tremendous odds and forces working against them. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn touches everyone's' hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father. This father somehow always makes her feel so special and \\"normal\\". She lives with her a severely realistic mother, father, and a brother who is favorite child. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\" just because she was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type, which deepened the division between herself and the other of the children. In fast Francie entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself, that one day she would read all the books in the library. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, deepens the division even more. She feels even more disconnected from the rest of the world at Neeley's (her brother) birth, fore he is the favored son and gets all the attention that Francie lacked. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division in society caused by money as well as education. Because of this division and Neeley's favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the her father's death. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from; a place where money doesn't necessarily make you rich. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today a high school diploma is mandatory for everyone. At this point in time; however, very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Yet nothing can stop Francie from completing her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better and equal way of life for everyone. The novel tell this dream through one special girl who realizes that she can be and do better. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 8th grade teacher. It is absolutly beautiful!

I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While Betty Smith's A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN will never rival Henry Roth's CALL IT SLEEP for so-called high-brow literature, the two books have something in common: pluck. In the eminently readable A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, Smith shows it to us in the Nolans--a half Irish-, half Austrian-American family at home(s) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In CALL IT SLEEP, Roth uses stream-of-consciousness alongside narrative descriptions of squalor and depravity on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to show us--if you'll allow a clunky metaphor--an alternative definition of pluck: namely, \\"the heart, liver, windpipe and lungs of a slaughtered animal\\" (American Heritage Dictionary).Is it fair to say that one novel is better than the other, that one writer is more accomplished than the other? I think it is. Henry Roth wins hands down.If Roth's novel deals with depravity, Smith's deals with deprivation. The difference between Roth's David Schearl (the beaten young \\"hero\\" of CALL IT SLEEP) and Smith's Francie Nolan (the coming-of-age heroine of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN) is no less than that between resignation and hope. On Manhattan's Lower East Side in the first two decades of the last century, 'hope' would've been a cynical sluice to the East River and its pollutants. In the Williamsburg ghetto of the same period, 'hope' would've been the only dyke keeping that same river and its pollutants at bay. Hope, for the heroes of both stories, is just a well-appreciated resting place along the way to resignation.If there's any similarity between the two novels, it's to be found in Chapter 43 of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN. This--at least to *my* way of thinking--is where Betty Smith's prose shines with a brilliance equal to Roth's.Why, then, would I here suggest that Roth is the better writer? In deciding upon the virtues of the harp or the lyre versus the trombone or the tuba, first consider the player--as much the reviewer as the author. I find that Roth takes me deeper into his characters and into their immediate circumstances while Smith tweaks me as a reader. For my money, she's a bit too heavy-handed in jerking the obvious tear.Would I read either or both once again? Unequivocally, yes. I've already read CALL IT SLEEP twice. I may one day invest in a second reading of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.If, in a word or two, I had to characterize the two novels, I'd say that CALL IT SLEEP stretches the brain cells while A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN tugs at the heart strings. Either way, you can't lose. But what do *I* know? CALL IT SLEEP had to wait thirty years to find an appreciable (and appreciative) audience; meanwhile, A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN was an instant success. Is there a more fitting--and telling--tribute to the American myth? Ms. Smith, meet Mr. Horatio Alger."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I can't say I really loved this book but it was a decent read. I loved the symbolism and the characterization. I would say this is between 3 and 4 stars. I just can't say it gripped me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just finished reading this book a few minutes ago. I am not trying to be against the grain here at all but I don't understand how this book is so reputably powerful and a classic. It's not terrible reading because this story was by far very well written and my vocabulary has increased by atleast 13 new words. Overall though, this book felt like a auto biography, too close to reality to really wow me. As the reader, I was experiencing poverty, hunger, bulleying, chronic rejection and loss of innocence through Francie's eyes and yet, she progressed beautifully by independently finding ways to be educated and learning about the world and the people in it. I did find myself physically reacting to certain parts like when this young woman whom had a baby but was unwed was bedeviled by the neighbors and having rocks thrown at her and her child. Also, an important character in my mind passed on which changed my mood from then on. For the record, I feel the need to defend Francies Father Johnny. Yes, he did drink but I don't feel like he deserved to be treated like an acute alcoholic. He was never biligerent or hurtful to his family. Johnny wasn't the type to pour whiskey in his morning cereal and he was always singing and being chipper. But because every night when he performed he had gotten inebriated this is how he was remembered. Luckily, Francie saw past it because he was the only one that truely understood her and supported her ideas and dreams. Katie, Francie's mother lacked a sense of humor, obviously favored Francie's younger brother Neely, and could not let go of her control issues. It was her way or the highway. I don't want to give away the entire story but I must say that although I did enjoy reading this book, it did not satisfy my hunger from what I expected based on all the reviews I read about it.

As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them.

How wonderful to stumble upon this date in the opening of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;.

I absolutely loved the descriptions of her neighborhood its residents. The sense of place could not have been better.

I read a few of the reviews that criticized the sadness and the troubled personalities of the characters. Look, those people have not truly read the book. They read the outside meaning of this book. They didn't read in between the lines. To get the true experience of this book, the sorrow and the triumphs, you have to discover the beauty of reality.

I like historical fiction, and this edition is so nice for a paperback, with helpful added bio-information about the author in the back. The first thing I like about the story is how the central character is a girl who has a passion for knowledge and literature/writing.Although this was a coming of age story, I still couldn't swallow some of the things the characters went through; which made the story kind of dark, but not too much. The descriptions of life as an immigrant in early 20th century New York were not so disturbing as to make me put the book down, but it sombered me. I can only look back at this book somberly.There are some lies that were told in bittersweet ways to make life easier and some truths told in harsh ways that made things harder. Which was confusing and thought provoking at the same time. That's why I say brilliant but can't quite define the book as beautifully written. I suppose it is all a metter of opinion.Overall, it was a fairly nice read for its' genre. I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone younger then a highschooler, and I think it would make a great book club read.It is an odd but sweet ode to family."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The book's cover is in good condition and the pages are in good condition too.

I fell in love with this book at age twelve, and have read it maybe one hundred times since (and i am not all that old) I am an avid reader, and usally finish five books a week. But the first time I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, something changed. It broke my heart while filling me with pure joy. I never cry at the end of books, but the last page of my copy is stained from all the years of reading and loving. I love it so much that sometimes when I get to the end, I flip to the first page, because I never wanted to hear the end of Francie Nolan.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a book about life. Nothing more. It fills you with a love and a saddness that almost no other books can. This is my favorite book, and as a huge reader and an editor of a literary magazine that is not said lightly. The ideas posed in this book will stick with you until your death, and maybe longer. You will never forget Francie Nolan.This book deserves much more than I can say. This book is amazing feeling, and maybe not more than that. Nothing really happens in this book, and that is perhaps the beauty of this book. If you read nothing else, read this book. I know you'll love it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was required reading by a Jewish teacher in my 8th grade English class, in Brooklyn. Being a know-it-all Black girl from Brooklyn, I never wanted to read it because I thought I knew it all. Fast forward 10+ years and I finally read the book as a semi-adult. Fast forward 10+ more years and I read it AT LEAST twice a year. This is, in my opinion, the best book for any young woman to read, EVER. It made me read everything else that Betty Smith wrote. It makes me check my local library's supply to make sure they have adequate copies for other young (or older, wiser) girls to read. I have searched and found a 1st printing of the book and I hold it more dearly that my most profound treasure. I would suggest this book to anyone that can read. It will surely teach you something about love, sacrifice and the complexity of the human heart. It is full of romantic love, child-parent love, hopes, dreams, fears, innocence, everything! I recently purchased the movie and I've watched it at least 15 times already. This is a really good book. Oprah thinks so too; she lists it as one of the few books that changed her life. I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Bad News in BrooklynFrancie Nolan is the kind of person that lives life to the fullest, no matter what the circumstances are. Francie is a poor Brooklyn girl, living in the early 1900's. She has many struggles to overcome, and few opportunities. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a fiction novel by Betty Smith, is about the battles Francie and her family have to win in order to rise above poverty.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is essentially a biography about Francie Nolan, the fictional heroine in this novel. Francie is an intelligent and determined girl. She is a wonderful writer, and has planned to read every single book in her local library. Unfortunately, though, Francie's life is anything but perfect. Her dad is a singing waiter, and he is addicted to alcohol. Therefore, he doesn't bring home a lot of money, so Francie, her mom, younger brother, and dad, all have to live off of only a couple dollars a week. In order to survive, Francie will have to work hard, and get a job to support her family.In this novel, Betty Smith describes in detail all of the characters' personalities, which helps the reader better understand their actions. She also describes the time period very well, so it feels as if you're actually living back then.I really enjoyed this book because it opened my eyes to how different this country was, just less than a century ago. Few people back then were well educated, and some were even illiterate. It also made me see how difficult life is as an immigrant. Francie has to grow up living through all of these hardships.I would recommend this book mostly to girls, ages 12 to 15. Anyone who enjoys reading fiction or historical fiction , or who liked Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, is sure to love A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a book I read over and over as a child. I so identified with Francie, the dreamer and eager reader, observing her surroundings as an outsider having trouble fitting in. I loved and savored the detailed descriptions of Francie's routines and rituals of junk selling, little treats, and books devoured on the fire escape. The world of turn of the century tenements seemed like a wonderful place, and the family's ability to make something from nothing was marvelous.Returning to the book as an adult I found new pleasures in the parts I'd skimmed or barely understood as a kid--the drama of the adult relationships of Katie Nolan and her husband, and Katie's sisters Evie and Sissy. Instead of Francie's impatience with her mother, I sympathized with Katie's point of view and saw the grinding poverty without the innocence of Francie's viewpoint. I was amazed anew at the vitality and resourcefulness of the characters.Recently I listened to the audio version of the book, read by Kate Burton. I rediscovered the story yet again, finding parts I'd forgotten in the ten or so years since last re-reading it and anticipating the parts I remembered. In having it read to me I enjoyed it all over, with the addition of Ms. Burton's talent for accents and the dialogue.If you have never read this book, read it. If you read it long ago as a kid, check it out again--I guarantee you'll find fascinating new dimensions to the story. If you've read it a dozen times, you will still find it worthwhile to spend a little more time with this old friend. I know I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is similar to Angela's Ashes, is a great book. Not only is it very personal and emotional, but it also is a reflection on a society. At times it can be so horribley honest; the descriptions are very blunt. Through the experiences of Francie and many other characters, we get a picture of what life was at that time and place. Francie is surrounded by ignorance and poverty. Some of the scenes she witnesses are not very pleasent (for example, the women who gang up on the girl who has a baby and throw rocks at her). But through it all, Francie manages to have a good time. On the last page of the book, i wanted to cry, which says a lot because i NEVER cry in books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very, very great book. I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to read it. I mean it has everything: romance, fun, adventure, sad stuff, down-to-earth characters, or whatever else you might be looking for. But really, this story one you read and then forget about. It really stays with you and makes you look at life in a different way. I know that I am a different person after reading this book.Anyway, now that I told you how truly wonderful this book was, here's a summary: This book is mainly about Francie Nolan, an eleven year old girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. The book goes all the way up until like she's seventeen and the author does a good job of showing in an indirect way just how hard her life is. Sometimes her family doesn't even have enough to eat, and instead of going to high-school, Francie has to go get a job. Plus she has to deal with many problems in her family.I loved this book because of Francie's courage and strength and because the author knocked down the typical stereotypes about people living in slums. But what I really should have just said along time ago is you should just read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn instead of this corny review that lasted way too long."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how many times I've read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My parents had a copy in the house where I grew up in Queens, and it was among the books I read again and again as a young teen. Perhaps that was because it was about a young girl growing up in New York, perhaps it was because it was among the few books (in the ramshackle, eclectic collection of my parents' house, which a friend once described as \\"decorated in Late Brooklyn Depression\\") that was clearly about the joys of being a kid. But I think it was really a lot more than that.The movies they made from this book are TERRIBLE, or at least they don't reflect any of the magic I found here, so please don't let them set your expectations.What Smith did so well -- and why this book has remained a classic -- is show the shabbiness and the innocence, simultaneously. The story, which you probably know is about Francie Nolan and her family in Brooklyn's tenement neighborhoods from the early 1900s, treats the poor with respect but without romanticism. It's nostalgic for the joys that children find -- in the flowers at a library checkout counter, in the opportunity to choose the best candy from the penny store -- without painting such a rosy glow that you ever want to go back there.Another reason that this book works so incredibly well is the author's marvelous ability to show each main character's viewpoint. Francie and her mother argue; instead of showing just Francie's side, you also know exactly what is going through Katie's mother's mind, and you know that BOTH of them are right. That's an important message, especially for teenagers, and I distinctly remember deciding to adopt some of the attitudes I saw in this book. How many books did you read as a child that had that kind of influence on you?Smith never shied away from issues of sex and drink, either, so if you're considering this book as a present for a child of, say, under ten, you might want to read through it first yourself. (Not that this will be a hardship; I just re-read it last night, at the grand old age of 48, and I obviously still love this book.)On the other hand, this might be a good book for a pre-teen, as the sex and substance abuse are treated with clear eyes and a kind heart. If you want to talk to kids about the choices that people make (\\"Could Francie's father have stopped drinking?\\" you might ask the kid), this would be a great vehicle for doing so.But heck -- you don't have to get that serious about it.

The \\"tree\\" of the title is young Francie Nolan, daughter of an alcoholic singing waiter and a janitress mother in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn in the 1910's. Character, self-reliance, pride and love see Francie through a life where every penny is precious, and most breaks seem to be bad. Even though the story is told primarily through the eyes of a teenage girl, readers of all ages will enjoy the book for the truths, along with a number of touching and funny stories, it holds."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I remember to this day receiving this from one of my favorite teachers in the 6th grade (Mrs.Diaz) as a gift. Now, a Sophomore in College, A tree grows in Brooklyn is still my favorite book ever. A really warm story, its so real you can feel it. Really touches the heart."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you want to read about a hard working family who gets through tough times, read &quot;A tree grows in Brooklyn &quot;, by Betty Smith. Imagine you have a father who you love more than anyone in the world, but who drinks to much and uses all of his money for liquor. How would you feel if you had a father who was addicted to liquor? This book gives the reader an idea of how hard life would be growing up with a dad who drinks and a mother who works so hard to get money and help the family have a better life.Other characters in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; have hard lives. The main character is Francie. The book tells the story of her life growing up in Brooklyn. Francie is a smart girl who likes to read and write. She lives with her mother and father and brother. Her parents married when they were very young. Her dad,Johnny ,drinks all the time. He loves his family but isn't happy. He is not happy because he didn't have enough education. He dreams all the time but it doesn't come true. Francie's mom works very hard because she wants Francie and Neely to have a better life than she did. Francie's Aunt Sissy loves her very much and hangs out with her when Francie's mom is busy.I really thought this was an interesting book. I thought it was interesting to learn about how different their lives were compared to mine. I learned so much about what life was like in the early 1900's.They wore different clothes and played different games. When I read this book I really wanted to know what happened to the characters. I would recommend it to readers who like books about hard lives. I would recommend &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to girls over twelve years old."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only started reading this book because it was required for my English class. The first 70 or so pages were very hard to get into but once I hit 100 I couldn't put it down! There are amazing characters in this book and when it ends you wish there was a sequel. I've read it twice in 3 years and will read it again in years to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Every so often I find a story that is so authentic in the revealing of its characters, that I find myself wondering about them when I'm finished. &quot;How is Francie?&quot; I think to myself...&quot;Is Katie happy?&quot; I wonder...&quot;Does Neely sing just like his father?&quot;...as if they are real, and their lives continued somewhere in the cosmos after I finished the last page. This is one such book. Although I found the everyday drudgery of the Nolans just trying to survive a bit tiring, I would often chastise myself with the thought that &quot;This is very real for many people, even today...&quot; The crisis of poverty and hunger remains with us, and I was struck by my own frivolity as I watched the Nolans struggle to save every single penny. I wonder if I had read this book at a younger age, would my lifestyle have been any different? It is well worth the occasional struggle to complete this novel...for I believe it will impact you internally."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith takes us back to the early 1900's (1912) where Francie Nolan grows up in Brooklyn in abject poverty. Her mother, who loves Francie's brother, Neely, better, works to support the family, while their endearing yet alcoholic father staggers though Francie's early life, giving her more support through out his weak life, than her mother's strength, because he truly loves her. To me, this is an amazing story of true life in the early 1900's among emigrants and others, like Francie's family, who consider themselves true &quot;American's&quot;, because her parents were born in America, making Francie the only one in her class in school &quot;a true American&quot;. Hard to find a great deal of humor, but easy to find an amazing family story as good today as when it was published. I recommend this to everyone and plan to make sure my grandchildren read it - hopefully with me- to explain a generation they cannot imagine, but certainly did exist (and probably still does)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would probably pick A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as one of the greatest books of this century. Yeah, I know Ulysses was chosen as number 1 but those guys who picked the best books of the 20th century don't know what their missing. This book has everything, you will fall in love with Franci Nolan and her family. Its realistic about poverty but not quite as depressingly repetitive as Angela's Ashes(I liked AA but A Tree Grows in brooklyn is much better) This is one of those books where you escape into the world of the characters and become best friends with the main character. I could read this book over and over again and not get bored, its a remarkable book and I recommend it to everyone who would like to be introduced to a wonderful book that they can treasure forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book along with my class and my language teacher in the seventh grade. This is one of the best-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This isn't a book for short-story readers and it's definitely not one for fairytale readers. This book gives a vivid, firsthand account of a young girl growing up in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, and it deals with all aspects of society, no matter how shocking or taboo they may normally seem. This book describes literally ever aspect of this young girl's life, and I think that the author should be praised for examining the issues that she did and presenting them without the silver lining that isn't there in real life. This is a wonderful book for fans of history and especially for fans of good literature. Books like this one don't come along very often, and if you haven't read it then you're missing a great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \\"to read\\" list since girlhood, but I never got around to it, until this week, at age 29. Now I almost cannot believe I lived so long without reading it. Smith's novel is a written masterpiece of storytelling, characterization, and narration. Never have I so longed to be back in college with a professor and fellow English majors, to be sure I hadn't overlooked a single morsel of a book. Though Smith writes in the third person, it IS \\"Francie's book\\" and the narrator describes the world beautifully through her eyes. Over and over, a single, simple sentence expressing a fleeting, naive thought by young Francie manages to make more of a poignant and sometimes humorous social commentary than what other authors might take entire chapters to describe. As Francie grows, so does the narration-- becoming more direct, less naive, and more self-aware. Francie is one of the most lovingly drawn and memorable characters I've ever encountered-- she is a timeless picture of every curious young girl who has ever grown up in a poor family, dreaming of more, working hard in school and writing her way to a better life. A century later, I know that I was that girl, and thousands of other women over time have been \\"that girl,\\" yet Francie manages at the same time to be both every-girl and a unique little jewel all her own. Smith's book not only provides an intriguing description of life of the American urban poor at the turn of the century, but also grapples with social issues still existing in modern America. This is a book to be read over and over; even while reading it, I was aware of how much I was missing by not pausing to relish and deconstruct particular passages. However, it is also a novel so well-written and so packed with life that it deserves to be savored between readings. So, as I finished the book, I had to stop myself from turning back to page 1 and starting again-- at least for a while."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived. When Francie was 11 years old this tree was only 2 stories high, but it seemed that as Francie grew, it grew too. Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read. From her first glance at \\"If I Were King,\\" to her job at the Press Clipping office, Francie has demonstrated her creativity and love for reading and writing. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is split into 5 books. Book One, explains the childhood life of Francie and Neely Nolan. It explains how Francie loves the library. Book Two explains how Katie Rommely and Johnny Nolan (parents of Francie and Neeley) first met. Book Three is the longest and explains Francie school life. She changes schools in the middle. In this book her mother saves her from a murderer. Book Four and Book Five go on to explain Francie's life from ages 13-15 and how she gets a job. It's a very good book. Outstandingly written, and explains 1910's poverty life very well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only recently got around to reading Betty Smith's 1943 memoir-cum-novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, mainly because it had a reputation as an Oprah Winfrey sort of book, meaning I thought it must be one of those tomes filled with good intentions but short on literary merit. After all, the first mention of it I can recall was a snide comment in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 1940s. Boy, do I love to be wrong about things like this. The novel is a total masterpiece. At almost 500 hundred pages there is not a thing I'd cut- not a chapter, paragraph, sentence, nor word. It is a work of fiction the equal of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and some other great works like John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, and the best of Kurt Vonnegut and William Kennedy. In fact, it might be the best of the bunch.In fact, it's more than great literature. It personally resonates with me because its depth and narrative immersion in a bygone world rivals that of the best of memoirs, including my own True Life series. I include it, now, along with Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, Alex Haley's The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, Leonard Shlain's Art And Physics, Loren Eiseley's autobiography All The Strange Hours, and Terry Matheson's Alien Abductions, as the most personally influential and resonant books I have read. Aside from that it is a perfect example of what the publishing industry used to do right versus what it does wrong now.In many ways ATGIB is a very similar story to 1996's Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt. The later book follows a poor Irish American boy who will grow up to be a writer for his first nineteen or so years, while this book chronicles a poor Irish-German American girl who will grow up to be a writer for her first sixteen or so years. AA is set three decades later and the family goes from America to Ireland, and then Frankie goes back to America, while Francie Nolan remains in Brooklyn, until heading off for college at novel's end. Both books feature strong mothers who endure alcoholic husbands, and both books have colorful families to sketch, as well as great poverty, but ATGIB is a far superior book to AA. Primarily this has to do with editing. AA is a 450 page book that could have been 300 pages, and included far more. But, in it, McCourt tends to ramble on far too much, and recount far too similar stories, with the effect of boring you. His book revels in suffering for suffering's sake. ATGIB, was submitted as a memoir, but the editor urged Smith to make it a novel, which helped her flesh out the characters and smooth over rough spots. It worked, for ATGIB is a compelling, poetic, and multifarious work, where AA is a spotty work of unrealized potential. I submit these two books as Exhibits A and B in the case of poor editing for most current books' being so poorly written, rather than just bad writers.The book ends with Katie Nolan accepting a marriage proposal from a retired police sergeant and widower who has long been enamored with her. He offers to adopt Francie's youngest sister Annie Laurie and to send Neeley and Francie to college. Francie readies to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend the University of Michigan. As she stops past her old apartment building she sees the cut down but still growing Tree Of Heaven resprouting in the tenement yard. She sees a small girl named Florrie Wendy, for whom the tree will also come to represent something, just as it must have represented something to her older neighbor girl Flossie Gaddis before her. That all three girls have names that start with F is not coincidental. That the tree that is chosen as the titular tree is a nondescript tree is all the more apt. It is, along with Melville's white whale, one of the greatest metaphors in fiction. Yet, even as the book ends the reader wants to know more of what will happen in Francie's life, even though none doubts she will perdure.I am eager to read other of Smith's novels, to see if this was merely part of a continuum, or some great work that rose far beyond any other in her oeuvre. The scenes she so deftly set in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn are indelible, and even if her other works are not on par, this book alone is one of those near-miraculous things that justifies the 99.9% of bad arts being out there. Now, back to the crap!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Reading this book felt like falling in love. It helped me re-connect with an appreciation for small pleasures and grow to appreciate the importance of how I look at the world around me.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn changed my life more than any other book I've ever read. The first time I tried to read it, I thought the beginning was slow and didn't try it again for a few years. Oddly, the second time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Because I enjoyed this book so much, I sought out some of Betty Smith's other novels. While they were all moving and wonderful, this one is by far her best.I think everyone should try this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!Rita Southgate - Cyprus"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Of all Brooklyn literature, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", has probably the most charm and magnetism for everyone, who reached for it at least once.The story of the Nolan family from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, comes to life in the book - and the novel is really heartfelt, very much because of simple, but poetic, suggestive and emotionally engaging language. Betty Smith managed to write a timeless piece, not only because of what she wrote about, but largely due to the lack of mannerisms and phrases fashionable in the 1940's, when she wrote \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\".Francie Nolan, a gifted girl who loves books and decides to be a writer (an alter ego of the author), who is 11 years old at the beginning of the book, is a daughter of Katie, a strong, pragmatic, honest, down-to-earth woman of Austrian descent, who supports her family being a cleaning lady, and Johnny, an Irish, heavy drinking romantic, earning some money now and then as a singing waiter. Francie has a year younger brother, Neely, and although the children are often hungry and cold, and try to earn money, selling scrap metal, they have the love of their parents, their own good nature, and a happy childhood as a result.The plot follows Francie from 11 to 16, when she goes to college, but also goes back in retrospective as far as the childhood and family lives of Katie and Johnny. Francie is at the center of the story, growing from a dreamy, shy child into a bright, imaginative woman. The lives of the Nolan nuclear family and numerous relatives and neighbors are described in a series of anecdotic pieces, which could make very good short stories, like snapshots of everyday life of the poor neighborhood, where people are resourceful and full of character. These stories, however, are masterfully tied together into this brilliant novel, which made me laugh and cry, moving me to the core, and teaching important lessons of the essence of humanity and American spirit.Betty Smith wrote a wonderful novel which will inspire generations to come, and immortalized the atmosphere of Brooklyn at the beginning of twentieth century. Thinking of this book simply as of \\"coming of age\\" novel does not do it justice - it is much more than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My grandmother, who I adore/admire in words I am not able to convey, passed this book onto me years ago. It still remains in my top 10.It is intensely emotional and affirmative for a woman of any age... and, for those who want to be around them.I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To all the one star reviewers out there complaining about the tedious details in the book. Betty Smiths gift for detail is what makes the book so wonderful. I was fascinated with this book as a kid. I even tried to recreate the stale bread cutlets with ketchup sauce that Mama Nolan made!To this day, if I find a book about turn of the century NY tenements I will stop everything to read it. I've had a copy of ATGIB for 30 years now and I don't think I've ever gone a year without rereading it. Now I need to buy a new copy as my treasured copy (with illustrations!) has become lost. I hope whoever finds it enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just bought this for a young lady I know who is graduating High School. I read it at that age as well, and it is the perfect tale for a young woman on the verge of adulthood as it moves from the children to the young, and eventually middle-aged adults as it tells the multi-generational tale of the Nolan family. Heartbreaking and heartwarming without ever delving into sentimentality and highly, highly reccomended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Not many books come close to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird on my bookshelf, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has been placed right next to it.The story may seem bland: a girl grows up in a poverty-stricken section of Brooklyn in the early 1900's, as her mother and father struggle to provide a better life for their family.Yet, the story does not totally transcend the standard book: the characters are not overly eccentric and the plot is simple. After finishing the book, I could not put my finger on what it was that left such an impression, until I realized it was very demonstration of human nature which left me breathless.Smith's work offers much insight into the gorgeous complexity that is the human spirit, and the innate ability to acclimate to the life one is thrown into the moment they are born. When boiled down, the essence of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a beautifully written tale of strength in the midst of the eternal turmoil in poverty, heritage and relationships, both deep and superficial.The book, being semi-autobiographical, is easy to identify with; the themes of poverty, innocence and strength flowing strong throughout the story. But what may seem as urbane and indistinctive actually reveals the matchless feats and adventures conquered in an ordinary life.The characters of Johnny Nolan and Aunt Sissy bear a kind of comedic tragedy: a loving, alcoholic father who leaves flowers for his daughter a year after he dies, and an \\"over-sexed\\" woman who calls all her lovers \\"John\\". The characters are odd, but also very recognizable in any lifetime or family.Conclusively, Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the humbling story of ordinary people, doing ordinary things to stay alive, while astonishing readers by how parallel the fictional characters' lives are to their own."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"With joy and regret I finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the tale of the Nolan family (and the Romelly women too). Started by eleven-year-old bookworm Francie Nolan and told by her younger and older selves, this book is rich with all the truth and tragedy of life at the turn of the century. Francie, born sickly and never quite getting enough food, thirsts for knowledge and in ways that she doesn't understand, love. Katie, her mother is a hardened and hard-working scrub woman who takes care of the family when her drunk but handsome husband is between jobs, which is most of the time. Though Francie and her father are very different, he understands her in a way that her mother can't and her brother Neely won't.On each page, there is something rich about the Brooklyn in all of us, the stingy place where we nail down our best dreams in tin cup banks and pray that something amazing grows out of the often sour soil of our lives. Francis and her family remind us that are many things in the world more important than money. This one goes on my \\"Books for Life\\" list. It's a keeper to be read over and over."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've read this book twice in my life, and am thinking of picking it up again. I can still \\"see\\" the scenes from the book, and remember how I felt at each part. One of the best books I've ever read, definitely in my top 10. A book that stays with you and becomes a point of reference in how you see the world.Yes, that good."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the kind of book where there is no interwoven complex plot - just life, death, marriage, sacrifice and lessons learned. It's these simple writings that sometimes touch us the most and are the most thought-provoking. A girls life from childhood into womanhood, and all the dreams and devastations in between... Excellent."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's wonderful that Betty Smith's classic &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is still being read enthusiastically.Betty Smith's character Francie Nolan is autobiographical. The detail with which Smith recreates life in a poor section of Brooklyn is memorable and meticulous: the small details such as dinner after dinner of fried eggs with onions (eggs and onions being what the family could afford) are reminscent of &quot;Angela's Ashes.&quot; Francie is spirited, bright and unquenchable and it's this spirit that has inspired young readers for decades.Smith was able to write autobiographically while fictionalizing the events sufficiently to create a novel. This is a marvelous writing. I enjoyed reading it again to study the skill with which Smith blended the ability to recreate her past in detail, yet keep the writing spare and fresh. This is great fiction."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how I got through junior high without reading this. I listened to it on tape and loved it.

Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did. It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain. I loved every word. There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an America classic, so you probably already know the plot outline. The book is the story of Francie, a poor young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early years of the 20th century. Francie is an intelligent girl who aspires to be a writer, but she has to overcome the predictable obstacles associated with poverty and absence of connections.But the author doesn't over-romanticize the story by inventing a too-good-to-be-true character who is single-mindedly ambitious. Francie has the same concerns as any young girl in the poor section of Brooklyn would have had during those years. She is no more honest, no more selfless, no more generally virtuous, than any other girl. That typical-ness, I believe, is the key to the book's popularity.The book has been more popular with women than men, I believe, because the book evokes powerful memories of what a girl's childhood is like. And the female readers whom I have talked to all say, \\"Yes. That's just what it was like.\\" And it's probably not a bad idea for men - especially men with daughters - to have that vicarious experience by reading the book, either.Heartwarming, genuine, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 12years old. I'm now 33 and I still find myself returning to this book for its beautiful story. I love how Betty Smith drew a picture of early 1900 Brooklyn and it's temement district. The story she reveals page by page of Francie Nolan and her family is filled with triumphs and sadness and the joy of learning and growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"For the life I don't know how Betty Smith managed to write my life decades before I was born. I too, am a Brooklyn native and I truly believe Smith has a amazing style of writing. Like Francie, I'm the older daughter, and I have a younger brother close in age. If I were to describe all the similarities between Francie's life and mine, I would never finished. I recommend this novel whole-heartedly. Every Brooklynite should read this. Though the story takes place in an entirely different era, Smith evokes a wave of nostalgia to all who understand the appeal of Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a Brooklyn native, with my father being brought up in the same neighborhood (Williamsburg) described so vividly in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My father (deceased) never spoke much of his childhood, probably wanting to avoid telling me of the squalor. But as Betty Smith proves, one person's &quot;slum&quot; is another person's &quot;home&quot;.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the (hard-to-believe-it's-fiction) story of a teenage girl, Francie, being raised in rather rough conditions during the 1910s. Her life, as viewed from 30,000 feet, is not terribly exciting. Yet it is her mind, her curiousity, her compassion, and her soul which is so well projected by Betty Smith. I feel that Francie and her family are, well, people *I KNOW*. A brilliant novel.My only 'objection' to the novel is that it is targetted to young adults, which might limit its overall popularity (..the book has only been recently reprinted here in the UK). I believe the strong emotive element of this novel to be a bit too ... intense for folks under, say, eighteen. Young adults might actually find A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to be too sentimental."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I remember i first read this book when i was in Grade 8. My mom had told me about it, and i couldn't find it in any bookstore. I finally found it in our library at school and was spellbound the minute i picked it up.

I'm 22 now, and have an old copy of the book that i cherish greatly..it is my favorite book and i am a voracious reader! Francie's story rings so true, it doesn't diminish with time at all.

Francis is every child on earth, her mother is what is hidden in every women, the poor father is one of the most loveable characters in the history of fiction... read, laugh, cry, feel that you live."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the type of novel that comes along once in a lifetime. The reader is swept into the life of Frances Nolan, aka \\"Francie,\\" and is an unseen observer in the life young Francie leads. Francie and her family are poor. Poor to the point where it is a simple wonder that they have enough money to exist. There is a knowledge of this poverty in the characters, and a wish to be better, however they have no means by which to overcome it. Instead they embrace their lives and hope for better times. Francie values small things which may be overlooked in our world today, such as a pickle, jello, and even shiny pennies. She is grateful for what she has in life, though she is deeply poor and is well aware that others look down upon her.The title, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is symbolic in its meaning, and has many layers by which to discover. The characters come to life in the beautifully written prose of author Betty Smith.Time passes through the life and eyes of Francie, and as she grows, so does her perception of the world and those around her. She grows up fast, and at 14 is older and wiser in years than her Mother. Her relationships are heartfelt, as are her desires to overcome her life of poverty. Though poor, she is not ashamed and her pride is felt in waves throughout the novel. Throughout her journey, she remains true to herself and to her family.Personally, I was moved by this novel. It is an excellent read. My perception is that it started out somewhat slowly, but soon gathered speed as characters were developed and the story unfolded. I recommend this to all who want to experience a rich, beautifully written and deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith penned a true classic in her novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is a richly detailed and nuanced portrait of a time and place as seen through the eyes of young Francie. This is a classic coming-of-age story that follows Francie's growth and changes and is vividly told in her own words. It is a true pity that so many people seem to loath this wonderful book when it is assigned for school, but that is not the fault of the book. Thank goodness I came to read this one on my own so that I could appreciate the literary treasure that is A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely adore this book and recommend it to everyone every chance I get! I identified so much with Francie in her relationship with her family. I also admired her strength through all that happened. My favorite part is when they are getting the christmas tree chucked at them and they have to stay standing to win it. Francie was always thought of to be frail and weak b/c that's how she looked while her younger bro. looked strong and healthy but when the tree hit them, the bro. went to his knees and Francie jerked him back up even tho it hit her in the head. The book has great insight and narrative. It is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel can look imposing for the casual reader. However, the story is so wonderful and the writing is so enjoyable, that most people will rediscover this great book and realize why it is such a classic of American literature.The characters are \\"alive\\" for the reader. The Nolans are a family that could be any of us. Betty Smith must have felt these characters in her soul, because, they are that real! I tend to believe that Smith based these characters on her own personal experiences.Some moments of this novel will have you tearing up, some moments will have you cheering ( the christmas tree scene), and other moments will make you angry at the injustice that seemed so prevelant at the time.In this time of cultural excess and flomboyant bounty, it is a good reminder of how this country was at one time, not nearly so bountiful. When the \\"working class\\" lived in poverty. Much could be argued about the politics of the working class today, but we all have to admit that the \\"working class\\" of America is not living in the poverty and hard times of the early 1900's.This novel was a joy to read. I will recommend it to many others. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Set in the early 1900's, a tree grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is an old classic we should all revist. The reader continually finds him/herself cheering for the sterdy little girl who forms the main character of the book, Mary Frances Nolan.The book tells of the struggle of a typical family living in that time. It shows the poverty, the happiness, the utter love for the opportunity that America provides and the pride that first and second generation immigrants felt at being in America. Though Johnny Nolan, the witty, talented, drunk father of Francie, Smith shows how, even in poverty, a typical &quot;johnny&quot; enjoyed his freedom and opportunity in America. Johnny's conversation with Francie about the opportunity to drive a car if you could afford it (chapters 25-6), not based on who you were, shows the real love of the American dream of getting ahead on your own merit. Each such conversation is equally compelling and satisfying on the topic presented by Smith.Smith's portrayal of the relationships that Francie had with her mother, Katie, her aunts, Sissy and Eve, and, in particular, her brother Mealy, are so well defined and understood. Like Dickens, Smith, through these relationships and personalities, has the reader identifying smilar characters in their own life.A reader will really enjoy this classic and I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"You can see, hear, and taste Brooklyn in the early 1900's while reading this book. I connected with Francie, the heroine, on the first page and loved her by the time I reached the end. I finished the book last night and must find a new book to fill the feeling of vacancy in my heart today. While it's pretty hard to impress me these days, this book made it onto my 'absolute favorite, must read list' of books...please don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It was with relish that I opened the book for the second reading of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is one of those novels that you can read over and over and find some lovely detail that was missed before with each reading. This is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan and her family living in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. What is fascinating to me in addition to the story is the accruarate portrayal of life for the working class citizen at that time. Life was hard and could be physically and spiritually back breaking for the uneducated working class man or woman of that time. Betty Smith so beautifully captures this in her prose and observations about life. This may be so, because the author grew up in those very neighborhoods at about that time period.Francie is the daughter of John and Katie Nolan who grows up knowing that her father is an alcoholic and that her mother loves her brother Neely more. Although this is conveyed to the reader what you really see is the love Francie has for her parents despite their shortcomings. As a child she only sees the way her father sings and his poetic, dreamy view of the world. Francie admires the hard working ethic and coarse love and protectiveness of her mother. We meet her aunts and other neighborhood characters who add to the richness of the story and feel of authenticity of that time period. She views all of the secondary characters for what they are, flawed but worth loving. She is a dreamer who goes from being a little lonely girl with the ability to see lifes ugliness with a sense of wonder and joy to an accomplished woman who still maintains this ability. As the reader we are treated to life through Francie's eyes and that is truly a journey worth taking more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book now, and will be for a long time to come....it reminded me of Angela's Ashes (Frank McCourt), the story of a young woman against the world. I loved reading all the descriptions (glad I haven't lived them) and watching Francie's experiences to the end. She is a character that wasn't, and-shouldn't, be perfect but one to cheer for. READ THIS!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn starts slowly, but gradually pulls you into the mind of the wonderful Francie Nolan. And the other characters are great: Neeley, Katie, Johnny, Aunt Sissy, Evie, and the rest. What a heartwarming story! My favorite part is when Francie and Neeley talk about how their sister Laurie will be missing all the fun.This is a great book which you shouldn't miss!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a wonderful treat, with a very poignant message to anyone who reads it.

It was a very moving and poignant novel, with every detail intact, it gives you a full description of events and it does not let you imagine a setting of your own. Betty Smith, the author, gives such a detailed introduction that there is not an absolution in how you want to imagine the setting. I think a reason why many people do not like this book from the beginning, are because of its length, and use of verbal effusion. She does use a lot of unnecessary descriptions followed by mindless bits and pieces of little information at odd times. Nevertheless, this is a great novel, of which there are very few, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I do believe that the way this book composed, it cannot be a novel that is forced to be read in schools, for this reason, it is such a great novel that once you get an introduction of all the characters (a.k.a. the first hundred pages) it will want to make you read onward to see what happens to these beloved characters. One of the best things about this book is that it can be interpreted differently by each person who reads it. I love the way Betty Smith, the author, has used a tree that grows outside the Nolan house, to in a roundabout way portray the dramatic life that Francie had lived. It also shows the unconquerable vivacity that Francie Nolan possess. The usage of a tree to describe Francie's life is so intelligent and well thought up it makes you realize at the end of the story the significance of the tree that grows in Brooklyn. That tree is named Francis Nolan . DISCLAIMER: It was a long and arduous read, but in the end it is all worth it!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just finished reading this book for a class assignment. I loved it. I thought it was going to take me forever to read, but i was one of the first to finish. I can't see how anyone could hate a book like this.When I read this I felt like I was Francie. When se was happy, I was, when she was sad, I was. I felt so sad for her when I read that her mother did not love her as much as she did Neeley. Francie only had her dad to rely on for strength. Then he died. This book was so real. I can't say how much I loved it. Betty Smith is a talented writer and I hope to read more of her books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn is the best book that i have ever read.

I figure, if they're classics, they must be good. Well, I was so right. I can read this book over and over and everytime I read it I love it. I like to picture life as it was in the early century, and this book showed me that it wasn't all fun and games and that everyone struggles. I cried when the father died becasue he seemed like such a hard worker and the entire family depended on him. The book is better then the movie and nothing ever made with the name attached will be better. Even though the length is really long, you become so interested in the characters that it goes by like that. and remember: IF ITS A CLASSIC, IT MUST BE GOOD, and it is."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When reading this book for a seventh grade book report, I fell deaply in love with it!!! It was all so realistic. I was given a month and a half to read the book and write the report, but now I am finished after four days!!! I love this book and will read it many more times in my life time! I belive Betty Smith Deserves great praise for her work in this book. My heart goes out to the Nolan family. They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and at that age, I related to Francie. As I grew older, I find myself relating to more that of Aunt Sissy and fianally Katie's. Aunt Sissy's &quot;love for men&quot; was a strength and a weakness. It was a strength with her relationship to Johnnie's that out of her love and compassion she gave him alcohol when he was drying out cold turkey as could not stand to see such sadness and suffering. It was also her compassion for others that allowed her to adopt an unwanted child which invaribly saved it's life as well as the mother's. There was no judgement nor moralization on Sissy's part. When I was younger, I didn't like the mother, Katie much, but now I understand the hardship she went through to provide for her family through it's setbacks. She lost some of the joie de vive, but in the end got what she truly deserved, a good reliable man to provide security and love. She married Johnny out of young immurity, but sadly paid the price. This book also gives great background of the New York Tamammy Hall political corruption of the time as a general feel of the firt 20 years of this century from the view of an every day working class family. I read this book every 12-18 months or so and always find something new. To this day, reading about how Francie received the graduation roses from he father posthoumously, I cry. It is touching to know of an example of how love reaches through even death to reach another through Aunt Sissy's compassion."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book that deserves to be read by all. Simply beautiful!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a real treasure. I don't think anyone who reads it and is a good reader will disagree. I'm sixteen and a real book freak- I read more than 20 books in a year- and I assure you, this is the best book I ever read in my whole life. Apart from being a light reading, it is a very strong and thought-provoking, inspiring novel- the kind that makes you happy and hopeful in a somber kind of way. When I finished it, I looked up and smiled and even my room seemed to brighten up. Step into the world of this young girl from Brooklyn, and you will find yourself there!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Betty Smith does a wonderful job of not only portraying people to the reader but also portraying thoughts and feelings. The characters were very well-developed through both the dialog and the narratives. Each action and word said by the characters seemed to fit them and make the reader understand the person a bit better, but at the same time it makes the individuals seem more confusing and complex. There was not a page in this book that didn't create a mental picture of the scene in my mind. Betty Smith depicted scenes and settings just enough for me to have a picture of it, but not so much that I got bored with the tedious descriptions. The fact that this story took place in the early 1900s made it much more appealing. It was interesting to learn about the Nolans' lives not only in poverty but in that specific time period. It is amazing how Francie, the main character, can overcome all the many obstacles working against her. It shows that the parents of a child really do make all the difference in how the child turns out. Francie's mother worked hard from the beginning to make her children's lives better than her own, and she succeeded. This book made me glad I lived in America where one can change his or her social status after birth. This novel proves that no one should ever give up. It illustrates that no matter where a person comes from, if they get an education and work hard enough, there is always a chance of success. This book is probably more interesting to women, but the occasional sensitive man would enjoy it too. Both teen-agers and adults can read this book and enjoy it to its full extent. No matter who you are, this book can open your eyes to something new."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved every page of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.

From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There have been many memoirs of sad and deprived childhoods on the market lately (most notably &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt, which is very good), but this magnificent novel is far superior to any of them. It is fiction, but it reads like a memoir and is told with an innocence that tugs at your heart.We come to identify very closely with the characters and their deprivations, and rejoice when they do, and sorrow when they do. It paints a picture of poverty in a city that had a booming economy that makes you feel guilty for having a comfortable home with plenty to eat. And yet it does not intend to be a confronting novel - it is easy to read and is truly entertaining and heart warming.It is one of the best books of its type, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the most realistic, well-written book that I have ever read.

Fantastic, superior, genuine, wonderful... it really is a masterpiece! I had to read this book for 7th Grade English Class (3 Chapters a night). Even though this was a lot to read a night, I truly enjoyed it. This really is a classic book and almost every adult you talk to will say they read it as a kid. Buy it today, it is worth the money, you will want to read it again and again.

History of turn of the century Brooklyn unfolds before our eyes. But this is more than that, it is the story of a family, a very real, flawed family. This in not a sit-com family, where everyone is happy all the time and the biggest choice is what to wear to the prom. This is a gritty reality, sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I was unhappy when the story ended, loving the characters too much, but I was also glad that the author ended it when she did, not dragging out the tale too long. She left me wanting more, which is the best I can ask of any character. Actually, it seems hard to think of these as characters, they seem like real people."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Though this book was a little long in places, I loved it. I'm not even half-way through and I have to be yelled at to STOP reading. What thirteen year old can say THAT? I loved the book, felt as though I was Francie.

It may be a little too much for younger readers, although I would accept the challenge. I love this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this book with all my heart. It is right next to my bed every night along with my Bible. I can never get enough of young Francie Nolan. It shows how much we really need to survive. Most of us are living in luxury, but I would rather be Francie any day. She had the love of her father and the soul of her mother to survive on and nothing else. She didn't need the money to be happy, she was content and taken by the world around her. I think if more people in this world took time to look at their surroundings, and acknowledge their worth it would be a much happier place. Francie really knew the secret of life. She knew that &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; In the end, we are all survivers of the biggest game. Life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could not put this book down!

I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend recommended this novel since I enjoy historical fiction. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn follows the path of a turn of the 20th century family in Brooklyn. Although Ms. Smith wrote the book in the 1940s, its message is timeless. The reader watches as the central character, Francie, grows up determined to have a better life for herself. Francie is 2nd generation American who comes from a working class neighborhood of Brooklyn.Francie adores her Irish father who does not have steady work and often comes home drunk. Her father loves Francie dearly and encourages her to dream and to become a writer. He even supports her efforts to go to a better school despite the distance the school is from their home.Francie's mother, Katie, works hard and long as a housekeeper and keeps the family together. Katie recognizes the value of education and reads to her children from the Bible and Shakespere nightly. She also encourages their imagination. When the family moved into a house with a piano, Katie had the children sit with her during lessons so that they all could learn to play since the family could hardly afford lessons for one.Francie is very close to her brother, one year her junior, who is also pushed to achieve more than what the parents have been able to do.While money is always tight, the family always has a roof over their heads and usually they have food. Francie's maternal grandmother and aunts add to the moral fabric and are there to support the family when needed.There is conflict between having the children work so that the family can survive vs. allowing them to focus on education. Francie and her brother are able to do both, but the logic that Katie uses when forced to choose was not intuitive, but the right choice.What I loved about the book is that it showed how the children grew up with very little material things. Another message is to look at everything around you with the attitude as if it was the first or last time that you have seen such things. Recognize beauty of which it beholds and you will live a much for fulfilled and hopeful life. Sure, the children had conflicts with their parents, but in the end, they recognized how important their relationship was with each other and that having money didn't equate to having happiness. It is a wonderful, timeless, coming of age story that should be required reading for today's youth."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Brilliant book! I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it, as it has been on my \\"to-read list\\" for years. Definitely worth it. Anyone who enjoyed Scout Finch's character in To Kill a Mockingbird would especially appreciate Francie Nolan's character. I found some original and new reviews of this books and wanted to share them:[...]. I was drawn into the original reviews, especially after reading Betty Smith's quote: \\"I, Betty Smith, wrote a novel. I had no axe to grind. I just wanted to write, but it seems I didn't know my own strength.\\""},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"What a great book. I enjoyed the character development, and the author definitely kept me interested. Read this and become a fan also."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is a story about the average American Dream. Critics have called in a \\"coming-of-age novel\\" but when it is looked into further, this novel is really a story about pride. It is about family pride and personal pride. It is also about instilling pride in the younger generations. Too often children are spoiled and told the beautiful parts of life, but Katie Nolan knew better. As the mother of two children Francie and Neeley, she made a point to show them the hardships in life while still giving them happiness in the little things. For instance, coffee was given to the entire household as a supper drink. When Francie decided she didn't want her coffee during supper she was allowed to pour the remains into the sink. For the Nolan family, this seemed to be the exact worst thing to do. The Nolans were extremely poor and barely had enough to keep everyone in warm clothes during the winter. Johnny Nolan, the head of the household and Francie's father often drank his tips as a singing-waiter away leaving only his meager pay to bring home. However, allowing Francie to throw away her coffee gave her the feeling of being rich and proud and Katie knew well enough that if Francie wasn't proud of herself, then no one else would be proud of her.Katie wasn't the only person who wanted to instill pride in her family. Katie's mother, Mary Rommely, gave Katie the secret to raising children. She said first Katie must own land. Katie was to make a tin can bank and every day add a little bit of money to the bank until she had enough to buy a plot of land. Then she must read to her children, one page of the Bible and one page of Shakespeare and as her children grew and learned to read on their own, they would take the role of reading one page each every night. Lastly, Katie was told to instill a sense of imagination in her children by reading them stories of fairies and elves etc. At first, Katie was skeptical of her mother's advice but soon realized that Mary's advice was only to help the children remain proud of where they are from and where they are going.While the fairy tales did not last long for the Nolan family, the mystery surrounding Santa Claus and elves gave Francie the love of stories and books. She went to the library every day and checked out every book she could. Her goal was to read every book in the library. The land ownership gave pride to the entire family. Unfortunately, the land that the Nolan family would finally own was the burial plot of Johnny Nolan who died of alcoholism. Johnny's death affected young Francie the greatest because of their close relationship. Francie was \\"daddy's little girl\\". The reading of Shakespeare and the Bible was the beginning of Francie's love affair for books and her yearning for an education. Education was what would give her pride in herself. Especially after Johnny's death, it was difficult for both Francie and Neeley to stay in school past the eighth grade but because Francie pushed herself and wanted to get a good education, she made it to college ending the novel with the new young woman proud of where she was from but even more excited about where she was going.Betty Smith used the hardships of early 1900's Brooklyn to tell a story of pride and youth. It is probably one of the most influential novels in America today and will continue to influence future generations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story stays with you, it is inspiring and grounding, so beautifully written, a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many of us read about Francie Nolan and her life 100 years ago growing up poor in Brooklyn when we were young ourselves. Try it now as an adult. Although the writing is at times a little stilted and too often we are told things instead of shown them, the spirit of Francie and her practical and hardworking mother and her dreamer of a never-do-well father comes through. Some scenes are absolutely delightful: Papa taking Francie and her brother on a fishing trip or Aunt Sissy finally finding a way to get herself a baby.

Betty Smith's style of writing is very detailed and her book shows us what literature was made to be. Young Francie deals with deaths, losses, and school. A poor girl, she is captivated by anything. I highly recommend this book for preteens, as not all of the material is appropriate and understandable for young children. Francie, as a young girl deals with much.

The story follows her through her life, with all the ups and downs included, until she is at the age of twenty and off to college. A wonderful long read, I think that a girl would like it more than a boy would. Some material may be inappropriate, so I recommend an age minimum of 9 or 10.

Need proof? Here it is: scholarly, sedate, by-the-book little moi actually went so far as to STEAL this book from the library! Read it! And enjoy yourself. On the double!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some books that are hailed as \\"classics\\" are very much a product of their own time and seem confounding and dated to modern readers. Betty Smith's 1940 novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't one of those books.. It touches on timeless topics like family ties, loss, and poverty, making it accessible to a large number of readers. It also helps that the characters are endearing, and above all, honest. Everyone has their flaws, and some are even self-destructive, but none are unlikable. None of the characters are sugarcoated in the least, and feel like real people with very real problems.The story of this novel revolves around the Nolan family, and in particular Francie. The family includes a mother, Katie; a father, Johnny; and a son, Neeley, in addition to Francie. As the title indicates, they live in Brooklyn, in a typical immigrant tenement building. The Nolan family is staggeringly poor, along with all the other families that live around them. Their poverty is evident in the first few pages when Francie and Neeley go around collecting junk with all of the other neighborhood children for a few cents. Even this meager amount of money is split in half so that part of it can be placed in a bank on a closet door in the apartment in Katie's hopes that someday the money can be used to buy a little land. Katie is a janitor in the apartment buildings and is still pretty despite the toll of years of hard work. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic, but is still charming and loving to his family despite this. His small pay as a singing waiter, alas, is not enough to feed his family. The book starts out when Francie is a preteen and gets to where she is in her late teens. In that time, the family has to deal with hard times, has had some small triumphs, and Johnny's alcoholism is a fact that can no longer be denied. The children all lose their innocence pretty quickly as living in poverty is a fact of life that has to be dealt with, as they find out.I guess you could say that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is largely plotless and doesn't follow the conventions of any type of genre literature, and you would basically be right, but a lot does happen in the book. Basically, the plot of the book is life itself, with no convenient twists or last-minute saves. What happens, happens--and none of the characters can change that fact. That makes the book seem too bleak, though; while it is never explicitly \\"happy\\" (how can you ever be truly happy when you sometimes don't even have enough food?) it never loses that glowing feeling of hope. Enormous sympathy goes to the main characters, who seem like hard-working, honest, good people who seem to deserve more in life than what they've got. Even Johnny's alcoholism is easy to understand, though of course not condoned. When he begins to spin further into the abyss of self-destruction, you don't think \\"well, that's what happens\\" or \\"Good riddance\\" but rather sadness for him, and for his family, because he is so likable. This feeling of hope does occasionally dim because of various things that happen, but you never stop hoping for the best.Betty Smith's writing style is thoughtful, and meditative, and occasionally even witty. She also has a commanding use of metaphors that is impressive. Her no-frills, butstill expressive, writing carries the reader through the nearly 500 pages with ease, and while the story naturally lags occasionally, it is never \\"boring,\\" just slow sometimes. She also stops from the main story into flashbacks that recall how Katie and Johnny have previously spent their lives, and she also fully fleshes out the many fascinating supporting characters, who get their own back stories. The most interest supporting character is Katie's sister Sissy, who is regarded as some kind of cheap floozy who sleeps around who is hopelessly in love with children despite the fact that she has miscarried over ten children. Her story is heartbreaking, but ultimately bittersweet by the end. Francie is always the anchor of the novel, though. Sometimes headstrong, sometimes weak-willed, she experiences a lot of life for her young years by the end of the book.I would recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to anyone looking for a good coming-of-age story that is always interesting to read with fully developed characters."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book thirty years ago and have since read it many times over. It is a rare classic that will stay in your heart long after the pages have been read. You will become deeply and emotionally attached to Francie Nolan, a young girl who overcomes many obstacles and challenges beyond her control in order to survive. Taking place in the slums of Brooklyn, Francie is part of a family who dotes on her brother. Her parents are not without their own set of problems, and Francie is faced with growing up in a world that is not kind to her. She understands only too well the meaning of hunger, doing without, leaving school and not having enough money to go around.&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; takes place in the early part of the century and was written over fifty years ago. With this in mind, it may be difficult for today's generation, particularly if financial stability was never a problem, to fully understand and appreciate Francie's life. Unless, of course, the reader also experienced poverty - &quot;no money&quot; means no money, no matter what year you are living in. You will marvel at Francie's determination, strength and courage, smile at her resourcefulness, and feel compassion for a girl who, by necessity, is far more mature than her years.One other excellent book by the same author that I also treasure among my collection is &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; It is written with the same grace, style and emotion as this one. Both classics are highly recommended and would make a cherished part of your library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story is basically about the struggle to overcome adversity.It chronicles the childhood of Francie Nolan, a very wise girl, mature past her years, who grows up in the mean slums of turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, New York.In spite of quite a terrible childhood, filled with indignities, unfairness, and pain, Francie is determined to succeed, so that she may rise up above her surroundings. Although she must leave school before getting to high school, to work in a factory, she fights her way back to an education, eventually making it to college and out of Brooklyn.Francie's fight out of the slums is truly inspiring--like the &quot;Tree of Heaven&quot; that grows out the broken cement of the sidewalk, she fights through setbacks and never gives up. What I found to be especially wonderful was the fact that Betty Smith made no character all good or all bad. This enables the reader to feel what the character is feeling, and understand their motive in doing what they do. Thus the story is felt and experienced on many different levels and in many different ways.I really love this book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Author Betty Smith was a one hit wonder. Although she wrote other novels, her work after &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; never came close to capturing the characterizations and sense of time and place exhibited in this fine, even extraordinary, piece of writing that was released in 1943.But so what? Who needs an encore when the first performance has readers standing in the aisles? &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is as readable today as it was fifty years ago. It has stood the test of time to become one of America's most beloved and enduring novels.The story evolved from Ms. Smith's experiences growing up in Brooklyn in the very early 1900s. Although it is a novel, it's obvious that the core experiences are autobiographical. The main character in the book, Francie Nolan, is Betty Smith.The book carries us through a little more than ten years of life with the poor but proud Nolan family. The Nolans face numerous hardships - the heartbreak of losing a warm-hearted but alcoholic father, the attempted rape of Francie, the shame of being poor - but they are held together by the steely determination of Francie's mother, Katie.There are unique characters, perhaps the most unforgettable is the promiscuous and colorful Aunt Sissy who worked in a condom factory, had the habit of marrying time and time again without getting a divorce, and had ten babies stillborn, until a fake pregnancy brings her first healthy child (how? I won't give that away.)But the book's strongest point is its ability to capture a place and a time: Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century America. Not since Charles Dickens has a writer so skillfully described an era and a physical setting. Betty Smith harpooned with a pen the details and nuances that made Brooklyn the true melting pot of America, a rugged and confused place that bore more genius than anywhere else in the world. Ms. Smith is gone. Her tree is still growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was thirteen I read this book and loved it. I was Francie in my mind. We lived not far from Brooklyn and while not as poor, shared many of the same problems. The book has always been a fond memory for me. This month it was chosen as a group read for my reading group. Although I rarely re read, I decided to see if the book was as good as my memory said it was. To my delight it was still as wonderful as I remembered. Only this time I had a bit more sympathy for the mother Katie, then I did the first time. Seeing the book through the eyes of a mother, I admired more of the qualities I saw as harsh those many years ago. Betty Smith writes with such detail, that one can see the streets of Williamsburg as seen through Francie's eyes. The Nolan's are a family that literally lives the American dream. They start the book in dire poverty, yet each generation accomplishing more than the one before. And they have the most important gift of all, the love and support of family. Today this would no doubt be labeled a dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic father, a mother leaving her children unattended, an aunt who is a little too free with her favors. Yet we love the Nolans, and root for them through thick and thin. Francie Nolan loved reading and the library above all else. I am now the grown up Francie, still trying to read every book in the library. I am glad I took the time to re read this one. Francie Nolan will be a part of me forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's no wonder that this book is truly loved by practically everyone who reads it: it's a story of growing up and innocence, life and love, caring and the way things go. You might not have a lot of money, but you can do one thing that's free, and that's to love. Francie Nolan is inside of all of us, the eleven year old girl who has her life set out for her: flowers in a brown bowl, read a book every day in alphabetical order until you reach the Z's, have a lot of children. She wants to win everything on a board that she spends a bit at every Saturday; right down to the skates and the doll with real hair: she yearns for what she may never get. Her family is poor and lives in the tenements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She and her brother Neeley do not know to be ashamed of their father and Francie has scant knowledge that her father has a bad reputation. Her mother works hard and her aunt &quot;gets around&quot;, as the writer calls it. She may be poor, but she has a loving family. She wants to be an author when she grows up and pay attention to children; she is upset with the librarian at the Brooklyn library who does not even look up at the poor little girl who comes in every day to check out a book that is good for an eleven year old. Francie is pleased when a book she loves is chosen; she symbolizes an everyday, American girl. We grow up with Francie; book one chronicles the life of an eleven year old girl that is so everyday, repetitive, that it shows everything is all right. The customs and the traditions prove that Francie's life has a rhythm to it, nothing bad happens. Book two chronicles life early on, as her parents meet and have their children and Francie grows older as things happen. And book three proves that you must grow up, as Francie enters college and begins a new life that only the reader can imagine what happens next. So read this book. Just read it, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always wanted to read this book, and when I went into my ninth grade honors English class this year and saw it on the reading list, I couldn't wait to start it. I never had read it before because it had always seemed too long. How wrong I was! I couldn't put the book down, and when I finished, I yearned to know more about Francie. The story is very believable, as I am sure that Ms. Smith experienced some of the same hardships that Francie underwent. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an excellent book to read for school, and it is probably on most reading lists. The theme is very prevalent throughout the novel, and there are good examples of figurative language, and other aspects that are discussed in the classroom. I think that in order to truly understand the book, the reader must be at least eleven years old. However, I do feel that this can be enjoyed by a younger child, even if the exact meaning is not understood. Francie sets a good example for everyone in her ability to overcome obstacles and reach her goals. This is a timeless classic that I'm sure will be enjoyed for years to come!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book almost 40 years ago when I found it in my parent's bookcase. I was in grammar school at the time and my mother thought I wasn't old enough to read it so she hid it from me. It didn't take me very long to discover her hiding place and I read as much as I could each Saturday when she went to do her shopping. Even as I child, I was moved by the story of Francie's coming of age in a city and economic situation that were completely foreign to mine. Betty Smith's writing transported me into Francie's life. I loved the book then and still have the copy that belonged to my mother. Over the years, I have forgotten the details of the story, but have remembered the feelings that the book inspired in me and how I felt connected in some way to Francie. I have just recently come across my old worn copy and am currently reading it again. The feelings still ring true, but to read it now as an adult, I am finding a depth to the novel that I missed reading it as a child. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i just finished reading &quot;A tree grows in brooklyn&quot; as part of a class project. I've got to admit, that I chose the book because of it's high point value. I had the book for 1 month, and just read it casually until i really got into it. The last 300 hundread pages were magical! I didn't want to put the book down! There seemed to be a new surprise every time i turned the pages. There was just so much to learn about Francie and her family. The book at me crying towards the end, even though it wasn't sad. It was one of those books you just want to go on forever and never end. I think this book ranks alongside my favorite book of all time &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;. This book is one for people who enjoy reading about family life, and getting very much invovled with the charecters and caring what happens to them in the following chapters. I admit, there were some points in the book in which i was screaming at the mother &quot;Don't do that to Francie! &quot; i would yell in my head. I think that is what makes this book so good-you become Francie and become very much a part of her world. I read 400 pages of the book in 2 days. I never put it down-it was that good. If you are looking for a good book, this is definiatly one to pick."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a guy in his 30s who has nothing in common with a prepubescent girl living in Brooklyn in the early 1900.I should have hated this book: I usually cringe when I see stuff like 'Emma' lying around the place.But........I loved this book. I actually had to ration that book, so that I would not finish it in a day. I would read 50 pages a day and forcibly keep the rest. Its a beautiful tale of the girl coming of age and with harsh terms of life.Its nothing short of a classic.My wife has actually BOUGHT a copy to keep.5 stars!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has the rabbit running afoul of some dogs in the New York City. Trapped in an alley, Bugs grabs a book that is nearby for some meager protection; the dogs see the title, perk up joyously and run away. The name of the book: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I have to wonder if more people have watched the cartoon than read the book that provided its punch line. Up until recently, I was only in that former group, but not anymore.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is Betty Smith's semi-autobiographical novel of life in a poor family in the early 1900s. As the story opens, it is 1912 and Francie Nolan - the protagonist - is eleven years old. She lives in a small apartment with her father, mother and brother. Her father Johnny is an amiable enough fellow who nonetheless has sunk into alcoholism. Rarely employed - and becoming less employable - he is unable to be the family breadwinner. Katie, his wife, married him more out of lust than love and now is suffering the consequences: although still young and beautiful, she is suffering from the burden of holding the family together. Neely, Francie's younger-by-a-year brother, still clings to childhood.This is the story of Francie's life, and like any life story, it is not driven by plot as much as character. We see Francie's development from child to young adulthood, while coping with the many problems (and occasional joys) that accompany an impoverished life. Attending bad schools, going to church, working to support the family at meager wages, even contending with a psychopath: these are some of the events that occur in Francie's life.This is an excellent book, well worth the \\"classic\\" designation often given to it. Smith's strengths are with her strong characters and wonderful writing. Francie, of course, is the centerpiece; a girl who is gifted but may not be able to exploit those gifts in her poor environment. Yes, there are sad moments in this book, but it is not really downbeat; one can imagine an adult Francie looking back at many of these events with a bit of wistfulness.Compared to other \\"great\\" novels of yesteryear - such as Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or the Grapes of Wrath, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn seems to not get the same attention anymore. It is, however, a book that is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a middle-aged man in the 21st century, I did not expect much from a story -- even a famous one -- about a young girl set in Brooklyn 100 years ago. The only reason I considered reading it was a comment from a reviewer here on Amazon, a young lady who seemed to have excellent literary taste and who cited it as her favorite novel.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a force of nature. Author Betty Smith, like Theodore Dreiser, formed piercing views of social conditions and expressed them through literature. Her arch gaze falls on an elementary school teacher here, a Tammany Hall politician there, small neighborhood merchants everywhere, and reveals an iron judgment that convinces as it informs. The weirdest aspect is that much of what she decries still pertains today.The main theme is the novel's paean to the benefits of learning. The story line is filled with interest; this book is simply unforgettable. Francie Nolan and her immediate family will remain in the reader's head long after this volume is returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It is the first book that I read that really made an impression on me, and I was only 13 years old the first time I read it (That was over 40 years ago!). I did not even realize how strong an impression it made until years later, as I began to grow and mature as a person. I recently (1 year ago) sought out and bought a new copy for my two teenage daughters to read.I identified with Francie's plight, growing up in a 'poor', but rural, area, and becoming 'aware of life' at 13, when I first read the book.Betty Smith's portrayal of a 'survivor' of a disfunctional life and time is 'universal' and timeless. Her poignant reflections of a young girl struggling and learning 'against the odds' are heartfelt and enduring.(I believe she was a strong influence in my love of writing and story-telling)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's not every book that will grab you from the opening paragraph and draw you into the characters lives the way this one does. 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was a fascinating novel describing the life and times of a young girl growing up in the early nineteen hundreds, but the experiences are not dated - they are repeated with every generation of young women, and the writer does a wonderful job depicting the inner turmoil. I loved the way the author described things, I loved how it was a book about life that I could relate to, but the thing I loved the most was that when I finished it, I wanted more.'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was an amazing story that follows Francie Nolan throughout her early life in Brooklyn. It touches on the many trials and tribulations a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn had to face in the early nineteen hundreds. The entire novel was split into five books and each represented a different point in time. The novel didn't have a single conflict, but instead it had problems overlapping problems throughout the story to show the reality of growth and development. The main goal in the novel though, was the maturation of a single child from their own perspective. It simply cuts right to the heart of life. The so-called solutions to the problems most of the time turn into larger problems and seldom solve anything in the novel, but that goes to show how honest and true this novel really is.The main character is Francie, a shy timid girl the reader can see changing and blossoming through the course of the novel, but the cast for this play has many actors. It takes many people to influence one's life. Francie's mother Katie Rommely-Nolan, played a huge role in this story, as she should because a mother's role is important to life. Francie's father Johnny Nolan also played a huge part in her life. He was an alcoholic singing waiter who was never around very much but influenced Francie's idea of life, death, and the value of everything. I noticed throughout the book that Francie compared everything to her father which showed his unbelievable importance even without a constant physical presence. Neely Nolan was crucial to this story; he was not only Francie's brother but also her best and only friend. Francie was also very influenced by her Aunt Evy who was a stern woman in many ways but you could tell that she enjoyed life, her Aunt Sissy who in the beginning of the story is a wild, crazy type and then settles as the story continues. Both of these women have husbands and children, but they don't play as much of an important role in Francie's life as the aunts themselves. There's also Francie's grandmother Mary Rommely, who indirectly plays a very important role in Francie's life because she taught Katie the grounds for raising her children. Other vital characters include Francie's bosses, teachers, schoolmates, significant others and random people she met on everyday travels throughout the city.This novel taught me that things are not always what they seem and that hardly anything goes exactly according to plan, and that you shouldn't take anything for granted. It mainly taught me however, to live life to it's fullest everyday so that I may get everything that I can out of it.If you have lived and you can read, you'll enjoy this novel. If you can't read, get it as a book-on-tape collection and you will love it too. Everyone could take this novel to heart because it's a novel about each one of us in the world, one that no matter whether you're a bum that lives in a cardboard box in the alleyway, or the king of England you can empathize with the author's growing pains, and that's the most important part. How can anyone deny reading a story about themselves? Some people are partial to science fiction, some people love editorials, all people would love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a poor girl named Francie Nolan growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Francie lives with her brother Neeley, (who is a year younger), her mama, her papa, and at the end her baby sister. The story tells about the hard lives of the Nolans. After Francie had graduated from grade school, she had to start working while her brother Neeley continued on with his education and went to high school. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes to read books about growing up. I liked this book because it was very descriptive. It didn't focus on just one character, it told a lot about all of the characters. I also liked that it showed a very nice relationship between family members."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it seems a challenge to read since it has 500 pages, there wasn't a single page where I was bored. Betty Smith focuses on Francie's struggles and thoughts about life, her family, and the world surrounding her. Tragedy and tough choices plauge Francie all throughout the course of the story. Her lovable but unreliable father, loving, realistic mother, and favored, companionable brother add conversation and relationship to the book. This book is a moving tale of one little girl who tries to understand the world around her and teaches the reader about love, sacrifice, and hope in the process."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan, an Irish-American girl growing up in the early 1900s. This book gives the reader a look into the daily lives and struggles of Francie's traditional, if not sterotypical, early Irish-American family. Poverty, alcoholism, and struggling to survive in a harsh urban environment are major themes in this book. Betty Smith's well-structured and detailed narrative helps the reader to experience the day-to-day hardships, emotions, and triumphs of the Nolan family, and is peppered with interesting details about life in early 20th century Brooklyn. Although the Nolans are poor and struggling, their intelligence and humanity never fails to shine through."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is one of America's timeless classics. The story of young Francie Nolan will touch your heart and forever change your view of life. A young girl growing up in the Brooklyn of the early 20th century, Francie had to face the many hardships of poverty as well as just growing up. Some of Francie's experiences are funny, and others almost brought me to tears. This book isn't famous for the phenomanal writing style of Betty Smith, because the book is written plainly and simply. Smith doesn't mince words getting to her points, but shows the life of Francie plainly and bluntly. From selling junk to earn a few extra cents, to an interesting fishing trip, Francie's life is just so different. This probably ranks number 2 on my list of all-time favorite books, right behind The View From Saturday. You haven't lived life completely until you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I would reccomend it to all girls over twelve or thirteen, because some of Francie's experiences are a bit inappropriate for some younger readers. A must-read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I never read this book as a child (I missed out). I'll tell you right now that it is NEVER too late to read this book. It's a 'slice of life'. It's real-life with real lives that render characters that shine. It reminds us of the struggles we all go through in life. It's a beautiful story that revolves around the life of Francie and her family. It's no wonder that so many have told me how wonderful this book is to read. I underlined scores of lines that made me want to go back to re-read them...to be reminded of how to live my life or how to advise other people.

The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book.

I usually choose books with topics and intersets that I like. I, and like a lot of people, do not like to be told what I have to read. This was I book I had to read for summer reading. Out of all the books on the list and that I have ever read, this was the worst piece of crap that I have ever read. The main thing that made me hate this book was that the depressing and sad life lead by Francie Nolan, is that it is very much like mine. She is me living in the 1800's. The story is about Francie and her family's struggle through poverty, death, periods of no food and money, and most imoportantly, alcoholism. When you think that things can't get any worse, they do. Out of all the characters in the book I hate Johnny Nolan. He is just like my dad, but when my dad is drunk he is a jerk. I don't know how she can love someone who is holding her back from the world. She and the rest of her family give up alot for thier father's little things like clean shirt, beer and bus money. My favorite part in the book was when he died. I celebrated this convince for Francie...."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature. The novel would have been better if it was solely about Katie!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it.

I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details.

I felt it was meant to show &quot;what growing up in a poor Catholic family in that time period in Brooklyn was like.&quot; That's my family background, and it just struck me as some upper-class WASP who beat it out of the brownstones down South at a young age's snobbish look down. The &quot;plain&quot; daughter got sent to a convent? The daughter who was moving up financially sent her kids to an Episcopalian school? The mother told her daughter it would have been a beautiful thing if she'd lost her virginity to a guy she wasn't going to see again, although wearing her hair down was bad? This is probably my least favorite book ever (I finished it because it was a school assignment.)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book.

The main topic of this book as it states in the foreword.\\"The best anyone can say is that it is a story about what it means to be human.\\" Represents that the novel about a little girl named Francie and her little brother named Neeley that wasn't just about how they pulled through in a poor neighborhood. It was about the real life struggles families have to go through.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel. The author of this novel was born on December 15, 1896 with the name of Elisabeth Wehner. She married young with a law student from the university of Michigan. She then had 2 daughters named, Nancy and Mary. She wanted to finish her schooling but she didn't finish high school. Although she was able to take classes and she was focusing in journalism, literature, and drama. The foreward states that the novel isn't just a book about \\"social issues\\" nor \\"class struggles\\". Its a novel when you read it you recognize yourself.The main topic on this novel is that Nolan family of 4. Living in Willamsburg, Brooklyn. Trying to make ends meet with the father, Johnny Nolan, being the head of the family. Working as a singing waiter, And drinking his tips away. The Nolan family were very poor. they bought penny worth stale food.This work addresses to many audiences, but i think the problem relates to a particular audience which is the ungrateful audience. The type of audience that have enough and wanting more.At first the book confused me a little. The reason for this because the way the story was written in which i liked. But it started with Francie and how her life was. Then the next chapter it was about Francie's meeting. i got that part but the part where it was a chin scratcher was when the part where Mary and Sissy came in. Until I read on and understood that Sissy was Katie's sister, and Mary was her mother.The book in general is great. But the part that I loved. Was the part where Francie went up to the fire escape and started to read on a Saturday. I like this part because it made me understand the difference between kids from then and now.I completely concur with previous reviews. In which they state \\"A profoundly moving novel, and an honest and true one. It cuts right to the heart of life...\\" I recommend this book for all audiences to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read...it has a great plot and a great setting too.

Betty Smith is a fab. writer."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book in high school, and remember it to this day. There is also a well-known movie made from the book which follows the story closely. The book is the touching tale of a family with 12 children, much spirit and love, and at times very little money. It's an inspiring, very moving tale that shows how determination, hard work and the love of your family can get you through anything, good times and bad."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The thing about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is that it is inconsistent in terms of quality. The plot is AT TIMES interesting, and other times so dull I barely even bothered to read what was on the page. The writing is in fact incredibly readable, but that is only because it lacks depth at times and is extraordinarily simplistic.For the most part, the story of the Nolan's is interesting. Francie seems to be a character that falls into a template or a pattern - she is a reader, she is somewhat weak, and she is an intelligent child. These traits have rather become cliches in main characters, but the point is almost irrelevant here. The remainder of the Nolan family is fascinating, but more often than not, we are only given Francie, which is both disappointing and also boring at times. Things do get quite repetitive.There's not much to be said about the writing. It's hardly the most beautiful writing I've ever encountered, nor does it have the greatest consistency or flow, but it reads simple. For readers who don't want to dive into a thick book that is also complex, this would probably be a great choice.The best parts of this book are the little things. The \\"should-be-great\\" parts of the book are merely \\"okay\\". While the overall story is grand and impressive, at times the book and the writing simply stall, giving a few pages of words that really need not be there. Editing, perhaps, would have helped.On the whole, this book can be recommended, though be warned that it may not suit those in search of good writing, and also that it stops at time, or rambles. It is thoroughly readable, though, and overall good.3 1/2 stars - Recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A simple story of a seemingly unimportant life that is inspiring and enjoyable. A must have addition to your library of classics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is the detailed account of young Francie Nolan's life from birth to about age 17. While the story is quite poignant at times, the amount of detail is really just too much. I felt like Smith gave a breakdown of every meal and purchase made from 1901 to 1918! Yikes! While these descriptions did give the reader a sense of the desperation, hunger, humiliations, etc. that the characters faced on a daily basis, I felt that it detracted from the story after a while as I grew accustomed (and perhaps calloused) to their misfortunes. The characters were very well developed, particularly Francie, Johnny (her pathetic ne'er-do-well of a father), and Katie (the hardworking and often under-appreciated mother). Smith did an excellent job of presenting them as multi-faceted people, full of inconsistencies and indulgences, without passing judgment on them. The relationships between the characters were also touching and true, the emotions real and understandable. Smith gives poverty a true sense of dignity. For this, she is to be commended. Keeping in mind also when this book was written, Smith blazed some new trails for the frank discussion of women's sexual identities and labor inequities. By today's standards, these things may not seem significant, but Smith undoubtedly was ahead of her time and helped clear the way for women writers to follow. So, while this book is not one of my favorites, it is worthy of a read, more for historical relevance than pleasure, at least for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this for some time.

Her Irish father, Johnny, is an aspiring singer and waits tables while dreaming of a better life. Her mother, Katie, finds herself supporting the family more than Johnny, as he is an alcoholic. Francie is an admirable girl living in poverty and wants a good education; she has a true love for learning. Francie and her family live a hard life, but just like the tree that grows in her neighborhood despite a lack of soil, sun, and water, her family will find a way to survive. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith really captures the American Dream at the turn of the century. Fans of coming of tales must read this literary gem.Francie is one of my favorite literary protagonists. What is not to love? Despite growing up in a rough neighborhood, she loves books, libraries, and wants better for herself. Her mother is also strong as she has been dealt a tough hand in life. She could easily give up, but is an honorable character and a role model for her family. On the other hand, Johnny, although a sweet romantic, is unpractical and brings his family down. It was hard to watch his slow spiral into alcoholism and its impact on the Nolans.Smith is a brilliant writer. Her use of flashback takes us back to when Katie and Johnny first met, which was one of my favorite parts of the novel. Also, there were parts of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn that stopped me in my tracks and there were lines that were simply beautiful. Here are two of my favorite lines:\\"People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,\\" thought Francie, \\"something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains - a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone - just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\"\\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn's theme is a powerful one and will always be one of my favorite classics. It teaches us so much about perseverance, love, family, survival, and the American Dream. I display this classic proudly in my classroom library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is a historical fiction book set in ... Brooklyn.

This Irish-American family faces poverty, alcoholism and the brutal realties of life in turn of the century New York City.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is considered an American classic and an essential part of American literature. The book describes life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and is a testament for the hope kindled in immigrants who came to the United States.Not surprisingly, this well written book emphasizes the value of good educations, good teachers, community and family.\\"Before they went to bed, Francie and Neeley had to read a page of the Bible and a page from Shakespeare. That was a rule. Mama used to read the two pages to them each night until they were old enough to read for themselves. To save time, Neeley read the Bible page and Francie read from Shakespeare.\\"To be honest, I ignored this book for a long time. I had several chances to read it but chose something more \\"manly\\" each and every time. Finally the \\"classic book club\\" I belong to has chosen this book and I decided that this is it.I'm going to read it.The reason I always passed on \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is because it has always been billed as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\". That tag line didn't sound to enticing to me.Once I did read it I discovered that all the taglines and advertising did injustice to the book. This is not as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\" but a book that everyone should read. While the story is also about the coming of age of young Francie Nolan, it is also a touching testament to the early immigrant spirit and the hardships of life which were rarely written about first hand.\\"'This could be a whole life,' she thought. 'You work eight hours a day covering wires to earn money to buy food and to pay for a place to sleep that you can keep living to come back to cover more wires. Some people are born and kept living just to come to this.\\"Even though this book was not written as historical fiction, I believe that it squarely falls in that category in 2011. The story is a powerful look at the time using relateable characters (even for guys). The book reminds us how lucky we are to live in this time, where the daily dilemma is should you download the new song from iTunes instead of not knowing where you're going to get those ten cents to feed your family for the day."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived.

Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read.

The book is divided into five parts. In part one, the reader meets eleven-year-old Francie and her little brother Neeley. Francie and Neeley live with their parents, Johnny and Katie in the tenements of Williamsburg. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic and Katie works as a house cleaner. Living in utter poverty, Francie and Neeley earn pennies selling scrap metal with other children of the tenements. Part two tells the story of Johnny and Katie's meeting and falling in love as first generation immigrants. Part three describes the Nolan children as they begin school, as well as the death of Francie's father from pneumonia. The rest of the book chronicles Francie's coming-of-age as she and Neely grow up and get jobs to support their family. As Francie's life appears to have more on the horizon than that of her mother, she can't help but remember the small apartment in Brooklyn where she grew up.Though written almost seventy years ago about a time long since past, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn remains one of the most celebrated and classic coming-of-age tales .The character of Francie Nolan is one many teen girls can identify with: she struggles to find out who she is while coping with her father's alcoholism, her family's poverty, and her unfortunate surroundings. Addicted to reading and education, Francie's unending struggle to better her life has and will continue to inspire many. Betty Smith paints a rich portrait of the characters in the novel, and as they grow, the reader feels connected with their lives. The book is also an excellent look at life in the early 20th century. Smith's attention to detail is perfect for creating a realistic backdrop for her story. In a way, Brooklyn itself is another character in the novel. Francie's ability to overcome adversity, essentially becoming the \\"tree\\" that grew out of Brooklyn, is what keeps generation after generation interested in reading this wonderful, heartwarming novel.I have read this novel twice, once when I was about 14, the second time as an adult. Both times I thought it was wonderful. It is truly a classic piece of American literature, but I have met quite a few people who've never read/heard of it. It's definitely a must-read for people who enjoy historical fiction or period novels, but can be enjoyed by all audiences.Like my review?

I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12. Oh, and I was born in Brooklyn too!St. James Place"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is an 11-16 year-old girl growing up in 1910 Brooklyn, part of a seriously poor immigrant family. Her story is valuable to teens, young adults, prime timers and retirees. Her story is an inspiration to upwardly mobile individuals and a tonic for those who assume that the poor are lazy, unskilled, bad, incompetent or different. The story is timeless.Francie loves her alcoholic father and appreciates her hard-working mother. Her life is shaped by a handfull of rules from her grandmother, most importantly those about thrift and education. Her life is also shaped by her extended family, her neighbors and her city. She is a good person who shares her innermost thoughts with the reader. Francie is one of the most attractive characters in American literature. She is not perfect; she's simplistic, naive, overly individualistic and overly focused. But, she's a keen observer of life.This book is rated a top 10 American novel on Amazon because it is approachable to all. It reflects American values. The description of life is authentic. The characters are familiar, but not mere caricatures. Francie is driven to succeed, but not at all costs. She learns and grows. The \\"cattiness\\" of life at all socio-economic levels is well-described. Francie rises above it. Random events and tragedy are fully included in the broadly positive tale. In spite of economic pressures, war, cultural norms, institutions, and human nature Francie ultimately succeeds in her primary quest for higher education. Her family succeeds economically. But, this is not utopia. Success comes with a cost. It does not provide permanent security. In the author's tale, grace comes to some, but not to all.The possibility of individual progress, in spite of ..., is elevated by this novel in a believable manner. If Francie Nolan can overcome the odds, we should all be fully engaged in the game of life, pursuing our dreams.The CD version is exceptionally well performed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I did enjoy this book, but at some parts I felt the author could have done without. Some places have too many details and over explain; I got it the first time....the book is about a family, focusing on Francie as she grows up in Brooklyn, beginning in 1912. pre WWI. It's about loss of innocence in many ways, the harsh cruelty of life and the sacrifices that must be made, and the downfall of Francie's mind after a tragedy, dealing with her emotions, not being favoured by her mother and finding herself through the experiences of her life, her job and war. Francie triumphs in the end,and how she gets there is incredible and will leave you feeling like you've a diary of someone who had it harder than you and you will feel better and more confident about yourself and finding the strength to accomplish your goals no matter the hardships that come your way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn captures the life of the Nolan family, who live in the slums of Brooklyn, not by choice, but because they are poor. The book follows them from the opening of the 20th century through the 1920s. The central character here is Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny, opening when she is 11, and follows her through her teenage years.The book is a coming-of-age novel, but at the same time, it's a look at many issues prevalent at the time which one could argue are still prevalent now. For example, beyond the immediate effects of poverty on Francie's family's life, the author has also reflected on how people both on the inside and outside of the Nolan's community viewed poverty. There is a great scene where Francie and her brother went to a \\"celebration for the poor of all faiths\\" (211) -- where the kids received little gifts, watched a play, etc., and then there was a give away of a doll. The woman gives a speech about the child giving away the doll, saying that \\"Little Mary is a very rich little girl,\\" who had received a lot of dolls for Christmas, and wanted to give the doll to \\"some poor little Mary.\\" All of the \\"poor\\" little girls refused to own up to being named Mary, because no one wanted to be a \\"symbol of all the poor little girls in the audience\\" (212). There's also a part where Francie, who wants to become a writer and is good at it, turns in compositions about \\"poverty, starvation and drunkenness\\" which her teacher tells her are \\"ugly subjects to choose..\\" and while Francie argues that they are true, the teacher says something along the lines of well, sure, but these are not subjects to be written about. (321).Smith also writes about the perception among many of the poor that education would lift their children out of the slums and give them a chance to have a better life than the previous generation, but at the age where they can go on to high school, many families were so poor that the kids had to get working papers to help support the family, sounding the death knell of many parents' dreams to get their children out of the slums and into a better situation, further perpetuating the cycle. I could go on. Gender, geography, the role of women, these are all important themes, but I can't write forever here.What this book is really about is hope and perseverance. At the end of my edition is a little bio of the author, and in it, the author's daughter notes \\"She often said about 'Tree' that she didn't write it the way it was, but the way it should have been.\\" I think the reason this book resonates with so many people is reflected in that statement. Would we have liked it as much if she had written A Tree Grows in Brooklyn \\"the way it was?\\" Contrast this book with Ann Petry's The Street, where it was definitely written the way it was and see which you like better.I vaguely remember reading this book as a teen, but I think my recommendation would be to older readers who are a bit more life savvy. There's a lot in this book to contemplate."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is not much more to add here about this amazing coming-of-age novel, except to say that the reader of the audio version, Kate Burton, made the book come alive by being spot-on with several different accents found in the melting pot of early twentieth-century Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely love this book!

I already can't wait to re-read it!And though its setting takes place around WWI, and the city is New York City, the book really reminds me of my own grandparents (contemporaries of the author, not her characters) in many ways.

She lives through many trials of being hard up on money, but family ties and events keep the apple of life as sweet as ever. Even sweeter, for though every meal is an adventure, she has a wonderful education and class, which as her mother believes is the difference between two types of richness, money and love from people and richness of knowledge. As she grows up, she sees the rest of the world, and her life is compared to a tree in Brooklyn, which always forces itself to grow, as she pushes her way out of poverty, getting a good job, and struggling to rise above her parents and go on for greater things. It is a very compassionate story, moves quickly, and though life is viewed from the point of a young girl growing into an elegant woman, it is meant for all ages. It gives the reader a power of hope. Aye, it has the same underlying generalized moral, but in such sweet and unique words, its like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter day. This is an awesome book, which you should read at least once in any point of your life, for it touches on all aspects of life.

Betty Smith has brought us a compelling story of the Nolan Family who lives in Williamsburg Brooklyn, in the early 1900's. I really enjoyed reading this book and the story and its characters will live on in my mind for years to come.Francie Nolan is the main character of this book and we follow her and her family thoughout all the hardships that befall them. Money is not very plentiful in the Nolan household but yet somehow this family knows how to take a loaf of stale bread and turn it into a feast. We learn how Francie makes it through her teenage years and her story is of hope and survival.I truly enjoyed reading this book, it was well written with a lot of great characters especially Francie, Aunt Sissy and Katie. This is the type of book I could read again and its one that I plan to hold on to for a very long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I picked up this book at the library at school. I had no idea who Betty Smith was or that the book was going to be any good. I cannot ever remember ever understanding a book as I did this one. The writing was so clear, I got the feeling and the meaning deep in my heart. I devoured it page by page feeling Francines every sorrow and joy. I think Betty Smith deserves a pat on the back and a thank you for this amazing piece of writing she has contributited to us."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read about the Nolans when I was in the 7th grade for a class assignment and I have read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; countless times since. Although I am an avid reader of the classics- I always stray back to my ratty old copy of &quot;A Tree Grows...&quot; - the same copy that I have now had in my possesion for the past 18 years. I still get a tear in my eye when I think about Francie and all she endured- perhaps because I can relate to her life in so many ways. Like Mary Nolan did for her children- I hope to do for my own. As Mary Nolan had Neeley and Francie read a page from The Bible, and a page from Shakespeare every night before going to bed- my children will hopefully do the same- however they will also read a page from &quot; A Tree Grows From Brooklyn&quot;. I only hope that they too will learn as much from the Nolans as I have over the years..."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought this book was amazing. It was one of my most favorite books. I felt like Francie became a distant friend. I felt her hardship, and I felt sad for her, too. She was a poor girl living in Brooklyn in an extremely hard time. I was astounded when Betty Smith said that Katie, her mother, liked Neeley, her brother, more than her. Thank god I had never had that happen to me, but it really hurt me when that was said in the book. I felt terrible when Francie's father died, he was her only support, she could always fall back down on him, and then boom, he died. So sad. She was so helpless, yet so strong. She was a wilted flower that still had the potential to live. Betty Smith gave Francie a very realistic role in the book, as she did all the other characters. She built them up beautifully, so you felt you really knew them, atleast I did. The story was like a jigsaw puzzle that wasn't missing any pieces."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first had to read this book my sophomore year in high school I frowned on it simply because it sounded like a extremely boring book set in a boring time. As I started to read it I could kind of feel for Francie and I never could put that book down. To this day whenever I'm bored I will pull that book of my shelf and start reading it all over again."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the few books that have made me cry. When a book makes me cry, it means that I have felt,throughout the book that I was in the book. Not as Francie, but as Francie's best friend who lives a better life than her. I still get sad when I think about it"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the tree of heaven. No matter where its seed falls it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of the cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly without earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.&quot;This paragraph, which appears right before the book starts is the definition of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is the story of Francie, who like the tree, struggles to reach the sky. The sky represents the vastness of knowledge. To the people around her she would seem beautiful except there are too many of her. Her family is poor and are sometimes completely out of food, but she survives. She lives on life and gets drunk on it. Knowledge is her food and life is her drink. Betty Smith, the author, saw the beauty in a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn and wrote a powerful book.One of the most important characters in this book besides Francie is her dad, Johnny Nolen. Although he is a drunk, he is a wonderful father. Even though he brings in very little money for food he fills Francie and her brother, Neely's mind with stories of great beauty and with his own love. He is a pipe dreamer who never gets his dreams, but he builds a whole heep of them for Francie who has a chance at fullfilling them.Betty Smith brings color and sunshine to the Brooklyn streets through her characters. Sometimes with a simple barber or junk man or with a strong character like Francies mom, Katie. My favorite side character was Francies aunt Sissy. Sissy married a man of 25 when she was 14. She is concidered a bad woman because men like her pretty looks. She has married several times, calling every one of her husbands John. With her love of men comes a love of all human kind, and in that way she isn't bad.When I read this I was so pleased to find some things in common with Francie. Although there weren't many, it made me happy. I think any girl who reads this would find bits of herself in Francie. We sometimes forget that poor people have just as high expectations and longings to learn as any of us. Every time I opened this book I felt like I was being bathed in sunshine and when I finished I sat and smelled the pages, trying to take it all in."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I got this book, I had a warm feeling because I knew it was a classic and because I rarely get American books. I think this is a good choice for foreigners like me.A good thing about this book is that Betty Smith tells all about every member of the Rommely and Nolan families, as well as other people, even though this isn't important to the plot. She isn't realistic the way modern children's writers are, but she gives lots of little details. I love the parts about the Catholic religion.My favorite character is Mary Rommely, and I enjoy daydreaming of being cared for by her or Sissy. I like the part where she tells Katie how to raise her daughter. This could be used in real life, even today.Katie is very smart, hard-working and strong-willed. Sometimes she seems too stern, but other times she is kind and understanding.I can most identify with Francie when she argues with her teacher, Miss Gardner over her writing. Also, same as her, Ikeep imagining things, so I liked the part when she's told to write down stories instead of speaking lies. (Only writing takes much more effort!)I think part of what it makes this a serious novel is that sometimes little sad details are included. I don't mean the kind describing the cruel school system, but softer ones: the father Johnny being a bum; Francie and Katie knowing it would never again be all right between them. However, there are also some parts telling of good times.This is a good book to read, and after you've read it, you can browse through it again and enjoy your favorite parts separately."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really loved this book until it got to the point where Francie left school and started working. From that point on the novel seemed like a Disney story. Factory work is fun? You can easily skip high school? I felt like the author ruined all the good she had put into the earlier part of the book. I loved, in the first 2/3 of the novel, seeing the characters overcome their hardships, the frank treatment of sexuality, the hipocrisy of the neighbors with the pregnant teenage girl, the way the family deals with attempted rape, handling difficult issues like alcoholism and the way the author honestly described peoples' flaws. Then it seemed like the author thought that the story was too sad and had to create a forced happy ending. The part where McShane \\"proposes\\" marriage to Katie was laughable. Here is a woman that would never accept charity but then she automatically jumps into marriage with the rich guy. I didn't believe that Francie would become such a snob too and state that she would never return to her old neighborhood. I just really hated the ending."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith does not need my words of Praise. It is exstraordinary piece of writing - Warm and human and speaking to you personally. It touched me deeply. With unforgettable characters that are drawn from real life. Open any page in this remarkable book and you continue to read - whether you intended it or not. What a masterpiece..Max PaetzoldAustralia"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a beautiful book. I have loved it for 20+ years and read it more than 20 times. Every time, it is as if I become a part of Francie. She is a daughter, a niece, a younger sister, the neighbor, the friend....she is so real to me. Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character. This is a story that may be over 50 years old, but is just as new as if it were written yesterday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book about thirty years ago. It stands in a class all by itself. My daughters have read and loved it. If you are over 12 and under (it doesn't matter--you could be 120) add this book to your &quot;don't miss&quot;!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book in three days. When I finished, I started over again. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. Betty Smith writes a novel set in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. The reader immediately falls in love with Francie Nolan. Even if you don't know what it's like to be poor and hungry, this book humbles you. You'll laugh and cry with Francie until the last page. And you will never forget her. Buy this book and leave it on a shelf. You'll read it more than once. I promise."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was in college about 20 years ago, I needed something to set a plant on. I took an old book from an old set off the shelf and there it sat for a few years, under various plants. That book happened to travel with me, unread, for another 15 years from apartment, to home, to home, until someone gave me a list of the Top Ten Life-Changing American books. Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family. I don't think I was ever required to read it. I never saw the movie - didn't even know there was one. To me, it is the most wonderful best-kept secret I have ever had right under my nose."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's clear narrative of her days (as this book was based on her own experiences) a young girl in the Brooklyn slums brought life in the early 20th century to life for me. Her writing is absolutely captivating - it made me angry, sad, light-hearted - and I finished the novel in but two days."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I LOVED A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN! I am not an adult I am a child of ten. My grandmother said that it was the first adult book that she read so having read the Horse Whisperer and Memoirs of a Geisha I bought the book at a local store started to read it and it was nothing special but when I got to the third chapter it got SO much better. Before I Knew it I had finished it and was sorry that I had."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is amazing. I truly, totally recommend it. I just finished reading it and I was terribly disappointed when it was over. I didn't want it to end. I rarely enjoy a book as much as I enjoyed this o one. It draws you into the lives of the characters, so you grow to understand and sympathize with them, and care about what happens in their lives. It's one of those books that are the best in the first reading, but still amazing enough to read many times afterwards...."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is my favorite book of all time, and even though it is not the &quot;most sophisticated book&quot; that there is (I read it for the 1st time when I was 10) I can read it over and over and NEVER get bored! A 10 STAR RATING IF THERE WAS A CHOICE!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My mother recommended this book to me. As soon as I started it, I couldn't put it down! It is a great story about a girl who grows up in Brooklyn. Through many hardships, she finds courage, character, and love. It is a warm and comforting book. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;Intolerance is a thing that causes war, pogroms, crucifixions, lynchings, and makes people cruel to little children and to each other. It is responsible for most of the viciousness, violence, terror, and heart and soul breaking of the world.&quot; -page 226 in the 1998 Perennial Classics (excerpt from 13 year old Francie Nolan's diary)This quote is what I believe to be the most powerful. It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever. It made the novel for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first read 'Tree',I must have been around 10. I read it over and over. The subject matter hits too close to home for me, having grown up in the 70's, but under startlingly similar conditions for their time. My mother, brother and I were alone, yet we utilised our time and resources just Like Francie and Neely. As one who has gone through poverty can tell you, that is much the way it is for many, many people in the USA. Reading this book will remind those people of the small things, the things that matter. This family was like many, in Brooklyn and all over the world, with its harshness, ugliness and hope. There will always be poverty, but for those, like Francie and Neely who have finally found their way out, it makes the past all that much more bittersweet. I recommend this book for those kids who have never gone without, who have their lives handed to them, and for whom the computer does all their work. Read this: you will be humbled. I promise you will appreciate what you have."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is an extremely fasinating. It combines love with the hardship of life in the 1920s. This is one of the only books that was hard for me to put down. Yeah, it was long but when I was done I was completely overwhelmed by the amazing abilities Betty Smith had for writing. She keeps you interested through the whole book. There is never a dry moment. Francie (the main character) is very heroic, and talented. If you were going to read only five books in your entire life time this should be one of them."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is my favorite.

It is one of my top 5 favorite books. The characters and the story touch your heart and change the way you look at life. I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your taste in books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"ATGIB is the kind of book that you can sit down with and finish reading the whole thing feeling different about your life. I felt this way when I first read it: for me, I had to read it for school and thought when I first picked it up that it was a long book and what possible plot took up such a long book? Since then my life's changed because of Francie. I, unknowingly, acted like Francie each time I read this as a young girl: I managed to sit out somewhere where I could face my whole life (the neighborhood really) with a bag of something to eat with me. Sitting usually up in a tree with the copy, a bag of pennystick pretzels or popcorn, and a nice breeze once or twice, I fell in love with Francie, Neeley, Katie, Sissy, and all the rest. I could hear Francie telling me about her life in Williamsburg, NY and how she loved her father so much. I saw Sissy, the wild Sissy, doing all kinds of things imaginable. I smelled Katie cooking dinner and touched the library books that Francie treasured. I tasted the candy that Francie and Neeley bought. It changed my life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was in junior high (over 20 years ago) &amp; still regard this book as a treasured friend. Betty Smith's description of life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is magnificent--you can smell &amp; taste it right along with Francine. (The Elia Kazan movie does some justice to the book--Peggy Ann Garner's portrayal of Francine is haunting &amp; makes rereads of the book even more enjoyable.) No matter how many times I read this book I never get tired of it. I return happily as if to a long-lost friend."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book appeared on an optional eighth grade reading list for me -- 45 years ago. And, I'm very sorry I waited so long to become acquainted with Betty Smith's masterpiece. If nothing else, Francie Nolan is a contemporary of my grandparents, and it would have been a great way to start conversations that might have let me learn more about what it was like to grow up in poor immigrant families in small-town Wisconsin.Beyond that, though, this is a truly compelling story of a girl's coming of age under less-than-ideal circumstances, buoyed mainly by her own strength of character. Smith's sparse writing style took a bit for me to get used to, and it helped reading her biography and learning that she was primarily a dramatist; she prefers to show her readers what's going on and leave them to their own interpretations, rather than simply telling them.The latter chapters weren't quite as rewarding, even though it's comforting to see that Francie's hard work is finally going to pay off. The real meat of the story occurs in her formative years ending with her own eighth grade graduation. Even so, these were not characters I was prepared to leave when the book ends. And, while I believe I understood the adults better for having waited 45 years to tackle this book. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone 12 and up who wants to read a wonderful story of a girl's growing up."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"the author painted a clear picture of New York City and described the way of in the 1930s and growing up in the area"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Very good book, but is a slow read.

Buy it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I tell people who have already read this book (especially women) that it is my absolute favorite, I typically get a look an/or a comment somewhere along the lines of, \\"How can a book about a 13 year-old girl's coming of age in Brooklyn be your favorite?\\" Maybe I can't relate period-wise, geographically, or sexually (male/female), but there was a strong emotional connection that formed between myself and Francie the first time I read the book that I will never forget. I've always loved libraries and reading and now that I am a librarian, I rarely walk into any library without thinking of Francie's interactions with the librarian and her goal of reading all of the books from A-Z. This is a wonderful book for all--women, children, AND men."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could NOT put this book down!I have read it three times in total and plan to read it again. Betty Smith writes of the coming of age of one young girl in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. Smith does well in characterizing Brooklyn and its inhabitants, from the &quot;fast&quot; but warmhearted woman to the lonely army boy.Smith accurately portrays the hopes and fears as well as the crushed dreams and ambitions of one young girl looking for happiness in a world full of nostaligia.A time that is past comes alive with glitter and grit in Smith's words."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a student of Betty Smith's and have read all the reviews on this site. Many of you loved this book and described it as a classic. Unfortunately, as great as it is, it is not considered a classic academically. It is not canonized, it is not often read in high school and college classes. Do a web search on Betty Smith and her name will rarely link with any websites. That is where you come in. If you truly love her works, spread the news. This author, who wrote 4 novels and over 70 plays, is quickly becoming forgotten. It is time for a revival."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I got this book off a reading list and put it on my own for the summer. This book is amazing. You feel as if you are a child in New York. Smith describes so well the life of a poor family scraping by in turn of the century Brooklyn. How much things were changing and things needed to get by in the world, not as much as we would like to think.I so enjoyed reading about Frnacie's life, I didn't want the book to end, and that generally means a good story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is so wonderful. THe author describes the life of the Nolans so well, you feel as if you are actually there, experiencing the things she describes. You are happy for Francie during the good times, sad during the bad. This book will make you laugh, cry, and really help you to get your priorities straight. It is a classic, and should be in every home in the country. By not reading it, you are depriving yourself of an amazing experience. It is great reading for teenagers as well as adults, although the readers should be mature enough to truly grasp the story's meaning. I know some 13-year-olds who get more out of this story than some 30-year-olds. Like I said, it all depends on maturity. To wrap this up, I believe that this is an amazing book, and everyone should read it at least once at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"even though i'm 12, i've found this book to be amazing. it first appealed to me at a family friends's house at the age of nine. i find it hard to believe that a book can be read at least 10 times. now, my class is reading it and we all love it. we analyze every single chapter to the point, and i absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Having just moved to Brooklyn my mother thought that I should read this book. The book arrived two days after my arrival, so after a long day of dish boxes I sat down and began to read. Several days later with few boxes unpacked I finsihed the book and loved every word.

This is a book for every shelf and should be cherished and shared.Read it soon."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There's a lot to be said about B.Smith's &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, but I will simply say this. There's nothing else like it anywhere. Without knowing it and - almost as instantaneous, you're thrown into this world (some can relate if they're from brooklyn and recognize the areas spoken of in the book) and you just can help falling in love ..utter love, with every character!! Mark my words: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be humbled by the story and inspired by Francie's and Katie's passion, your heart will go out to Johnny Nolan it's just so intense so deep so AMAZING!! Please, read this book - soak it in and love it forever, because this book will treat you well...this book is a dear friend to anyone who needs a little friendship. GET THIS BOOK AND READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I think I finally understand my younger sister who is in her forties today. She read this book when she was the age of eight or nine and living in New York City. I recall her talking about how wonderful the book was and how much she enjoyed Francie and aunt Sizzy. Like Francie (including myself), she grew up in similar circumstances except there were six siblings and mother. Dad was too irresponsible to fit any of the characters, except perhaps the disgruntled Willie Flittman, who runs off with his new found vocation; a single man orchestra (substitute women). Anyhow, she grew into Sizzy more than Francie although there was a lot of Francie in her as a young girl. I certainly went off in search of the American dream. My sister did not, although Francie still lives in her particularly in her search for beauty, love, and insatiable love for books. She too wanted to read all of the books in the local library.The book speaks mounds of truth about poverty and the struggle faced by urban poor. Ms. B. Smith treats the subject and the characters with great tenderness and honesty. Although the pathos and ethos of the urban poor may not have been of great interest or even palatable to readers at the time of the book's publication, the great human paradigm and its redeeming values is timeless and relevant. Reading A Grows in Brooklyn and having lived in Brooklyn Heights as well as experienced a similar childhhod is especially welcoming. To reflect on those difficult childhood times is important as it helps keep me grounded. I would not deny or exchange that experience for anything in the world.The book is a must read for all lovers of literature regarless of age, gender, or socioeconomic circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Everyone should read this book.

Every story about Brooklyn or NYC has already been told, millions of times. But I'm telling you, this one is different. The main reason it's different is because this Brooklyn story is told through the eyes of young Francie Nolan, one of the most glorious characters ever created in literature. Truly, she's almost indescribable. She's smart without being precocious, at times sad but never maudlin, and traversing the world of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th Century with her is one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. I will love her forever.This book is about family and community and love and education and poverty and strength and mistakes and triumphs and growing up. It is filled with the most amazing characters and paints a picture of America that is utterly new to me and leaves me believing there IS magic in America, magic in the neighborhoods we call home, magic in our childhood memories . It will make you laugh and cry (I cried three times, a record for me, while reading a book) and as soon as it is over you will vow to return as soon as you can.So if you've been putting it off, or if you've never heard of this book before, or if you haven't read it in years, do yourself a favor and read it now. And then reread it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book first at 11 years old. It has been one of my favorite books ever since. The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was an unexpected discovery: I had seen something about this American teenage classic, but had no idea what it was about. It sounded rosy and childish, but turned out to be an excellent novel on the life -from age 11 to 16- of Francie Nolan, a girl who lives in Brooklyn. The Nolans are very poor. The father, Johny, is a handsome guy, but he suffers from a horrible alcoholism that only leaves him time to find sporadic work as waiter and singer. Katie, the mother, is a young, admirable hard-working woman, who has had a tough life and who finds work as housekeeper in order to sustain her children. Francie has a younger brother, Neely, with whom she generally is in good terms. The portrait includes uncles, aunts, and grandparents, depicting their lives and misadventures. It is a grand realistic fresco of life in Brooklyn during the first decades of the XXth Century, a poor Brooklyn populated by Irish, German, Italian and Jewish people.But the main, and most interesting, focus is on Francie's inner world. She's an absolutely lovable character, an admirable, brave girl, self-assured and reflective. Francie enjoys going to the library to borrow books which she later reads in the peace of the fire ladder outside their tiny apartment. Although she is kind of a loner, this is compensated by the mental travels and the enrichment of her mind provided by books. The novel recounts the difficult passage from childhood into adolescence, her troubled and hurting love for her father, a pathetic failure who can't find the will to overcome his problems, and who stumbles from fall to fall until his destruction. It also recounts Francie's relationship with her mother: she suffers from believing Neely is her favorite, but she's never reproachful and is always helpful.The tone is intimate, and even sordid aspects are treated with great beauty of language, depth in psychological description, and empathy with the characters. Feelings, values and situations are universal and allow the reader to really feel the story. Readers of any age beyond early childhood may enjoy it. It is about dignity, courage, effort, and authenticity without ever being corny or preachy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith isn't a novel about a dysfunctional family. It is a lullaby of a quiet corner in the city that never sleeps. It is a lullaby that whispers the joys, hardships, and love of a family that will forever be in my heart.The story revolves around Francie Nolan, a young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. She is one of the only true Americans on her blocks and is proud of it. Living on little food, Francie quenches her thirst for life through books and school. Her mother is a traditional housewife with a twist of rebellion. Her father is a man as magical and loving as he is drunk, living through a kaleidascope of wonder that he teaches his children to adore.Everything about A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was utterly enchanting. I truly connected with each character. It doesn't matter whether you're an eager young author, someone who has experienced a tragic loss, or simply someone who loves life, I believe there is a little bit of everyone in Francie Nolan. Everyone has that childlike need to live their dreams in an attempt to escape an imperfect reality. In fact, all of the Smith's characters are so terrific that it is hard to believe that they are 'ction. Their attitude, togetherness, and love are something that every family should strive to imitate. By the end of the novel, I began to miss the family that I had grown up with as if they were my own.Betty Smith's writing is full of wonderful portraits of the place she grew up. She displays the glory of New York City at a time when immigrants poured into America. Her prose make us feel the pride of Francie's neighbors when they leave their homeland, and the freedom they felt as their boats docked. Yet, along with these beautiful images, she portrays the struggles of so many people living in the small crowded islands of New York City. Betty Smith shows us the loves and losses of a new nation by painting a picture to rival Picasso.The chronicle of the Nolans' life was a truly wonderful and enlightening experience. It is so enchanting to travel alongside the family through their trials and celebrations alike. I will admit to several tear streaked pages and advise anyone who reads this book to have a box of tissues handy. I will end with my favorite part of the book. The tree is growing outside the window as Francie looks out at it for the last time. About the tree, Smith writes: \\"It lived! And nothing could destroy it.\\" Those sentences remind me that nothing ever truly dies. Everything and everyone will live on forever in the memory of all who come to love it.- Victoria Testa"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I lived in the pages of this book, was totally carried away to Brooklyn. It made me want to be a better person. I cannot wait for my teen daughter to read this book and to find out what she thinks of it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The term \\"classic\\" is thrown around these days and lands on lots of inappropriate choices, whether it's books, movies,music, etc. But this book is- and always has been - a gem. I read it myself fifty years ago; bought it for my daughter, my daughter-in-law, and, most recently, my niece. We have all loved the story.Buy it and share it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is an incredible coming of age story that everyone should read regardless of social class, race, etc. It is the story of Francie Nolan and her often impoverished family and their daily struggles to put food on their plates and to become educated. Francie's voice is so innocent and perceptive as she narrates her family's history, the Brooklyn neighborhood she was raised in and the adjustments she must make as she grows older. She is able to find pleasure in the simplest of things, yet her life is a constant struggle filled with small joys and immense tragedies. Smith's beautiful writing immerses the reader in the Nolan's lives, effectively conveying the atmosphere of their existence and defining the era. I was so absorbed in this novel and am thrilled that I was prompted to read it for my book club. It will be a favorite that I will recommend and revisit over the years."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith deftly depicts a young literate woman's perspective of Irish life in Brooklyn during the turn of the last century - impressively in a manner similar to great American authors Theodore Dreiser or Saul Bellow. She shows us the great American story where simple roots can bring rise to good and sometimes great triumphs.Protagonist Francie Nolan is the main party throughout the book whose literary verve and gift make her the seemingly natural person to author this or a similar book. She writes about the happy and sad times of poverty in Brooklyn when impoverished lives delivered grueling challenges. But, to deliver such stories to the teacher in grade school can be straining.All great writers probably stretch the truth - that is what makes their stories surpass what we read or hear about on a daily basis. When Francie writes true stories about her poverty, her teacher says, \\"You know, Francie, a lot of people would think that these stories that you're making up all the time were terrible lies because they are not the truth as people see the truth. In the future, when something comes up, you tell exactly how it happened but write down for yourself the way you think it should have happened. Tell the truth and write the story.\\" She learns \\". . . poverty, starvation and drunkenness are ugly subjects to choose. We all admit these things exist. But one doesn't write about them.\\"But, Betty Smith did write about such difficult topics, and succeeded. So have numerous others since. Recently,Angela's Ashes: A Memoirrevolved exclusively about such Irish poverty forty years later. And how many post-war novels (WW I or WW II) have caught the public's attention with doom and despair as the almost exclusive focus of the fictional or nonfictional account?Reading books like this also allows modern readers to learn about the times and events. People walked outside late at night with little wonder about physical assault. Meals were \\"stretched out\\" from crumbs, day old bread, soups and parts of animals most of us would ignore. Education was very expensive, and horses ruled the roads in New York. As the subway and car were still not fine-tooled enterprises, trips from Brooklyn to Manhattan were journeys. And, \\"When you get a Democrat president, you got a war president.\\" Times have changed.This book proudly has been selling for decades, and could continue its selling feats beyond a century, because of the simplistic delivery and acute perception tied with great story and dialogue. Books like this are fun."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Our Book Club chose this book as a \\"classic\\" read. I remember reading it as a teenager and I believe that's who it appeals to. While I enjoyed reading it, I wouldn't say it has a lot of discussion value."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read Betty Smith's book shortly after it was first published. As a young girl, I loved it. Oh these many years later it was a nostalgic read, and I enjoyed revisiting the world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith as a teenager many years ago. I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have you ever had a book that you did not want to end? Because it sucked you in, grabbed your heart, transported you to a place and a time you did not want to leave? If so, you have been lucky. If not, this is the book. It has captivated me since I first read it in middle school, and I read it at least once a year.The title refers to a tree that only grows in Brooklyn. No one plants it, no one really tends it, they don't want it, but there, stuck in the cement, often deprived of sunlight, the tree grows into a thing of beauty. This is the story of Francie Nolan, a child growing up in slums of turn of the century Brooklyn, and her family, Neeley, her little brother, Johnnie, her drunkard father, and Katie, her mother, who works hard and doesn't have time for her dreamy daughter. The story follows Neeley and Francie as they grow up and deal with life's trials and small joys, all while beautifully describing their community in a way that places the reader in Brooklyn and makes you yearn for life to be like that again, even just a minute.I have read other books by Betty Smith, and this is, by far, her best book. Francie is such a lovely, well-drawn character. The reader can not help but feel for her as she deals with the sometimes rough life she has been given. When the children go to the doctor after playing in the dirt all day and a nurse makes rude comments about dirty children, we hurt because Francie hears her and hurts, and cheer her for standing up to the nurse, and, when the children earn a Christmas tree by letting the seller throw it at them (a tradition), we cheer because they've come out ahead in a world where that doesn't happen often. I laugh at the events of their trip to the shore with their father and a neighbor child because it reminds me of the good-intentioned but poorly-executed day trips of my childhood. But we WANT Francie to succeed, for her to be OK in the end. It's hard to find many books that make you care about a character so deeply and this book does it so well.I look forward to the day when I can read this with my daughter and let her discover the beauty of the story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Well written, very interesting account of the times, and family, sad, funny.Read it twice, several years ago first, and now again.A very good read for book clubs."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My school teacher daughter suggested I read this and gave me her paperback.

Very descriptive, very insightful, a truely great read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read this classic several tmes during my life. I own hardback and paperback copies of it. The book was published in 1943 and I first read it a few years later, probably when I was 12 or 13. I became so engrossed in the story I once sat on our very small porch rooftop to be like Francie, who read on a fire escape she could reach from her apartment window. The story of young Francie, a voracious reader, who lives in Brooklyn with her poor family - an alcoholic father, an always-exahusted hard-working mother - is one of the best books any woman, young or old, can ever read. When I discovered it was available now on Kindle, of course I bought it. I'm now 76 and can't wait to share Francie's life once more.This is not a child's book. It is about a child who makes her way in a difficult world and neighborhood, with help from unlikely caring people along the way.Thank you to Betty Smith, the author, and to Kindle for making it easily available to thousands of us.Janice Kirkland, Salem, Oregon"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was such a good book.

It seems to me to be the author's autobiography. Before I read this book, I thought the only poor people lived on small farms in the Deep South. Don't miss it. This book is a lesson in survival that will make you a better person."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn transports us back to an earlier time, the early part of the 20th century in one of the most famous places on earth, Brooklyn, New York. Here masses of relatively new working class Americans came to make their way, dreaming about the endless possibilities while working hard to make it through the day.In this faraway place we meet the Nolan family, Katie and Johnnie who marry young, love, work hard, and bear two children, Francie, young, impressionable and sensitive to the hard world but aware that beyond her neighborhood's confines is a gentler world she wishes to enter, and Neeley, tough and tender at the same time but rambunctious and anxious to live for the moment.Johnnie Nolan makes his way as a singing waiter. He is liked by everyone for his friendly, respectful and thoughtful ways. As a father he encourages Francie, his \\"prima donna\\" to follow her dreams, and he encourages her fancies just as he lives in his own--that the impresario will discover him one night as he works, and all his wishes will come true.In order to keep her home together, Katie Nolan does not have the luxury of dreams. She works as a janitress in her building. She loves Johnnie, but she does not like his drinking nor the idea that she cannot depend upon him. Her sense of responsibility makes her appear hard, and in some ways she is, but she feels she has to act as she does if her children are to have a better and easier life than she has.Katie's mother, who can neither read nor write, insists that the family reads the Bible and William Shakespeare. Each night they read whether they understand or not, for she knows that somehow it is education that opens doors to a better world. It is Francie's intention, in fact, to read her way, alphabetically, through the books in the library, and she reads voraciously.We meet Katie's sister, Sissy, with her peculiarities. We meet other neighbors, some good and some bad. We see Francie become an adolescent and deal with all the problems that involves, and we see the very difficult and divisive decisions Katie is forced to make as Johnnie's drinking becomes more of a problem.Despite the hardships of daily life, throughout the novel there is so much good and a great deal of happiness in little triumphs and successes that keep spirit and hopes high. It is a testament to the strength of the human spirit. It is a reminder that the little things in life are often the most memorable. It extols the importance of love and family and of forgiving when forgiveness is not easy. Many of the characters are as strong as the tree that grows outside Francie's building--a tree that refuses to die.I love this book. I've read it before and it never loses its appeal. I've cried through the sad parts and smiled happily at others. An absolutely marvelous movie was made in 1945 starring Peggy Ann Garner and Dorothy Maguire. It cannot cover the entire novel, but it is a treat. I recommend this too.I re-read the book recently for a library book discussion, and I asked the men there if this had appeal for them as well, and the answer was an unqualified yes, so take A Tree Grows in Brooklyn along on your next trip."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a classic that I just got the chance to read.

But there isn't a better way to describe Betty Smith's beautiful \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - except it isn't about a boy, but about a girl, Francie Nolan. It is a sad story - one that we have seen so many times - and, yet, Smith is capable of making it fresh and touching, because her prose is confident and abundant in details.Despite not being narrated in the first person, the story has the intimacy of narrator-protagonist, because we learn so much about Francie and the ones who surround her - her parents, he brother, friends and relative. She belongs to the same league of \\"To kill a mockingbird\\"'s Scout; and Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. They are kids whose wisdom is beyond their age. They are perceptive and sensitive about life and, specially, its difficulties and obstacles.What makes Francie Nolan - and consequently \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - an enduring character is that in she we can see all of us. The girl is the fear of growing up, and, at the same time, she is the courage overcome our neighborhood after something bigger. We accompany her for too many years in the narrative, and become close friends with her.Francie is Betty Smith - Betty Smith is Francie. But she is also each of any of us fighting an everyday battle for a better living. Life has rarely been kind or fair to her, and in that we see every injustice kids have suffered all around the world, what makes of \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" a perfect book for every generation - anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was for my daughter.

She and her parents and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, are a poor family and they know it. Her beloved Irish father, Johnny, is a part-time singing waiter and a nearly full-time alcoholic. Her petite, black-eyed Austrian mother, Katie, is the janitor (\\"janitress\\" here) for three tenement buildings, in return for their rent on a small flat. But with all this, they get by, though it's nearly always a struggle. Everybody likes the dapper Johnny, who seems incapable of doing anything right. Everybody respects the steel-cored Katie, who is equally incapable of making a misstep. This entire book could have been written about either of them and the reader probably would be just as satisfied. But Francie is the focus: Intelligent, thoughtful, observant, imaginative, dogged, tough -- she's all those things. She's also lonely and pretty much friendless. The narrative follows her through the next six years as she grows up physically, mentally, and emotionally, changing from a ragged street kid who collects junk to sell for pennies into a mature, confident young woman of seventeen who has skipped high school and yet is going off to college, having passed the regents' exams on the strength of summer courses, and without the benefit of high school. Francie is one of those kids who understands things. The book isn't exactly a novel, in the sense that there's no overarching plotline and nothing much of importance happens. It's difficult to answer the standard inquiry: \\"What's it about?\\" It's more of an oil painting in words, a portrait of the Brooklyn of a century ago and the people who lived there and who, with all their tribulations, still thought it the most wonderful city in the world. The style is very plain and straightforward, yet quietly poetic (which is partly why it's always included on school reading lists), but Smith spins her story out in such a way that you can't wait to find out what happens next to her characters. What holds everything together are the book's universal themes of family, interdependence, determination, and the power of learning, as well as a profound realism regarding both the good things in life and the bad. Betty Smith herself grew up largely as Francie did -- she originally wrote the book as a memoir but was convinced by her editor to recast it as a bildungsroman -- and she went on to do memorable things in literature. The reader will have no doubt that Francie (who no doubt has added \\"bildungsroman\\" to her vocabulary by the end of the book) is headed for a similar future. This book and the people in it -- and Brooklyn -- will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Like us, you'll find it very difficult not to fall in love with little Francie Nolan.While you may not pull an all nighter to finish this one, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a must read. The plot is delightfully complex, though, primarily surrounds the childhood of a lonely girl who loves books (now you know why we're so fond of her). Her family is stricken with many hardships including poverty and alcoholism, although her dad possesses one of the most underappreciated singing voices in all of literature. Symbolism is prevalent throughout and even Francie herself represents the American dream.For us it was so much fun to watch Francie bloom, ironically enough, much like a tree. We found it very easy (almost too easy...) to get caught up in each one of her successes and failures. There's also a whole cast of great characters that evolve and mature throughout the story. In the spirit of the holiday season, we double-dog dare you not to crack a smile at some of Aunt Sissy's antics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I think that this book is very good, and the descrptions are very elaborate.

Growing up isn't easy,but when your father is an alcoholic and your mother clearly favores your brother, most people would turn inward and reject the outside world. However, Francie Nolan is too strong for that. She knows she will accomplish her dreams, and she won't let anybody else tell her differently. Even when her father becomes ill, even when Francie must leave school to work, even when her heart is broken, Francie never gives up. I think Betty Smith gives courage and spirit to the Francie Nolan of today's world, a young girl growing up amidst anything else. Francie's struggles are the same struggles of girls of today, only in a different time. Parents, sibling, school, dreams, and simply understanding why the world works are all part of growing up. Just as Francie must learn these things on her own as part of growing up, young girls must learn these things on their own, as a part of growing up.The book shows that young girls are never alone in their struggles, and never will be, ever. Because this book gives hope and inspiration to girls of today, this book is among my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I originally picked &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; off of a reading list my junior year in high school. I wasn't looking forward to the reading, and frankly I put it off until the very last day.

In a world that is so fast paced, I was overjoyed to read about a time when all a little girl wanted was to read every book in the library. When penny candy really cost a penny, and when ice was delivered. This book is magical and educational. It shows the aches and pains that all young women feel, regardless of what decade you were born. It is passionate, and full of love. Each sentance is crafted, caring for the finest detail.

A GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Recommendation I highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Its portrayal of coming of age is both easy to relate to and very interesting. It was beautifully written, and was never boring. It gives you first hand, seemingly accurate knowledge of life in poverty at that time. The time during which the story takes place is made real through the effect of the different events and ideas (such as advertisement, the union, the urban machine, and WWI) on the characters. The book explores and analyzes each character's life, so that everyone seems like an old friend by the end of the book. Through these characters you experience joy, pain, hunger and sorrow as if it were your own. While it was lengthy (430 pages), it was not very complicated, so it remained enjoyable throughout."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith enchanted me with her beautiful description of early 19th century America through the eyes of Francie Nolan. Despite the significant differences between Francie Nolans lifestyle and my own, I feel connected with her. I love this book because I loved Francie's character. Francie's innocence, imagination, human desires, and passion make her very lovable. I cherish the descriptions of Francie's relations with her family. I also enjoyed Francie's endless observations of the world around her. I anticipated reading from chapter to chapter to see what trials, experiences, joys, and triumphs she'd come across next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves detail and good anecdotes. Francie makes me appreciate the wonderful life around me, one of the greatest gifts a book has ever given me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and certainly is Betty Smith's best book. It follows, for the most part, the life of the Nolan family from the oldest daughter's point of view. But it also gives you backround to give you idea of John and his wife's lives and their families before Frances was born. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I was assigned it for an English class I took. I moved away from my old school and finished it for no reason at all. I feel in love with Francie, and continued to read &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, also by Betty Smith. That was wonderful too. I am currently reading &quot;Maggie-Now&quot;, by Betty Smith. She has a way of writing that I can't even describe how good it is. I would reccomend for anyone that hasn't read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to do it fast. I learned a lot from it, and I think you will too. I have been encouraged by this book to be strong when times are tough, and to NEVER give up. Here's the surprise, I'm only 15 years old. I think I have matured a lot from reading this book. I can't seem to stop reading. This book has gotten me addicted to reading. I go from one book to the next, but &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; will always be my favorite. Jamie"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was fourteen I read this book for a class in junior high. Now, at age twenty, I am reading it again for a book review and have found that I have a deeper understanding of its meaning. Francie is like the inner child in all of us, wanting to be greater than anyone thinks she can. She rose up out of poverty by her own thinking and has shown us that we can do whatever we set our mind to. Her mother Katie was a very strong character who gave us an insite into a mother's love for her children. At the end, I loved the symbolizm where Francie says good-bye to her old self, the next little girl to take her place. And always, there is the tree, the one that will never die. To me, that tree stood for the continuation of life itself - it will always go on."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. It touched me.

Thank you Betty Smith for bringing this book into my life. -Sarah Homan"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Turning 16 I went to California to stay there for a year as an exchange student. My English wasn't very good and the first thing I had to do in my junior-English-class was to read the &quot;Tree&quot;. I had a hard time surviving the introduction and getting on was even harder. But even though I failed the first five or six quizzes on the book (we did one quizz a day) I somehow started to understand the language and to sympathize with the Nolans. Francie Noland became my dear friend during my first two months in California and my English got better and better turning the pages of Betty Smith's wonderful novel. The essencial thing that made Francie special to me was the way my English teacher pronounced MY name, Franzi, that sounds differend in German and in English. When I came back to Berlin I couldn't get a German copie of the &quot;Tree&quot; which I thought was terrible for me. I searched the libraries and found an old English copie which I read instantly. I missed the Nolans and the 1900 New York.

I found myself thinking about it recently and decided to order another copy (lost to loaner!) This book is not about Angels that fly around waiting to swoop down and save us from our misery and keep us from harm; but about the inner self and how each of us has a multi-faceted spirit, which is there to guide us and provide us with all that we need to live a joy-filled, abundant life. It is the part of of us that is created in God's likeness. This book is not about &quot;Angel Healing&quot; in terms of someone or some divine being from beyond ourselves that will help us to achieve an end. It is about our own divine nature. It also corresponds these twenty-two archetypes (The Angels Within) to the Major Arcana of the Tarot. (Think Jungian.) A must read for anyone studying Tarot. This book is far more profound than &quot;angel healing&quot;. The twenty-two archetypes are present and active in all self-actualized human beings.

I still actively work with this book today. This is a powerful teaching book based on esoteric traditions throughout the ages. Each angel is introduced as a timeless vortex of energy with corresponding archetypes from the tarot and ancient mythology, and the author guides you through the process of meeting each angel with a meditation. Manly P. Hall is qoted, as is the Bible, which would normally turn me off. However the amazing energy shifts that can occur by using the meditations in this book speak for themselves. Any description of this book really can't do the experiential results justice. If you feel drawn to this title, go for it. The vibrations are very esoteric and can feel alien to your everyday mind, but just EASE into it, and you will learn exciting techniques for altering your consciousness (for the better) and working with powerful angelic energies.

Holt. Published by The University Of California Press.Holt tells us that there have been 2000 books and papers published about Alexander in the last 40 years. What he kindly omits is that most of them have been rubbish; this one is not. It is a fine and valuable contribution to Alexander Studies admirably thought out and very well written. The University Of California Press has, as usual, well presented and marketed the work which is enjoying a popularity it should not have had otherwise. Basically a study of some unusual coin- like medallions depicting Alexander battling elephant mounted men. Holt gives us what might have been a tedious article in an obscure numismatic journal as a fascinating mystery and, along the way, manages to present an unsullied glimpse of Alexander without any of the contemporaneous tints which have been so blithely applied to him over the years. This is an excellent small book by a fine scholar with a keen analytical mind and an unusual facility for communicating with non scholars without pandering."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"This book is a delightful read. Like a good mystery, I was mystified by the clues as they were presented in the narration and wondered at times &quot;so what?&quot; But that only made the satifaction so much more pleasant when the meanings of the clues were revealed at the end and the medallions tell their story after thousands of years."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"This is on the surface a book about the history of a set of Hellenistic medals, which began to be discovered in the late 19th century. They show on one side, a Hellenistic leader / king figure, and on the other a combat between a mounted Hellenistic figure (usually taken to be the figure from the reverse side) and an elephant with two crewmen. There have been numerous interpretations over the years as to who the figure represents, with the majority favouring Alexander the Great, and the elephant fight being the defeat of Porus at the battle of the river Hydaspes. There have been many theories as to what exactly the medals portray, why they portray it, and where they originated. There are also several forgeries in circulation, just to muddy the waters. The author's research takes us from the former Soviet Central Asia, where the first medals were unearthed; the length of Europe; and to America, where many of the medals are now housed. He looks at the history of Numismatics (the study of coins - created by some of the former owners of the Elephant Medallions), archaeology, and the study of the classical and Hellenistic world, and the changes that have affected them since the medals were first discovered. Many of the characters involved knew each other, and even Charles Darwin's study of the behaviour of earthworms plays a part. However, what the author does best is to show the influence that people's contemporary culture can have on their world-view, and how it can affect their view of the past as they project their current world-view on the way people behaved in the past, and colour their reading of historical sources. Some recent Indian academics have tried to prove that Alexander never defeated the Indian king Porus, for example, and others have tried to place him in Darius's army at Gaugamela, and some have even tried to put Darius on an elephant at the battle. At the end of the study, the author then offers his interpretation of the origin and meaning of the medals, using only historical evidence, and reaches an elegant and satisfying interpretation, that fits with the known facts and the behaviour and beliefs of the Hellenistic world.This is an entertaining and erudite book, and will be a worthwhile read for people interested in the world of Alexander the Great, and also in the study of history, archaeology, coins, and the great debt owed to earthworms."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"That is exactly what I thought when I was assigned this book in Dr. Holt's class, but I was later proved wrong. As stated before he definitely has a knack for communicating with those not in this academic circle.

I encourage others to read other works by Dr. Holt especially his latest \\"Into the land of Bones\\""},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"This small book and fast read is a wonderful companion voume to thicker biographs about Alexander. You won't get a full accounting of Alexander' campaigns here- that's not the point, but you will get a concise account about how these objects that we use to reconstruct what history might have looked like are found, dated, and then mulled over by experts.This book is more about the essence of Alexander, and what was important to him and the men who followed him, than the nuts and bolts of his overall story.... I thought it was very entertaining.JJ"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"Professor Holt must be a stimulating, admired lecturer in his subject, for this book brings a wealth of knowledge together from a large variety of sources. Primary sources are the medallions themselves, of course. As for myself, this is the first time I have been fascinated with numismatics enough to stay with the whole book (which is easily absorbed in a day). Never again will I briefly skim over exhibits and pictures of ancient coins! Dr. Holt has made me a bit of an expert on many aspects of this subject, and he invites us to delve further with extensive, annotated footnotes on each page. He is certainly a dedicated scholar with deep and wide knowledge of his field, able to clearly present his interpretation while giving a balanced analysis of various theories. Each of his conclusions is supported by strong references to the literature."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","review":"Where should I begin? Above all, Holt supposedly invented a mysterious story, but there is no real mystery in it. In fact since the coins were found researchers have come to understand that those coins had been imprinted in memory of the battle between Alexander the Great and Porus, the Emperor of India. It is only the place and time which we think are of secondary importance could not have been determined precisely. In the introduction to his book Holt assumes himself to be Sherlock Holmes, but the solution he suggests at the end of the book is far away from reminding the persuasive arguments of the famous detective and only serves to surprise the reader because of its speculative quality. The majority of the book deals with many ideas which had been previously proposed and refuted by other studies, and apparently re-refutes all of those. When we reach the final part, we encounter the very principal elements of \\"Sherlock\\" Holt's solution; the first of these is about the imperfect apperance and imprint of these coins and Holt explains this unusual event by the rushed minting of these coins on a return journey from the Indian expedition, under exteremely difficult conditions caused by muson rains! The historian meticulously discarded a great many arguments throughout the book yet he surprised us by bringing forth this meteorological solution towards explaning the bad apparences of the coins. Perhaps this can justify a reader who may come to propose that the man who was in charge of the minting process was having a bad day! Or even because he did not received the merits he deserved from Alexander. Even more surprising is the explanation which concerns the other side of the coin showing the Alexander holding a thunderbolt. We can't understand why Holt discards the perfectly reasonable, simple yet adequate solution which is in accord with the traditional Alexander narratives deifying him- especially the one which deals Apelles' portrait of Alexander-. Instead he insists on seeing particularly a reference to the the rainy night on which Alexander won a victory against the Indian King Porus. Yes, there are many events in history about rainmaker army leaders. But, for God's sake, Alexander and his troop already knew India's disastrous air and field conditions. While, they advanced to the interior parts of India, they always encountered with such stormes, muds...So, if storm and rain had been an unexpected incident, maybe Alexander's powers which brings rain would have been good and miracolous news. And even after that battle, during the journey to the Babil, Macedonian army suffered from bad meteorological conditions. According to Holt's argument, one may think, Alexander, just after the battle, having been minted that coins, maybe has also seen responsible for that terrible field conditions! But, this time, his men, could not mint properly those coins, because of very same musons(in last chapter, the sentence which concludes with footnote 25!)Thus Holt's theory -searching the \\"textual\\" help to that night- extends to the assumption that these coins were minted in memory of \\"a dark and stormy night\\" and these coins function as a narrative picture of the whole war. But this sounds rather weird or impractical because Alexander gifted each of these coins, which allegedly individually represents a particular scene of the war, to his men which means the coins would never come together to form such a picture: One of the generals saves the one with elephant, other has Alexander with thunderbolt and maybe other one has the one with a chariot? As a matter of fact Holt himself was not persuaded by his suggestion that he claimed that these imperfect coins were indeed a turning point in the history of numismatic by this aspect.As for the much praised popular style of the book, as I read the translation I am unable to comment adequately; however I did not see any extraordinary features that deserve credit. By the way, it seems to me, Mr. Holt's only field of interest -expect coins- Darwinist biology. He mentions him several times, curiously enough, but most of these are unnecessary element of the failed rhetorical construction."},{"Title":"Dead Wrong","review":"What if President Abraham Lincoln weren't killed in Ford's theater in April in the 1860's? What if his double was assassignated instead, but Lincoln's friends and enemies thought him more valuable as a dead martyr than as a sick, though alive, President?Bill Dantini explores this situation in this strong debut novel. \\"Dead Wrong\\" is a good mystery and includes fine historical detail for mystery or historical fiction fans.Martin Rudd is a present-day scientist who discovers a mystery in an old diary passed down from an ancestor-Malachi Rudd-a former Pinkerton agent and investigator. In Malachi's diary, Martin discovers a plot and conspiracy against President Lincoln that, if true, would re-write history. \\"Dead Wrong\\" is told in modern scenes and flashbacks in which the mystery of what happened to Lincoln unfolds.Dantini makes excellent use of his chosen narrative device by furthering the plot in both the contemporary scenes and in the flashbacks. Since one particular set of scenes isn't relegated to simply expositional delivery, each set of scenes is compelling with its own well-developed characters, locations and plotting. You won't find yourself skipping sections to \\"get to the good stuff.\\"Dantini has a flair for description and exposition that enables his plot-driven book not to become a series of episodes (I went here, then I went here, then I did this), but keeps the reader's attention through to the end. His description of an 1860's July 4th celebration and baseball game is a high-point of the novel.In addition, he does an excellent job of maintaining focus. This is an important point since the book follows four distinct plot tracks: the Martin Rudd-modern scenes; Malachi Rudd's investigation in the late 1860's; the real Linclon's story in the 1860's; and the assassin's story, as they try to finish Lincoln's death.Dantini manages a complex plot and delivers strong, interesting characters in the midst of a compelling mystery."},{"Title":"Dead Wrong","review":"Bill Dantini has woven a masterpiece of historical fiction, bringing to life aspects of Abraham Lincoln's \\"life\\" no pure historian ever could have. These \\"fictional\\" acccounts (are they??) set in 19th century DC, Baltimore and Upstate NY give a rich texture to an already gripping underlying plot. Lincoln fans, historians, conspiracy theorists and lovers of fiction alike will love this book. I literallly could not put it down. A must for any library. If you loved Caleb Carr's \\"Alienist\\", in terms of his depiction of 19th century New York City, you will love Bill Dantini's writing and descriptions of the various locales visiting by his characters."},{"Title":"Dead Wrong","review":"Dead Wrong is one of the best historical whodonits I ever read. Bill Dantini crafted a delightfully believable story from what I thought, at first, might be an implausible premise (Lincoln's double was shot at Ford's theater, not the President, who was kidnapped by opportunistic powers from his own administration.)It is a fast-pace thriller with compelling characters and historical accuracy. Could not put it down until my wife hid it from me so she could finish it herself. Mr. Dantini, when will we see your next book?Joe Ball"},{"Title":"The crater","review":"Similar to Shaara's Killer Angels, in that historic characters are thorouglydescribed by internal motivations and external trench warfare conditions.Pennsylvania coal miners work for officers who were their bosses a two yearsbefore; beleaguered, starving Confenderates who were once freemen but nowbut now are army privates fighting to hold on to slaves they will never own;black soldiers led by white officers with motivates quite diffent than thecircumstances that have forced them together. Trench warefare is presentedin its grim conditions of August dust, Coehorn mortars, sharpshootingand tedious daily routinges. Life in bombproof shelters for officersand shelter tents over holes for the enlisted men, on both sidesis graphically shown. The attack on the Crater is gripping in its courageby enlisted men and their nco's and disgusting as the generals discuss whatcould be happening at the front, if they could get just one messanger backwith a clear picture. At over 550 pp., the author tells many life stories inThe Crater; Jews, jayhawkers, abolitionists, ex-slaves, farmersfrom Georgia and mines from Pennsylania, immigrants and frontiersmenall meet in Virginia, in the trenches at Petersburg, 1864."},{"Title":"The crater","review":"While not nearly as well known as other certified masterworks whose theme is the Civil War, Slotkin's book is a masterwork nonetheless. From a boat trip down the Mississippi by a very young Abe Lincoln to the labor riots of the 1870s, The Crater ranges over a wealth of 19th-century US history. In the process, it reveals an author uniquely capable of bringing history to life.One thing, however, that separates Slotkin's work from other, more rabble-rousing Civil War novels is its often ironic stance. The general officers of the Union Army emerge as hopeless buffoons or, worse, criminals who seem never to have deserved the victory they won only by superiority of arms. And Slotkin does especially well by their victims, the private soldiers of the war, who are portrayed with great sensitivity and detail.Slotkin's work makes one of the darkest hours in American history seem even darker. But it has never seemed realer than in Slotkin's masterful piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The crater","review":"Slotkin's massive tour de force is his first work of fiction, and that becomes obvious to the reader quite quickly. In many ways his research is exhaustive. He quotes whole pages of dispatches from the Official Records and has clearly researched the Battle of the Crater and the units involved in the depth one would expect from a Ph.D. and former National Book Award nominee. When he relaxes and allows himself to write, he writes well, and some of the battle scenes are truly excellent. Where this book falters is in its storytelling. It moves slowly. There are too many characters and they become hard to tell apart. The action is broken up by too many retrospectives and dispatches. You really have to have a long attention span to enjoy this book. As far as Slotkin's interpretation of the period, it is very cynical; I put down The Crater thinking that the Union generals really deserved to lose the war for their politicking, stupidity and wanton wasting of their men's lives. Slotkin sees the issue of slavery and black rights as being central to the war, and his book reflects that. One place where he is rather weak is in his portrayal of Southern soldiers: they are not as human and believable as his Northerners. He presents an ongoing clash between officers, even NCOs, and privates which replicates the class conflict which is the underlying theme of the entire book; I'm not sure to what extent this clash really existed, but it is believable within the context of the novel. Overall, this is ponderous and hard to read, but for those who have the patience, it is a very interesting and rewarding effort."},{"Title":"Intern","review":"I read this book - glued to it - in high school -- and because I am fascinated by medicine anyway, I have recently repurchased a few copies to share with others. If there weren't so many books to read, I'd read it again! I still might!"},{"Title":"UFOs: The greatest mystery","review":"\\"UFOs: The Greatest Mystery\\" by Hilary Evans was probably the first book I read about UFO's as a kid. It's short, concise, and has large colour illustrations, many of them credited to the Mary Evans Picture Library, co-founded by none other than Hilary Evans himself! Apparently, it's very convincing too, since I had a \\"UFO phase\\" as a preteen. Later, I became more fascinated by the fact that people can believe whatever they want to believe. And these days, I'm just tired of it all.The book manages to cover virtually all aspects of UFOs and the UFO subculture, despite being so short. Cases mentioned include Socorro, Lakenheath, the Papua observations, the death of captain Mantell, and the Hill abduction case. However, there is very little about alien abductions overall in this book, probably because it was written in 1979. The abduction craze didn't start in earnest until the 1980's and 1990's. George Adamski is prominently featured, and the book also mentions some more bizarre speculations about Nazi-UFO connections, \\"the hollow earth\\" and MIBs. The Roswell saga is notable by its absence, and so are Billy Meier and the lovely Semjase. Nor does the book mention Erich von D&auml;niken. Still, it's surprisingly comprehensive for a work only 100 pages long, where almost half of the pages are illustrations!\\"UFOs: The Greatest Mystery\\" ends with a dramatic and apparently real photo of a human crowd anticipating the landing of an interstellar space craft. Alas, it's not really real. It's actually from the movie \\"Close encounters of the third kind\\". Still, it's a fitting close. Evans' book was published during a period when the UFO phenomenon was still interpreted by many people as benign, and perhaps even as a chance at salvation. It was an optimistic mystery waiting to be solved. If you pick up a ufology book today, a very different picture emerges...Times have changed, apparently. And so have the mysteries."},{"Title":"Camaro Exposed: 1967-1969 - Designs, Decisions and the Inside View","review":"The author of this book is an expert on the Pontiac GTO and has written several books on that topic. He also co wrote Glory Days with Jim Wangers. This book is not his best work.The major problem is that there isn't enough content to fill 173 pages. It is full of white space. The outside margin is 2.5 inches. The tables are narrow and double spaces. They often contain trivial information like the exact equipment in every version of the Z/28 package, the equipment included in the 1969 Indy Pace cars, or what percent of the Camaros shipped each year had wheel covers or tinted windows. There are many small black and white pictures of different interiors, all too small to be useful, some referring to the color of the interior.It is difficult to determine who the intended audience is? Does the reader who wants to compare the shock absorber piston diameter of the Z/28 and the Boss 302 also want to see pictures of the proposed station wagon or fastback?"},{"Title":"Camaro Exposed: 1967-1969 - Designs, Decisions and the Inside View","review":"The book has a ton of Information in it and it is very well done.

The problem is exacerbated because this really is not a true biography but, as the subtitle says, a &quot;Story&quot; ~ told for young people, or those with an interest in a new (at publication time) &quot;saint&quot;. Thus it is hard to offer a criticism without sounding petty or self-righteously opinionated. I remember when Kolbe was beatified, i read a Reader's Digest article telling the story of his martyrdom; i have a vague memory of his canonisation too ~ inevitable once Wojtyla became John Paul II ~ but i had no sense of the man. I still don't. This book is written in such an adulatory fashion, whether or not it was designed to coincide with the canonisation, that it is hard to grasp any meaning to Kolbe's life or death. There is very little in the way of depth, interpretation, meaning, to the biography; all is the recounting of the surface facts, largely how many obstacles were overcome by the intervention of the &quot;Immaculate&quot; (Mary), with whom Kolbe had an appallingly close relationship, to the detriment, despite anything Dewar shrilly insists to the contrary, of his relationship with Jesus Christ. The facts of Kolbe's life and death are amazing; but there is no explanation, either of how they came to be nor what they mean, here."},{"Title":"Dead Ernest","review":"If you loved the 'screwball comedies' of the Golden Age of movies, and/or the cliff-hanger endings of the weekly serials from about that same era, you should truly appreciate the Leonidas Witherall books by Phoebe Atwood Taylor, written under the pen name of Alice Tilton.This particular story whizzes by so rapidly, you'll find yourself struggling to catch your breath from the hustle-bustle, while laughing uproariously at the same time. The truly amazing part of it (at least to me) is that there are 218 pages in this book, and all the action takes place in less than 24 hours! Amazing!Leonidas is a William Shakespeare look-alike, and indeed, is frequently known as 'Bill Shakespeare'. His business persona is that of proprietor/headmaster at Meredith Academy, a prestigious boys school in Dalton, Mass., a suburb of Boston. The time is in the early 40s while the war is still being waged in both the east and the west. When Leonidas is not engaged in school activities, he is the author of the famous Lieutenant Haseltine adventure novels, written as Murgatroyd Jones. What with his own adventures, plus researching those of the good lieutenant, it's probably safe to say that, apparently, he knows every policeman in the state of Massachusetts, and a good many other states, as well.When a huge deep-freeze is delivered to his home, Leonidas is determined that it is in error, and thus sets in motion the Harold Lloyd/Buster Keaton/Keystone Kops type non-stop action. As the freeze makes its way from house to house to school, he is visited by a lovely young blonde with violet eyes, the very personification of every man's birthday wish. Of course, it isn't his birthday, but the beautiful young lady in the gorgeous white gown and a corsage of violet-colored orchids is nonetheless positive she's at the right house.In the meantime, the next door neighbors are moving, and the new family seems rather intrusive. And then there's Ernest Finger, or is he really Carlos Santos, and why does it appear that he's on everyone's 'most hated' list?Leonidas and Terry (the blonde whose real name is Terpsichore!), his housekeeper Mrs. Mullet, and a cast of assorted folks as quirky and interesting as anyone could wish for, combine to make this one sensible, if breath-taking reading experience. I could barely stand to put it down, even though other duties beckoned. What fun! M'yes, indeed. If you've not previously made the acquaintance of Leonidas, I urge you to do so. The sooner the better!"},{"Title":"Dead Ernest","review":"DEAD ERNEST begins when Leonidas gets ready for his temporary apppintment as head of a boy's school in a neighborhood that, while it looks serene and very proper on the outside, reeks of crime and nothing is what it seems!Jeff Marks' recent account of the lives of seven postwar female mystery writers made me seek out Alice Tilton's novels, and beginning with this one I plan to go and make a broad sweep of her oeuvre, because DEAD ERNEST is so funny I found myself trying to catch my breath with laughter. I can't even begin to list the complications Leonidas faces here, but most of them have to do with trying to track down the two squat, brawling movers who hauled an electric freezer into his front room--a freezer that contains a body--the body of the new teacher at the local prep school--name, Ernest Finger. Or is it? In another part of town, he is known not as a teacher but as a singer and a heartbreaker. Complicating matters for Leonidas (or BILL as he is called due to his uncanny resemblance to that one etching people have identified as Shakespeare) is the presence of a beautiful young woman, a blonde Rita Hayworth type in a slinky \\"Gilda\\" style dress, called Terry, who shows up with an unlikely explanation for her activities. Can she be trusted? In any case, her wisecracks and her slangy 40s drawl make her eminently fun company. She gives \\"Bill\\" as good as he gets.The banquet they attend is beautifully redolent of small town suburbia, right down to the menu, creamed chicken (\\"even if they added mushrooms and referred to it as Minturn Club chicken a la king') and orange sherbet for dessert. Also, \\"colossal stuffed olives (imported), selected hearts of celery, and \\"Crsip Lettuce with French Dressing Minturn Club.\\" You might almost forget that a man lies dead in that freezer, or that a war's going on.

I know most of the big names by this point, but wanted to know more about the back story than I already did.I have to say this book is an extreme let-down. I don't mind if a scholar/critic doesn't agree with my taste, but Mast makes ridiculous claims. Here's just a few:-Mistakenly credits the closing shot of the Magnificent Ambersons to Welles, and even claims that he doesn't know what Welles was doing putting such a tacked-on ending (Robert Wise shot this and a few other scenes)-Claims that Birth Of A Nation isn't really racist (even D.W. Griffith felt bad about having made such a racist film). Clearly the film is important, but this claim is absurd.-Calls people in the early industry \\"Jews\\" derogatorily, making the link between them being Jewish and only caring about money and not the art of a film.-Discredits movies such as Metropolis for only being good \\"looking\\" films that have no real soul/interesting story.-Claims that all Kubrick films are panned by critics (many critics panned his films, but certainly not by a majority!)If you have any interest in film, you will learn more by finding out a director's name and reading their wikipedia.

I'm an avid reader and have no indications leading me to believe I have ADD or ADHD but this was simply put the worst text I have ever seen about film. The author's subject matter is not only unappealing but at times also irrelevant.

Instead, we learn more about bridge gamesmanship: how to win with trickery, how to win unorthodoxly, and most importantly, how to win with style.The other half consists of various stories, many with only the most tangential relation to bridge.

Therefore, the sovereign nation is losing power.While these are all true, the most important question is; to what extent? She never adresses this, and so, the whole book amounts to not much than some trendy talk of &quot;Oh the world is global now and everything's different&quot;. So, forget this book.

After offering various food classifications, Dr. Ogden reviews food as a cultural identity anchor, as a statement/expression of self, and reviews eating as a forum of social interaction. This broad lens perspective offers humanizing context for looking at food and diordered eating - and offers an important counter-weight to the often mechanistic and reductionistic discussions of disordered eating.In chapter 7, \\"Dieting,\\" Dr. Ogden begins with a similarly broad socio-cultural lens of examining dieting as a modality of female oppression (on par with foot-binding, corsets, etc.). Dr. Orden proceeds with a balanced analysis of the Restraint Theory that has become an official platform for claiming that diets don't work. And - no minor accomplishment - follows up with an honest critique of the Restraint Theory by posing such questions as: if attempting to restrain doesn't work and presumably leads to overeating, then how do vegetarians and anorexics lose weight and maintain weight loss? This question - in light of what appears to be an emerging radical anti-dietism - is an important reality check. The fact of the matter that the contemporary health lifestyles have begun to include rather devoted, long-term vegans, vegetarian, calorie-restricters, and even regular detoxifiers/fasters whose experiences clearly contradict the no-restraint scare tactics. Dr. Ogden does a good job of summarizing the relevant research on this point.As evidenced by Chapters 4 and 7, Dr. Ogden's delivery style is that of a bird's-eye view with a gradual and effective zooming-in. This from-general-to-specific resolution progression allows the reader to orbit around the issue without losing interest. Dr. Ogden doesn't mislead: she begins with an overview of a chapter; nor does she abandon you to make random conclusions - each chapter ends with an effective summary.The book is well-illustrated: it offers - my guess - about 30 figures/diagrams and some photos (check out a rather provocative ad on page 55 for a for-men-only candy bar).Dr. Ogden reviews all the conceptual pillars of the field of the eating disorders: food, food choice, healthy eating, dieting, anorexia, bulimia, overeating, obesity; she reviews the standard treatment options (perhaps, the only area of the book that might be a reason for the second edition); summarizes various strands of relevant research, and culminates with an integrated model of a diet.In sum, Dr. Ogden's \\"Psychology of Eating\\" is an encyclopedic feast on the topic of eating, dieting, disorder eating, and eating disorder treatment.Pavel Somov, Ph.D.Author of \\"Eating the Moment: 141 Mindful Practices to Overcome Overeating One Meal at a Time\\" (New Harbinger, Nov. 2008)."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Eating: From Heathly to Disordered Behavior","review":"The Psychology of Eating is essentially a synopsis of various food and eating habits investigations conducted over the past 25 years.

Duran, a Tiwa Indian, scientist, and Christian, the search for identity and purpose is the central theme of this \\"difficult introspective journey of self-exploration and internal conflict.\\" In his journey to reclaim his Pueblo identity, Duran speaks candidly about the difficulty of deconstructing old paradigms, shedding conformist ways of thinking, and recovering traditional paradigms in order to reconstruct a wholistic spiritual and integrated scientific worldview. I grew up among the Anishinaabeg and thought I had a pretty good understanding of the history of the European occupation of Turtle Island for the past 500 years. But Duran's insights into the ideology of Manifest Destiny and our government's systematic extermination of the original nations of this land helped me to ask new questions and think beyond my historical, cultural, and spiritual assumptions. His exposure of the American Church's witting and unwitting complicity in this nation's project of cultural and spiritual genocide is honest, fair, and heart-rending. The genocidal policies and practices of our government and churches, often hand in hand, have left a legacy of pain, loss, and grief in many indigenous communities of North America. As I began reading this book, I wondered if this shameful and violent legacy could be overcome. I wondered how the culture could be restored, and where hope could be found. Duran doesn't answer all of these questions, at least not in any complete sense, but he does gather up fragments of history, culture, spirituality, and traditional knowledge, while following the path of his personal story, in a magnificent effort to find the meaning of his own life, the richness of his own culture, the beauty of his own people, the depth of his own spiritual traditions. In making this journey, Duran reclaims the strengths that have sustained the Pueblo and other Native communities of Turtle Island for generations of occupation and oppression. This is an important book about an important journey taken with great pain, unbelievable gentleness and respect, an unsettling humility and humor, and breathgiving faith and hope. Read widely, this personal and courageous journey has the potential to move the church, if not the nation-through repentance, reconciliation, and restorative justice-toward partnership in recovering and celebrating the personal, cultural, spiritual, and national identities of the original inhabitants of North America. I highly recommend this book to those who are beginning to understand the breadth and depth of the wound festering in the heart of the church and in the history of this nation. --Dr. Bruce D.

Levine passes blame all around - youth culture's fascination with being \\"cool\\" and instant gratification, the public school system and higher ed. system's failure to prepare students for reality, etc. Levine presents a simple four-part framework for understanding and dealing with the problems he identifies.I honestly can't disagree with Levine's observations and conclusions, although I find his approach to be somewhat predictable and trivial. Yes, there is a problem, and yes, we can be teaching our young people better about life's stages and transitions. Perhaps we can even do some good if we follow Levine's prescription for setting things right.However, I think Levine is best understood as a product of his generation, specifically the Dr. Spock, baby-boom, \\"Me\\" generation. Although Levine has identified some legitimate problems, he rings hollow because he comes off like the next in a long line of navel-gazing baby-boomers. As such, he seems to have a blind spot for the failings of his own generation and its guiding \\"Me\\" philosophy, and so ends up treating symptoms rather than the true disease.Perhaps I'm reading too much into all this, since I am inherently suspicious of all things related to his generation. As I said, taken on its own, Levine makes some good observations and offers some advice that may be helpful. However, I can honestly say that I can't read one more book like this w/o thinking, \\"ENOUGH ALREADY!\\""},{"Title":"Ready or Not, Here Life Comes","review":"Dr. Mel Levine makes some good points in describing why so many of today's young adults have trouble with the transition from the world of school to the world of work. For starters, Levine states that many of the skills needed for school may be different from the ones they will need during a career. For example, think of all the multiple-choice tests you may have taken in high school or at a university. I agree with Levine that these tests really don't prepare a student for anything important in the adult world.Levine also says that kids need to be more interested in the working lives of people. I think this is a great point. So many kids grow up idolizing sports stars or entertainers. Instead, they should try to make more connections with the adult world. Kids and students should focus on their feasible futures because the odds of making it in sports or entertainment are minute. It also talks about reading biographies of people you admire (to get an idea about how they navigated life). However, with technology and other reasons jobs are changing so fast that, as Levine notes, role models even within a family are an endangered species.A lot of the advice is very practical. For example, it helps to know what abilities you have, what you enjoy doing, where you see yourself in x amount of years, etc. If you know this, you will not make the mistake of just taking whatever job comes along. This could easily turn into being stuck in a job you hate after awhile. It is important to keep in mind that a willingness to start way down and climb way up is, of course, the American Dream.Bottom Line: It is a great/essential/interesting read for educators, parents, and students."},{"Title":"Ready or Not, Here Life Comes","review":"Levine takes a hard look at today's youth and how they're being prepared for life in the real world by parents and teachers alike. His all-too-true allegations about young people being prepared to be students rather than real-life workers is all too true. College and college prep programs prepare one for four years in a classroom, but not necessarily for a true career. Learning about a career and actually working in it are two different things, and Levine recognizes this difference with sound advice as to how to prepare for both. Highly recommend for educators, students, and their parents."},{"Title":"Ready or Not, Here Life Comes","review":"As a therapist working primarily with teens and families,I've often felt that the transition from college to work is one of the most overlooked areas in research and writing.

Less melodramatic than his previous novel, The American, and therefore showing less of the influence of European writers, Confidence rather establishes familiar Jamesian themes and explores ideas that contrast European Old World and American society, albeit in a style that is rather more light-hearted that his more notable later works, with the advantage however that it is still entertaining and more readable than some of the latter-day novels.The story is centred on Bernard Longueville, a young man travelling freely around Europe, sketching and painting, who meets two fellow Americans in Siena - a Mrs Vivian and her daughter Angela, who he sketches while she inadvertently poses picturesquely outside a church waiting for her mother. Bernard expresses his admiration for the young woman and offers her the sketch, but is not so delicately rebuffed by the rather defensive and dismissive young woman. A few weeks later, Bernard receives a letter from his friend Gordon Wright in Baden Baden, exclaiming that he is in love and wants to be married. Bernard rushes to visit his friend and discovers that the object of his affections is none other than the same young woman he painted in Siena.The majority of the novel explores at length Bernard's attempts to comprehend the actions and motives of Angela Vivian, a young lady who does not act like other society girls such as their rather feather-headed travelling companion Blanche Evers. This attempt to get to the bottom of this strange but undeniably fascinating young woman is initially on the request of his friend Gordon, but Longueville has difficulty coming to terms with his own feelings for Miss Vivian.Confidence is a slight work by James, a little longer than it needs to be, but witty and entertaining all the same, delighting in the \\"intellectual fencing\\" that goes on in the realm of human interaction, relationships and communication, seeking to find truth in the less than precise - and sometimes even contradictory and deceptive - use of language. James manages to do this without over-elaboration, using some nice allusions and metaphors (losing himself to a bout of gambling, although successful, Bernard at one point realises that contrary to the impression of controlling his actions, \\"he had not been playing - he had been played with\\"), and without the extravagant verbosity, over-analysis and sometimes unendurable length of his latter works."},{"Title":"Confidence, 1st US Edition","review":"Two leisure-burdened young Americans frolic around Europe during the 1850s. One is rich and science minded and without a sense of humor or common sense, the other just well to do and art minded and a little inconsistent and frivolous. They meet some women and try to figure out what they think of them. The artsy one (Bernard) is more in the focus of the narration. His friend (Gordon) asks him to figure out what he thinks of the woman to whom he has recently proposed and who has rejected him (Angela).Our hero tries to do that and the inevitable complications happen. The woman becomes aware of the consulting project and sabotages the investigation by odd behavior. (This situation is reminiscent of the physics problem that the observation of an experiment tends to interfere with the results of the experiment.)The basic story sounds as old and solid as a Boccaccio tale. The Decamerone would have gone straight for a love affair between the hero and his spying object, but James didn't do things nice and easy. He thrives on the roundabout way. Frankly speaking, James overdoes the complications of the plot towards the end. Had it shut down after 25 chapters instead of 30, the novel were better.James lets the spy give his friend a negative verdict on the advisability to renew the quest for the woman. Decisions in other directions are taken (Gordon marries somebody else), but there will be a later re-match, a second round of guessing.The novel is structured like an hour glass: the first half set in Italy and Germany, then an interruption (with an un-detailed Asia trip), then a continuation, some years later, in NY and France. By now, Bernard has started to feel the emptiness of his life, while Gordon has at least started doing something: he owns a chemistry research lab (unclear if for profit or not).One of my favorite little texts by Bert Brecht is this:Herr K met a man whom he had not seen for a while. You have not changed, said the man. Herr K paled.Consider this Jamesian version, which has clear historical precedence, making Brecht a plagiarist:You are the same man I used to know (says Gordon to Bernard when they meet again).I am sorry for that (says Bernard). (The dialogue is repeated by two other protagonists later in the story.)"},{"Title":"Confidence, 1st US Edition","review":"I wish that I had met (main character) Bernie Loungeville in the 20's... riding across Europe in a traincar... what an interesting trip that would have been."},{"Title":"Star Paws (Puppy Patrol #5)","review":"I own this book and i love it!

Richelieu, typically portrayed as a selfish or evil figure is shown in this book as a master statesman, a brilliant politician and a reluctant, if successful, member of the Catholic church. His rise to power is more of a by-product of his goal, to united the disparate factions and provinces of France into a single, powerful authority under the king. Unfortunately, Louis XIII is a weak-willed child figure dominated my his mother Marie de Medici, who resists Richelieu's efforts to reform the state. In the end, Richelieu defeats all of his enemies except for himself. In Anne of Austria he finds the one weakness that he shouldn't allow himself, but one he must satisfy. For her part, Anne is a spoiled, selfish and politically ignorant girl. Having been raised and pampered in the Spanish court, she expects much of the world. She, however, is disappointed by her new husband, Louis, who enjoys the company of his favorite, Cinq-Mars, more than his queen. Richelieu is smitten with her, despite his better sense, and confesses his feeling for her early on. She is greatly offended, as he is a man of the cloth, and she is a queen. She has seen Richelieu exile Marie de Medici and have her lover executed, so Anne merely smoulders.Rejected by her, Richelieu redoubles his efforts, putting down a near civil war championed by Phillippe, Louis' younger brother, who desperatly tried to enlist Anne in the effort to depose her brother. Finally, through careful statesmanship and personal maneuvering, Richelieu protects Anne from being found a part of the revolt, sparing her life for becoming her lover. It is the final break of her will that she succumbs to his mastery of her world. Initially, his visits are polite meetings, but ventually she sees him for the great man that he is, and returns his love equally. Anne, through her association with Richelieu, grows in wisdom and maturity, becoming worthy of the title of the Queen of France. When she finds herself pregnant, Richelieu even manages this well, prompting the king to make the attempt to sire an heir, assuring him of the queen's love. The visit goes well enough, for to everyone's satisfaction, Anne gives birth to Louis XIV.This novel will forever change your perceptions of characters that you remember from popular films; although the 1972 version of the Three and Four Musketeers captures much of this book's Richelieu and Louis XIII."},{"Title":"The Cardinal and the Queen","review":"This is an intriguing work of historical fiction that centers on the supposed love affair of Cardinal Richelieu and Anne of Austria, who was Queen of France and the sister of the King of Spain.Married to Louis the XIII, who prefers the company of his young male companions, Anne is left to her own devices. Finally, Louis is forced to consummate the marriage, which results in Anne becoming pregnant, only to suffer a miscarriage. After this event, the King leaves Anne alone and treatas her as if she were his prisoner, rather than his wife. This results in Anne intriguing with the Kings mother, Marie de Medici, and the King's younger brother, Gaston D'Orleans, against both the King and Richelieu.Cardinal Richelieu is depicted as a consummate statesman, the true power behind the throne. He knows himself to be a political figure, first and foremost, and a son of the Church, a distant second. He is consumed by his fight for power, as well as his secret passion for Anne. Yet, she will not succumb, as she detests Richelieu, blaming him for all that befalls her at her husband's hands and orders.There comes a time, however, when Richelieu gains the upper hand in the battle of wills, and a passion is unleashed that would have the power to topple a dynasty were it known. Then, an event occurs that would change the stakes for which they are playing. It is now a matter of life or death for both Anne and Richelieu.Seventeenth century France was a turbulent place and time, a hotbed in which rumors and intrigue abounded, providing a great deal of exciting events for the author to weave together into a story that is sure to keep the reader turning the pages. Those who like the historical fiction genre will enjoy this novel, as well as the author's interpretation of the events of the time."},{"Title":"Professional Writing in Context: Lessons From Teaching and Consulting in Worlds of Work","review":"I borrowed this book and found that the various essays about writing in the workplace and teaching writing in the workplace had great practical applications to my daily writing activities at work.

We feel that the public should have full disclosure as to what Jehovah's Witnesses are taught and are in turn teaching the public... At the same time, it is our hope that Jehovah's Witnesses themselves might read this book and become free of Watch Tower bondage. That hope will be made difficult by the fact that this book has been banned, even before it is published, by the edict of Watch Tower policy.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"It can be demonstrated that the door-to-door ministry is highly inefficient if the goal is to attract converts. For example, statistics from 1986 indicate that it took 3014 hours of service to make one new member! That equates to one Witness working 40 hours a week for 75 weeks to make one convert. The leadership is well aware of this, yet will not consider more efficient methods. Why? Because door-to-door is the best way to sell their literature... The Society continues to hide the huge profit margin they enjoy through the use of volunteer labor in their factories and on the doorsteps of the world.\\" (Pg. 17)\\"A new addition was incorporated into (Charles Taze) Russell's theological stew in 1881 when he extolled the Great Pyramid of Gizeh as 'a miracle in stone,' 'not planned by men but a work of God.' He declared that the pyramid corroborated the Scriptures and that the measurements of the grand gallery confirmed his prophetic dates!\\" (Pg. 29)\\"By incredible manipulations, (Joseph) Rutherford engineered the removal of four of the directors and denigrated the candidacy of the strong contenders for the office.

The mansion was completed in 1930 and the Judge wintered there until his death in 1942... Rutherford rationalized that since San Diego's climate was very similar to that of Palestine, it would be appropriate to build a house there for the soon-to-be-resurrected 'Princes.'\\" (Pg. 45)\\"At about this same time we attended a large Witness gathering... The then vice-president F.W. Franz gave a convoluted discourse which ultimately led to the point of his visit and talk, He asked the audience in a shrill manner, 'Do you know why nothing happened in 1975?' After a rather protracted pause he virtually shouted a reply to his question,'It was because YOU expected something to happen!' He emphasized his point by waving his hand toward the audience in a theatrical style... Naturally, that didn't sit well with us or with most Witnesses.\\" (Pg. 77)\\"(JWs) teach that the gathering of the 144,000 began in the first century and continued through the year 1935. Why 1935? The date was chosen by Rutherford when he realized that the organization was growing and would take in far more than 144,000 people...

After reading it, I would say that this book is good, but - as is typical of collections of this kind - the stories vary a lot in quality.For me, the highlights of the collection were:- Dead Wrong (from the Houston Press) is a quirky, sad piece about a Houston cemetery that doesn't know where it buried people.- Bound By Fear (from Phoenix New Times) is a long piece about polygamy in the Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints. However, since this piece appeared, the polygamy story has received so much attention that the story has lost some of its impact.- Evil Eyes (from the Dallas Observer) examines the case of Coral Eugene Watts, a serial killer scheduled to be released from a Texas prison.- The Last Executioner (from The Village Voice) investigates the 1990 suicide of the last man to work as executioner for the State of New York.- Stalking the Bogeyman (from Westword) covers a rape victim's attempts to confront - and come to terms with - the man who assaulted him as a child.

Of course there will be some stuff people don't like, but I would urge anyone to give it a go."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Over the years of D+D playing, 15 of them to be precise, I have seen so many useless variants, seen some unimaginative stuff that any competent DM should be able to make up by them selves, and basically been unimpressed by the WotC's handling of the greates RPG of all time.I remember protesting when WotC bought the D+D franchise, and effectively ruined it with over priced books. In the end however my players forced me to switch to the new versions, and I wasted to much money on piles of, for lack of a better term, bad books. In the end I just gave in and began to simply take the few little things from each $50 book, and using those, or simply taking their unbablanced classes and feats, and varying them to make them a little more fun, not to mention fair.I found that the best books to buy were the paper back books, like Tome and Blood, or Sword and FIst, they often had better material, and always cost less. This book I found sitting on a shelf one day,and found that all the best things from my favorite paper back books were in hear, along with a whole bunch of old stuff from v.2, and a fair amount of good new stuff. Basically this book is a fail safe. It has the best variants I have ever seen, even if they aren't new. The new ones are often even better than the old ones.There are no prestige classes, except for some new base class variants, but you won't notice, this book is simply to good. I have spent hundreds of dollars on useless D+D books, this is not one of them. Buy it."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"While most of the material in this book is available elsewhere, it's always much nicer to have it in a hardbound book. I think that the most important aspect of this book is not its contents in and of themselves. Rather, I think this book is useful because it inspires those who are new to the game to realize that the rules can be tweaked to suit their own worlds or play styles. Any seasoned veteran DM and his crew of players have their own rules as well as their preference for variants. I think this book is a good medium for conveying that aspect of play to new gamers. That being said, I never would have bought this book at full cost. It's not worth it. I got it here on Amazon in the used section (it was new) for 9 buck, which isn't bad at all."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"It is just a compendium of alternate rules/house rules/ect., but it is a very good one. I went through it and found more useful rules in this book than in any other book I've found, so far. Not everything will be for everyone, but that's the nature and purpose of this kind of book - present the reader with options and ideas, lots and lots and lots of options. Everything from alternative magic rules: a spell point system, incantations that anyone, even non-spellcasters can cast...but at a price, new ways of thinking about classes, racial bloodlines so that your character can have some giant blood, or troll blood in his ancestry. Just about anything else you can think of.

In the process of plagarizing alternative &quot;house rules,&quot; they broke just about every damned one of them. I read the bad reviews, but didn't listen. Do yourself a favor, save your $35 bucks and make up your own damend rules if you have issues with the core-rules. It could NOT POSSIBLY turn out worse than this book. Not one original idea. I'm starting to wonder whether WotC has chased off their best tallent. I mean, come on! These guys previous claims to fame were the Dragonomicon, the Hero Builder's Guide and Arms and Equipment? Rich Redman is the only one of these HACKS who has produced anything worthy of publication. Where the hell is Monte Cook when you need him?

Perhaps the Hit-or-Miss quality of the text, though, is derived not so much from poor conception or execution, but rather from the opposite; after all, this text attempts to collect some of the more interesting \\"house rules\\" variants out there, and by definition, different variants would seem to appeal to different gamer-geeks.Cool Things:--sections on \\"reducing level adjustments\\" (buying off LA with XP later on) and \\"bloodlines\\" (adding a touch of bizarre ancestry to a PC) are well thought out.--in terms of class variants, some of the wizards are decent, but the paladin (i.e. of any alignment) really shines.--the \\"character traits\\" (personal quirks added at generation, a la *Fallout*) and \\"character flaws\\" (taking penalties at generation to add bonus feats, a la White Wolf) are long overdue to this system; the \\"spelltouched feats\\" (adding event-specific magical abilities) are also fertile.--the \\"defense bonus\\" variant (a level-contingent statistic like attack bonus), \\"armor as damage reduction\\" (self-explanatory?), and \\"damage conversion\\" (armor changes lethal damage to non-lethal) are all great; the \\"variable modifiers\\" variant (instead of BAB +4, say, one would instead add d8 to the standard d20 roll) is also smart.--many of the magic variants are useful, such as \\"summon monster variants\\" (individualized or themed lists), \\"metamagic components\\" (such feats have costs in this case), \\"item familiars\\" (why not? there's tons of intelligent constructs otherwise), and \\"incantations\\" (complex magickes that can be cast by anyone).--the final section, about campaigns, really delivers; here, we get rules for \\"contacts\\" (a la White Wolf), \\"Reputation\\" (yeah, like in *Baldur's Gate*), \\"Honor\\" (which would seem to be self-explanatory), \\"Taint\\" (evil corrupts, after all), and \\"sanity\\" (yes, that nearly perfect stat from *Call of Cthulhu*).Holistically, the text displays the same sub-par attention to editing as other WotC releases, and the artwork varies considerably in quality (compare the \\"Paladin of Tyranny\\" on 53 to the gamer-geek group on 134, for instance). I tend to consider the rest of the text uninteresting for my purposes, though others will surely, and with good reason, find such items useful. And that diversity is precisely the value of the text overall. (It is fair to note in this connection that nothing is particularly badly done, though the \\"racial paragon classes\\" are a bit too ubermenschy for my political taste--the game already suffers from a tolkienesque proto-fascistic racialism as it stands; no need to make it even more arriere garde.) The text might be a bit pricey, however, if one ends up using merely one third of the rules contained herein. That said, I'd note that the rules for sanity alone justify the (reduced amazon.com) expense for me."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I'll agree with a few other reviewers that the price can seem high, and much of the content is available elsewhere. However, if you're no longer a HS/university student long on time, short on money, I think the book is well worth it. With a personal life, career, family and home, I don't have the time I used to have, so having this nice little compilation of options (some are very similar to ones already in use by my group) is worth the $20some I spent on it. I'd rather spend my precious free time creating a good adventure for my players than on creating optional systems for everything, and that also goes for scouring the web and bookshelves for the tweaks and options in this one book. It's like going to Jiffy Lube; sure I can change my own oil, but for $20 I'll go across the street and hit the bank, get a coffee and otherwise enjoy my free time while they handle it :)I'm sure someone will flame me for being lazy or uncreative, but hey, my time, my money, my game. But if you're like me and struggle to find the time to do the big stuff (adventures, plots, maps, NPCs, backstory) as it is, this book is likely going to work for you."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"- First: Don't buy at full price. Some Amazon marketplace sellers are selling this as low as $9. I was expecting disappointment based on the low-balled price, but I was wrong!- Second: Don't confuse this with TSR AD&D; 1st Ed Unearthed Arcana or Sword & Sorcery Arcana Unearthed. Both cool books.- Third: Don't read the Amazon description. It makes you think this book is all about strongholds for some reason...- A minor annoyance is that WOTC already have a DMG2 released and a Player's Handbook 2 planned, and the material herein would be better placed/organized into a larger 500+ page Player's Handbook and larger 500+ page DMG respectively or just merge all these things entirely. Monte Cook did it with a huge Arcana Evolved. Why can't WOTC do this? Why all the individual books (this one is barely 200+ pages)? It's stupid to flip through 100 different books to see all the different classes and races available, make 1 race book, 1 class book and so on...Everyone else is doing it (Moongoose, Green Ronin) but WOTC. I think Hasbro has enough money.- Its variants, house rules, and draws from a variety of sources and influences old and new as others have suggested. You have race variants (desert elf, aquatic gnome, etc. not terribly exciting), class variants (new paladins, etc., cool), Gestalt classes vs. multi-classes (nice), many \\"Bloodline\\" race-types (a succubus mates with a human creating a human with some demon bonuses - very interesting), Character traits and flaws, item familiars (very cool), insanity (which goes back to the original AD&D; DMG 1st Ed), Rep and Honor (goes back to original AD&D; Oriental Adventures 1st ED), Spell points instead of Spell memorization (fire and forget method) (many people use this spell pt house rule), the racial Paragon (sort of like a Prestige Race). On and on. Very neat stuff...Criticism that this book has contradictory rules or not-well-thought-out cohesiveness is missing the point. I like this book more than the regular DMG or PHB."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Unearthed Arcana opens with these words and no phrase has ever been more appropriate. This is not a standard core rule book, where the DM can just say yay or nay on whether or not they're using the material. Unearthed Arcana is not even trying to be that kind of book. Unearthed Arcana is a collection of dozens (hundreds, if you count like a marketer) optional rules, many of which conflict with one another. This book has something for everybody and everything for nobody.If you buy this book thinking your getting another normal core rule book, you're probably not going to like it. If you buy this book hoping to find individual rules to liven your campaign, you'll probably like it very much.Chapter 1 contains racial rules. These rules are the most niche oriented of the book. For instance, the first section involves environmental racial variants (like desert elves). Honestly, I don't think I'll ever use these unless I do an extremely theme oriented campaign (like a home grown Dark Sun). This is followed by elemental variants, which are even more niche-like (air elves). Then come bloodlines, which are fairly interesting, if you allow this sort of thing. Bloodlines allow you to introduce racial traits without saying a character is half something. If great great grandmama had strange thing for minotaurs or demons, these rules can help your character reflect that (and give the family something not to talk about). Finally, this chapter finishes with what most will think is its most useful section, the racial paragons. These are three-level prestige classes which grant bonuses that emulate the most stereotypical traits of a race (Stonecutting and constitution for dwarves, for example).Chapter 2 is all about the classes. This starts with variant classes, which are your base classes, tweaked somewhat. For instance, the cloistered cleric is a variant class that drops some of the cleric abilities (it lowers the hit die, for instance) to grant such abilities as Lore and the Knowledge domain. These are actually quite interesting. This is followed by an extensive section on variant specialist wizards and then rules for spontaneous divine casters then variant rules for various class abilities, such as turning undead and the barbarian's rage. Next is the prestige class section, but in this section, they take three base classes (Bard, Paladin and Ranger) and they present them as prestige classes. This will be particularly handy for games where, for instance, a person must petition to a holy order to become a paladin. Next come Gestalt characters, which are essentially characters that have two classes at once (as opposed to multi-classing) for games where there aren't enough players to cover all the class bases (are you starting to see why no one can use all these rules at once?). Finally come the generic classes, which are a way to step away from all the class complexity and get down to four very basic choices.Wow. Seems like a lot doesn't it. We just finished page 78.Chapter 3 is building characters, and no, this doesn't have the old Unearthed Arcana's stat rolling system. It starts with alterative skill systems and rules for complex skill checks. Then it moves onto character traits (which are like advantages in other games). Next comes . . . you guessed it . . . character flaws. Next come spelltouched feats for those characters that have had a lot of exposure to certain spells. This is followed by rules for grouping weapons by type for the sake of weapon group proficiencies. Next comes a set of alternate rules for crafting items (magical or otherwise) during campaign down time. Finally comes background rules, for representing skills a character had before becoming an adventurer.Is your head spinning yet? Mine is.Next comes Chapter 4: Adventuring. This is where things really start contradicting themselves. It starts with class defense bonuses, like in Star Wars, and moves into armor Damage Reduction. Then it moves into rules for having armor convert damage instead of stopping it outright. Then it moves into an injury system that negates the use of hit points completely. But wait. Then it bring hit points back in the form of vitality and wound damage (like in Star Wars again). Next it goes back to the original hit point system, but allows for a character to have \\"reserve points\\" which essentially allow them to heal very quickly. Then it moves on to alternate rules for massive damage while throwing out a rule for dodging when it isn't your turn (a page layout nonsequitur). Next come new death or dying rules (which look a lot like the rules for dying in the vitality points section, but we're back to hit points, now, remember?) Then we move on to action points, which characters can spend during a game to help save their proverbial bacon. Next comes combat facing rules (which I've been waiting for forever) with some extremely ineffective luck rules thrown in a sidebar. But wait! Maybe you're an old GURPS player. We better throw in hex rules as well. Speaking of GURPS, who cares if this is D20. Let's take out the d20 from the game and have the player's roll 3d6s instead. Speaking of that, lets have the players roll all the dice, taking the load off the DM. And, and, and . . .Oh. I guess that chapter ends there.On to Chapter 5, because we've barely even touched . . . Magic. Lets start with rules that give a character a magic ratting, based on all their multiclassing, instead of a straight spellcaster level. Hey, rogues pick up stuff about magic too. Then lets introduce the concept of themed summoning lists, because it's always embarrassing the summon an amphibian on the lip of an active volcano. While we're at it, let's let characters throw money at the problem of metamagicked spells instead of increasing the spell slots (and drop in a rule about metamagic and sorcerers while we're at it). Wait! That reminds us. We have all these new possible spontaneous casters now. Lets put in metamagic rules for them and a second optional rules for sorcerers, to boot. Speaking of spontaneous casting. How about spell points? A lot of people play Rolemaster, don't they? Speaking of that, lets have characters recharge between spells, eliminating the hard cap on spells per day entirely. You know, I've stopped mentioning the side bars completely now. Still, I have momentum, so lets move on to legendary weapons, which increase in power with the character (new prestige classes in here). You know, that sounds kinda like a familiar, so lets throw in familiars that are items. Now let's shift gears and throw in rules for ritual magic (we'll call them incantations). Since we've now brought magic into the hands of even nonspellcasters, lets finish up with . . .. . . .Chapter 6: Campaigns.In case we hadn't, you know, done enough to shake up your game.Let's start with new rules for contacts, but contacts need to have opinions of the characters, so we'll move onto reputation rules. Hey, didn't reputation first come from Oriental Adventures? Yeah, let's throw in honor too. You know with honor comes the opposite, so we should have taint rules as well and if we're going to have tainted characters we'll need, you guessed it, tainted prestige classes. Wow. I'm starting to lose it here. I think we need rules for sanity! That was a little much, so we'll change tracks again, this time attacking the concept of prerequisites. How do you know if a character has the toughness feat? Let's base prerequisites on tests instead. While we're breaking free of molds, how about XP awards that aren't based on level? That sounds good so lets turn the page to . . .. . . the afterword? Are we done already? I'm barely even started.I don't know if you became as exhausted reading this as I did writing it, but now you should have some idea what's in store in Unearthed Arcana. Some of these rules are very good. Some of them are stupid. I doubt anyone will completely agree on which are which, and I think that was their attention. The biggest thing to keep in mind is to watch how these rules interact. For instance, if you use vitality points or the death and dying rules, character death is based on fortitude saves, so you best make sure your rules keep those from getting out of control. If you have one gestalt character you better have everyone play gestalt characters. Also, don't try to integrate rules which oppose one another too greatly, like the injury rules and vitality points, unless you want to play with real world insanity as well.The biggest drawback of this book is you're going to waste money. No one can use more than half of these rules at a time without verging on the ridiculous, so unless you have an extremely high turnover on campaigns, it will take years to use the whole book. Meanwhile, you're paying for development, paper and color ink that you're not using. But If that doesn't bother you, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Ok, its time to start a new campaign and I've played everything there is to play (aside from the myriad of prestige classes that don't interest me). What am I going to play you ask yourself for hours. If you have ever had this problem, like me, probably because you've been playing D&D; for far too long, this book is your savior, plain and simple.Back in second edition there was a game called Player's Option, if you recall, and it gave you a good deal of freedom to customize your character. This book goes well beyond that. Its actually quite interesting. There are little tweaks for all sorts of races due to climate or elementally based races. Follow this up with a lot of variants for classes which are basically swapping a few things in and out in most cases, sometimes losing a trait from one class and gaining another, while some are new. In my opinion, this adds a lot more depth to the game because if you do want to play one of the 10,000 prestige classes, it gives you more than one avenue to get to them. If you do not like prestige classes, then this gives you more options than the dozen or so base classes that currently exist. I would particularly recommend this if you're fond of playing Specialist Wizards (in which case this is a MUST), Barbarians, Monks, or have ever wanted to see a quality representation of an \\"Anti-paladin.\\" This may be the section of the book you most commonly use, and that would be mostly at character creation.There are some feats, which are so-so on the usefulness scale but are just so very interesting and characterful. Then, traits to make your character more attuned to how you envision his personality, and flaws to give him special vulnerabilities (and of course there is a benefit to them as well). Its an interesting section to say the least but after that you get into some very wild and, indeed, very fun options, including a variant on weapon proficiency based on weapon groups, variants on armor systems, D&D; without levels, and even D&D; without hit-points. All I can say is, despite how crazy that sounds, someone obviously put a good deal of thought into it since it is at least mostly viable.Basically, if you're bored with D&D; sometimes, this book is curry powder. It would DEFINITELY spice things up again."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Let me start out by saying: this was a great book. I'm really glad WotC decided to publish it.The book cut up into 6 main parts:Races. This section was pretty well done. It offeres subraces for most of the standard PHB races for different environments and even some examples of planar-bases races (such as the Fire elf or the Water halfling). They also introduce a system that essentially lets you play creatures with a LA from ECL 1 on. There are a fair number of Bloodlines in this chapter, covering everything from the Doppleganger to the Dragons. What I think is particulary nice about the bloodlines is that there are varrying strengths (so a character with a celestial for a grandfather and another with a celestial for a great great great great grandfather arn't necesarily gonna have the same signs).Classes. Variants galore. There is so much awesome stuff packed in this (relatively short) chapter that I just couldn't do it justice here. Every core class is covered, and many posible class feature changes are printed as well. And yes, there *are* Prestige Class versions of the Bard, Ranger, and Paladin (as well as a Chaotic Good paladin!). But really, you'd have to read this yourself to get the whole picture.Characters. The [Spelltouched] feat is introduced (essentially, you can take a feat to gain powers related to a spell that has been cast on you at some point), as are different skill systems (and an entierly new system for Craft). Traits (little feat-like abilities that are taken primarily at 1st level and offer a roughly equal positive and negative bonuses) and Flaws (major negatives that you can take in exchange for an extra feat at first level) are in this chapter, and a new system for weapon proficiancy (weapon groups) is also here. At the end of it are a bunch of tables that you can roll for inspiration about your character's background.Adventuring. There are a boatload of varient rules here, some about armor (one system has Armor provide less AC in exchange for some DR; another has armor convert lethal damage into nonlethal; and yet another provides a system of a level-based Defense bonus, reminiscent of d20 Modern, as is much of this charpter. Example: Action Points). There are roughly 4 Alternate Hit Point systems, some better fitted for low magic campaigns than standard DnD. There's even a section about Combat Facing, although personally I think that's much more complicated than necessary.Magic. Like the Classes chapter, this section is so good that it's probably wisest just to see it for yourself. Spell Points (See: Psionics), Legendary Weapons, Summon Mosnter variants, Item Familiars, a long list of components for spells that you can use to give them metamagics without increaseing their spell slot level, and even Incantations can be found in this chapter.Campaigns. This section is probably most interesting to DMs since the majority of it is a major component to add to a campaign. Short list: Reputation, Honor Points (in both numerical and immaterial form), a Taint system (far too complicated to go into here. Basically, you becomes physically corrupted and gain power therefrom), Sanity system (very well thought out, highly comprehensive. Will fit great in any campaign with a \\"dark\\" feeling. Talk to your players before institution this because it can radically change the way they have to play), Test-Based Prerequisites (to get into PrCs. Example: the Shadowdancer must dance well enough to impress a judge and then sucessfully escape the theatre from several dozen gaurds without directly attacking them), and a simpler way of awarding XP.The book ends with a few pages discussing possible extraplanar varaints, and then gives a few pages that list the variants offered in the book (the idea is that the DM photocopies these pages off and check-marks the things he will be useing so the players know what's pre-approved and what will be left out).All in all, an excellent book that I suggest every DnD group buys."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Most of the material available in UA is available in other places, either in free Net material or in material already published in other supplements, albeit changed to fit D&amp;D3.5 and in one convenient place.But the sticker shock alone for such a thin book should scare most people off.What we have here is a collection of &quot;House Rules&quot; from a variety of campaigns. Some of them you will find useful, others not so -- everyone's tastes differ, so what one person likes, others will loath. One of the greatest problems I find is that the impact of many of the rules are not well thought out. A prime example of this is the Vitality/Wound Points system (available as a free sample at the Wizards of the Coast site). First of all, despite the promise of &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot;, this is not at all the case -- a character may be reduced to 0 Wounds (never below this point), at which point you make rolls to /see/ if you are /dying/. Nope, not dead, just potentially dying. Equally, the W/VP rules make absolutely no reference to magic at all except in terms of healing. Does this mean that magic never does Wound damage? That it does it to a smaller extent? If it can effect Wounds, is there a new limitation on how many dice may be rolled for a fireball or magic missile? Many unanswered questions abound. Conversely there is also a long discussion of Hexes vs. Squares for battle boards. But why? Is it so difficult to figure out the conversion of one set of space indicators to another? Here authors go overboard with examples on something that is terribly simple to explain. Then there are the Paragon Classes which are, to say generously, /borrowed/ from Monte Cooks &quot;Arcana Unearthed&quot;, but with the odd twist that you can be the Paragon of Half-Orcs or Half-Elves. How does one become the Best of the Bloodline of a mixed bloodline? This makes neither logical nor internal game sense.Overall, like most of the 3.5 retool, I find the product overpriced, overhyped, and half-baked. The print quality is good, the editing about on par with most gamebooks (a few glaring errors, but not as many as something from Mongoose), and the illos the standard mix of very good (insane wizard on p199) to vastly mediocre (human of brass dragon lineage on p22) to unintentionally comical (ambush on p212) to plain awful (decorated soldier on p183).Is it worth it?Depends on what you need. If you are a completist, yes. If you have no other source for ideas or are desperate to fit into a convetions rules, yes. If you have access to the internet and can surf through a few D&amp;D sites, probably not -- you'll gain all of this material for free if you just look around a bit."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I admit it.

Reading trough, one wonders if it is humanly possible to find time to use and apreciate all the options found within.

Don't listen to the people who say its useless, this is an awesome book with all sorts of variants, tips for character building, and prestiege classes. There are many tips for specialized wizards. For you DM's out there, there's rules about insanity, drug addiction, and mental disorders for when you get pissed off at your players. There's also some interesting variants for running campaigns if you don't like some of the things in the DM's guide. Personally I liked the \\"Recharge Magic\\" section. It is a cure for the wizard not being able to cast spontaneously , while still keeping his wide selection of spells. For those bored with the common races there are plenty of different races, such as desert elf and paragon dwarf. With 9 pages of nothing but metamagic components(for more powerful spell abillities)its hard to ignore I think this book is a must have for all spellcasters and DMs alike.With so many variants its hard not to love the book."},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Unearthed Arcana is all about variants. It does not really create anything new, and it \\"borrows\\" from other games, but that's a feature, not a mistake. I really enjoyed the variant spellcasters, racial paragons, flaws (un-feats), and taint. The section on mental illness had bits that were just a little too realistic for my taste. While I can't imagine working paraphilias or bulemia into a campaign, using a fantasied-up psychosis as a symptom of taint has potential.Overall, I definitely liked it."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"This book sold well in its German original, but I'm not sure why. It meanders and never gets to the point. Perhaps the writer meant to be impressionistic, but doesn't have the skill to really pull that off. Perhaps it was too literally translated, but I don't think that was the real problem. The translator seems to do well enough with the material he was presented with, even providing some explanatory footnotes for historical terms and aspects of life in the former GDR. And his translator's essay at the end of the book is superior to Hensel's jottings. I doubt Hensel is the right person to provide an interesting reminiscense of growing up in East Germany, or life since then. My suspicion is that this is a book by the kind of individual who gets by regardless of the kind of country they find themselves living in. For a far more sympathetic and sensitive look at the same theme, try the film \\"Goodbye, Lenin\\". This book already has a huge number of used copies available, and there's a reason for that."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"After the Wall is an interesting account by a young woman who moved from being an East German to being a German, when the Wall came down.

I was hoping it would be a more detailed account of life before and after the reunification. Instead the author just rambles on and on, without really saying much of anything.

So she robbed me (among others) the experience of a childhood in the GDR, German Democratic Republic, \\"Wuppertal\\" should be \\"West-Germany\\" (American sector), the isle of Ruegen became Russian sector, behind the \\"Iron Curtain\\". So I did not learn anything about \\"Young Pioneer meetings\\", socialism, communism, STASI (the secret police) or summer camps of young \\"Pioneers\\". In the Western hemisphere I grew up, drinking Pepsi Coke, receiving American Care packages, later on: listened to the Beatles, noticed the students movement in 1968, had no Ulbrich or Honecker, but chancellor Willy Brandt and Helmut Kohl. But I tried to find out the place, where the woman could live, who had born me in that dark year 1945. After 40 years of persistent search, 1985, before the Berlin Wall fell (1989), I found out: She was living behind the \\"Iron Curtain\\" on the isle of Ruegen. And I started to look at this lost childhood, which I did not enjoy: She showed me her photo album: summer beach near \\"Kap Arkona\\" at the north-point of the isle, snowy winters on Hiddensee, flight ducks, cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks. Color films (Orwo), books, Trabi substitute parts: only hard to get. Nevertheless, I wanted to make up for my life in the GDR - in 1990 when the Berlin Wall was fallen: A schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor, filled with former Stasi employees (security police) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb \\"cadre conversation\\", he unfortunately (thanks to the \\"reunification\\" of East and West-Germany) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now (in hastiest kind). I should return please to West-Germany, where I just had come from. The direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically, out of character, and not recommendable. No \\"Ossi\\" (vs. \\"Wessi\\") - no job. As a result my mother, noticing, that all her dreams collapsed, joined an acute epidemic disease at that time: She committed a so-called balance sheets suicide. I was deprived of the chance to become a \\"zone child\\" a second time. Did I miss really much? Because the book of Jana Hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic \\"Ossi\\" writings (of course very different to my \\"Wessi\\"-point of view) are not as superficial, simple, banal, as I thought in the first moment? Compare her point of view ..."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"The book is written as an extended essay. There is very little observation of actual events. The author's account of life in the GDR lacks realism and is really quite shallow."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"Jana Hensel was born in 1976 in what was then the German Democratic Republic. Her childhood was filled with Young Pioneer meetings, clubs, school, recycling, swearing allegiance to world socialism and summer camp. But there was a dark side to all this. As Hensel writes, \\" . . . to avoid being denounced to the secret police, you also had to watch what you said to whom. You had to really trust your friends.\\" Hensel's parents protected her from the government man who came around offering sports scholarships to girls who wound up with \\"man sized shoulders and physiques.\\" There was a constant hunt for stylish clothes, Western food, and appropriate Christmas gifts.In 1990, a year after the fall of the Wall, the GDR came to an end. Hensel would spend her high school years in the same place, but in a different country. Her generation was able to adjust by learning West German slang, figuring out which clothes to wear, and understanding that the television shows and other artifacts of her childhood were gone. Hensel's parents' generation, however, did not adjust as well. They weren't just losing comic books, they were losing their jobs: the new owners of former-GDR factories shut them down and many teachers and other civil servants were forced out. These middle-aged people who had spent their lives under socialism could not easily adjust to the change to a market economy.Hensel's experience is similar to those of immigrants to a different country, where the children adapt to the new culture more easily and wind up interpreting it for their parents. And, like some immigrants, Hensel's generation of GDR children wound up both more confident than their parents (\\"We felt like monarchs, founding a new kingdom on the ruins of the old\\") and protective of them. The rub is that these \\"immigrant\\" parents are German, speak German fluently, and haven't moved an inch.This is the third personal memoir of life inside the GDR that I've read, and the only one to describe a childhood in East Germany from 1976 until the fall of the Wall. Hensel has no axe to grind, and no need to justify the GDR or its policies. She was not a communist. She did not voluntarily emmigrate to the GDR -- she was born there. The book is thus neither \\"Ostalgie\\" (nostalgia for the East) nor specifically anti-GDR. It is just an accurate and interesting description of life before and after the wall.I have not been able to find a memoir of life in the GDR written by someone in Hensel's parents' generation (probably born in the late 1940s or early 1950s.) It would be interesting to read the story told from the perspective of one who was born in the GDR and lived in it through middle age. However, I can recommend other memoirs of life in East Germany: \\"Twelve Years\\" by Joel Agee, who lived as a child in East Germany from 1948 to 1960; and \\"Crossing the River,\\" by Victor Grossman, an American Communist who, as a soldier stationed in West Germany, fled to the GDR in 1952 and still lives in eastern Berlin."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"Whereas one of the previous reviewers may not have \\"gotten\\" this book, I did. I visited East Germany right after the fall of the wall, and then five years later. What a change there was. Not only could you tell the difference on the outside, but the people changed too. Hensel writes about these changes and how it affected her. Then she relates how it affected the older generations. Hensel is a little flip, but maybe she has a right to be. There were big changes, and the young adapt to change. Older people do not. This is a story about one young lady changing to the new landscape. East Germany no longer exists physically, but does emotionally in millions of Germans.This is a nice read for those interested in Germany. I found myself laughing at some of Hensel comments. I can relate how she experienced life."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"I recently spent 2 1/2 months in the former GDR working at a university. My trip was a great experience and I was really struck by the historical remnants and stories of those that had grown up and moved into the former GDR after the fall of the wall. When the wall fell I was only 9 years old and many of my friends there were in my age range and we had few memories of this time. Jana Hensel's book provided me with an in-depth understanding of what life was like for my friends and their siblings during the reunification. It was interesting to hear stories of her childhood that were similar to my friend's stories.\\"After the Wall\\" was fabulous and a must-read for those interested in the real-life of former East Germans."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"After the Wall depicts the real life impact of West German materialism on the people of the GDR. The younger generations adapted but as a consequence they lost their historical identities. The older generations of the GDR were simply overwhelmed. Although the intense focus on 'things' makes the reading a little repetitive and annoying at times, that just reinforces the fact that western/capitalist materialism is such a powerful force. This book offers unique insights into life in the GDR, capitalism, socialism, identity, and history. It's worth a read."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"This book is beautiful.Having briefly visited East Berlin in 1959, I was impressed with its cleanliness and dullness in contrast to the chaos, colour, mess and joy of life in West Berlin. Hensel explains the difference with skill and personal example: East Germany, the most successful and prosperous of the Soviet satellites, was a collection of industrious, intelligent and obedient ants.In many ways, her life until the collapse of \\"The Wall\\" was marvelous, packed with activities, programs, events and adults intended to uplift, enlighten and motivate youngsters to do good for others. The frightening aspect of her life was the unrelenting pressure to support these organizations to do good for others. East Germany was a cult without charisma, a ritual without religion in a minutely organized system designed to eliminate every element of chaos from the otherwise free human spirit.She is acutely aware of her parents' and grandparents' generations who lived a rigidly controlled life for almost 60 years, during which even so much as smiling at the wrong event would bring suspicion and possible punishment. When very young, Hensel knew it was dangerous to pick up a discarded Western chocolate bar wrapper from the street; but, she also knew the pure joy of such rebellion. As a teen, she suddenly plunged into a free lifestyle in which almost everything was possible and nothing was unlikely.This is a beautiful portrait of her astonishment at the democratic freedom -- much the same sense of astonishment I feel, having lived all my life in the luxury of such freedom -- the chaos and pure joy of \\"leaving people alone\\". In today's politics, too many talk about creating an inspiring sense of purpose for their country; Hensel deftly and with chilling starkness portrays the cost of such enforced \\"purpose\\", and the wondrous freedom and peace of mind that comes from respecting the rights of others.The happiness of Americans is the ability to celebrate or condemn their consumer culture without restraint; this book is a warm, human and personal memoir of what it is to not have such freedom. This book is everything anyone could want in a good book; it's well written, concise, poignant and utterly relevant to American society and the world at large.Thank you, Jana Hensel, for a marvelous explanation of what I saw in Berlin almost 50 years ago but didn't fully understand until now."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"This book definitely provided an interesting view of life after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is typical in the west to think about what the world gained by the fall of the wall...progress is an important part of the way we view the world in the United States. Rarely do we stop to think about what was lost...this book provides an opportunity to reflect on that."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"I was very interested in reading this book after visiting Berlin last year and noticing that this author is close to my own age. I was looking forward to either a colorful description of what her personal life was like both before and after the fall of the Wall or a reasonably detailed discussion about the experiences of her generation at large. In fact, she tries to tackle both storylines--her family's and her generation's--and she doesn't succeed very well at either one. Maybe I was expecting too much from such a slim book, but I felt shortchanged, like she skates neatly over the surface of everything and fails to provide memorable anecdotes, details, or even evidence.Her anecdotes about her life as a child in East Germany aren't compelling. She recalls the organizations she belonged to, sports she participated in, magazines she read, and schools she attended, and a handful of the memories she relays are mildly interesting, but overall her storytelling is lackluster and disappointing. Unfortunately, her accounts of her life post-Wall were equally flat and unenlightening. She did write with interesting perspective about what a complicated relationship she has with her parents because of the gulf between her life experiences and opportunities and theirs. Although it seemed a little insulting to her parents, I give her credit for her candor, and if she had approached other aspects of this book as forthrightly, maybe it would have improved her story.Probably the worst aspect of the book, though, is her attempt to assume the voice of her generation. The author is a journalist, and I'm kind of shocked that she makes so many assertions with no supporting hard evidence, even when it is readily available. One of her primary arguments is that people her age from the former East Germany still struggle to compete with their peers from the former West Germany. She offers no data to support her point. It would have been interesting to hear about whether their incomes lag, their unemployment rates are higher, or their university or secondary school graduation rates are lower than their peers, for instance. I'm not saying she should have stuffed the book with statistics--that's for a different kind of book--but it really felt like she didn't even try to do her homework. A few well-selected points could have done much to help her readers better understand the nature and scope of the problem she's describing. Instead, this whole facet of the book is nothing more than a bunch of squishy generalizations, assertions, and unsubstantiated conclusions. It reads like a college student's term paper written hastily at the deadline, when the student ran out of time to gather research but was determined to reach the requisite number of pages by resorting to off-the-cuff pontificating. It's amateurish.I really wanted to like this book and this author, but I just couldn't. I didn't like that she recalled with no remorse the fact that she and her friends shoplifted frequently as adolescents. Her references to her parents are terribly condescending and must have been exceedingly hurtful to them. Her writing makes her seem humorless, apathetic, materialistic, and irritatingly self-absorbed. She clearly takes herself very, very seriously (much more seriously than she takes her audience, for that matter), and that makes it hard to like and empathize with her. If it hadn't been such a quick read, I wouldn't have stuck it out. A few months ago, I read Stasiland by Anna Funder, which was absolutely fascinating. If you're looking for insights into the lives of East Germans and their government, that book is definitely the one to choose, especially when compared to After the Wall."},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"For those who visited East Berlin before and after the wall and who have German friends, this book provides a very interesting insight"},{"Title":"After The Wall","review":"Interesting expose on the 'sandwich' generation squeezed between two different worlds within the same country.

Forty years ago both my wife and I ran across this book as we were taking wearisome ed courses in teachers college to acquire certification to teach in New York public schools. Our professors did not like Barzun then, and I am sure they don't like him today. He is down-to-earth, full of common sense, and brilliantly lucid. This was our handbook, along with Gilbert Highet's The Art of Teaching, which they didn't like either. Everything we heard in those classes was shown to be false after we began teaching, but Barzun's observations were unfailingly accurate. Any teacher who goes by this book cannot utterly fail, even in this ridiculous system which has persecuted American children for a half century."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"Barzun's book provides a sounding of education in America. He measures what is right and wrong and he always comes out for the students, making the best of their minds and goals.Although a few chapters have become either outdated or in applicable, overall, the analysis of America's public education is bull's eye accurate. Further, what is particularly enjoyable about reading this survey is his mellifluous prose style. He is a fine craftsman of the language and it serves to crystalize his thinking and wisdom.Read this book with a pencil in hand; read it for the many quotable quotes; read it for the perspectives therein; read it for a grounding and a sounding."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"The hardest yet most refreshing part about reading this book is that I am 25. One can easily pick up the urgency in Barzun's words and doubtless he was critiquing the educational modifications of the time- originally published in the 40's. Since that time, every school has become the 'progressive' school that Barzun warns against- A furthering of Deweyan principles of 'It's not learning if it ain't fun' and 'true understanding is in the heart, not the head.' In an effort to make education fun and push students through at all costs, we've lost any sense of the teacher's true goal- to instruct.I should not give the false impression that Barzun is a hard nosed, humorless curmudgeon who would turn back the clock to monotanous recitation and rote-memorization. The truth is that he is somewhere in the middle. Before the job can be done correctly, the teacher needs to gain the students willful attention and her trust. At that point though, the student NEEDS to be challenged- the student will be pushed to learn (yes, memorization may be involved), grades will be imposed and the student will- it's true-come out the better for it.The best part is that while Barzun jabs at administrators and theorists (can't we all relate) he writes with obvious love for teachers and students, always keeping their interests in mind. While Barzun can come off as a sourpuss when poking fun at the circular Ph.D system and standardized testing, he is easily forgiven when discoursing on how and how not to teach mathematics, history, arts, literature, the sciences and writing. I only wish he would've been one of my instructors.The only other thing I can say is that while for teachers, this book is a MUST HAVE, for students (of all ages and abilities) this book is a hidden treasure. Barzun, while giving advice to teachers and administrators, inadvertently (?) gives us tips on how to learn and more saliently, how to think. I'm confident that I will reread this many times throughout my lifetime. Bravo!!!"},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"This is one of those timless books that remain relevent year after year. Originally written in the 40's it remains one of the best commentairies on the American educational system. Absolutely required reading for anyone interested in how are children are taught, or not. This book along with Leon Bostein's recent book &quot;Jeffersons Children&quot; could serve as guidebooks for improving the quality of instruction in todays schools. Both these authors are quite clear about one thing and that is intstruction and/or teaching are one thing, and that education and &quot;educators&quot; are another. Both of them favor the elimination of the Education Departments from colleges and universities. These are both well written books, from two articulate intellects without an agenda other than the quality of instruction in todays schools."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"Mr Barzun has all my admiration. I agree with somebody's words below: \\"down-to-earth, full of common sense, and brilliantly lucid\\", and whatever more you want to add he's got it. But, what he talks about is utopia, ancient history -the way our educational history develops. It just doesn't apply. One can really enjoy reading Mr. Barzun, no matter what he talks about, but in this case, being the contrast between the former state of education and the current one so hurting, I can't take it. It would have been wonderful if his recommendations (candid recommendations) were applicable today, even slightly. But we've gone (Europe&America;) to a point of no return. It would be like taking aspirin against gangrene.His advice is common-sense, though, as I said. But how do you implement common-sense in a non-common-sense society?"},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"Jacques Barzun's TEACHER IN AMERICA is a classic commentary on actual learning as opposed to \\"fun and games\\" in the classroom. He knows what is important in learning and what is cosmetic and false. Barzun not only gives a careful diagnosis of what good teaching and actual learning means, but he is aware that modern \\"methods\\" do not work, and he knows why.Barzun, as other reviewers note, wrote this book in the 1940s when the disasters in public schools were only incubating. He clearly saw what was going to occur as long and teaching and learning are tied to politics. Barzun is clear that the \\"academic bafflegab\\" that passes for expertise is pure nonsense even though it sounds good and popular. Jacques Barzun was not trying to be popular with the educational establishemnt. Yet Barzun's writing style is not harsh or too severe. Barzun writes well and engages his readers in a lucid assessment of what authenic teaching and learning are.One thing that Barzun does is inform the reader that there is a cause-and-effect realtionship between teaching and learning. He does not waste his time nor that of his readers in presenting useless statistics based on phony polls and questionnaires. Rather than relying on useless statistics, Barzun relies on reason and honesty as if truth mattered. This is far removed from the current \\"experts\\" who think phony statistical assessments are somehow a substitute for solid learning and difficult but useful solutions.The chapter titled \\"Getting the Classics off the Shelf\\" is probably the best chapter of the book. Barzun knew what some currently know which is the fact that The Classics have much to teach us. The Classics expose students to excellent writing, reading, and serious thinking. If students are well armed with the ability to read well, think critically, and write coherently, they are prepared to learn so much on their own without the babified pablum offered by teachers of useless \\"education courses.\\"Barzun's book has much more meaning currently than when he first wrote it. The so-called \\"experts\\" think they are going to use childish methods and useless classes to solve problems of mass illiteracy when in fact their programs and babified methods make a bad situation worse. These same \\"experts\\" are the same ones who offered the previous canned nonsense that did not work. Barzun hints at the fact that this is a perpetual problem of failures that no one wants to admit.When current students are told that \\"wellness\\" classes and learing to fill some benefit form or other bureaucratic set of paperwork are more important than actually learning to read well and think, the current disaster needs no explanation. When very didicated teachers are told they are responsible for criminal behavior and teenage pregnancy which are well beyond their control, there is no wonder why young, intelligent teachers vacate the teaching profession. Barzun knew that students had to learn to take their place as adults. Yet, currently teachers are told they must conform to students' bad taste and be sensitive to students' needs. The fact is that students must learn to be sensitive and conform to an adult world. Teenage adolecents need to learn that they must adjust to the adult world and not the other way around. Studying The Classics is a good place to start learning this.While Barzun is in advanced age, his book titled TEACHER IN AMERICA is still useful and relevant. The problems that Barzun alluded to in this book are now complete disasters. Yet, to paraphrase Barzun on page 15, one must not lose faith in the teaching profession."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"Jacques Barzun, as other reviewers note knows about teaching. Broadly, and deeply well read (check out his magnum opus 'Dawn to Decadence', a five hundred year sweep of Western cultural history, Barzun has been a teacher and writer nearly all his life. Mostly at Columbia University. He knows the rewards of teaching, and also the frustrations, such as trying to get young people to focus on things that are almost certainly not their first preference. He is rigorously scholarly, concluding with words justifying the life of the mind in the face of the myriad practical concerns of day to day living.He is an intellectual giant, but a genius teacher too, with the teachers' knack of knowing just how much a learnign mind can bear and how it should be developed.This book, written in the 1940s, should be written by all teachers, at school or university level. Unfortunately it is unlikely that politicians will read it, given their focus on all that is 'measurable' and 'targets', the idea that the value of a lesson can be measured instantly (as Barzun astutely observes, the fruits of a days teaching may not be realised until twenty or thirty years hence)."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"I love reading Barzun, since he always writes as if he has nothing to lose. As a teacher, I found this to be a very enjoyable book, and I appreciate that much of the book can be read as independent essays. I will be sharing some of these with my colleagues. Some of the content is a bit dated (understandably), and perhaps the book is a little longer than it needed to be. Overall, however, Barzun ranks up there with Theodore Dalrymple as someone that I read purely for the well-crafted prose... regardless of whether I agree or not (which, most often, I do)."},{"Title":"Teacher in America","review":"Of course this is an excellent book.

They are different stories, yet it is neat to see how the author has continued to develop some of his earlier ideas and worked them into a greater piece as his skills improve.More specific to this novel, Tailchaser's Song is a wonderful tale of adventure and coming into one's own. The personal ethics expressed in this story are rather unique in the fantasy world. The values are real and are not based on some extrodinary gift of the character (which typically separates the reader from the character), but on a choice and dedication to what is right.Williams does a wonderful job of spinning this tale and keeping interest. Parts of it are predictable, but there are few (if any) let downs. The most impressive feature of the book, and what really makes it stand out, is the perspective. The main character is a cat, and the whole world is cleverly shown through a cat's eyes. It is very believable, and makes you look at your own pet differently -- with more respect, even.This is a great book for anyone who likes adventure or fantasy stories.

A strange darkness has descended upon their Ka (spirit), and the further Tailchaser gets from his home, the more prevalent this sensation becomes, weighing him down. Something terrible is amiss. The cat Gods of long ago may still be battling it out for supremacy. But how is Tailchaser, a little tabby with a small white star on his head, supposed to help out? He has some help from some companions. Pouncequick, a youngling feline, starts the journey with Tailchaser. Pouncequick is an energetic but inexperienced hunting cat. Tailchaser feels him more of a burden (initially) then a benefit. Along the way Tailchaser and Pouncequick pick up Roofshadow, a female feline with more experience in the world then either of them. Now a trio, this band of brethren cats move from unfamiliar territory to unfamiliar territory, searching for clues to all the cats&#65533; disappearance. They soon bump into Eatbugs, a strange cat that speaks incomprehensibly at times. He follows the trio and becomes a &#65533;pain in the tail.&#65533; But nothing, not even Eatbugs irrationality, could&#65533;ve prepared them for The Mound: a horrible underground domain built by one of the Ancient Cat Gods. It is here that Tailchaser and his group of friends find the answers to the disappearing cats. Tailchaser, along with his companions, must foil the plans of Hearteater, one of the firstborn Gods of this cat-ish realm. Hearteater has unleashed a terrible power upon the world with his evil ways and has created the underground world of The Mound to bring light and darkness under his control.An impressive amount of research went into the writing of this novel. Most notably is the cat behavior, cat language (singing, not talking, and High Singing), the movement of the moon and sun across the sky as seen from a felines perspective, and much work on the curious names given to all the characters.Now I&#65533;m not a cat person. I don&#65533;t own one and haven&#65533;t been in a home with one since I was a teenager living with my parents (back in the late 70's and early 80's), but this story didn&#65533;t require that I be so inclined toward cats. It was interesting enough to read the heroes journey, and that kept me turning the pages night after night.So why only 4 stars and not 4-and-a-half or 5? Well, the parallels to Tolkien and other fantasy worlds were smackingly obvious. But Mr. Williams (the author) kept it entertaining enough, and varied enough, to make it a fun read. I think this would be a good gateway book for younger readers who might later want to tackle that magnum opus of a book: The Lord of the Rings.Good Dancing to you all.B+ rating"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song is a philosophic quest that is told in an enchanting way. The requisite battle between light and darkness is there, but there are no straight paths, just a lot of wisdom to gather if you keep your ears perked. I still greet cats with the musical language Tad Williams transcribes for those of us who are a bit too slow to understand cat speech just yet. This is one of my sacred trio of favorite books. As an added bonus, the quotes that introduce each chapter are wonderful as well."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I had to struggle a bit to rate Tailchaser's Song. On the one hand it's a fairly well-written fantasy novel with a likable hero, hefty challenges along the way, and a seriously evil foozle to get rid of. On the flip side the story didn't really grab me and the feline slant on things seemed to merely be a thin veneer on otherwise human characters. Apparently I'm one of the few readers who failed to be captivated by the novel; the previous reviews are for the most part gushing with praise. Different strokes for different folks I guess. Many years ago I read Richard Adams's &quot;Watership Down&quot; and &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;. I have very fond memories of those works and even though I was a teen then, my feeling is that they are far superior to Tailchaser's Song w.r.t. adventure books written from animals' perspectives.There were quite a few delightfully humorous moments. The tales told by the older cats were noteworthy, especially the ones about the origin of man and about the horrific discovery of neutering. Williams did a nice job describing the unlikely and fragile alliance between the cats and squirrels. The sad ending surprised me and added some emotion that was generally lacking throughout the story.Characterization was nothing special but not poor either. I could say the same about the story. The young and inexperienced Fritti Tailchaser sets out to find his missing beloved and along the way encounters a great menace. He sets aside his personal quest to tackle the more noble cause and manages to save the animal world. He doesn't actually do any major fighting, but instead acts as a catalyst for allowing far more powerful forces to take care of the problem. Then he goes back and finishes his personal love quest. Yeah, you've seen variations on these themes before in other novels and movies. Ho hum.Based on other reviews I've got a bunch of Tad Williams's fantasy novels sitting on the bookshelf. I really hope that they're more mature and involving than this one. Tailchaser's Song is a good effort for a first major novel and Williams shows promise. I think it'd be good for young teens. For adults my overall recommendation is to read something else."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I read A LOT of books, and Tailchaser's Song is one of the best books I have ever read. I must have read this book at least a dozen times (no, really!). You don't have to be a cat lover to be enchanted by Williams' best work, but it helps. To me, the sad thing is that most &quot;average&quot; people will pass this book up at first glance because they assume that it's a kiddie fairy-tale type thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am a senior in high school and there are parts in Tailchaser's Song that even startled me the first time I read it. The effect is really enhanced because the story is so intricately woven that the reader is drawn in. You will feel as if you are actually padding along beside Tailchaser as he journeys deep beneath the Earth's crust, and you will find you actually care about what happens to the stories characters... Anyone who is reading this, please read this book! I have loaned my copy out many, many times, and it is always returned to me with a smile (and also a bit of reluctence) and some sort of comment along the lines of &quot;Man, am I ever glad you convinced me to read this!&quot;,&quot; It's even better than you told me!&quot;, and&quot; To think I would have missed out on this if it weren't for you!&quot; You will feel the same way once you read this book. In closing, let me say once more: BUY THIS BOOK!!! If nothing else, check out the price; less than six bucks! You couldn't even get into a movie for that much! And unlike a movie, this is an experience that you will savor over and over again. Don't cheat yourself; order Tailchaser's Song TODAY!!!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I picked up Tailchasre's Song not expecting it to capture my interest, although I am a cat-lover. I was between Warriors Books. When I started reading it, it was amazing to me how much it was like the Warriors, which I LOVE. I'm not finished with it yet but I will be soon. It's so hard to put it down.Tailchaser and young Pouncequick set off on a journey to find Tailchaser's fela(girl cat)friend, Hushpad. Along the way they meet Roofshadow who is also missing some friends. They suspect strange \\"cats\\" with red claws (as Pouncequick put it).Roofshadfow's family and friends were attacked by them yet there were also some cats missing.Roofshadow, Tailchaser and Pouncequick set off into the unknown to try to find their missing friends."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song is one of the best books I have ever read! It creates an entire world, not just a story. It's full of cat folklore, stories, and even some words (there is a glossary in the back). There is action, too, and plenty of it. The descriptions of the Hearteater's underground realm (he's evil) are a bit haunting. You will find yourself not being able to stop reading-I stayed up until 2am reading it the first day I had it :-). It *is* long, and detailed, but not in a boring way. I'd recommend in for fantasy fans of young adult age or older (younger kids will find it too long). However, people who don't like cats, longer books, or fantasy will probably dislike it. &gt;^..^&lt;"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I just read this wonderful book on the heels of Gabriel King's new novel, &quot;The Wild Road&quot;, which I really loved. This one was truly special as well, and there are certainly parallels one can draw between the two. The idea of the quest, the journey from innocence to experience, the coming of age of the main character in each novel-- very well done. The characters themselves were quite completely realized, too--although I think that Gabriel King managed to pull this off a bit better, through the use of really interesting , often humorous dialogue which certainly revealed each individual character. I loved the cat language Tad Williams created, and the way he enables the reader to truly see the world through a cat's sensibilities. (e.g. distance always is referred to in &quot;jumps.&quot;) As with &quot;The Wild Road,&quot; I felt hungry for a sequel to this remarkable book!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book its trully great. It really reels you in, then keeps you moving along at a nice, yet swift pace. You really feel like you're in the story. Also, you know how sometimes when you're reading an animal story, and in the middle you forget that the characters are even animals, they're so human-like? Well, that NEVER happens here. There is so much description and nature-like activity that you'll always remember that the characters are CATS.Summary - Fritti Tailchaser is a young cat who wishes to find his missing friend, Hushpad. Along the way, he meets up with many dangers as he and his friends try and save the world of the cats.One of the only things I found could be edited was the plot itself. Fritti goes on the journey to find his friend, but that mission is almost, like, forgotten in the middle because of the other plot.

The way the languages are spoken is an amazing detail. Everything happens for a reason, and it's never to take up space! When Fritti Tailchaser visited cat hell I felt so bad for the cats. I could almost smell the stench of death on every page, while reading that part. I could feel the premonition that Tailchaser felt, the os (wrongness) of the situation, and the evil creatures. It is amazing how Williams works up a legend and weaves it into this &quot;song&quot; of a young tomcat. This book was incredible, had I been sitting down while reading it I would have been on the edge of my seat. It also has a very unexpected ending. Well, Mri'fa-o (good night)"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Much different from the average Fantasy Tale. It has allthe main components, but all characters are animals. Atfirst this twist was enough to keep it fresh enough toread on, but by 2/3rd through the book this premise worea bit thin and the faults of the storyline began to showthrough.

I thuroughly enjoyed this read and it a great book to pick up for any Tad or cat lover! Think, picking up a group of outdoor cats and dropping them in as the main characters of your favorite fantasy book.I can't suggest Tad's works and especially Tail Chaser's Song enough!- Scott J. Toney"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This cast of feline characters is simply wonderful. Don't think of it as a book just for children, it's overwhelmingly entertaining for adults as well. Tad Williams, in his special unique way, made his characters-- CATS! They speak, behave, and accomplish their goals as any cat would, not furry fuzballs with human attributes. Humans don't belong in this action filled quest to solve a mystery of a missing girl kitty that, our hero, a male cat, is desperate to find. It's a love story as well as a difficult dangerous mission. Can he find her? His gut wrenches with fear of what he might find if he succeeds.

Beautifully realised world with a real insight into the cat mind (in my humble opinion coming from years surrounded by furry sharp beasties), this is a lovely and clever book which I feel deserves more accolades and attention than it receives. It follows the young ginger tom Fritti Tailchaser's adventures, through the dark, light and amorous, with a charming writing style and immersive vision. The names and language of the cats are fabulous, too. It's an easy read without being throwaway, and it stands up to numerous rereadings. Any cat lover will love this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"There are very few books I've reread as many times as &quot;Tailchaser's Song.&quot; The characters could very well be human, and very little would change about the story. However, by focusing the book around cats Williams is able to create a world with very few restrictions based on human perceptions and codes. The settings vary widely, and each one feels real enough to step into, something that I think is lacking in many stories. I believe that readers who complain that the ending is unsatisfying and doesn't resolve enough have not really been paying attention to this book. I was surprised by the ending, but loved it and the way it tied everything together. Many critics like to compare &quot;Tailchaser's Song&quot; to &quot;Watership Down,&quot; but I feel that this is an unfair comparison. &quot;Watership Down&quot; has nowhere near the imaginative flair nor the dreamlike magic of Williams' cat adventure."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Although it has been almost ten years since I first read this book, I have never forgotten it, perhaps because I was only twelve at the time and picked it off the library shelf because I loved fantasy and cats, and the cover-art caught my eye. But there is more to this book than that, and I do not only realize this now. Tailchaser's Song took me to another world, a cat's world, whose different troubles and excitements, challenges and dreams let Williams' story come alive in a way it otherwise might not have. He is a unique and beautiful writer, with a style that is perfectly uited to this type of fairytale story. The characters are wonderfully drawn, the setting is lush and realistic, and the things the story have to teach us, immense. For all this, however, Tailshaser's Song is not a book I would reccomend letting a twelve year-old read; it has extremely dark elements, disturbing scenes and events. Although it was exactly this which I believe makes Williams' story powerful, it is also the reason it stands out it my mind. For adults this very darkness may hinder taking Tailchaser's Song seriously, and so it seems I am advocating it for the pre-teen crowd, but only those who will appreciate its value."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Loved it! I had such a fun time reading this book that I was at the end before I even relized it!

Thank you so much.Lola Korowicki"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I bought this book on a whim shortly after it was published back in 1985; I wasn't looking for it particularly, just saw it on a Waldenbooks shelf and thought it might be a mildly entertaining read for a fantasy-and-animal-lover like myself (3 cats and one dog presently). I was amazed at the depth of material presented - the \\"Folk\\"lore, the cat language, the Tolkien-like tale of the timid, reluctant hero whose actions are the catalyst for saving his world. I read it with avid interest then; and now, a couple of decades later, I have just finished re-reading it. It's held up well in the intervening years - I found myself just as captivated by the tale as I was then (even though I knew the ending!) Don't be afraid to buy this book - little Fritti Tailchaser and his band of companions will not only hold your interest, they'll hold your heart. I was in my late twenties when I first read the adventures of the Folk; now, in my late forties, it's still every bit as enjoyable as it was when I was still a youngling :)"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I first came across this book in high school and as a dreamer, free-spirit, and cat lover- this novel fit the bill for my girlhood imagination. It's full of fantasy, cat lore, sci-fi, and even though the ending could be interpreted as being a bit dramatic, in turn it is eerie and frightening. This stalwart cat journeys far and wide for his friend and encounters so many regions of his catfolk and beyond that he comes back a stronger kitty and a changed heart. Although the idea is intended for kids, adults would enjoy it and I've got two copies waiting for my own kids when they are ready to hear such a fun tale. This book has stuck with me over the years and I'm a devoted fan."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song was my introduction to Tad Williams and I was immediately hooked by this mesmerizing anthromorphic fantasy. Delightful prose, names that roll off your tongue and invite reading aloud, a well developed fantasy world from the point of view of cats (as opposed to a human viewpoint merely imposed upon animal characters)all help to make this a classic - one of the three or four best fantasies of its kind, it compares favorably with Watership Down and the Plague Dogs. Be careful, though, the longer you read it the more you begin to believe that you are a cat yourself!If you love fantasy in general you've probably already know that Williams is an extraordinary writer, if not check out Mr. William's other fantasy books like his Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series or his new Shadowland books. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tad Williams confounds me completely. I'm either gushing over one of his works or shaking my head in disappointment. I'm beginning to wonder if he has a split personality. Memory, Sorrow, Thorn is one of my all-time favorite trilogies, and I'm enamored of the Shadowmarch trilogy. On the other hand, I simply couldn't get through the Otherland series. I finally gave up halfway through the second book. Tailchaser's Song, while better than Otherland, falls into that category. Slow and semi-interesting. It isn't bad exactly, but not good either. I wouldn't call it unoriginal but definitely uninspiring. The characters are nice, nothing spectacular but likable and realistic (for cats anyway.) The feline angle was amusing and is probably what kept me going. It was, though, very easy to put down. Honestly, if it hadn't been so short, I really think it would have suffered the same fate as Otherland; abandonment at the used book store only half finished."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song was an okay book. Nothing exceptional, or poor, just okay. The characters were good, and the plot wasn't bad, but a few plot threads were loose and the ending didn't resolve everything that it was supposed to.

This shows many signs of having been a first novel and is far too much of a prototypical epic fantasy feel for my tastes. I'm a cat fan and a fantasy fan and a Williams fan but you can find better cat books, better fantasy and much better Williams. Not a bad read, but way below what I expected from Tad."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I must make it clear first that I LOVE felines-they're my favorite animal, and I myself enjoy animal stories so much that I've completed the first few chapters of my own fantasy cat-tale. I knew the Warrior Cats series was popular, but then I got to thinking, well, what other novels feature cats? I found Ratha's Creature, then Tailchaser's Song. Both these titles are quite popular, so I bought them for extra reading.Truth be told, I did not find young Fritti Tailchaser's adventure as compelling as the reviews led me to believe. I found myself constantly breaking off from the book, only returning to it when I had nothing better to read. Although I like the language and stories and mythologies of the Folk, the plot itself seemed to drag out on a rather boring path, only sparking my interest when they finally reached the Court and then again later when they became enslaved in the Mound. The good news is I did end up feeling satisfied with the ending.One of the things that's bugging me is people comparing it to Tolkien, and I still don't get it. How in the world could anyone even think of Tolkien while reading this? Sure, it's about a young hero setting out on a journey, meeting all kinds of different people on the way and destroying a foe, but gosh, so are a billion other fantasy books out there. Why zero in on Lord of the Rings? I do not say these things to offend the author, because Tailchaser is unique in its own right, but it's just not clicking for me. The two stories do not appear to be on the same level.All in all, Tailchaser's Song isn't the worst I've read, but I'm still debating on whether or not it was worth the price."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book is amazing, I've read it countless amount of times.

I give it ten stars!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"As I was browsing the book store one day, searching for something to read over vacation, I came upon this book. Surely, the cat on the cover intrigued me and so did the wording on the back. Flipping through the pages, the detailed explanation of different words in the cat 'language' as well as a list of some of the more creative names for cats, dogs, and squirrels finally made me buy the book. And after reading it I was very much hooked upon furry fantasy and have since read most anything I could get my hands on.The storyline keeps you hooked as you see through the eyes of Fritti Tailchaser, a tom cat living at the outskirts of the city that embarks on an adventure filled quest to find his beloved Hushpad. The cat personalities are totally believable and you'll find yourself wondering if this sort of world actually does exist somewhere out there with all the stray cats of the world. Ever wonder why your cat circles three times before laying down? What do they think about us humans? How do they percieve the world around them and how it came about? Tad Williams enchanting tale answers all of these in a wonderful fantasy story that I recommend to most anyone."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This charactors in this book could easily be subsituted for human charactors.

I won't try and compare it to &quot;Watership Down&quot; really, because there's not much point. &quot;Song&quot; is fantasy--completely. &quot;Down&quot; really isn't. &quot;Song&quot; is a shallower book--it does not have the depth or the language. I'd recommend it, but I wouldn't place too many expectations on it. Enjoy it for what it is: an adventure."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"The first time I read it was as a child, but the depth of the story grows as I grow and reread this book.

At the time, I just wanted to read about explosions, and was dubious about a book concerning cats. But, to humor my grandmother, I read it. I've re-read it dozens of times since, worn out three copies and am on my forth, and never seem to tire of it. It is fantastic how it trangresses age boundries. Things that weren't apparent to me at age 12 came clear to me, and just enhanced the book's appeal. Give it to your children, or better yet read it to them. But read it yourself first!

I couldn't have been older than nine or ten, and it immediately became one of my favourite books. I'm turning twenty, and it still is. I like cats, and have identified two of mine in the story, but that's only part of why I liked it. As has been mentioned before, the characters, the completeness of their world, the power of the writing. There were a few things that weren't quite explained to my satisfaction--the ending, what had happened to Tailchaser's family--but overall I loved this story and didn't want it to end. It isn't a kid's story by any means--I was reading it last night and Vastnir spooked me more than it had when I was younger. I've bee through two copies, lent it to dozens of people. Everyone should read this one."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This is the book that got me into fantasy, into novels, into all the books I know and love (including the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series).

Hushpad isn't the only cat to dissapear out of thin air, however, so Fritti's clan sent adelegation of cats to the Court of Harar, where the Queen of Cat resides, to ask for help in thissituation.Fritti decides to follow them, and is followed himself several times by terrifying creatures he isn'table to glimpse.

When Fritti went into Cat Hell &amp; saw what was going on, I felt as if I were right there with him. My heart broke as I read of the cats' enslavement, &amp; I had to hug my cat close as I pictured her trapped for eternity digging holes with her little paws! I find that the story was very original &amp; it is a book that I have read several times since I first picked it up about 5 years ago.

Williams does a great job creating an entire cat culture, complete with a history, language, and lore. The plot isn't what makes this book so wonderful (although I enjoyed it too) but how he creates the animals. Williams captures the personality of cats, the way they move and relate to each other.It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much, what a refreshing change."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Told through a cat's eyes, \\"Tailchaser's Song\\" reads like good mythology. It's a simple story, at the beginning: Tailchaser, a tomcat, goes searching for his soon-to-be-mate Hushpad, who has gone missing, and has many adventures as he seeks her. He journeys through a world filled with intelligent animals ranging from dogs to squirrels to birds to more, eventually meeting up with the source of much evil in the world. Tailchaser comes of age and learns much about himself and about the value of friendship -- and about what love really is.I encountered this book first as a 20something, and I've read my way through two copies so far. Williams is a fantastic storyteller, with an artist's touch. His descriptions and characterizations are excellent, as always. I'd recommend this without hesitation to anybody interested in a good yarn. Even those who don't normally get into \\"fuzzy animal\\" stories may like this -- it's really about way more than just talking kitties."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Ever wonder why you're cat absolutely has to go out at night?

Please Mr. Williams, give us some more of Tailchaser's adventures!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Take it from an avid reader as opposed to a cat or fantasy nut; this book is a stellar accomplishment. Children will love it for its colorful characters and intense action sequences. Older, more discerning readers will cherish it for its complex plot, understanding of its subjects and the simply beautiful way Williams weaves the English language in his tapestry. I first discovered this book in the fifth grade and my own dog-eared copy has endured through four book reports, four plane trips with a certain high-school choir, countless sleepless nights and about two dozen school finals periods when I finished way ahead of the class. Buy it for your children, buy it for yourself, or buy it for your cat!

Every time I have sat down and re-read it since then, I always discover something new. This is my favorite story, simply because it is not your typical fantasy novels. There are no elves or shape-shifting people, but in the world of Tailchaser, the cats themselves have the empire. Well written and crafted, I would recommend this for fantasy and adventure readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I was given this book to read in my 8th grade english class, and read it in about 3 days. I then badgered my mother until she went out a bought me the book to have. I have read the book an uncountable number of times, and now, 13 years later, I'm on my 3rd or 4th copy (duct tape just looks funny on the spine!). The only other book I've worn out like that is Watership Down, which my aforementioned teacher suggested after my love of this book.Tailchaser's Song is an extremely well written, but definately not for those who don't like cats. The way the characters come together, and the journey that Friti takes draw you in until you find it's 3am, and you need to be to work in a few hours!The way that Mr. Williams handles the other animals in the story is impressive as well. I could actually hear the squirrels' conversations with the main character! Mr. Williams has obviously paid much attention to detail when it comes to portraying all the characters in the story. The irony of the ending made me sit and think about how things can take such a strange turn, and how things aren't always what they seem.A must read for anyone that liked Watership Down, is an animal lover, or lover of fantasy!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I read this book in the 3rd grade, 1989, and it had a profound efect on me.

Not only is it wonderfully written (which it is) but it is also from the point of view of a cat. I would recommend this to everyone!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Being a lover of fantasy and cat tales, I had to get \\"Tailchaser's Song.\\" It began wonderfully, but about halfway through it sizzled. Most of this was because of the unusual plot, which involved subterranean cats living under the rule of a wicked cat-leader, a sort of deposed demi-god.Sometimes a plot such as this can be pulled off, and sometimes it can't, and this is a case of the latter. It is unfortunate, because the writing is quite good, as are the characters.When the animal-fantasy genre is one's book of choice, it is difficult to keep from using \\"Watership Down\\" as the measuring stick, and in this case the story falls somewhat short. Adams is an accomplished story-teller, and although the animals in his story talked and had adventures, they were within the realm of plausibility (I know that sounds absurd in describing a fantasy, but bear with me) in that the rabbits ACTED as rabbits do. That is to say, Adams read Lockley's book on rabbits and incorporated many of their actual behaviors, while still combining Joseph Campbell's \\"Hero of a Thousand Faces\\" attributes to Hazel. Voila! It works.Williams has done this to a degree, but the story veers off when there is a large colony of feral cats living in very close proximity in the woods (cat owners know this doesn't wash;look at the spats created when one has more than three cats in a household) since cats tend by nature to be solitary creatures. The disbelief could have been suspended, but the idea of having the \\"prisoner cats\\" living underground in such wretched conditions as described pressed me a bit too far, especially in conjunction with the strange revenge plot of the evil demi-god, HeartEater.However, it is still an enjoyable read for cat and fantasy readers. Similar books worth the read are \\"Catswold Portal\\" and \\"Wild Road.\\""},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Well this book follows the great journey of a cat named fritti tailchaser. the writer takes us to the adventures of this cat along with his side kicks he picks up along the way. The story line does not differ from from \\"Watership Downs\\" by Richard Adams. Mr williams use great stories that the cats tell one another about past heroes and great cats. It is a simple book to read quite a catchy book. The book deals alot with the world issues, opressed people strugging to be free. A harse life for the cats and what they have to endure to be free."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Fritti Tailchaser is a young ginger tomcat in a world where cats have their own language, culture, and mythology. When his friend and prospective mate Hushpad goes missing, Tailchaser sets out on a quest to discover what distant evil threatens the lives of the Folk. Tailchaser's Song is a generic fantasy questing novel with larger-than-life gods and a feline wrapping--but, unfortunately, Williams knows nothing about cats. Gross inaccuracies and general misconceptions strip away the feline aspect and so destroy this book's only unique aspect. I do not recommend it.In plot, pacing, and writing style, Tailchaser's Song is unexceptional but not that bad. Williams knows how to write a novel, if not a very good one, and the book follows many common fantasy tropes. Tailchaser is an unassuming small \\"town\\" youth who leaves on an ill-advised quest which leads him to a big city, to an enemy city, and up against a scheming powerful antagonist so that good may triumph against evil. Bits of interspersed mythology create a powerful setting, yet this mythology still seem out of place when it enters the plot. Williams paces his book well, and Tailchaser's journey feels realistically long while maintaining interesting variety. Best of all, the book doesn't end as soon as evil is vanquished, identifying Tailchaser is a character in his own right and not just a tool of the story. All in all, the book is aptly- but not well-written: readable, passably skillful, but not memorable.However, what sets this book apart is also what condemns it. Tailchaser is a cat, and his journey leads him through cat cities and against cat gods. But for all this focus on cats, Williams knows little about them. They speak a \\"high\\" language which is almost entirely spoken--but domestic cats don't vocalize among each other. Williams believes that kittens are born without fur, that cats prefer forests, that they live in teeming cities, that they can overdose on catnip. Cats also hunt mice and clean themselves and heckle dogs, but on the whole what Williams gets right are generalities and nothing more. Worse, he sets feral cats as the ideal--a dangerous and false lesson to the reader. Real cats are not the indigenous master species presented in Tailchaser's Song, nor do they hate humans for neutering, nor are housecats somehow inferior. Whatever personal secret it is that cats keep in their own silent, heavy-eyed company, despising M'an, building huge cat cities in forests, and originating from powerful old cat-gods is not it.The premise of this book probably appeals most to cat fans--but the book itself will be most disappointing to cat fans. On the whole, the book is neither very good nor very bad. Capably written but not particularly skillful, it's a fairly average fantasy novel. The cat characters, on the other hand, could be quite exceptional--but this is not a book in the lines of Watership Down or even the Redwall series. In fact, there are barely any cats here--merely predictable human characters wrapped in cursory fur. With nothing else to endorse the book, I don't recommend Tailchaser's Song. While it is not outright bad, it is disappointing."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"The greatest cat story of all time! This book is for fantasy and cat lovers of all ages!

The story has a complete and unexpected twist and feels like it comes to a screeching halt. This made me feel very sad and angry. Later, however, after a few days of pondering I realized that the ending dosen't hurt the story, it strengthens it by offering advice to Tailchaser that we can all use. I can't say what the advice is or what exacly happens because I'd be giving it away, but I have to say to all readers; please keep an open mind and don't judge the book by its silly names or its &quot;un-orthodox&quot; ending. Just try to see why it can relate to us. This book can be loved by children and adults alike, so I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I first read this book almost 10 years ago, and it's become one of my favorite re-reads over the years.

WOW, does he know cats. Everynight before going to bed, I would read this book for hours not caring that it was 1:30am and that I had to be up in four hours to get ready for work. His story takes you on a journey that is funny, exciting, unknowing, sad and loving. When I was finally through reading this story I was absolutely balling!

It's simply AMAZING!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"My friend let me borrow this book, and I liked it so much I got a copy for myself! Tad Williams excellently tells the story of a brave tomcat named Fritti Tailchaser who goes on a dangerous mission to rescue his best friend.

Overall, if you had a choice of books, grab this on first!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I read this book for the first time in seventh grade after four consecutive readings of Watership Down, one of my all-time favorite novels. What I loved about Tailchaser was the way I never wanted the book to be over. True, the ending leaves a lot open to the imagination, but then most of the best books do. It is ripe for a sequel, but I'm more content to imagine the further adventures of Fritti and Roofshadow than read about them. Sequels, I have found, are usually a disappointment."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I first came across this book when I was 10. It took me 3 days to get through it. It was the first novel I finished reading (that wasn't assigned as part of English class). It still holds my intrest today. I always have an extra copy to hand out to any budding readers in my neighborhood. Now they are all looking for more cool books to read."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I've had this book since I was a kid, and it never gets old. The mythology and the language are beautiful and thoroughly developed; instead of different nations of people we have different species providing contrasting cultures and rich worldbuilding. The book begins lightheartedly, if a bit more lyrical than you'd expect from a book with housecats on its cover. But then the story gradually travels, quest-like, into the heart of darkness. Every detail of creatures both strange and familiar is richly imagined, lending even the familiar ones a strange air.The animal perspective invites comparisons to Watership Down and the Redwall series, but a more apt comparison is Lord of the Rings. Sweeping and poetic, it's an epic which captures the mind as surely as Middle-earth ever did."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tad Williams' first published novel (1985) has done a fairly good job of standing up to the test of time. Somewhat reminiscent of THE HOBBITT, with an unassuming protagonist taking on what seems like an impossible journey to destinations unknown, and facing dangers that seem insurmountable, TAILCHASER'S SONG fits a classic mold. It is also an interesting exercise for fans of Williams to see how his storytelling has improved over the past 20-something years. TAILCHASER'S SONG is very different than his huge multi-volume epicsMemory, Sorrow, and ThornandOtherland, standing on its own as a self-contained and rather simple story. It does have an epic fantasy-like feel, as long journeys are undertaken and world-changing events take place, but you'll be able to read it in just a week or so. Williams' take on the society and behaviour of cats is very amusing, making this story worth reading and giving it the needed edge to gain a favorable rating. Memorable and well-developed, this is a story that should please most readers.Compared to Williams' more recent products, the writing in TAILCHASER'S SONG does seem a little less refined. While there are certainly gleams of greatness, he isn't as able to touch the reader's heart-strings like he so effortlessly does now. His descriptions are more repetitive and don't quite inspire the imagination like they do in his newer work, and the characters, while interesting, aren't as compelling as they could be. One thing that Williams STILL has a problem with is being overly long-winded, describing some scenes in way too much needless detail, to the point that the reader starts to lose interest. In some ways, this problem may have only gotten worse with his more recent works, as I didn't notice it as much reading this one as I have in the past. Still, there are areas of this one that could have used the input of a more critical editor.Probably the most interesting aspect of this book is Williams' take on cat society, cat behaviour, cat lore, and cat thought processes. Throughout the book you'll be able to picture your own cats in Tailchaser's (or another character's) place, and get a good laugh. The scene where Tailchaser meets the queen of cats, whose hing leg happens to be sticking straight up in the air as she casually cleans herself, is absolutely great. I know his interpretations of how cats think holds true to what I see in the expressions and behaviours of my cats.Recommended for fans of Williams and for cat-lovers.The 15th anniversary edition (pictured here on Amazon) includes a forward from Tad Williams that is hilarious. His description of what he was thinking and where he was during the time he penned TAILCHASER'S SONG is sure to make you laugh and helps you relate to this great author of fantasy."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Growing up surrounded by cats of every size, color, and temperament, it was definitely interesting to read Williams' take on the ways these creatures live. Like any who'd care to notice, Williams was quite right in saying that while dogs are boundlessly eager to please, cats display a languorous disdain towards their keepers. I remember remarking once that they treat our home more like a motel--they stop by when it's time to be fed, putter around for a short nap, and then set out again without so much as a by-your-leave. Hey, but we're still suckers for them...Certainly i enjoyed this novel. My only grief about this was that i inadvertently compared this with Adams' Watership Down. Which was unfair, i know. Sad to say, Tailchaser's story lacked that emotional depth, character development, (and dare i say it--cutesyness) that makes Watership Down a timeless classic for kids and adults. Honestly, if i hadn't read the latter before, i would most assuredly have been able to rate Tailchaser's Song higher. As it is, it fell short of my expectations. I really wanted to give this 5 stars but there were some scenes that lagged, some short narratives that i really felt need not be included in the chapter, there were loads of symbolism (which i didn't even dare discern), and the ending felt hurried.Despite those things, readers will still adore Tailchaser, the effervescent Pouncequick, and the gruff Fencewalker. I'm sure this book will be enjoyed by readers of any age bracket--it's a treat to see yet another insight in the world of felines. Definitely some might even take a second, longer look at their pet cats just to ponder their mysteries once again."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tad Williams creates a complex and convincing culture for cats in this novel, complete with folklore, a language, values, and beliefs about the world, including a clever legend about how humans came to exist. The protagonist is likeable and easy to identify with, and we share in his discoveries about the world as he ventures forth from his sheltered forest home. Every plot point introduces new mysteries and questions to be answered. Yes, there are some similarities both to Tolkienn and to Watership Down, but the author puts enough of an original spin on everything that I never felt like I was reading a rip-off of someone else's work. (Besides, most writers are inspired by other, previous authors to some extent).One reviewer mentioned being dissatisfied with the climax. I can certainly understand how it could come across as a deux ex machina ending that comes out of nowhere, but I found it satisfying. Looking back over the novel, the author leaves many clues that Eatbugs is not what he seems, so I didn't feel like it was totally out of left field. Though it was a little disappointing that Tailchaser himself played such a minor role in the grand, epic ending battle, perhaps that's only realistic, since he has no special powers and wouldn't be a match for Grizraz Hearteater, the evil cat-god. I do agree, though, that the frog scene was kind of pointless and silly.All in all, though, this was a thoroughly fun read and I recommend it to anyone who likes either epic fantasy or cats.As a side-note...This didn't occur to me until recently, but Tailchaser's name is actually a bit of a double entendre. If you re-read the scene where he first meets Hushpad, it becomes clear."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"A friend loaned this book to me and after a few weeks I decided to just go ahead and read it. I assumed it was going to be boring, I mean a book about cats? I thought I'd rather knit or make a quilt or something but I was wrong. This book is awesome! I convinced my husband to read it and he (Mr. Sci-fi geek) even enjoyed it! We bought our own copy and have shared it with some friends since."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I have had this book on my shelf for a number of years. After reading other books by Tad Williams and enjoying them immensely, this title seemed like a good purchase. I just couldn't bring myself to read it, as there was always something new that seemed more exciting. A book about cats? How am I going to enjoy that?On a flight across the Pacific, I finally opened this book and started reading. I couldn't stop, it was such a well written story. I found myself identifying with the characters even though they were cats. The description of how cat's view history and their relationship with humans was humorous. Otherwise it is a typical story about the youngster who goes out to save the world, and succeeds.If you feel like something a little different, I recommend this book. You really can't go wrong with Tad Williams."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I received Tailchasers Song as a gift because I love Tad Williams work, I put it on my wish list. While I am glad I read the book, you can tell this is his first work and the whole book is not as complex and riveting as a lot of his later work.The whole theme of cats and how that affects the story is cute. The cats have slightly different motivation than humans but it is still along the line is the typical human or humanoid groups that you would run into - the people who want security, those who want to live life wild and free, those who stick to their specific code of conduct etc. etc.I enjoyed the story, it was well done but I always got the feeling that I knew what was going to happen next, and it usually did. A good effort, there is nothing wrong with the story; it simply needs some more depth which comes through in later works."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Still in print after more than 20 years, this feline fantasy clearly owes more than a little to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Its hero, Fritti Tailchaser, is a rather ordinary cat, roaming the fields and woods by night, returning between times to the back porch of the human family that never fails to leave food, water, and a cozy bed in place for him. But when his female friend Hushpad suddenly disappears, his inquiries lead him to fear that she has shared the fate of the many cats who've also vanished from their accustomed haunts in recent months. Passed over for the embassy that his local clowder decides to send to the court of the Queen of Cats, he sets off alone to find her, though he's very soon joined by a kitten named Pouncequick.Tailchaser, like many other heroes of fiction, doesn't set out to be a hero: he simply does what he feels he has to, and more or less falls into things as he goes, but when tested he finds unexpected depths of courage, moral strength, and resourcefulness within himself. He learns lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and self-knowledge, and in the end proves instrumental in defeating an ancient and terrible evil. Williams extrapolates creatively from cats as we see them to create a complete culture and society, based on singing, dancing, and the telling of traditional stories. The scenes of Tailchaser's and Pouncequick's captivity in the sinister mound in Ratleaf Forest may be difficult for sensitive readers to take, but they can rest assured that both will emerge alive and triumphant. Lovers of cats and fantasy (who are often one and the same) should enjoy this unusual story."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book was a delight. I was skeptical about reading a quest type story about cats, but I was shocked to find out that you forget about that after about 5 minutes into it and the concern about that aspect never returns. I quite enjoyed this story. It did not have a typical Williams ending, which I found myself a little bothered by, but other than that it was great.Tad Williams is my favorite author and I read all of his other books and avoided this one because of the subject matter. I am not a cat person! Finally, I decided to give it a whirl and you should too. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"What Adams did for rabbits in \\"Watership Down\\", Tad Williams accomplishes for cats in \\"Tailchaser's Song.\\" But this is no mere rehash of Adams's work: Williams creates his own mythic world; and his characters, while certainly \\"human\\" enough to pull our heartstrings, retain their feline natures.The story of Fritti Tailchaser is a beautiful adventure, and reaches epic and mythical proportions. Fritti's initial quest to find his missing female friend takes him beyond the daily \\"average\\" life of a cat: his eventual journey through a cat \\"hell\\" skillfully mirrors the epics and myths of the ancient world. This is an amazing novel, often overlooked, and I would highly recommend it to any lover of myth, folklore or adventure!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I must have had this book in my bookcase for twenty years (no, really!) before actually reading it just over the past few weeks! I am a huge cat-lover, but somehow the fantasy slant kept me from starting this book. Now I can't get it out of my head! It is a truly magical saga and I really love the portrayal of the cats as well as all of the other animals in the book. When Fritti Tailchaser and his companions, Pouncequick and Roofshadow, find the source of evil that has been snatching their Folk, I was so engrossed that I cried reading what the cats were going through! It is truly horrible, but a happy ending rounds the book out nicely. I love the \\"cat language\\" used in the book as well! Extremely well written and imagined! I will definitely read this one again!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book was purchased as a gift to my niece. She requested it by title for Christmas. Nothing else, just this one book. My sister, her aunt, had shared the book with her years ago. Far too soon after sharing the book, my sister was killed in a house fire. Gifting this book to my niece was like giving a piece of their relationship back."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song is another great animal fantasy. Tad Williams created a wonderful world for his cat characters, including their unique religion and culture. He also introduces a language, \\"The Higher Singing\\", which can be confusing to follow but it has a glossary in the back so no harm done.The story follows the journey of young Fritti Tailchaser, a tom of the Meeting Wall Clan. His friend Hushpad goes missing, and Fritti swears to bring her back. He begins a perilous journey with the kitten Pouncequick in tow. He meets a whole cast of cats and other creatures along the way, and it's there that Williams really shines. You can tell each cat apart by their characteristics and different tones, and the way he introduces the custom of all cats having three different names is well done.The tale does get downright bleak during Tailchaser's stay at the Vastnir, and it's a little confusing in places. But the twist at the end when Fritti finally discovers Hushpad was unexpected and really made the book work, without the usual ending that the author could have just as easily ended it with. Tailchaser's Song is on my list of well-done fantasies, and it's perfect for readers of The Wild Road and the Golden Cat by Gabriel King."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Williams does a good job of drawing the reader into Tailchaser's world.

No, it is not the most complex of stories, and no, it doesn't have the depth of 'Watership Down'...but, still it remains a favorite.

Tad Williams conveys the politics and mythology of cats through this great odyssey.

I love the character Fritti Tailchaser. I read it twice over. From the start to beginning it was hard to put down. I liked the bad guy, the way the author describes the evil cat god as being blind and fat from eating live wounded animals.. it horrified me and made me feel a bit ill. I liked it really and it had me wondering what happened next. I wish I knew.. did he go back to the wall? Did he go back to Roofshadow? I couldnt help but wonder what next for our feline?Anyways I read this one before I read the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. I love both equally.. I have always adored cats and wondered what my own little calico is doing outside all the time.. she loves being outside and I still dont have a clue where she goes.. so it makes me wonder what is she doing?.."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's written in a way that makes a cat seem more of a different sort of intellectual being rather than a 4-legged human. The ending leaves me wondering if Tailchasers Song is really just the beginning of a series, which I really do hope since I found myself being really sympathetic for the protagonist and his friends."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book reminds me strongly of another exciting book- ever heard of the Warriors series? Well, if not, it's about this cat who is named Rusty and goes to live in this Clan in the woods. This book uses the terms elders, queens, apprentices, and leader. They also use names similiar to those in Tailchaser's Song. Well, it just so happens that Tailchaser's Song uses the exact same words. I suspect that the author of the warriors books, Erin Hunter, got a lot of her ideas from Tailchaser's Song. But that's okay- Erin created her own world of fantasy about beloved cat characters and plot twists.I just wanted you to read that. Oh, don't get me wrong- Warriors books are very well written, but possibly a bit of copied material. None the less, I'm sure you'd fancy hearing about this book, Tailchaser's Song. Well, it's about Fritti Tailchaser, a curious and rather small tom cat who lives in a type of group of cats. He has suffered pain of losing loved ones before, like when ma'n ( aka humans ) destroyed his family's den and maybe killed his family. So when his love, Hushpad, a pretty and young fela ( what these cats call females ) disappears from here ma'n home and all around the places he walks, he is determined to find her. And so starts a long journey filled with twists and turns with his friend Puncequick and a nutty cat named Eatbugs.If you like cats, you'll like this book. Not love- like. It has a bunch of confusing words ( there's a glossary in the back ) and the prolouge is extreamly complicated. It also contains a slight bit of frightening material- blood, attacks, etc. But otherwise, you'll get a knack for understanding it all. It really is a well written novel, just complicated.Sincerely,MoonwhiskerP.S. It is a book not exactly meant for young kids, but if you can handle it, well done.P.P.S. If you liked this book, try Watership Down. If you can handle Tailchaser's Song, Watership Down is a splendid novel about rabbits migrating to saftey. ( and not cute bunnys, I mean )"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I recieved this book many years ago as a gift. I was unimpressed when I read the cover. It seemed rather silly. I figured it would be just another cloned fantasy novel. However, this book more than exceeded my expectations. Mr. Williams has done an excellent job deciphering the feline mind in all of its graceful, affectionate, and aloof glory. The idea of cats having mythology, rituals, clans, and supernatural enemies is very conducive to the peculiarities of the feline mind. Also, this is an intriguing fantasy read. I have read it several times, and I catch something new with each read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars. But seeing as I can't I pick 5 rather than 4. This is a very unusual book. It's very well written, and it has a... ah... er... unique plot line. it's not really complicated: Tailchaser goes on a seemingly hopeless journey to find his friend who has disappeared, and also to solve the mystery of the other cats who have vanished in a similar fashion. Believe me, it gets a lot more complex than that. It's sort of gruesome at some points, and it's a little hard to follow, but all in all it was wonderful. I had to read it again to really get it, and that time I understood it a little bit better. So, anyone who likes different and unusual books, even if you're not a cat lover, go for Tailchaser's Song.-Sealink, the Delta Queen"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Found this book at the library, to my amazement I simply couldn't put it down. The book is absolutely a true treasure trove of one cat's adventure, with his friends, through the cat kingdom and beyond. Gives you another prospective at the way cats act and think.

I love cats. Unfortunately, this is not his best novel (ok, it's his first published, so don't expect too much), nor is it about cats, as I know them. What cat do you know that can maintain an attention span for more than 10 seconds?The accurate version of Tailchasers song:Pounchquick - Tailchaser, Hushpad has gone missing.Tailchaser - Let us go rescue her, quick Pouncequick, this way.Pouncequick - Tailchaser; the river. Look at the way the sunlight shines off the ripples.Tailchaser - Yes, isn't it shiny. Let's play; maybe there's fish in the river.[5 minutes later]Tailchaser - Well that was fun Pouncequick; remind me, why did we come to the river again?Pouncequick - I'm not sure. Maybe Hushpad wil know.Tailchaser - Hushpad! Who's Hushpad?The End.So yes - pretend the cats are really hobbits, dwarves or elves. Tailchasers name is really Frodo, Pouncequick is Sam. The Firsthome is the Elven place at the end of the 1st book of LOTR. The underground hive where the baddies live is Mordor .. need I go on.

Hearteater was jealous and corrupt (the ultimate bad-guy) and plotted the downfall of his two brothers, and of all cats. Though his brother, Whitewind, was killed, his scheme seemed to have failed, and it is said that he burrowed into the Earth, seeking refuge from the vengeful Firefoot, and the enraged cats of the surface world, and still he remains there today, plotting and scheming in solitude...Fritti Tailchaser is just a cat like any other. At least, that is, until his humdrum life is interrupted by disaster. Along with a mischievous kitten named Pouncequick, and a crazy, grizzled old cat named Eatbugs, he sets out on a perilous quest to rescue his friend Hushpad, which soon becomes not only a struggle to prove himself, but a battle involving all of catkind, a battle against the deepest evils known to this world. A battle involving the long-lost firstborn brothers, a battle that only courage and ultimate sacrifice can win... And a lesson for Tailchaser, that sometimes what you think you want is not what you REALLY want......And what you really want is this book!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This book was very good. I loved it so much that I think five stars would not suffice for it. Five million might not even work. It has everything a good fantasy book should, like cats, magic, and ancient legens that come into play sometime or other. I enjoyed it more that The Wild Road, although it was a very close runner-up, simply because this book was much easier to understand. That, and the characters of this book were much, much easier to understand and love.Tailchaser is an orphan cat living happily in a colony of cats. His life seems to be great, until his best friend, Hushpad, goes missing without a trace. When Tailchaser meets with the Elders, he learns that cases like these have been happening all over the cat world. When, dissapointingly, Tailchaser is not chosen to be sent on the delegation to search for the missing cats, he decides to go off on his own adventure. He meets up with a few old and new friends, and things seem to be going good. But then he comes to the source of all the horror, the terrible Vastnir. There poor Tailchaser is put through the ordeal of his life and he comes to wonder: is all this worth one fela (female)?"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song is the best book that I have ever read. The characters are all of natures creatures living in a realistic setting. Each creature's personality matches that of their particular species. The reader quickly falls in love with Tailchaser and his group as they embark on a journey to find Tailchaser's friend that recently and mysteriously disappeared. Action and mystery are found on every page. None of the book becomes confusing or boring. I can go on and on about how wonderful this book is, and try as I might I can't find a reason why this book does not rival classics written before it, like Redwall and Watership Down, two other animal stories that I dearly love. Tad Williams has done an amazing job, and I can't help but commend him!I must say, however, that if you did not like Redwall or Watership Down, do not read this book, because you probably will not like it. Also, you need to keep an open mind about how Williams combines cats into supernatural, almost God-like beings in the storie's climax. If you can't do that then the book might not make a lot of sense to you."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Tailchaser goes to nightmarish depths to rescue his lady love. The cats are realistically portrayed and the storyline is as good as \\"Watership Down\\"."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I first picked up Tailchaser's Song back in the early 90s. I've recently re-read it and decided to post a review. The idea behind the book was well thought out, however some of the characters seemed to lack a bit of depth - and development (example: for some strange reason Pouncequick stayed a kitten throughout the entire length of the novel, even though it apparently several months from start to finish and Tailchaser himself was only 9 months old at the start). It is temping to compare this to Watership Down, but other than the anthropomorphism there are few similarities. Whereas Watership Down uses familiar animals both as the heros and the protagonists, Williams creates a whole new creature as his \\"bad guys\\". Its not a bad freshman effort from Tad Williams though as others posted his later works were much better."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"What a great book! At first I was a bit weirded out by the creepy underground devil-cats, but the more I read about Tailchaser's plight, the more I came to believe in their terrifying underworld.

Nothing about it really grabbed me but not quite half way through the book it took off and held me with it. At the end, again, I had a hard time sticking with it but was glad I did. Lots of action, humor, love, friendship, loyalty. Good book, even if you are not a cat lover"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"If you like cats. I you simply like good stories. If you like a book you cannot put down after reading the first page...this one is for you. I first read this book in 1987 and have to admit to rereading it several times. It has a haunting quality about it. The authors insight in to cat behavior is wonderful. The author is also a top story teller. You will not be sorry that you read this book. My highest recommendations!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"At least as far as this book is concerned.***spoilers follow***I loved Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn - it's the reason I tried this book - but Tailchaser's Song is a disappointment to me. I guess I shouldn't be too harsh as it is the author's first published work, but I'm frankly puzzled by the huge praise this book has gotten. I didn't get much of the alleged cat personalities in this book, besides the obvious. What I did get was a lot of silly names like Stretchslow, Pawgrip and Hangbelly. I'm surprised Coughhair, Sofascratch and Lickbutt didn't make an appearance.It takes some time for things to happen in this book but even when they do, it's still not very compelling. I find the whole idea of a race of underground demon cats and a swollen, corrupted cat god not a very strong one. It's also derivative ; Tolkien comes to mind, but Tolkien's work is itself derived from other sources so what you have in Tailchaser's Song is a very diluted fantasy. To me, it doesn't make a whit of difference that cats are substituted for hobbits, elves or orcs; it's not nearly enough of a twist. All the archetypes, already well plundered by other fantasy authors, are pretty much the same and, in this book, they aren't very interesting. And it's way too grim. I was expecting more light-hearted fare but much of this book depicts cats in slavery to their demonic counterparts in a huge, underground enclave. Not very enjoyable reading, in my opinion. Not very interesting either. You either have cats sitting around, sniffing or grooming each other, cats telling stories and &quot;singing&quot; or cats being enslaved to dig holes.I noticed some complaints about the ending and this is where I disagree with any negative reviews of the book. Besides the ridiculous, pretentious bit when Tailchaser meets the mother of frogs (named ChumbaWumba or something), I actually sort of preferred the ending to the rest and I think the entire book should have taken this whimsical route, instead of all that grim, boring junk about fat, blinded, cat gods with telepathic powers."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This started and moved along very comfortably - in a Hobbit sort of a way. Our likeable but not especially strong or gifted hero sets off on an adventure - to find his lost fianc&eacute;. On his way he meets the tough and noble Thanes (rangers), encounters a royal court where he befriends a bluff and hearty prince and is discomforted by the dissolute Queen mother and her Consort, forms a strange alliance with a traditionally opposed race, and becomes a vital part in the defeat of an ancient evil foe. OK, standard fantasy fare here, but generally a well enough executed enjoyable derivative (and what more should you reasonably expect from a first novel?).There is some originality in making all the characters cats in a contemporary rural setting, with \\"M'an\\" as their incidental servants. Fortunately Williams keeps this in the background and doesn't milk it too much to be clever or confuse a (adolescent) fantasy with a social satire.There's a nice epilogue too, with (spoiler warning) Tailchaser finding that his \`heart's desire' is not what he thought it to be. Williams does a decent job showing how his protagonist has grown through his experiences and is now a far wiser and self-assured animal.So, I was happy to go along for the ride and thinking Williams (who I haven't read before) was a pleasant enough discovery for me. However he lost me with his magic and mysticism. Not because I don't like magic and mysticism, don't get me wrong (\`some of my best friends..'etc.), but because I don't like the resolution to a whole novel (and, in this case, of millennia) to be based on an, until now, minor character, suddenly realising, \\"Hey, strewth, that's right - I'm a god! I can fix everything! Lucky you were humming that old tune, Tailchaser'. Really. And we're supposed to buy that somehow Tailchaser's done something wise and noble and insightful and deserves praise for something outside of anyone's control. Eatbugs' transfiguration could just as accidentally have happened a hundred years before, a week later, last summer - whenever. Just too dodgy for me for an author to place an essentially random event right at the climax of the novel and expect us to feel satisfied with the conclusion. The book heads right down this irrational hill after that, with Yoda/Guru frog just appearing from nowhere - who are these characters? Why is it that Lord Firefoot can only float in for a vision and then lose transmission? There's no attempt at explanation, and while you don't have to have a Silmarillion for every fantasy creation, you really should do better than this with your pivotal myth. I mean, the idea of the three deity brothers was fine, my basic beef is with the unsatisfying (deus ex Machina) way Firefox metamorphosises, particularly given how vital this is.So, without the lazily plotted climax, this is a good book. With it, an average one."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser is the loving character for this book. Even though it has few deaths, it makes you cry. Because Tailchaser finds Hushpad who dosen't love him in the end. Wah."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tad Williams sets out to a great start, but after I was about half way through the book became stagnant and uninteresting. I like the idea of humans having evolved from cats (I love cats !!) and initially found the characters and their stories captivating. But Tad Williams just slows down and comes to a screeching halt somewhere near the middle, and I couldn't get myself to continue reading."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I usually tend to avoid the fantasy category unless something good pops up. Don't get me wrong, but I usually prefer Sci-Fi as they have more complex plots and I'm about 5% more likely to see less cliches, unlike Fantasies which tend to be rehashes of Lord of the Rings (which I really did not like). I really wanted to like Tad, I really did, but after This one and a failed attempt to read Dragonbone Chair, I figured it IS possible to compare him to Tolkien... they're both masters of cliches, except Tolkien invented most of them. The reason I review Tailchaser is because its the only Tad book I read all the way through. I grabbed Tailchaser because I was both a Cat lover and a fan of Watership Down. As it turns out, I made a mistake. This novel happens to be the very essence of what I'm trying to avoid! Wall to Wall cliches and predictable plot elements. These things made me stop reading Dragonbone after about five chapters. Of course Simon is the kitchen boy who is destined to save the world... but we're speaking Tailchaser. The mysterious things that keep chasing Tailchaser and crew are obviously rip-offs of the ringwraiths, Eatbugs is the gandalf wannabe... except Gandalf was sane and intelligent. Puncequick is the annoying child who's there just to screw things up. Of course, an evil god wants to take over the world. Need I name any more common cliches? How about the predictable plot elements, like that he Cat Queen obviously won't help so Tail has to continue on with just a few companions? How about the deus ex Machina devices, such as how Eatbugs just HAPPENS to be some God who opposed Hearteater? IF you didn't see most or all this book coming half a mile away, this is probably the first book you read or you didn't try. Anyway, I'm done being negative, and therefore have no more to say on this book. Try reading Feist."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I love books. I love cats. I decided to read a book about cats. Tailchaser's Song. This was before I read Watership Down. But even then, I didn't find this book all that great. There are two parts that REALLY drag this book down. 1) the part where Fritty goes to that cat-mound-hell-underground place whatever. It reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Dante's Inferno. Too dark. Too depressing. Too boring. 2) The ending wa a BIG letdown. Fritty went all that way only to discover THIS! Sure it's a surprise ending, but it's the type of surprise ending that makes you sick. The way I felt after reading the last line in Orwell's 1984. Finally, let me ask you this: Which book sounds more interesting: Tailchaser's Song, where a male cat is trying to find his missing she-cat OR Watership Down, where some rabbits are trying to escape extinction both by man and their own kind. Read WATERSHIP DOWN by Richard Adams. THAT is a good animal-as-main-character book. This isn't."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I've read several of the books with cats, or cat like creatures playing central roles, but this took it too far. The excessive changing in language really dragged the story down; and I don't think the author truly understands cats. Where's the smugness, holier than thou attitude every cat I've met has?"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This is one of the few books I was unable to finish. I love fantasy and cats, and this book was a disservice to both. Perhaps the story improved after the first sixty pages, but I wasn't willing to suffer through any more of the book to find out."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"I guess if you LOVE cats you might find this book tolerable. It is more interested in beating you over the head about how wonderful cats are than telling a meaningful story. An overly obvious take of on Watership Down except it is more interested in promotion of the &quot;humanity&quot; of kitty cats than in storytelling.Fritti is one of the shallowist fantasy characters in a long time. Provides a pethetic mouthpiece for the promotion of &quot;kitty cat philoshpy&quot;AVOID AVOID AVOID"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"This was written either with little old ladies or children in mind.

It took me 2 1/2 hours to complete, and i have read it since over 10 times. It is right up there with water ship down, but &quot;Song&quot; was written in a more freindly manner, and &quot;Down&quot; was a little depressing.

He also makes friends on his journey, as with the squirrels called Rikchikchiks.I believe this exciting story is about the need for freedom, and the constant struggle to remain free. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"My copy is tattered and torn - a favorite re-read.

A marvelous source of unusual cat names - I have a &quot;Pouncequick&quot; too!!"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"When I saw what the book was about it reminded me of a child's book.

Fritti and Roofshadow and Pouncequick are cool characters - you'll love them!!! :) :) :) :)"},{"Title":"Tailchaser's Song","review":"Tailchaser's Song has been one of my favorite books, and I have read it four times, since I first bought it two years ago. While it is often compared to Watership Down, the two are really nothing alike aside from the obvious animal-themed similarities. The characters are endearing and their troubles frightening enough to cause the reader to worry, but there is enough humor to keep it from becoming grim. The ending comes as a surprise, also, which is becoming more and more rare these days.

Political intrigue mixed with science fiction. Amazingly this hasn't been dated as so many sci fi works from that period have become. Author also gives history throughout the novel making it believable. Have read it 30+ times since I read it first back in 1976. Sorry the author never wrote a sequel on life after the demise of the structures - or even novels about Union and Hinterland in earlier phases of the 1000 year structure history or - how about a novel about the covert mission of Rivera French into Hinterland years before?

Heartwarming, funny, charming, emotional, richly rewarding, and beautifully written. A keeper!"},{"Title":"The Last Man in Town (An Avon Romantic Treasure)","review":"Lucas Garrett was living every man's dream. Laundry done, good home cooking, and all the, um, tender, loving care he could handle. Only. . . he was tired of handling it. The demands of being the last man in town proved to be overwhelming and exhausting. He needs a way out. So he turns to Pricilla Wentworth, his best friend from childhood and the only one he can trust to get him out of this predicament. If they can convince the man-hungry females that his &quot;engagement&quot; to the very upstanding, proper Pricilla is for real, maybe Lucas can get some rest.In the meantime, Pricilla has one condition of her own. In return for saving Lucas's neck, he must find her suitable candidates for a husband. Not an easy task, since all the men but Lucas have left town, following the rumors of a huge gold strike out west. She regrets not pursuing the matter of marriage while the iron was hot, especially since prospects are now so slim.But while he is busy avoiding entanglement and she is chasing it, they discover feelings for one another that had never complicated their relationship before. Can he let go of the fear of losing his best friend if he complicates it with his heart? Is she better off playing it safe with a steady, established older man, giving up the dream of Lucas?Ms. Law presents readers with an original theme and characters with spunk and sparkle. Way to go!"},{"Title":"The Last Man in Town (An Avon Romantic Treasure)","review":"A handsome man and an obstinate woman who has been friends for years. A town devoid of all other able-bodied males. A cast of multi-dimensional supporting characters. Sound like a good premise for a great romance novel? If only the author had delivered. While the premise sounds inviting, I find &quot;The Last Man in Town&quot; boring and completely lacking in intelligence. Since the readers unavoidably start out knowing what's going to happen between Lucas and Priscilla, this book would have worked much better if the author had allowed our two main characters to gradually discover that there's something more to their relationship than just mere friendship. Afterall, that's why we bought this book in the first place. Instead, from the moment Lucas steps into Priscilla's bedroom after escaping the attentions of an unwanted female, Lucas was presented with the knowledge that he actually wants his long-time friend &quot;that way.&quot; And that was only in the 2nd chapter. The same revelation came to Prescilla not much later, and from then on, it's one scene after another in which the two main characters tries valiantly to control their lust for each other while feeling jealousy towards each and everyone of the townspeople who dares to encroach on their territory. And the reason Lucas and Prescilla cannot be together? Luca is the by-product of a broken marriage and therefore has resolved not to get married because he does not believe in the sacred institution. PLEASE!!! How lame can you get! This book could have been over in 20 pages with the kind of plot there is, or there isn't, and instead we had to suffer through pages and pages of sparkless interactions between the two main characters only because we've already bought the book. On top of that, I did not find Priscilla's prim and proper mannerisms the least bit likable. And did I mention that the dialogue between our hero and heroine can only be described as juvenile at best? You can bet that this is the last time I'm buying a Susan Kay Law book without borrowing it from the library first."},{"Title":"The Last Man in Town (An Avon Romantic Treasure)","review":"Maple Falls had become a town almost exclusively inhabited by women. Every healthy man had ventured west to California, seeking his fortune in the Gold Rush. But there was one healthy, good-looking, virile man left in town - Lucas Garrett, owner of the town's general store. Now, Lucas loved women. And he found it hard to say no to them. But lately he had been saying yes so much, he was just plain exhausted! And he never got to sleep alone anymore. Heck, he never got to sleep at all anymore! So he sought help from his longtime best friend, the trustworthy and proper Priscilla Wentworth. Priscilla agrees to his request, to pose as his betrothed to keep all the hungry ladies away. But she does want one thing in return - for Lucas to find her a husband. Reluctantly, he agrees. Although he's uncertain just where he will find a suitable man for the lovely Pris. But once their relationship starts heating up, Lucas may begin to consider himself the most suitable candidate.This was my first read by Susan Kay Law, and although I'm not usually drawn to stories set in the Old West, I did enjoy this one. It was a well-written, light read infused with humor. I liked the characters of Lucas and Priscilla and their love scenes were quite sensual. The story is basically about how these two fall in love and get together, without much in the way of subplots. It's worth the time, especially if you're looking for an enjoyable, light reading experience."},{"Title":"The Last Man in Town (An Avon Romantic Treasure)","review":"In 1860 all the healthy males leave Maple Falls in search of gold except for Lucas Garrett. Sounds like male heaven, but to a weary Lucas it plays more like hell. With one noted exception, every female in town wants a piece of him. Needing a good night's sleep, Lucas turns to the model on proper behavior Priscilla Wentworth for help.He asks her to fake an engagement with him so that he becomes hands off to all the hungry women. She agrees if he finds her a real husband. As he searches for a mate for Priscilla, he treats her like a fiancee. His kisses make Priscilla realize she has found her soul-mate. Though he is jealous of his own actions, Lucas does not realize that he is the right spouse for Priscilla.The humorous story line centers around the antics of Lucas, a renowned philanderer, trying to thwart the advances of an army of women and ultimately legitimize his compassionate relationship with his pretend fiancee. The lead characters are fully developed as their motives are loud and clear. The supporting players add jocular depth that turns THE LAST MAN IN TOWN into a fabulous American romance. Justice will be served if award winning Susan K.

With growth rates so much lower than they were in the early nineties, businesses have increased the focus on maximizing the revenue stream. The authors are partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers and have extensive experience in the trenches with the telecom industry. While their advice is current and highly practical it is most appropriate for industries the have a great deal of transactions on a regular basis such as telecoms, hospitals and similar organizations.The areas covered include facts about revenue leakage, causes of revenue leaks, what some companies are doing now, how to get a revenue maximization initiative going within your organization, day-to-day processes, key automated tools, quantifiable monitoring mechanisms, and the future of revenue maximization. While the authors focus on an approach they call identify-quantify-capture, it is obvious that they have dealt in the real world. One of the places this shows though most clearly is in the section where they discuss the problems of getting an organization to commit to a program. It includes detailed discussion of some of the various commitment phases and the process of moving through those phases on the path to commitment. &quot;To the Max&quot; is a recommended read for anyone in business for their self or at the head of a large department or corporation. It is a highly recommended read if that business is involved in a highly detailed transactional business where thousands of transactions are detailed daily."},{"Title":"To the Max: Revenue Maximization: Capturing the Opportunities Within","review":"I recently read To the Max.

It has interesting and believable characters,And I need to write eight more words-done."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The Confusion is a wry, sometimes serious, sweeping adventure story in which much of the action resembles a cross between The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Wall Street, with a bit of Master and Commander and The Three Musketeers thrown in. True, there are pages and pages of scientific discussions, as well as hints of building a computer, plus more financial dealings than Donald Trump could keep track of. There's also a tender and globetrotting love story that reminds one of a tragicomic Cold Mountain, as well as more gutsy, educated, daring women than can be found in either Tolkien or Jordan. There's Eliza, the female protagonist who makes Martha Stewart look like a homemaking hobbyist, the Satanist Duchess of Oyonnax, the brilliant precocious Princess Caroline, the pirate queen Kottakka and let's not leave out Jack Shaftoe and his gutsy band of slaves turned entrepreneurs.To try to describe the plot in this review does the book an injustice. The battle scenes supply grit, blood and guts galore, the political and financial intrigues make our dot-com fueled stock market look tame and Bush and Kerry's economic plans straightforward. There are failed and successful invasions, battles over lost love, worries over budgets and currencies, battles on the high seas, and women and men seducing each other for king and country, and sometimes for love. There's even a custody battle. As the French say, plus a change, plus a reste la mme chose.Although I had not read the first volume, I found The Confusion not confusing, but a delightful linguistic and suspenseful alchemy by a master."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Stephenson's very long historical novel, the sequel to Quicksilver is here! Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory.Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward. For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Perhaps, most of all, it was because Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which NASA tried to ban. The possibility of NASA and Government cover-ups makes truth stranger than fiction, which is based on someone's truth. Anyway great reading all."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Not much to add to what everyone else has said; for those of you who recognised the promise of Quicksilver, it pays of here, and for those who didn't, I'd perhaps give Stephenson a second chance.However, what other book can transform the image of French 18th century nobility sitting around, playing cards, into an hysterical comic scene and a lesson into market forces and financing? For that reason alone, this is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Neal Stephenson is at its finest, here. The charachterization, the storytelling, the historical reconstruction, are superb. You get to feel there, in the historical period, along with Jack and Eliza and the other wonderful charachters. Recommended for the lovers of historical novels, particularly the history of science (albeit even romance and adventure have their part,here).You'll get to know Newton and Leibniz as you never knew them, between a stormy voyages, amorous intrigues and treasure hunts. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This second installment is better than Quicksilver, which in turn was a great book. The high adventure, political intrigue, scientific meanderings, wonderful characters, and witty, sharp, yet emotionally charged and poetic language make this one of my favorite books. This entire series is fantastic, and this is my personal favorite of the three. Jack's voyage around the world is an unmatched high adventure, and the real selling point of The Baroque Cycle, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This book was a great deal of fun to read. Lots of deep, interesting, well-developed characters to love and/or hate. Richly plotted, but not like any historical novel I ever read before. The familiar names were confusing to me as this was fiction, but felt like it might be history. Possibly needs at least more generous footnotes if not a historical concordance if based on or extrapolated from actual history as much that was included is not found in sources available to the average reader. A good candidate for the Annotated series (Annotated Alice, Annotated Mother Goose, etc.) First page to last, a really gripping read, whatever genre it is or isn't. The writing is brilliant and carries the reader forward sometimes in spite of the content. Am anticipating enjoying more good stories from this author."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The Confusion follows two separate plots: that of the galley slave turned pirate Jack Shaftoe, and that of the off-and-on fabolously rich French noblewoman Eliza. As Stephenson leaves one plot to cover the next he leaves a cliffhanger, so you have to keep reading through the other plot to get back to the first and find out what happens. This isn't annoying or obvious since both novels are good and they tie in with each other - both are taking place simultaneously and Jack and Eliza have history together.I eagerly read the prequel to this book, Ouicksilver, when it came out only to be bored and disillusioned. The earlier book drags, and in a 600+ page book, thats bad. This is the biggest flaw of The Confusion: I am not sure if someone could read The Confusion and know what was going on without first having read Quicksilver. The plot is pretty complex and I had read the setup. I think skipping Quicksilver could be done, but wouldn't be best for someone trying to read and enjoy.The Confusion is an excellent historical science fiction novel. It is a very awesome book. However the previous book in the trilogy drags and would likely have to be read first. So there is a good book here, but you have to get to it via some route or other."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"While I don't concurr with reviewers of Quicksiver who found it boring, I have to say that the plot gets up to an orange-or-better ambient temperature in this book as the two main stories continue to unfold.Rejoin the fledgling scientific group, the Royal Society, as they tip the balance of human thought towards scientific reason, away from the magical or mystical world of the alchemists. Marvel at the intrigue, as their most accomplished member, and chair, Sir Issac Newton rebells, and reverts to alchemy, and religious fanaticism.Follow the spine chillng exploits of Liza (de La Zeur), our sizzling double agent, as she falls capture, then in turn begins to capture the thrall of the French Royalty and it's courts.Blush with gladness and admiration at the miraculous resurrection of hero Jack Shaftoe, as he begins his own Odessy, which will lead him from one bizarre situation to the next around the world in a megalithic adventure that bears paralells to the duller, more responsible historical lessons that this great series lays out for us.If you finish this book with no anxiety for the next one, you are asleep, and don't deserve narrative fiction. If you finish this book, and drop it like a thirty pound biscuit, to sieze upon the next even greater one, more power to you, and remember that there were those of us who had to wait many months for the last volume to be publsihed.Peace and Wisdom to all who finsih the Baroque Cycle. May your entertainment meter be yet surpassed by the next monolithic Stephenson effort.(In the meantime, if you need something great to read, may I recommend a little book called Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian - if you like it there are 5000 more great pages ahead of you)The Confusion, as a story of Lust, Greed, Adventure, Science and Commerce is unsurpassed, until it comes time to read The System of the World, and complete this giant novel."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Sometimes the middle book of a trilogy drags but not this !! I am glad I bought all 3 books (on Kindle) at the same time so I did not have to endure the suspense."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"For readers who have made it through Quicksilver, I highly recommend The Confusion. Whereas in Quicksilver, the Waterhouse chapters tended to be a bit slow, The Confusion focuses entirely on Eliza and Jack Shaftoe, who are more active, engaging and surprising characters. While Quicksilver set the stage, The Confusion gives us the fruit of its labors, a stunning and exciting tale of how Eliza raises her children, keeps in touch with Leibniz and the changes on the Continent, while Jack begins an amazing journey off the coast of Algiers, giving us an intricate, complex and complete view of the world at the turn of the eighteenth century. Stephenson does a great job of showing differences, in particular in terms of business, trade, currency, language and culture. The mob of vagabonds who gather around Jack all have incredible stories, and at times, this feels like a caper, in the tone of Ocean's Eleven. The book is long, just like its predecessor, but filled with details, anecdotes, and the great writing which we expect from one of the masters of contemporary fiction. If you felt that something was lacking from Quicksilver, then try The Confusion' and while reading, try to figure out what the title is a metaphor for."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is one of the most ambitious series of historical fiction in recent years and he does an excellent job of bridging the distance between 17th century and today by focusing on putting the ideas and persons in the context of their time. Having read through the voluminous series when it came out, I was a little hesitant to re-read the three books (Quicksilver, The Confusion, The System of the World) but my curiousity won out. I'm glad it did. There is so much information packed into the series that the second reading really made me appreciate the ideas and historical personalities invovlved.I also noticed something that had slipped by me the first time. Daniel Waterhouse, rather than just being a neutral participant in the storyline, really came out as a catalyst for all the events in the book. Even more, his transformation from a person scared into inaction by the fear of others' disapproval into a man capable of exerting his will to make the world a better place is absolutely central to the storyline and I'm sad to say that I missed it the first time. This slow transformation permeates all three books and I think it must something very personal to Mr. Stephenson.The other arguement for a second reading is that the events are so complex and the historical descriptions of warfare, economics and natural philosophy are often so detailed that catching everything after only one reading is difficult. I think of this as a strength of the book rather than a weakness, although some people probably do not appreciate the density of background material in the books.The Baroque Cycle and Cryptonomicon form an interwoven historical narrative and I think that they will stand as a great literary achievement. I do wish he'd intersperse more of his shorter novelsSnow Crash (Bantam Spectra Book)andThe Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer (Bantam Spectra Book)alongside his large works (Baroque Cycle,Cryptonomicon,Anathem) but I'll happily read anything Neal Stephenson writes since he has a gift for conveying complex ideas in an exciting and compelling way."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"THE CONFUSION can be every bit as confusing as QUICKSILVER but it is no less delightful. It ever manages that rare feat among trilogies of being a middle book every bit as good as the first. That the first was outstanding means that this is no small accomplishment.In the grand scheme of things, this can be read as a pirate adventure or, actually, two of them. The first pirate ended the first book being taken prisoner by Barbary pirates. It is now some years later and Jack is still a galley slave but some chums have cooked up a get rich scheme that is not quite as quick as it could be. It involves a diverse cast of characters and, before it is over, Jack has circumnavigated the globes, been a king and had many, many more adventures. Each of them entertaining.The second pirate is a more sedentary kind. She is a financier and investor who manipulates the English, Dutch, French and Germans with ease. In the process she manages to raise herself from an escaped harem slave to a multinational duchess.These two have a history from the first book but their paths have diverged since then. Even so, the duchess is never far from the mind of the adventurer. He loves her dearly and she loves him...sort of.It is a great story that can stand on its own but which is so much better when read after the first book. The baroque plotting and story line are refreshing instead of tedious. This is a masterwork."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Neal Stephenson is definitely a writer whose brain is so busy that he has to wear a cap with little aluminum cooling fins sticking out. I couldn't more strongly recommend the \\"Barock Trilogy\\" for any American who would like to learn more about this convoluted and corrugated time of world history, but from a more modern perspective -- as well as have a good time doing it. This guy is a James Michener with an attitude, a Leon Uris with a fake nose/moustache.As always, I felt that Neal's writing is more about events and ideas than about feelings; he is not an extremely sympathetic writer, and so his characters all share a tendency to talk much like a bright cyberpunk writer after his first double espresso of the day. The humor is brilliant, ever-present, and nervy. The fresh ideas jump out of every page. But a Dostoesvsky he is not.Bearing that little caveat in mind, and focusing on the events of the story and the turbulent time in which you find yourself, along with \\"Half-Cocked\\" Jack, Eliza, and Daniel Waterhouse (the man fortunate enough to be Isaac Newton's college room-mate, or unfortunate as the case may be,) this is one grand adventure, steeped so thoroughly in historical details as to provide a better general education in world history than many factual texts, and also providing a general essay on the history of finance, even making it fascinating to us art majors. (Quite an accomplishment there.)Largely the backdrop of this novel is a Europe ripped by its growth from feudal aristocracies into more modern institutions. It is becoming apparent that the mad obsession with gold which to a great extent drove the colonization of the Americas has some underlying occult motivations. Just what is this occult fascination, and how deeply does it pervade the controlling nobility at the turn of the 18th Century, is the question begging to be answered in the last novel, which I have yet to purchase here at Amazon.The novel is also a 17th-18th C world tour taken by Half-Cocked Jack Shaftoe, our protagonist vagabond/trader/pirate, whose misadventures keep sending him further east, through all of Egypt, Asia, the Americas (all through the eyes of a bright young cyberpunk novelist working on his second double espresso.) Swords, sorcery (or sham sorcery, if you know Jack) pirates, plenty of dancing and fighting.And I did once read or hear Neal say that an overall theme of this trilogy involves the idea that taking a hands-on approach to life, the universe, and everything, is the root of all true genius. I could hardly think of a more inspirational message for any book to give to a young person who has a growing mind, or really to any person at all.This book has a handful of rather adult language and scenes, but Neal is definitely not focused on sex or violence. It's more that a somewhat adult mind is required to understand some of what is going on, and a rather well-read one too."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I was one of the ones that loved Quicksilver, but only gave it four stars. As other reviews pointed out, and as was immediately apparent when reading it, &quot;The Confusion&quot; is tighter, cleaner, twice as action packed and dazzling. It's the intellectual equivalent of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;. The plot is truly baroque beyond belief. But I had already thoroughly suspended my disbelief by the vivid, compelling reality Stephenson has put on the page, sothe plotting is almost beside the point--I mean, this all could really happen, and DID in someone's imagination.You must read &quot;QuickSilver&quot; to tackle this one, but in my opinion Eliza's boring encrypted letters of Book One (which kept it from getting five stars) were worth it if they led to the thrills of Book Two.I eagerly await &quot;The System of the World&quot;."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This book is a blast. Faster paced than Quicksilver (all that character development stuff having been gotten out of the way) and as intense as Cryptonomicon. Jam-packed with scientific development, philosophical discourse, political intrigue and world history.. but at heart it's really a swashbuckling pirate's adventure tale. Think of it as a Bruce Willis movie for people with brains. When does the next book come out??"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The pace picks up considerably in this continuation of the intertwined stories of Jack Shaftoe, Daniel Waterhouse, and Eliza, Countess de la Zeur. The plot set in motion in Quicksilver continues to twist into fiendishly complex patterns. Piracy and quests, political and financial intrigue, and the evolution of scientific thought; you'll find all of this and more in the hefty second volume of the Baroque Cycle. Read Quicksilver first in order to not be confused by The Confusion.Jack Shaftoe, now a galley slave in Algiers, joins a conspiracy to pirate a Spanish treasure and escape slavery. He and nine other oar-mates embark on their adventure burdened with Jack's usual mix of good and bad luck. Sea battles, land battles and general havoc follow the cabal of misfits across oceans and continents.Daniel has a smaller role in this volume, but the role of Jack's more socially integrated brother Bob waxes into a remarkable war-filled journey to free his enslaved love, Abigail. Eliza, in the meantime, has lost her fortune and her firstborn son and must tread carefully to keep her head amid the perils of the French court. Eliza works to recover her son and wreak havoc on the financial markets of Europe.Jack's adventures from South America to Japan and Eliza's maneuverings in Europe draw you along at breathtaking speed with enough momentum to propel you through the 800+ pages. The pace rarely falters and Stephenson continues to make even the secondary characters interesting. He also maintains the obvious attention to research and detail found in Quicksilver. The Confusion neatly sets the scene for the third and final book as divergent plots start to converge, and I can't wait to see where Stephenson will take us next."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"For those of you who did not enjoy Quicksilver, try this one. I struggled to finish Quicksilver, sometimes re-reading the same paragraphs again and again, trying to focus, wondering if what I was reading was important to the story or not. However, The Confusion is a rollicking adventure mixed with wonderful historical trivia and sly references to future terminology (batna, anyone?), and I could not put it down. I laughed out loud in several places. This novel does require your full attention - it's not light reading - but the rewards are immense."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Stephenson writes for geeks. He writes with geeky methods. I can personally relate with Stephenson wanting to write using green-screen command line technology and devising elaborate organization schemes to track plots and characters with phase diagrams and such academia. I get it, I know what inspiration such exercises provide.The Confusion is the trip from Quicksilver to System. Its not \\"worse\\" or \\"longer\\" or \\"less\\" or \\"more\\" *anything*. It just is what it is - the necessary dark force between two entities waiting to be discovered, quantified, qualified, and catalogued. It must be read, chewed, digested, and all nutrients extracted.I think it is amazing that Stephenson is able to proffer work birthed from raw academic, scientific, and technological approaches and brainstorms, that is still accessible to enough non-science, non-geeky readers to get a nice cross section of opinions on his work.Reading Stephenson's work may be an exercise in literature for those who read books, and that is fine - it is a book afterall. But the images invoked are much more to the scientific and technology minded, those who think in binary, dream of system integrations, and invent new technology for the human race. They are sustanance.That's why sprawling is better. The mind can eat more, longer."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"If anyone had suggested to me a couple of years ago that I would be voraciously reading a novel set in the 17th Century, I would have laughed... hard. As difficult as it was to put down Quicksilver, I find the time spent with The Confusion even better, as the story unfolds, as Eliza, Jack, Bob, Daniel, etc. etc. (my goodnesss, even Enoch Root... part of his secret actually revealed!) pursue their lives and schemes. Sure, the language is a bit modern (and will probably be off-puttting to the Barock aficionado), but I've sat quietly and laughed out loud more while reading this than I have in recent memory. Now, if I can only get over my propensity to buy only softcover versions of novels, I might even buy the next installment while its only in hardcover. If you've read Stephenson and liked his style, you've got to read this cycle!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Once again I am flabbergasted by the quality of a book from Mr. Stephenson. The scope, as usual, is immense, showing the storytelling genius that is a hallmark of this author. As the book jacket states, the book cannot be easily categorized. it reminds me of the blind men describing an elephant. In this case, one could say, \\"It's a thriller!\\" \\"No it's a swashbuckling adventure!\\" \\"No, it's a heist novel.\\" \\"No, it's a sea story!\\" \\"No, it's a novel of political intrigue!\\" \\"No, it's historical fiction!\\" \\"No, it's a love story!\\" And many more. Stephenson again shows that his knowledge about a huge number of subjects is wide and deep, from metallurgy to geography to sailing. So the reader learns while being entertained and intrigued by the story, which is worldwide in its scope. Careful readers may need to consult Google maps, or the equivalent, as I did, when Stephenson describes Manila harbor or coastal areas of India. More casual readers can enjoy the story without supplemental maps.I enjoy Stephenson's works, including this book, Cryptonomicon, and the first volume of this trilogy, Quicksilver, in small doses, 'sipping', if you will. If you speed through a novel of this kind of density, you will miss detail and humorous lines and quips. Late in the book, for instance, look for the author's reference to a line from the song New York, New York, made famous by Frank Sinatra. And if you read more than 25 pages a day, IMHO, you will get overwhelmed. \\"NO ONE,\\" I tell myself after longer sessions with Stephenson, knows THIS much about this many subjects and can write about it so well.\\" MIchener looks boring in comparison.Stephenson is in the top handful of authors writing today, and I look forward eagerly to his next book."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The Confusion is a ripping tale that goes off in two directions. One follows Daniel Waterhouse around Europe and england giving the reader a good feel for what it was like to live during the time of the emerging enlightenment.The other follows Jack Shaftoe and his circumnavigation of the Globe. This is the adventure story that goes from Africa, to India, to Japan to Mexico and back.As the second in a series of three books, one could expect this to be a bridge between the first and last books. Nothing of the sort, this book is an accellerates and is worth the read on its own.Earlier I reviewed Quicksilver and found it good but a bit ponderous -- not the Confusion. Like Stephenson's Cryptonomicron, this book races through with action, interest and good storytelling.If you thought about dropping the series after Quicksilver, don't this book is a great tale."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I really liked the first book in this series, but to give you an idea on this book, it took me about 3 months to read (as I kept on picking up other things to read...). It also took about 300 pages to get into this one and finally retain a level of interest worthy of not taking a break to read something else.Why the change of pace as I read the first book quite speedily? Probably because of the change of focus. The first book dealt a lot with the slightly naive and stubborn Daniel Waterhouse. Stephenson's depictions of the absurd life of scientist experimenting with their craft in an era of absurd fashions and fear of the church were priceless. He was dry, witty and utterly, utterly readable.In this book, he changes emphasis to focus on the Jack/Eliza angle. Except Jack and Eliza have more or less gone their seperate ways. So, the first half of the book is largely devoted to Eliza with some minor tributes to Jack. Now, I'm all for championing women in this era when they were supposed to be delicate and suffering attacks of the vapours, but it got awfully tedious reading about Eliza's clever machinations of the male species and financial institutions around her, divulged largely through letters to certain informers and fawners. Somehow, the dry wit that surround Waterhouse doesn't surround Eliza. So, that tale was merely interesting. And long.The later part of the book picked up as the emphasis drifted to focusing on Jack and his scheming plans which take him around the world. Literally. The dry wit returns now, but considerably dimmed. However, the wild streak in Jack does make the story marginally more interesting.I lament the near absenbce of Daniel Waterhouse in this book - scarcely a mention at all and his part in this grand tale is surely the most reminscent of the dry wit of Cryptonomicon.Because so much detail is given in this book, it is essential reading for the last book. But be prepared - it maybe a herculean task! Just remember, its worth it for those precious gems with Waterhouse or whenever Stephenson remembers to put in some of that dry wit!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The Baroque Cycle is Neal Stephenson's latest fiction undertaking. Like his other books, it is set in a complex world. However, unlike his other novels, this three-volume set has a historical setting, and is reminiscent of Russian novels with its many characters and intricate plot. Three major stories intertwine, along with other episodes, through the three volumes, often intermixing in the most surprising ways. It has bits of humor, and many references to science and mathematics, as well as other arcana. Fans of Umberto Eco would enjoy this series.Reading all three volumes took me four months. As a whole, these books should be read in sequence, and if possible, in rapid sequence. Otherwise, it is too easy to lose the threads of the plot. It goes without saying that one would not get much enjoyment from reading one of these out of order or on its own.In this volume, Stephenson tells us that two stories will con-fuse throughout. Each chapter is also labeled with the name of the book, and the two books are intermixed throughout. Readers will be glad to see that Jack is in fact not dead. The first book of the volume opens with Jack working as a galley slave. He soon forms up a group of likeminded galley slaves and they formulate not only a plan to escape, but also a way to become fabulously wealthy. The story of their adventures consumes their chapters. Meanwhile, we see Daniel mature into middle age, until the point where he leaves London for America.The sections on Daniel's life are perhaps the most boring of the series, and thankfully are punctuated with episodes of Jack's adventures. Sometimes it can be quite difficult to keep one's attention rapt. It is important to make a mental note of even the tiniest details, as all do appear later in the plot. I found myself doing a lot of re-reading. Even Eliza's court intrigues could be a bit hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The Confusion is Stephenson's second volume in his Baroque Trilogy. It focuses on the ongoing adventures of Jack Shaftoe and the Duchess Eliza in alternating chapters.The good: more frequently witty, a real plot that is interesting at times, less European history didactic, some real adventure. We see a much more focused purpose behind the plot, like the story is actually going somewhere. I think it effectively builds for the climactic third volume such that you end up looking forward to reading System of the World. There are some real cute revelations that made me nod with appreciation, and some dialogue that I admired as quintessential distillations of that era, although many of the characters started sounding tiresomely alike, at times.The bad: it's long, and tiresome at times. For all that it's 800-ish pages, the story is wearisome in detail in places that seem to serve no purpose, but yet will jump about plot-wise at seemingly key junctures. For example, Jack is a multi-zillionaire with hijacked gold whose adventures to get that gold we have experienced through clever and well-written narrative. The next time we see Jack, he is a destitute fugitive in the Middle East, donating his blood via a gazillion insect bites to a local scientist. The gold is gone. What happened? This happens again and again, and it's just bloody bizarre. One still follows the storyline, and I see now why he did some of it now that I am reading Book Three, but I still am not convinced it was Stephenson's intent or an editor's scalpel to effect some of the transitions that way. While not as obvious with Eliza's storyline, this still occurs to some extent. Perhaps because I have not yet finished Volume Three, but there were some scenes that could have been deleted altogether.The ugly: Daniel Waterhouse's storyline is addressed, but is essentially put on hold. Like a two second cameo in a movie-- I'm still here, I'm still alive. I'm thinking about something grand and am planning an epiphany, but it hasn't happened yet. Newton/Leibniz likewise takes a significant back seat in this volume, and their roles were certainly the most intriguing part of the storyline.I am about one-third through System of the World. Newton and Leibniz are back. So far, I give it 4 stars again. I'll let you know when it's done..."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"With the continuation of Quicksilver Stephenson has done another great job in using history to buffer his story line, making it believable at the same time. As we see Shaftoe again, this time as a slave and eventually, well I will leave this for the reader to discover, making his escapades fun and interesting to read.Again, this is a long winded rendition of a story intertwined with history. This is not a quick read, and can be difficult at times to struggle through. But, with all that said, his writing is wonderful and the story line is fun and interesting. Anyone who enjoyed any of Stephenson's other books would enjoy this series as well (permitting you like history), and I doubt you would be disappointed. His sheer grasp of what he writes about, whether in sci-fi, WWII or in 17th century Europe, is enough to captivate and catch a hold of your interest."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Better than the first. Takes the story further than you could have imagined from Quicksilver. Less of Dr. Warehouse much more of Jack."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I read this about once a year. Every time I immediately start the next book because you will have to find out how it ends. Only buy this book when you have also budgeted for the inevitable expense of System of the World."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Book was well written and interesting and generally the plot and characters were good and interesting. However, by the end it did seem like it had gone on a bit long. There were lots of incidents and side stories that did support the general historical perspective and &#34;epic novel&#34; status, but did not support the plot all that much. By the end, particularly given the two_interleaved novels nature of the book, it made things start to drag a bit. That was reason I dropped one star."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I love reading about history of science. This Stephenson novel is one of his best. Strong characters and fine prose."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I just finished the second book in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. I am stunned. I think I have read some of my favorite fiction I have ever read. (I love Nabokov, Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, Mark Twain, Tom Clancy, C.S. Lewis). I am amazed the little intricate wordplay details and the immense arcs and wheels and systems of plot and character and themes he has woven into an entertaining tapestry. I blew through the last 200 pages like it was an action adventure. Like MOBY DICK, H. Rider Haggard, Patrick O'Brian, Herodotus' THE HISTORIES, Shakespeare, Alexandre Dumas, and many others all wrapped into one, and yet not a pastiche...carrying the quality and weight and joy and enlightenment of all of these combined. I almost was engrossed, and in the last fifteen pages wanted to rip the book in half I was so angry (due to plot, etc. not lack of quality...in fact the opposite) and then the last five pages felt a true catharsis and then the last page cannot wait to see how it all really turns out. If you have only read QUICKSILVER and were somewhat admiring and entertained, you MUST read THE CONFUSION...it delivers on so much promised in the first book and goes so much further and is even more gripping. I am starting THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD tomorrow. And when I finish it, I could start with book one QUICKSILVER and read it all over again...in fact, I would like to because I know I only probably gleaned 3/5 of what I could from one reading and will see much more now that I know more of the outcomes and plots and characters and interweavings. How can something taste like candy and yet satisfy like steak? How can one work of fiction tickle my humor, stimulate my mind, and stir my heart?"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I'm 80% done with Confusion, and I'm loving it!The success of this book rests on the much-maligned extensive exposition of its predecessor Quicksilver. Here in this book is the beginning of the payoff for wading through the exposition. I frequently find myself chortling over it: AHahhahahaha!!!There are a few dry sections, but they invariably end with a rich payoff, for example the statue that's planned in London for the Earl of Upnor! :-DTo explain the &quot;I told you so&quot; title to this review, let me paste in my review of Quicksilver:------------------Quicksilver is just the first third of the novelReviewer: Brian Hobson from Raleigh, NC United StatesI have read most of Stephensons previous work, I have read Cryptonomicon three times, and I just finished my second reading of Quicksilver. I have also read a lot of reviews here, many of them from people who loved Cryptonomicon but did not like Quicksilver. I might be able to provide a little perspective.One of the reasons I like Neal Stephenson as a writer is that his books are not an easy read, they are a bit of a challenge. I consult a dictionary more often when reading Stephenson than any other author I can think of. Cryptonomicon was NOT an easy read; it would have been very easy to put it down in the first 25 pages and it didn't really get rolling until after page 300, after the first third. The first third of Cryptonimicon was a lot of exposition and character development which was necessary to the unfolding of the story. Readers who got through that first third were rewarded immensely in the latter two-thirds of the book.I remind you that Quicksilver is the first third of the Baroque Cycle. It is stuffed full of exposition and character, somewhat to its detriment as a stand-alone book, but I submit to you that this is necessary to the unfolding of the story of the Baroque Cycle as a whole.After reading Quicksilver the first time I read some historical non-fiction about Cromwell, The Bourbons and the Stuarts, and an excellent biography of Isaac Newton that examined his explorations in Alchemy. I appreciated Quicksilver more on the second read with this better background; I understood better how well-researched Stephenson is and I was better able to absorb the story he is trying to tell.Remember Cryptonomicon: Stephenson is teaching us about the origins of modern computers. The lesson is not an easy one and requires some effort of its readers. In my opinion the negative reviews reflect not a weakness in the book but rather a weakness or impatience in the reader. Be patient, complete the cycle. I am confident that you will be rewarded for your efforts.------------------Sit back, enjoy your reward!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"After an uneven, but good read in Quicksilver, I entered The Confusion with high hopes and a little trepidation. As I suspected, my patience with the meandering of Quicksilver was richly rewarded with the Baroque Cycle's ripping middle installment. The Confusion is a great book and tremendously fun.I think summarizing the plot of an 800 page novel would be futile, and better done on the novel's official website. But the return of Jack Shaftoe in Bonanza (one of the two books which comprise The Confusion) has to be one of the great seagoing adventures of all time. From the Barbary Coast, to Egypt, Hindustan, Japan, across the Pacific and beyond he is the everyman of 17th century nautical calamity. If a difficulty could be visited upon a traveler, Jack gets it. I keep thinking of examples to throw out, but the action set pieces are so well done and so riveting you will just have to take my word - Bonanza is as butt kicking an action adventure as you will find.Jack's adventuring is interspersed chronologically with Eliza's intellectual maneuverings in The Confusion's other book - Juncto. Her political and economic ascendance undergoes horrible setbacks and personal devastation. In Quicksilver, Eliza came off as somewhat cold and manipulative and she was not entirely appealing as a heroine. The Confusion humanizes her and gets you pulling for Eliza to escape the Byzantine web of French and English politics.The Confusion uses the same speculative fiction elements as Quicksilver - examining past technologies through a temporal lens as if they were state of the art. Instead of some retroviral nerve agent, they have phosphorus. Instead of hackers they have cryptologists. This is technologically driver fiction of the highest order - fascinating, informative and fun. You just have to use your mind (it is fiction folks) and imagine when calculus was a radical intellectual development.The Confusion is a compelling story, deftly connecting the threads from Quicksilver and leading us to what will certainly be an exciting conclusion. Somewhat muted in The Confusion is Daniel Waterhouse and Natural Philosophy, but I suspect The System of the World will deal with both. If you had complaints about pacing and lack of action in Quicksilver, I can see your point but give The Confusion a chance anyway."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"While perusing the reviews of the first book, it seems that many people thought it was simply too long and packed full of needless detail. To them I say, Michael Crichton this is not. I also occaisionally enjoy picking up a book that can be finished in an evening, and is perfectly crafted to hold my shortened attention span, but this is not that book. Not only is it rather long, but it takes more time to read each page in this book than, say, the Da Vinci Code. For anyone acquainted with the authors of the period, it is a style that is immediately recognizable. Unlike, say, Jane Auel in the Earth's Children series (Clan of the Cave Bear, etc.), the lines of the page are not unnnecessarily filled with repetitive garbage, but with rich detail that add drama and humor to the events that follow. The breaks between the action are filled with dialogue so witty that I actually laughed out loud too often while reading this book to continue to read it in public.In all fairness, I have my degree in history, focusing on the period immediately before this one, and so am perhaps more inclined than others to enjoy the historical trivia that can be found in this book. Also, having been forced to read a lot of John Locke, none of the weird spellings and odd word usage that can especially be found in the dialogue of the English characters bothers me, and, in fact, added to my enjoyment of the book.I consider myself a fast reader and I had to work to get this back to library in the alloted 14-day period, but I also haven't enjoyed any other book that I've read so far this year half as much.For readers who liked this book and enjoyed being rewarded for paying attention to detail (as well as long scenes at sea), I recommend Umberto Eco's Island of the Day before."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Having come across the Baroque Cycle by recommendation of a trusted source, I entered QS (and the works of Neal Stephenson), tabula rosa, save what had been described in the recomendation. Although I found the first bit with Ben Franklin to be a bit contrived, I gradually found QS to be brilliant in its description of the broad-sweeping changes going on in the world, which made up for its initial lack of a clear plot (although I found the formulation of the plot to be interesting, in that as the beginning of a movement, it is only logical for a writer such as Stephenson to cover all of his bases, as much as excite the reader with action).After my excitement over QS, I felt the need for something great out of The Confusion, and for the most part, I feel that Stephenson came through completely. It is fairly clear that Stephenson is a completist by nature, so it only followed that he would follow QS with a book like The Confusion. It is absurd to believe that Europe was the only place in the world that was affected by the changes taking place in the world of trade and commerce. By dividing The Confusion into two books: Juncto, in which Stephenson portrays both the nuances of the move towards modern ideas of trade and government, and Bonanza, in which he elucidates the fact that the world had come to exist in a globalized state of trade and interaction between nations, which became the foundation of the globalized world we live in today.Regardless of the legitimacy of the historical information used, the fact remains that Stephenson effectively portrayed the world as a place in which any effect on one part of the world, has ramifications in every other part. The activities of Jack on a slave galley affect the lives of people throughout the Middle-East, Europe, North America, and Africa. And in doing so, Stephenson even manages to make the whole thing interesting."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Neal Stephenson's second volume in The Baroque Cycle, \\"The Confusion\\", is the best work of fiction I've seen from him in years. It is an intriguing, swashbuckling tale that is part of a three volume prequel to his celebrated \\"Cryptonomicon\\", of which this novel can be regarded as a historical fiction prequel. However, unlike \\"Cryptonomicon\\", Stephenson has offered an exciting tale of adventure, describing the advent of the information age during the end of the Baroque period and the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment. Here Stephenson continues his dual saga featuring the \\"King of the Vagabonds\\" - adventurer and former slave - Jack Shaftoe as he travels through the Muslim world, India, Southeast Asia and the Americas with a motley crew comprised of Northern Europeans, Arabs and a Japanese Roman Catholic priest and another, equalizing mesmerizing saga featuring Eliza, the Countess de la Zeur, Jack Shaftoe's former lover, and her encounters with colorful real-life characters such as the French privateer and naval officer Jean Bart. Stephenson has wrought daring sea battles reminiscent of Patrick O'Brian's best in the acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series. And like O'Brian, he excels in writing dense, descriptive prose with some rathering modern twists thrown in. Until I read \\"The Confusion\\", I thought Stephenson's best novel was \\"The Diamond Age\\", but this is not a \\"confusion\\" but instead, a splendid celebration of Stephenson at his best, crafting lengthy, but exciting tales of adventure."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"&quot;The Confusion&quot; is the second weighty volume in Neal Stephenson's gigantic &quot;Baroque Cycle.&quot; &quot;Quicksilver&quot; (2003) got the Cycle off to a solid (if slow) start, and if the concluding volume (&quot;The System of the World,&quot; to be published in the fall of 2004) is anything like &quot;The Confusion,&quot; it will be a story worthy of its size. Neal Stephenson comes through on this volume, and those of us who were concerned by &quot;Quicksilver&quot; can give a sigh of relief.&quot;The Confusion&quot; covers the years 1689-1702 and consists of two interlocking books, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Juncto.&quot; Since events in each book influence those in the other, they are con-fused so that the volume as a whole is less confusing; we switch back and forth between the two books, reading a few chapters in one before turning to the other. The approach works well. Instead of jumping back to 1689 in the middle of the volume, the whole story unfolds more or less chronologically. There are occasionally gaps of an entire year or two in the narrative, which is a little disconcerting, but helps to keep the plot moving.At the beginning of &quot;Bonanza,&quot; we rejoin Jack Shaftoe, King of the Vagabonds, some four years after he was enslaved by the Barbary Corsairs. A fever has cured his pox and restored his sanity, but at the same time removed all his memories of the past four years. Jack learns that he is part of a group of galley slaves - the Cabal - plotting to steal a boatload of silver from the Spanish and use part of the proceeds to buy their freedom. There is only one problem: the silver they capture turns out to be gold. Even worse, this gold has incredible alchemical powers - or, at least, so the alchemists believe. Terrified that their alchemical gold will be spent and thus con-fused with the common metal, the Esoteric Brotherhood will pursue the Cabal to the ends of the earth to get it back - or, failing that, to get revenge.Eliza, meanwhile, has involuntarily donated her considerable fortune to the French war effort after being captured by privateer Jean Bart while fleeing to England. As she tries to recover, the European economy is thrown into confusion by a series of bad loans and bad harvests coupled with the seemingly endless wars that have sucked up all of the continent's money. Eliza, along with &quot;The Juncto,&quot; a powerful group of English politicians, has the task of rebuilding Europe's financial system on the basis of trade, laying the groundwork for modern economics. Her task is not made any easier by the alchemists, who know of her connection to Jack Shaftoe, and hope to get to him through her.As I hoped, I found &quot;The Confusion&quot; more entertaining than &quot;Quicksilver.&quot; The pace is much quicker, and the action and actual plot development makes the volume much more engrossing. I occasionally got the feeling that more happened in particular scenes in &quot;The Confusion&quot; (for example, the Duc d'Arcachon's birthday party) than in the whole of &quot;Quicksilver.&quot; There's still plenty of interesting errata (as we expect in a Stephenson book), though Daniel Waterhouse is largely missing - he doesn't appear until about 2/3rds of the way through the volume, and scampers off to Massachusetts pretty quickly after that. Finally, the conclusion does a wonderful job setting up the final volume; I can hardly wait until it's out.Those who have made their way through &quot;Quicksilver&quot; owe it to themselves to move onto &quot;The Confusion&quot; so that their efforts can be rewarded. If you were hesitant about starting \\"The Baroque Cycle\\" after reading mixed reviews of the first volume, you can rest assured that &quot;The Confusion&quot; makes it all worthwhile. If &quot;The System of the World&quot; is up to the standard set by &quot;The Confusion&quot; (and I suspect it will be), &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; will end up as a masterpiece of massive historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"In for a pence, in for a pound: that's probably the attitude of some weary readers who managed to finish the first volume of Stephenson's Baroque Cycle and who surrender to the elaborate pleasures and long-winded aggravations of the second. And \\"The Confusion\\" has lots about pennies and pounds--long passages about coinage in general and bills of exchange and the development of paper currency in seventeenth-century Europe. At the outset, we are reintroduced to Jack Shaftoe, who is groggily emerging from a venereal-induced mental coma to an awareness of his now-inconvenient slave status. His swashbuckling adventures are chronicled in the section called \\"Bonanza\\" and Jack's bounty represents the old currency: he captures a ship filled with gold. Meanwhile, in \\"The Juncto,\\" Eliza, the former odalisque promoted to royal courtesan, is deviously cornering the market on the new paper currency in an elaborate scheme torn out of the pages of Early Modern Banking for Dummies. The two sections are \\"con-fused\\"; Stephenson alternates passages for each of them as the drama unfolds in time.I realize it's churlish to carp about Stephenson's logorrheic excesses; that, after all, is the intent of the Baroque Cycle, which is less a commitment than a time-suck. The author is to some extent imagining what Fernand Braudel's massive \\"Civilization and Capitalism\\" might have looked like had it been novelized (or con-fused) by Alexandre Dumas. Neither Braudel nor Dumas were known for conciseness and, unsurprisingly, Stephenson confirms the influence of both his authors in the acknowledgments.In spite of these antecedents, however, Stephenson has repeatedly and somewhat pointlessly insisted that the Baroque Cycle is science fiction. Sure, there is much ado about the debate between Leibniz and Newton over who first came up with the calculus, along with a steampunkish subplot regarding the invention of a primitive calculating machine and many \\"phantastickal\\" references to alchemy, but the science here is both soft and tangential. Instead, the Cycle falls smack in the middle of the spectrum of historical fiction bounded, at one end, by the traditionalism of Hervey Allen's \\"Anthony Adverse\\" and, at the other, by the postmodernism of Thomas Pynchon's \\"Mason & Dixon.\\" Stephenson's opus shares many elements with Pynchon's: set only a few decades apart, both works revel in a tonnage of punnage and folksy anachronisms; the same real-life characters (or their relatives) flit across the stage; both authors describe thematically the dawn of a new era--Stephenson, the Age of Commerce; Pynchon, the Age of Reason.But unlike Pynchon, who sends his readers scrambling to reference sources with every paragraph, Stephenson is inclined to elucidate every obscure fact--and I mean everything--for his readers. Stephenson's prose reads at times like the lectures of an ebullient high school social studies teacher: \\"Isn't history FUN?\\" Add some explosions, swordfights, intrigues, geekery, pirates and harems, and dialogue that mimics the idiom of a post-Renaissance Ridgemont High, and you'll keep everyone interested even when the material itself mires in trivia. What he neglects in the Baroque Cycle, however, is any attempt at creating believable human characters: both Jack and Eliza are so far-fetched that they may as well be cartoon superheroes: Jack plays the globe-trotting Iron Man to Eliza's brainy Wonder Woman. (I suppose this is the real sci-fi aspect.)If it weren't so much fun--and don't get me wrong, it is a lot of fun--\\"The Confusion\\" would be simply ludicrous. It's the guiltiest of pleasures."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Every trilogy needs a second act. Sometimes that second act has to do the heavy lifting, so that act one can make us care about the characters and act three can usher in a truly satisfying d&eacute;nouement. This volume frees up \\"Quicksilver\\" and \\"The System of the World\\" to play their respective roles. If The Confusion seems to drag in places, it may be because Quicksilver takes on so much weight that it takes The Confusion's entire voluminous effort to set up a decent third installment.At the end of Quicksilver, one can't blame the reader for being a little fatigued. The depth of Stephenson's treatment of every conceiveable aspect of the story gets to be somewhat grueling, and it is clear that he is casting a very wide net with this series. In \\"The Confusion\\" Stephenson's readers reap the fruits (or should I say vegetables -- big, hearty, filling vegetables) of Quicksilver's ambitious scope. The complexity increases, the characters multiply exponentially, and the settings are far-flung and diverse.The problem with this part of the series is that there is no discernible crescendo here, just a series of events that are alternately entertaining, baffling, and boring. The story moves along, but without the narrative dynamic that would justify this novel's existence as a separate volume. Instead, this book comes across as a place-holder in the very good series.I give this one four stars in retrospect. While I do not think that it earns the four stars on its own merit, its affiliation with the vastly superior volumes one and three of the series gives it a little more credibility."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The journey through the Enlightenment continues, as Neal Stephenson makes your eyes cross and your head ache with 900 pages of rich historical fiction leading us to... well, it's getting clearer, but we don't know quite yet.While Newton contemplates theology and nuclear physics, Liebnitz struggles to construct digital computers and relational databases, Waterhouse's Juncto restructures England's economic system, and Eliza of Qwghlm spies her way across Europe, Jack Shaftoe and his band of former galley slaves (including, for a time, the ubiquitous Enoch Root) take on planet earth with a raid-and-trade circumnavigation.Many additional characters, including William of Orange, Louis Quatorze, and at times, seemingly the entire population of Parliament and Versailles add rich complexity and dimensionality to the tale. Be prepared to meet the politest man in France, an Armenian slave spewing 20th-century busino-babble, gentlemen pirates, masterless samuri, a Malibar Queen, and Mexican Inquisitors. You can feel the world opening up to naval commerce and exploration, while Europe staggers under endless wars, market crashes, economic depressions (\\"confusions\\") and continuous political intrigue.\\"The Confusion,\\" unlike \\"Quicksilver,\\" leaves us at an acceptable intermission. Many threads have reconverged by 1702, and the stage is set for a another good-time tome."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Ever since I ran across Stephenson's books. almost by accident I have been hooked.. i', glad i found then at at time when this series was all published.. i'd hate to wait for the next book to come out."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"For this whole trilogy, I really appreciated a technologist's approach to history.

Two stories are con-fused in this volume: One of Jack Shaftoe and his adventuring cabal, and the other of Eliza and her economic and political machinations. From the first book Jack Shaftoe was one of my favorite characters while Eliza was one of my least favorite, therefore I truly enojyed one half of this volume while only somewhat enjoying the other half."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"We'll have to wait 94 years to find out, but I'm betting on Stephenson's work for this century.Just get this series, you won't regret getting through all those pages."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This book will reward your attention, but it's a wrist cracker and at times it's diffuse.

Its got great small vignettes (100's of them) in it that have nothing to do with the main plot(s), but DEAR GOD does it plod, stumble, shamble along over its two sets of very ornate shoelaces after page 500 and something....The arc of my peticular path through Stephenson's novels has lead on a upward trajectory away from straight-forward plot-driven, character-focused (with interesting \\"ideas\\" explored) towards intertwining plots with ancillary notes on historical psuedo-truths arriving in a vaguely unsatisfying conclusive heap.The result is before I mindlessly grab another Stephenson novel off the rack I'll wait for a review or two to ensure I'll spend the next few weeks reading the former rather than the latter.Avast!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This second book in the Baroque series may be \\"con-fused\\" but is really not confusing. A much more lively tale than Quicksilver, The Confusion literally spans the globe."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Stephenson's very long historical novel, the sequel to Quicksilver is here! Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory.Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward. For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Perhaps, most of all, it was because Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which NASA tried to ban. The possibility of NASA and Government cover-ups makes truth stranger than fiction, which is based on someone's truth. Anyway great reading all."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This is a beast of a book, wild, ferocious and full of mystery. One of those mysteries is the origin of the modern world. Using the medium of fiction, Stephanson strips away layer after layer of recieved wisdom and shows us how a few extrodinary people, and a great deal of ordinary ones, invented the modern notions of finance, banking, credit, trade, stock markets, globalization and the little matter of science. Yes, these people invented science as we know it. And Stephanson will show you the world they inhabited, page after page, untill you feel that you are amongst the greatest minds Europe ever produced.Which is not to say that The Confusion is all about dry academic discourse. The first page of the book finds Jack Shafto miraculusly cured of syphilis, wandering confusedly on a beach while a fifteen hundred gun salute is fired in the honor of the Caliph. From there, we are engaged in one of the best travelouges, adventure stories and general assembiledges of all out mayhem ever collected in one volume.In the spirit of equal oppertunities, this is not strictly a lads book. Equal time is given to Eliza, a former Harem virgin,and by her own wits and courage created a duchess in two nations. Also, by the end of the book, a mother of three.Now, this is a long book, and jam packed with details. Like the art which insipred it's name, the book contains ever increasing levels of ornimentation and detail, built on mathimatically and geometricly pure lines. Well, curves actually. Quite often, the reader can become lost in the welth of images and imagry. Not to worry. Stephanson provides both Newton and Liebinitz to explain the nature of those curves and ornimentation. Even if the titans occasionally disagree."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I loved this book. It's intelligent and even more importantly it's lots of fun. Now, I'm a literary scholar, but I'm also a rabid consumer of fiction--everything from Stephen King's horror to Robert Jordan's fantasy. I don't know what drew me towards this cycle of books. Honestly, it looked sort of boring from the outside. I suppose I was drawn to the wacky contradiction between the author and the subject matter. Here's a guy who's best known for cyberpunk, and he's writing a quasi-historical novel. Well, I chose wisely, because this book really suited me. It's fast-paced with a screw-ball tone. It reminds me of Pirates of the Carribean without supernatural elements. Also, this guy's mind is just impressive. This is a really good book, but I'd add that it's also difficult to wade through. This is certainly for the more advanced reader who enjoys plunging into history. But don't get me wrong. This isn't for the stuffy old professor types either. It's audience is somewhere in between--the educated and the adventurous. If that's you then I say go for it and take the challenge! Also, this one is even more fun than the last. Can't wait to finish this cycle."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"It has taken me forever to finish this book. I was disappointed by Quicksilver, which I felt the book was far from. In The Confusion, which refers to the con-fusion of two books into one whole, I found the \\"Juncto\\" chapters, focusing on politics and court, economics, and the mathematically-inclined savants of yore, to be slow and tedious, filled with long-winded dialogs and expository letters. The \\"Bonanza\\" chapters, however, where a fun ride. Here we focus primarily on the King of the Vagabonds, Jack Shaftoe, as he goes from slave to pirate to merchant and finally to \\"Leeroy\\"'s London connection. \\"Bonanza\\" is everything a good book should be. Sadly, only half of The Confusion is made of this great book-within-a-book, making The Confusion as muddied as the water of the Thames."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I think just as many people were bored with Quicksilver as excited by it and for those in the former catagory, I can only say that it does get better. Many of those complaints centered around the impression that the book wasn't going anywhere, that the plot was sort of nebulous and static and most of the time it was just hordes of characters talking about things that nobody cared about. Stephenson must have listened to his critics because a number of those problems have been fixed in this, the second volume of his enormous trilogy. This novel, still gigantic but not as huge as the first volume, continues the stories already in progress, but Stephenson cleans up the pacing somewhat by dividing the story into two separate novels, but cutting back and forth between them, which fixes a huge problem I had with the first novel, namely that you had blocks of exciting, action oriented portions of the story and then when that was over it was nothing but talking heads until the end, without any break or suspense. Breaking it up works so well that I don't why he didn't do it the first time out, since it creates a sense of tension by building cliffhangers into the story and by alternating the political manipulation stuff (Eliza's sections) with the adventurer/world traveller bits (Jack Shaftoe's) it makes the novel feel more integrated, a sense that it's all happening at the same time (sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't). The novels also benefits from having a somewhat more coherent (ie straightforward) plot, in the first book everyone manipulated and schemed but it wasn't clear if it was going anywhere and the apparent lack of direction really hurt the story, making it seem flat and somewhat bland. This time out everything is much sharper, there's a definite sense that all the plotting is actually building toward something, even if it still remains to be seen if we're going to build toward something grand or something abstract. But at least all the talking and scheming has some payoffs this time out, even if those are varying quality, it's nice to see plots move forward, even if it's unclear how they impact whatever main plot is driving the book. Also on a nice note, Stephenson has reduced the number of annoying footnotes, which were far more irritating than clever (again to authors: if no one likes when David Foster Wallace does it, we won't like it when you do it). And I do give credit to Stephenson for scope and ambition, this is big novel that spans over a decent amount of time, with a huge cast of characters and a wide area of geography, touching on a variety of moods and situations. I think Stephenson does a good job of putting the reader into the late 1600's with the characters and I can't really tell which people are historical and which are just made up (other than the obvious ones). So it's a definite improvement over the first novel, but I don't see it as a &quot;great&quot; novel, it's entertaining in parts, but I really only care about some of the characters (Eliza, Jack, his brother, even the Sun King is pretty entertaining) and while the plot is stronger this time out, there's still a sense of &quot;so what?&quot; pervading the whole enterprise, everyone is running around and talking and whatnot, but it's not clear why any of this should interest us in the least (although Stephenson manages to pull off a handful of memorable moments, while the last book really had none, it was so even) and the rambling, digressive nature of the narrative really is a big hurdle, without thrilling moments or exciting prose to make the slog worthwhile. I'll have to maintain that opinion that Stephenson's book is a fitfully entertaining diversion and not the historical-literary masterpiece some are clearly hoping for. But it's too soon to give any final opinions on the work as a whole, with one book left to go it remains to be seen how he can tie this all up and what he can make of everything. So while this was decent, and a big step up from Quicksilver, I think it's the last book that is going to decide everything and let us know if it was all worth it or not. Here's hoping."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"When I reviewed the first book in this trilogy, I was quite critical of the pace of the book - I found it a little slow and rambling, going off on tangents, often for reasons unknown. I still gave it 4 stars because I found the historical information in it so interesting and educational.The second book, this one, is more of the same in one sense, but it seems that the author has found a better pace. He limited the main threads to just two, Jack Shaftoe and Eliza (although some side characters get a little bit of exposure). Maybe it was that I now knew what to expect, but I found that there was a better flow to this book, and there was definitely more story. It's a book you settle in with, and then just keep reading to see what's next, not necessarily with a lot of expectation, but rather with the interest of an old friend meeting up with other old friends.Stephenson's research into historical environments and circumstances is as accurate as ever, and he once again shows his strength in describing it very well, while at the same time subtly pointing out how ludicrous some of it really was. Some of his descriptions go a little bit into too much detail (there is one episode where Jack oversees the construction of a factory to distill a chemical element, that easily took 30 pages on my Kindle to get through), but most of them were just enough to get a good sense of them. And some of Stephenson's summaries and examples of how the modern monetary and trade systems came into being is nothing short of brilliant.The other very positive thing about this book is that it stays more closely with the two main characters, instead of leaving it to mail correspondence to reflect the passage of time. I found those mail exchanges of the first book a bit of a cop-out, but in the second book they are applied more appropriately, and action takes place more immediately and is therefore more interesting, with more twists, and plain fun.I believe it is safe to say that readers who enjoyed the first book will definitely enjoy this one, and readers who became a little irritated with some of the more tedious passages of the first one can buy this second book, knowing that Stephenson has packed much more into this one. It's not a 5-star book, because I still didn't find it to be an absolute page-turner, but then on the other hand, it's definitely 4 stars because I enjoyed it and on top of that, learned a whole bunch of history I had no idea about!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I just finished reading this book this morning, after starting it months ago. It's been almost two years since I read Quicksilver, and a couple more since Cryptonomicon. In between the latter, I read Anathem and Neal Stephenson's short early novels; before Cryptonomicon I read Snow Crash and The Diamond Age. I have yet to read The Mongoliad or REAMDE, but surely will (after System of the World, of course).All those books have the Neal Stephenson style, more or less (duh) but of course each is different, and his style has evolved over time. I guess I enjoy it, because I keep coming back for more, and Neal does not disappoint. In my mind, The Baroque Cycle, Cryptonomicon, and Anathem are all similar, in that they are ambitiou long novels with multiple characters and settings and plotlines. But the feel of each is a bit different. If they were movies, I'd say Anathem leans toward mystery, Cryptonomicon to heist, Quicksilver to pop-sci, and The Confusion to action movies.Cryptonomicon is in a modern setting, The Baroque Cycle is in an historical setting, and Anathem is in an alternate setting. But they all share that detail, that dialogue, that witty language, that humour.What more can I say, except to repeat what I've already said: if you enjoy Neal Stephenson, I can think of no reason you'd not also enjoy The Confusion."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The second book is a fun read as the majority of the characters are already established, bbut the action slows down from the first book. Per the usual \\"second of a trilogy\\" book the main characters are sent out away from each other, obviously in preparation for the grand coming together in the third book. If you liked the first one, keep reading. If not, you won't appreciate the second book( and you will not want to read the third). To be honest, I like the Shaftoe characters (Cryptomonical was better balanced) and could have used more of Jack, but the second is a set up for the third so keep reading."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This book, like its predecessor, Quicksilver, is quite a lot of fun to read. There is not as much science (or, excuse me, Natural Philosophy) in this book as in Quicksilver, which disappointed me a bit, as I enjoyed those sections immensely. But, then again, this book covers a tome period when the Royal Society was in decline, Newton was verging on madness, and Leibniz was concerned with his philosophy of windowless monads(q.v. - if you're interested, Bertrand Russell's A History of Western Philosophy and the chapter on Leibniz therein), a scientific cul-de-sac, as it turned out. Stephenson's historical knowledge never ceases to amaze me. Having just read Macaulay's history, which covers roughly the same time period in England, I can assure the reader that Stephenson is spot on, especially about the battles Bob Shaftoe takes part in Ireland. On the other hand, verbal anachronisms abound. Just for example, a \\"haymaker,\\" meaning a roundhouse delivery by fist or sword or other object, didn't enter the language until the early twentieth century. Then again, I learned a new word.But all this is really beside the point, which is that Stephenson's picaresque style is just fun to read, all literary pretensions aside. Comparing him with David Foster Wallace (as another reviewer does) is comparing dates and pomegranates. These books, the Baroque trilogy, though perhaps \\"literary\\" in some quaint sense of that word, don't make any stuffy claims for themselves. ---Some devotees may makes these claims for them, but leave them to it.As for me, I'm off for more fun in my newly purchased copy of The System of the World."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The second in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, \\"Confusion\\" is much faster paced and more action packed than it's predecessor Quicksilver (which I nevertheless enjoyed immensely).Jack Shaftoe leads a band of vagabonds around the Middle East, and across the Pacific in search of Spanish Gold. Along the way he escapes from slavery, steals a shipload of \\"Solomons's gold\\", looses it all to a warrior queen and becomes King of an Indian province after a bizarre battle using phosphorus distilled from urine as his main weapon. All before heading for the Americas and the promise of even greater fortunes.Eliza, meanwhile, discovers that being a Duchess, wife and mother, need not be a bar to European financial and political intrigue. Her motive is ofcourse, sweet revenge.If you were bothered by the philosophical/theoretical conversations in Quicksilver, these are at a minimum in the sequel. More things actually \\"happen\\". But the plot and characterisation are still brilliantly complex and stay true to the original form. Obviously, don't read Confusion if you hated Quicksilver. But if you were uncertain, ambivalent or even mildly entertained, Confusion will prove well worth it."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"As many have noted, Quicksilver was just way too drawn out.

Fantastic."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I enjoy Stephenson's writing, when he's hot he's hot, but he's still working hard to learn how to piece together his inspired moments. Despite the floppy ending I think Cryptonomicon is his best book, but Confusion is second. Unlike quicksilver, which was a bit of a slog at times, I remained interested for the duration of this book. The descriptions were richer and more involving, perhaps more visual.The historic times and places of this novel are captivating, and I strongly recommend it as an unchallanging historic cavort."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I just love reading the words Neal Stephenson writes. I love the swashbucking. I love the intrigue. I especially love his many digressions into subjects banal to esoteric. When, after years following the Cryptonomicon, I heard that he would release 3 volumes of a trilogy in the span of a year, I hoped that each would be a thousand pages. I have not been dissapointed.When people ask me about Stephenson, I am never sure how to describe his work. If you define science fiction VERY broadly then it fits there, because it is fiction and science or technology plays a role. Snow Crash and Diamond Age were clearly scifi, Zodiac was more detective fiction, Cryptonomicon was techno-thriller/historical thriller. This trilogy is historical novel / swashbuckler / within a scifi or technothriller framework?!? In addition to the storyline which other reviewers have summarized nicely, the books deal with a variety of interesting themes like: comparitive social classes and structure in england, france, the german states, india, and a few others; the evolution of jargon; cryptology; the birth of modern science; and the birth of modern economics. And all this with a healthy dose action, how can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Really long, much lonmger than it has to be but just the same its rewarding to read. You have to make time for it but by the end I was happy I'd made the committment to it."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Stephenson's strong suit in his recent novels has always been along the lines of 'Lives Lived Large'.As mentioned elsewhere, this series requires concentration. The books are long, but rarely drag. There is far more action/movement in the second novel than in the first one, and the reviews I have seen consider this an improvement. Personally, I do not; of the two volumes thus far I prefer 'Quicksilver' for the atmosphere it establishes.While there are many characters, those that require your special attention in this book are not the primary ones. Anyone should be able to follow the adventures of Jack, Eliza, or Waterhouse. The 'minor' characters are vital. Keep 'Quicksilver' handy.The structure of 'The Confusion' does make the reader's task easier when compared to 'Quicksilver'.There have been references elsewhere comparing Stephenson's &quot;sea shanties&quot; to Patrick O'Brien. Ignore them; I've always considered O'Brien to be more a Jane Austin type and comparing the two is not appropriate."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Confusion is both the second volume in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle and also the best. It takes off right where its predecessor volume, Quicksilver, ended.Stephenson's late 17th Century setting is a most complicated place where cryptography is one of the most important endeavors. There is also a great deal of emphasis on the science of the period. In many ways, the reader feels totally immersed in the 1690's.Since this is the middle book in a projected trilogy, The Confusion does not offer any closure on the various and sundry plot strands. However, it is very well done and as such is worth the time that the reader invests in it."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"It's rare that I put a book down, however that's what I've done with this series. After reading the first book and somewhat liking it, then reading most of this second book I realized I didn't find all of the storylines interesting. The pirating parts were a blast, good action, interesting planning by Shaftoe et al, but then it's back to Eliza and dreadfully boring political schemes to make money. It was disappointing because she was the best part of the first book!Perhaps I'll pick it up again when my reading backlog has emptied out, but for now, it's not a big enough satisfaction payoff for time invested.

For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Perhaps, most of all, it was because Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program 'insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's 'Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which NASA tried to ban. The possibility of NASA and Government cover-ups makes truth stranger than fiction, which is based on someone's truth. Anyway great reading all."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"\\"The Confusion\\" is the second in Neal Stephenson's \\"Baroque Cycle\\" trilogy. This book offers more action and adventure than I found in \\"Quicksilver\\" (Book 1 of the Baroque Cycle) but in no way does this book sacrifice the historical and scientific aspects typical of Stephenson's books.Stephenson continues to impress with his depth of knowledge, engaging style and meticulous research. This is an excellent book in a fascinating series of books - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The book being reviewed here is one of three books which are from the Baroque Cycle Trilogy by Neal Stephenson. Since there does not yet appear to be one title under which I can post my review, I have triplicated this review and placed the same review under all three titles. The sequence is Quicksilver, The Confusion, and the System of the World.I read voraciously of both fiction, non-fiction and that in-between category of historic fiction in which one can learn considerably about the age but still enjoy the plot of an ideal narrative, or, in the case of the Baroque Cycle, an intertwining of several narratives. In the last say, three years, I have read literally hundreds of books and I can unequivocally name the three most influential works (apart from \\"Postcards of Nursing,\\" the one I wrote myself, of course,) during that period. They are the 20 Aubrey/Maturin historic novels of Patrick O'Brian, \\"Shantaram,\\" by Gregory David Roberts, and the three books in the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson.I find it hard to critique Stephenson's work. His writing and research genius is so far beyond my poor abilities that if I come across an aspect of his writing which gives me pause, I have to look to my own deficiencies rather than his. But nowhere did I find the book to be condescending. And the subtle (and not so subtle) humor was superb.And the characters: Ah the characters. When I had finished the books, I felt I *knew* Isaac Newton, Leibniz, Hooke, and Wren. Half-Cocked Jack and Dappa were real to me. Eliza lived and breathed.Also, I began to discover that I was beginning to understand the international monetary system and the trappings of power surrounding it. I began to appreciate the conventions of letter-writing, the mind set when years might go by between a correspondence and its reply. I felt I understood something of the tangled tapestries of royal affairs in the 18th century. I was transported. Utterly. Words fail me.Each book in the trilogy was better written than its predecessor, and the first one was superb. When I was reading O'Brian's novels, and was on say, novel #5 in the series, I was in heaven, knowing that I had 15 and a half (so to speak) more novels to go. When I was finally finished with 20, I started grasping at straws. I went to see the movie which, to my delight, showed me something of the ship HMS Surprise, but to my extreme disappointment, miscast Maturin so badly that it robbed the film of its portrayal of one of the most complex characters in literature. I read the unfinished #21. Not enough. It was only when I came across Quicksilver that I began to let go of the O'Brian characters and came to \\"invest\\" in Stephenson's.And yet, by the time I was halfway through the \\"System of the World,\\" the final of the three books, I began anticipatory grieving. I knew I might not see these folks again in such a personal light. They had become my friends. The fact that I had already read Cryptonomicon, a work by Stephenson based in part on one of the descendants of Dr. Waterhouse, was not a consolation. I miss those folks. I will probably read the books again in a year or two, but until then, since O'Brian is dead, and since probably Roberts will not top his first novel, I will have to wait for another of Stephenson's books. By the way, and this is not a spoiler, the resolution of the Baroque Cycle is thoroughly complete and intensely satisfying. It's just too bad it's over."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Sometimes I think Stephenson is brilliant...coming up with a history of the world during the age of Newton. Then again, it could have been executed so much better.Pros: Stephenson's quick wit and quick turn of a phrase. A huge story arc. A chance to correlate the events of the second half of the 1600's and the early 1700's in to an orchestrated structure. I enjoyed Stephenson's observations on the creation of the world's monetary and commerce system.Cons: This is hard to put a finger on. Its a huge tale and probably a necessary tale. It seems like Stephenson is trying to join the up the current state of all the countries (or colonies) in the world, American, England, France, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, you name it. In fact, the plot is too big. Little pieces of the plot are created and scattered across the world, then conveniently pulled back up to be wedged into the plot. Sure, that's the hallmark of many plots, but this is 3 books comprising nearly 2400 pages. After awhile you start to lose track...\\"yes...that sounds vaguely familiar, but when and where did I hear that\\"....especially when it was in the previous book.I saw one commentary where the writer estimated that critics would be studying the Baroque Cycle for the next 100 years. Maybe. The book has big aspirations and a huge scope. On the other hand, think about books that we continue to study 100 years later...how much fun were they to read? Kafka, Conrad, London (oh, wait...I like London), Dickens.The Baroque Cycle is more fun than the Heart of Darkness, but its a whole lot longer. So, there we have it...if you're looking for your next big reading \\"assignment\\", look no further. But if you want to be purely entertained, well, you might look somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I am a huge fan of Neal Stephenson's book &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, which now serves as a sort of introduction to the Baroque Cycle. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in Quicksilver, Volume One of the Baroque Cycle. The tome resembled Cryptonomicon so closely (same author, same size, same character families) that I could not help but get my hopes up for another such read. Instead I found it dry and difficult to finish, where Cryptonomicon had been a fantastic page turner.Then I read The Confusion. Now I think I understand. Quicksilver is not to be compared to Cryptonomicon, but to the first third of Cryptonomicon, which (I seem to remember) was a little hard to get through. It is the beginning of the story where the author is planting the seeds for later developments.The Baroque Cycle is twelve books, or three volumes (of which The Confusion is the second), or countless stories, but it is one read. The Confusion is the part of the read where things start getting really, really good, and if I know Neal Stephenson, the satisfaction will only continue to escalate in volume three.If you have already made it through Quicksilver, then you have arrived. Treat yourself and read this book... er.. volume."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"If Daniel Boorstin, Tom Clancy and C. S. Forester had decided to collaborate on an epic novel, this would have been it, except they wouldn't have written one as racy as this one is.As made clear in &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; Stephenson loves parallelism. This volume of &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; is two parallel but intertwined tales:- one of The Cabal, a polyglot group of a group of one-time galley slaves who risk everything as they transport a cargo of gold literally around the world- the other of The Junto, a pan-European collection of royalty, savants and merchants who accidentally devise the modern banking system in order to transport money without moving metal.Don't read these books if you're looking for subtle character studies (though there are some subtle and witty conversations to decode). However, if you've the kind of mind that's interested in everything and how it got that way, if you enjoy a hell-for-leather tale (or two) set in exotic locales and times, or if you like to watch a brilliant literary stylist construct a story as carefully structured as a well-done sonnet, then buy this book and set aside enough time to savor it."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"After reading Quicksilver, though I already had my copy of The Confusion, I had to take a bit of a breather and I read The Bourne Supremacy, though once I was a few pages into it I couldn't help myself looking forward to The Confusion. That's not to say that Ludlum is not enjoyable to read, but there's so much lacking in his work compared to Stephenson's.The Confusion, as many have mentioned, is a combination of two books, one following Jack Shaftoe in his literally round-the-world exploits, the other following Eliza, Duchess of Qwhglm, etc., as she continues to rise in Europe's aristocracy. It's an ingenious device to combine the two novels in one, as the reader is left with a cliffhanger in one chapter of the first novel and spurred on in reading the other so he can learn the outcome of the first.At it's heart, so far, the Baroque Cycle is a love story. Jack and Eliza are a classic couple, torn apart by forces (for the most part) beyond their control. Around them the world of the 16th century continues to swirl, a storm of political, economic and social change, which in reality left no life untouched. Jack and Eliza seem to somehow be caught in many of the pivotal locations and events of the age, and as readers, we get swept along with them. Along the way, of course, we get a dose of the science that Stephenson loves to explain, as well as a good chunk of geography, social satire, and humor.Stephenson, while he may be getting more long winded, is getting better and better. I hate to pick favorites, because there are so many incredible authors out there, but he is certainly near the top in my book. Can't wait for The System of the World!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy/Series is considered one of the great science-fiction collections ever written, forming the basis of countless derivative and inspired works over the past fifty years. The Baroque Cycle will not, unfortunately, inspire fifty years of copycats, for a unique reason: it would be far too difficult to undertake with even moderate effort. This is a nine-book/ three-volume masterpiece of historical fiction that really has no peer in my experience (and please comment if you find any!)As an aside, I could, at length, review each of the nine books and prattle on endlessly about this or that, but that's far too many reviews for what I intend to say about the Cycle as a whole. My comments apply to all books equally.The cycle begins in the mid 17th century and spans the adulthood of one Daniel Waterhouse, a fictional contemporary of Isaac Newton. Of course, it also traces the life of one Jack Shaftoe, a fictional hero with his roots in every pirate story ever written or filmed. And then there's the mysterious Enoch Root, popping up again from the Cryptonomicon to move things along as the deux ex machina of certain story elements.The number of interleaved story lines would be an impressive enough feat of writing, but the historical references were simply amazing. The sheer amount of research Mr. Stephenson invested for the Cycle must have been enormous. In short, Mr. Stephenson describes London before, during, and after the Great Fire of 1666 politically, sociologically, geographically, architecturally, and economically; he performs the same rigor of place-setting with Hanover and present-day Germany, Paris and present-day France, diverse parts of Egypt, Algeria, India, Mexico, South America, and Boston. This is the kind of book series that would inspire high-school students to PAY ATTENTION. For, if the students really do their homework and have a teacher partnered with them to put the book details into their proper context, you could quite possible craft an entire school year around the nine books, such is the depth and breadth of scholastic research involved in putting together such a series. It's no small achievement or idle boast: Mr. Stephenson has in some way taken his education and put it to its greatest use, as an inspiration to students.All of this would be for naught if the stories weren't truly excellent at their core, and they are. You could boil down the Shaftoe story line to \\"pirate story\\" but that sells it short after the first book -- and there are eight more to go. What starts as a pirate story quickly become something of a precursor to spycraft and terrorism/counter-terrorism in the 17th and 18th centuries: currency manipulation, political scandals, and assassinations. I haven't even mentioned Isaac Newton versus Gottfried Leibniz in the battle for Calculus, or Isaac Newton's Alchemy, the reconstruction of London post-fire, the gold trade, the silver trade, piracy in the Atlantic and Pacific, the timber economy, the commodities exchange of northern Europe, the court at Versailles, and so on. I'm astonished as I write this.This is well-worth the time invested to read, as a Cycle. If Mr. Stephenson ever posted his complete bibliography, or if some doctoral student ever decided to craft that two-semester, eight-course class tracing the book's scholarship, I would be among the first to delve deeply into it and re-learn my forgotten history, mathematics, and economics. Simply, this is one of the finest fiction series ever written.-Fred"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"The revolution of the western mind continues in Stephenson's second volume of his Baroque Cycle.By \\"con-fusing\\" (this is a Stephensonism, not mine) the fictitious lives & passions of the epic's main characters, Jack Shaftoe & Eliza, with real events and equally real/colorful characters of the late 17th century, Stephenson has accomplished something which no teacher before him has...THE CONFUSION con-currently conquers the following subjects (among many, many others):- the dawn of a truly global economy- the pre-teen years of the commodities & futures markets- the minting of hard currency- the injection of fiat- the role of the New World in revitalizing and further confusing international relations- the pioneering minds of the Utilitarian Enlightenment (not of the artistic sort that has come to dominate discussions of the Enlightenment).- the conflicting motives of the Roman Catholic Church, the various Protestant denominations, and the Oligarchy of the European nations/principalities of the latter 17th Century- the boundless nature of the human spirit- the nature of love itselfNeedless to say, in order to envelop all the above while con-fusing it with a story of such enthralling intrigue, the Confusion is a megolith of a novel... but it is truly as awe-full (full of awe) as it is awesome!Can't hardly wait for the third volume."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Put simply: this book blows Quicksilver out of the water. All of the potential that the opening act showed really did come to fruition in this opus.I'm not sure what else there is to say. To all of those people who gave up on Quicksilver because of its meandering and glacial tendencies, I would certainly recommend that you give this a whirl. It starts with the formation of one of the most unlikely cabals in all of literature, progresses to the hijacking of a ship filled with gold, then a circumnavigation of the world. And that's just half the book.Back in Europe there is all sorts of intrigue -- spies, alchemy, infedelity, etc. Of course, there are trademark Stephenson educational tangents about things that have nothing to do with the story, like how watered steel is created.Add it all up -- pirates, convicts, spies, alchemy, swashbuckling, war, science, and sex -- and it makes for one hell of a novel that doubles as a history book about the evolution of modern finance.And it ends with one of the best cliffhangers in recent time. I can't wati until October!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This is a slow-paced narrative, without a clear straightforward plot, which requires more reading patience that your average historical novel. But the style is rich and the characters are engaging and very well-developed. The reader will be swept away by an adventurous tale of slavery, freedom, and fortune-hunting, among other storylines interwoven in this ambitious work. Indeed, this literary tale might not satisfy readers of more lightweight commercial fiction, but Neal Stephenson is a great stylist whose writing will appeal to the scholar in you.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"After the apparent choppiness of &quot;Quicksilver&quot; I was a bit worried that &quot;The Confusion&quot; would fall prey to the same unevenness of the first book of the trilogy. I was also worried that this novel could suffer from the same fate as many middle books of trilogies. Fortunately, I found &quot;The Confusion&quot; to be a much more engaging read than &quot;Quicksilver,&quot; and some of the revelations within have caused me to reevaluate my prior assessment of the former book. A lot of the cryptic occurrances in &quot;Quicksilver&quot; are unravelled somewhat here, and the stage is well set for the final book of the trilogy.Stephenson's style has developed a depth and density over the years, and while it is my opinion that &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is currently the novel that exemplifies the balance of depth and entertainment the best (so far), I will not be surprised if time proves this trilogy to have an even more lasting effect in the mind's eye than any of his prior works. Given the popular and critical acclaim of the aforementioned novel, that's high praise indeed!"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Why you should read this:Stephenson remains one of the most thrilling of authors. His wit, his prose, his dialogue, his drawing of characters, they really are almost unsurpassed. We feel that Stephenson continues to improve as a writer in general and those characters of Eliza, Jack, Waterhouse, Leibniz, and Newton have never been so palpably real. For those who were thrilled with Quicksilver, we feel they will be even happier with The Confusion. The anachronisms will seem less jarring, the progress of the novel is more linear and easier to follow, the writing a bit tighter. This is the central novel of an astonishing trilogy of books and one should most certainly continue them once started. For those interested in the history of calculus and in general the Age of Enlightenment, this is not a novel to be missed.Why you should pass:We don't believe that one should begin any trilogy with the second book. If you've not read Quicksilver, then you can muddle your way through this book-and probably be happy with it-but really it loses some depth. As before, if you're expecting laser gun battles, space wars, robots, or other tropes of sci-fi you ought to go elsewhere for those thrills. While this is generally quick read, the book is long and therefore heavy to drag around. If length will perturb you, wait to read this book until you have the time, leisure, and muscle to take it on.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"It's rare to come across a work of such scope and depth, which challenges the reader, while remaining entertaining, and keeps up the pace for nearly over 800 pages, but the latest volume of The Baroque Cycle does all that, and does it with style. I've nearly finished it, and am already pining that it's almost over.Stephenson tells a story that is enormously complex. I admit to getting a bit lost at times regarding who's who amongst the minor characters, and occasionally being baffled by a plot thread or two. But the occasional 'confusion' just made me want to read more. Like admiring a work of baroque art, the mind cannot comprehend all the details at once: careful scrutiny is required. However, I often found myself too excited by the narrative to pause and gather my wits. Which is allright, because Stephenson has a knack for gracefully reminding the reader of what he may have missed.The structure of the tale is broken up, as the author explains in the preface, into two seperate books, interleaved with one another for the sake of clarity over continuity. But those &quot;books&quot; are woven together like warp and weft, forming an elegant brocade which, if seperated into its component parts, would leave us with something far less admirable.&quot;The Confusion&quot; is all at once an exciting adventure, an historical treatise, an exploration of the rebirth of science, a love story, a mystery, etc., and each of these is handled with enormous skill. Stephenson has written some of the most exciting pages I've ever read, and likewise some of the most intriguing and informative. I simply cannot recommend this book (and its predecessor, &quot;Quicksilver&quot;) enough."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"This is a solid follow-through of Quicksilver, incorporating the same brilliant style and prescient ideas.

The book is a piece of baroque in need of major editing. While there are a few imaginative places scattered throughout, it lacks prolonged life overall.

If reading Quicksilver was as much fun as walking knee deep through parasite infested muck, you won't find the traveling in The Confusion any easier."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I am intriqued by thick books. That said this is, like the first in the proposed trilogy, terribly overwritten. Half as long and it would have been a much better reading experience. Stephenson digress to the point of becoming annoying. Much of these digressions are completely irrelevant. Part Sci-fi, part mystery, part historical - the author seemed unable to make up his mind and that ruined the experience. Bigger is just not better in this case, in fact it is to the detriment of the work. Better, more thorough editing is needed. Stephenson is trying too hard to impress with his ability to write, and write, and write - but the result is a lot of words, but not nearly enough substance. Plotting is all over the place, the characters are cardboard and pedestrian, and trying to pretend his characters are better prognosticators of future technological developments than Nostradamus is just too much to accept."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"I genuinely hope Neal Reads this......Look, it's simple, MORE SNOW CRASH.end of comments."},{"Title":"The Confusion (The Baroque Cycle, Vol. 2)","review":"Stephenson does it again with this outstanding sequel to QUICKSILVER, proving himself as at home with semi-historical epics as he is with such futuristic tech novels as Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.

Some readers will be disappointed that little action of the white or black knight variety, or exported cliches of the kind that make Irish pubs the toast of the world, can be found in 'A Game with Sharpened Knives.' But this was never Belton's intention. Instead, hived off from the guns and bombs, Ernest Schrodinger, author of the most famous cat since the Sphinx, flees Nazi Germany and takes sanctuary in neutral Dublin, where the President of the Irish Republic, de Valera, has created an asylum for leading scientists. What could be cosier? But as Schrodinger combines a domestic menage a trois with the receptive tabla rasa of theoretical physics, he is stalked by an agent of his former homeland. Belton plays on the stultifying purgatory of a quasi neutral country (de Valera says divided Ireland is neither alive nor dead) to bring Shrodinger's cat home to haunt him, so that from one moment to the next, through the fog and the black out, we never forget the rumbling confusion, the sheer anxiety of ideas, that led to the war in the first place."},{"Title":"Game With Sharpened Knives","review":"I'm sorry, I just couldn't stay awake reading this thing.

The victim, 79-year-old Philip Bondy, was found dead with blood everywhere and his face \\"frozen in a twisted mask of pain.\\" (p. 24) Turns out that Bondy was just a stand-in for his Jungian shrink, one Dr. Gregg Furth who first sought the operation for himself. It seems that both he and his patient suffered from \\"a fetish or paraphilia known as apotemnophilia.\\" Whitlock explains: \\"The fetish is also referred to as a self-demand amputation, and involves primarily men who wish to have amputation of a lower extremity for psychological and sometimes sexual reasons. Dr. Furth stated he had been aware of wanting his own leg removed since his early childhood.\\" (p. 29)Whitlock, who has appeared on TV's Oprah, Regis and Kathie Lee, Hard Copy, Extra and Inside Edition, follows this with Chapter 2, \\"A Brief History of MediScams: From Snake Oil to Cancer Quackery.\\" Then he returns to contemporary times and shares what he has found out about \\"Dangerous Doctors,\\" managed care, nursing homes, \\"Dental MediScams,\\" etc. He comes down heavily on incompetent and fake doctors and on the medical profession for not weeding them out. Seems that you have to be a combination of Dr. Dracula and the Son of Sam to get the profession to notice that you've gone astray.

Unfortunately, his bias towards 'traditional' medicine and the medical establishment is obvious in his discussion of everything from chiropractic care to therapeutic touch. Chiropractors are little more than cheats and charletans, according to Whitlock and his proof that therapeutic touch is bogus? - a ninth grade science fair project.

Typically students learn these techniques and inherit the knowledge about them from someone in the lab, who \\"think\\" that they know what they are doing.

After the Packers cut him, he returned home and was arrested when he attempted a sexual assault on a plain clothed female officer. After two years in prison, he was on the street with a greater thirst for sexual assault. All of his murders were along the I-5 highway between Oregon and California which led to his nickname. It is believed that he was responsible for twenty-two crimes ranging from rape to murder.While this book was a great work of true crime, it also highlights the flaws in the criminal justice system. Randall Woodfield was incarcerated too many times for predatory sexual crimes to be allowed future opportunities at freedom. It is sad to realize that his murder spree could have been avoided. At the very least, treatment for his sexual deviancies could have been attempted."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Randy Woodfield had it all. He was the boy next door, a star athlete and he had good looks. He also had an appetite for horribly violent acts which led him to cruise the I-5 highway through California to Washington. Randy Woodfield raped and killed women through many states. It's horrible to think that someone could be so awful to do those kinds of things to another person. This was another great book by Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Another book by Ann Rule that couldn't be put down until it was finished. All the victims were introduced first, so we knew who was who when they were murdered. At times I found some of the writing to be disturbing, but most of it had to be said to try and understand the problems Randy Woodfield had with his sex life.I highly recommend this book for all adults with a strong stomach, but keep it away from the fragile ones."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"This is the first Ann Rule book that I have read. I found many of the descriptive areas of the book disturbing, however, it is a good reminder that there are people who commit heineous crimes who freely roam our society in search of a victim. Very graphic and not a relaxing read, but one that reminds us that in the right time and place, we can be vulnerable to people like Randall Woodfield."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"This book is a real gripper! 1 to 2 nites regardless of the time. My wife read the book and then told me about it and that Woodfield was the guy that was caught here in our area and that he was the guy that the State police used to stake out the West 11th ave. Taco Time for while she and my sister worked until midnite. They thought that because it was so secluded that he would possibly try to case the place. Well they caught him somewhere else shortly after that and then I had the story told to me. I wasn't very happy having my girlfriend and sister used as bait but they were probably safer on those nights. When ever we drive by the State Pen on I-5 in Salem I always say &quot;there is Randall Woodfields house! &quot; and my wife just shakes her head and I say honey tell the kids how you and Aunt Mary were part of the stake out to catch Randy Woodfield when you worked at TacoTime in 1981. Our kids just cant believe it when I told them how many people he had killed. It has been a long time since the book first came out but I read it twice and so this review is quite overdue. Enjoy- Skip"},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"While I find in some of Ann Rule's book she tends too drag, I found this one to be too the point without going over board with gorey details. While the subject matter is disturbing, it is true life crime. Once again Rule shows great compassion for the police and the victims while accurately portraying the rapist/killer without being bias. While this book in some areas, such as a seen with two small children, is graphic, the message is still clear. The victims in this book did not plan on being victims, but were just ordinary women who ran into the wrong man. I think the book, while very chilling shows of the dangers that women face in society and that often times they become innocent victims of crimes. While this is not one of Rule's best work, it is worth reading."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"For true crime junkies, Ann Rule again suceedes. For some reason, I finish her books in one sitting. Ann Rule is truly an american icon in the true crime sense."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I am a fan of True Crime, been reading them for about 22/23 years. Ann's was not the first one I came across. However, when I finished reading the first one I was just mezmorized. Not in the way of \\"ok my turn\\", in a way of amazed that somebody can do such a thing.Ann's First book I read was Small Sacrafices. Holy crap, how in the world can you do that to your kids? Anyway. I purchased another one, then another, then the next thing you know I am hooked.When I finaly got to this one, I actually had to put it down and set it aside! I had never had to do that before. The things he did, just sickened me. She put details in there, that were rough, but it's was happened. Again, how in the world can you do such a thing? She is a wonderful author. Learning that she used to set next to Ted Bundy, wow. Now I learned that LONG before it was in a book though.This man would start at the top of the interstate and work his way down, then go back up. This was his thing. Once in a while he would do something that wasn't him. Thank God he finally got caught. I was amazed to learn who was in the book.If you have the gut, on true crime, then this is an interesting book to read."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I don't know where Ann Rule finds the fortitude and perseverance to write about serial murderers like the I-5 killer, Randy Woodfield. This particular degenerate actually filed a $12 million libel suit against the author, which was dismissed by Oregon's federal court. More power to her, I say, for educating her readers about these sociopaths. This one began his career by exposing himself to women and stealing from his college roommates. According to the author, he blamed his criminal tendencies on his bossy mother and older sisters.If you look up Woodfield's case on the Internet, e.g. Wikipedia or the serialkillerdatabase, this criminal was even deadlier than Ann Rule could have known, when she published this book in 1984. By 1990 he was suspected in at least 13 homicides, not just the three murders she concentrates on in \\"The I-5 Killer.\\" In 2001 and 2006, DNA testing linked Woodfield to yet another two murders in Oregon.Woodfield was not only a serial murderer, but a serial rapist and burgler. He didn't care how young his victims were, as two of the girls he assaulted were only eight and ten years old, and one of his rape/murder victims was 14 years old.A major frustration highlighted by this book is the fact that Woodfield was never tried for the majority of his offenses. For instance, he was never extradited to California for the rape and murder of Donna Eckard and her young daughter on February 3, 1981. The Oregon prosecutors and police convicted him in an assault and murder case where they had accumulated their strongest evidence, including the testimony of one of the victims who survived two gunshots to her head. Hopefully, this conviction will keep him in jail for the rest of his life.Ann Rule (writing as Andy Stack) details the biography of Woodfield from birth through his college years where he was drafted by the Green Bay Packers and chosen by \`Playgirl' as a centerfold candidate. One of her reiterated questions is: how could a guy with so many opportunities throw them all away to cruise the I-5 freeway in search of female victims? She also narrates the macabre story of his extended crime spree, his trial, and his first few years in prison. I think she gets as far into the mind of this psychopath as any normal person can."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"'The I-5 Killer' is a decent but unremarkable effort by Ann Rule, the queen of true crime novels. While it does give accounts of horrible sexual crimes and murders by a completely unrepetent monster, the book lacks many elements of Ann Rule's better works: intricate courtroom drama, in-depth analysis of the criminal's background, and detailed chronology of the police/forensic work done in proving the criminal's guilt. I suppose all this is unsurprising since 'The I-5 Killer' is only about half the length of Ann Rule's best works (eg, 'The Stranger Beside Me').Bottom line: certainly very readable and credible, but Ann Rule can and has done better."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"\\"The I-5 Killer\\" is the story of Randall Woodfield, a multi-sport high school star who was drafted into the NFL after a successful college football career as a Wide Receiver.He had the same problem as Lance Rentzel of the Dallas Cowboys, a severe problem with exposing himself to young women. Unlike Rentzel, Randall Woodfield's behavior escalated to more serious activities like armed robbery and sexual assault. It's difficult to understand how that led ultimately to murder. The final number of murder victims may never be known.Woodfield has suggested that steroid use was a factor in his becoming aggressive.Ann Rule details the jurisdictional battles of law enforcement entities that were involved in the investigation. That battle may have been responsible for Woodfield's destruction of incriminating evidence in the interim.She also explains the evidence that originally tied him to the multiple crimes around the I-5 freeway in multiple states.The thinking behind California deciding not to prosecute the double-murder charges was explained.Randall Woodfield is a narcissist, totally wrapped up in himself and his \\"image\\". What's so puzzling is how someone with a popular social life and apparently normal family background could become a serial killer.Ann Rule tells the story of the I-5 killer in gripping style!"},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Ann Rule does a good job here of keeping the suspence at a high leval well into the story. This is an improvement on the &quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; where the public was partially familiar with the Ted Bundy story from news reports. It's also an improvement on &quot;Dead by Sunset&quot; which told the story of &quot;only&quot; one murder-with an obvious culprit. &quot;The I-5 Killer&quot; also features a truely sick and evil murderer-there is not the hint of good that Mr. Bundy may have had in him. The bad guy is really a bad guy. We feel for his victims and are glad when he is bought to justice. Readers who actually live along Interstate 5, especially in Oregon should be especially interested."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"\\"The I-5 Killer\\" lacks the elements that make Ann Rule books so fascinating. Granted that Randy Woodfield is a complex criminal, and his story is interesting, but when Ann Rule wrote this book she had not yet started delving into the perpetrators' pasts and psychological makeup. Like her other early works, \\"Lust Killer\\" and \\"The Want-Ad Killer\\", Randy Woodfield's story is a better-than-average true crime offering when compared to books by lesser authors, but not nearly up to the level of Ann Rule's writing today."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I found it kept my interest quite well. Not one of her more interesting stories, but enjoyable."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"As I recall this book, the author jumps from one situation to another only to pick up the original situation."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Rule's expertise; her experience; her knowledge and research about this book (the subject) and any book I've ever read by her seems almost flawless. She knows her subject and she has a splendid law enforcement background.She's also a gifted author.That should combine for the best true crime books in America. But it does not.THE PROBLEM: Rule's problem is flooding the readers with details that get in the way of the narrative; details that mean nothing; that makes her books so long one can become lost. I don't question the factual nature of these mundane, boring facts, for Rule is accurate; as far as I know no author is more factual.The book needs 60 pages edited out. Like all of her books, it is 20% too long because of the boring details.For readers of Rule, it would be wonderful if she decided that sometimes, less (really) is more."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I am a huge fan of Ann Rule's books. I've been reading her true stories since the early seventies when she wrote for \\"True Detective\\" magazines. Her focus on detail is amazing. She must take months to do all of her research. I have never read a book of hers that I didn't like. The price I paid for this book was unreal (a penny).The I-5 Killer, Revised Edition"},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"There is a good reason why Ann Rule is my favorite true crime author, she is amazing. I love the way she realistically tells the killer's story while respecting the victims. Great read."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Although I have read a considerable number of true crime novels, this is the first Ann Rule book I've ever read. I generally avoid books that have covers where the author's name is in bigger print than anything else, but as the saying goes, &quot;don't judge a book by its cover.&quot; Sure enough, Rule has crafted a very suspenseful story about serial rapist and murderer Randall B. Woodfield.I've seen a number of ...reviewers bemoan the absence of a rigid chronological approach in this book, but I feel that this book would not have been nearly as successful in conveying the horror of Woodfield's crimes if they had simply been discussed one after another. By first introducing us to various women who had the misfortune to become involved with Woodfield, we are even more shocked when some of them turn up dead. Also, this book is generally oriented around the investigators who were hunting an unknown serial rapist and murderer; these detectives were not able to piece together a complete catalog and timeline of Woodfield's crimes until late in the investigation.There seems to be no consensus about Rule's body of work -- whether or not she's getting better as time goes on, or whether or not she's &quot;lost it.&quot; Regardless of what you think about her writing career as a whole, &quot;The I-5 Killer&quot; is a gripping true crime story. Woodfield's life and crimes are introduced and explored from a variety of perspectives. This certainly isn't the best true crime story I've ever read -- at times it feels like the story wanders a bit, and sometimes there seems to be extraneous detail -- but this is still an above-average book."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Wow! What a page turner! I just bought this book yesterday and I haven't been able to put it down but just long enough to sleep and write this review! I have recently moved to a part of town with only one book store. I have been searching like mad for an Ann Rule book. Before I could find one that I hadn't read yet, I had to settle for some other true crime books. I didn't like them at all. Finally, I have another Ann Rule book in my hands and it is just what I wanted. Although I am only half way through this book, this is some kind of story. After reading a couple of other true crime books, I now know for sure why I look so forward to an Ann Rule book. The difference is obvious. This story in particular, is horrific. How can anyone be so cruel, so heartless? It boggles the mind. Ann Rule gives you insight on the killers home life and social life as a child and teenager. You keep asking yourself where it all went wrong. He could have had the world. True crime such as this is more than just reading. It gives the reader knowledge and teaches that you must always be cautious of your surroundings and the people that you meet. You can never be too careful. No one tells a story of true crime as well as Ann Rule. No one."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Though Randall Woodfield committed incredibly frightening and really unspeakable crimes, Ann Rule, when she wrote this, was apparently just beginning her writing career, and it shows. Her usual well-researched detail is not as much in evidence here, though she does better here than with Lust Killer and Want-Ad Killer. The courtroom scene was so boring that I found myself skimming paragraphs, something I only do when I've lost interest and want to get DONE.Anyone who's interested in Ann Rule would be better served by reading her later works, which are superb.When Ann Rule is at her best, she carries me along to the point that I'm up locking doors. In this case, though Woodfield's crimes were utterly terrifying, Rule seems so distanced as an author that the crimes' true impact is lost."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"The title of my review is kind of taken from the back of the book which I think is understandable. Again, Ms Rule has written with knowledge & with an edge that keeps one hooked from page to page. This book was the most terrifying I've read so far just because the killer, Randall Woodfield, spent a great amount of time in the area where I grew up (SW Portland) and at the same time when I was 16 years old (the age of girls he was attracted to). The bar where he worked is less than a mile from where I lived at the time. I probably saw him at some point but did not know it. I think that's pretty scary!Randall Woodfield was a sick, disgusting pervert that received exactly what he deserved...LIFE in prison. Ms. Rule's research states that he is not eligible for parole until he is the age of 81 years old. God help us all if he is still alive! This book just goes to show that you cannot judge a book by its cover. Even though someone may look like an Adonis, it does not mean that they are the same way on the inside. Randall Woodfield still is every young woman's nightmare. Ann Rule writes with such detail and really brought this story to life for me."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I have read two previous books by Ann Rule when she wrote underthe pen name of Andy Stack: Lust Killer and the Want-Ad Killer. Thisbook, The I-5 Killer, I think, is the worst in the Andy Stack Trilogy. The crimes of Randall Woodfield are so horrific and sickening that I felt my stomach churn with disbelief and anger. His crimes were not just relegated to women, but to children as well...Any woman or women who looked as though they would be free targets for his sexually warped, frenzied, psychotic mind would be the target of Randall Brent Woodfield -- the I-5 Killer. My summation does not do the horror in this book justice -- as it gets extremely worse and bizarre....Ann Rule is a tremendously talented writer and deserves every honor and Edgar Allen Poe Award for this difficult genre."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"Randall Woodfield seemed to have it all. Growing up he had a stable home life, did well in school, and was an exceptional athlete, excelling in every sport he tried. He was such a good athlete, in fact, that the Green Bay Packers drafted him. But Woodfield didn't make the team and he never finished college, instead drifting from job to job, from city to city. He also went from woman to woman, pursuing all of them intensely. Still, he seemed like a nice enough guy and people who knew him were shocked to find out that he was the I-5 killer, committing a series of robberies, terrorizing and assaulting young women, killing some of them.\\"The I-5 Killer\\" is one of Ann Rule's early true crime books and it shows. It's not a bad book, but it's not as good as her later efforts. Rule focuses more on Woodfield than his victims, consequently, although the crimes against the victims were horrific, I felt detached since I never came to know what any of them were really like. There are eight pages of photos, but only one picture of a victim, which also adds to the feeling of detachment. Woodfield's trial had a bit more detail to it and was quite interesting.This isn't a bad book, but someone trying Ann Rule for the first time should try reading one of her newer books."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"This book was a pure example that a sick mind has no limitations. Randall Woodfield came from a good family background and had everything going for him. But that still was not enough. Reading Ann Rule's books have made me aware that you have to be on guard at all times. You never know who's lurking in the shadows. Her books are not only shockingly true, they also serve to 'educate' those who read them. Once you start reading one of her books, you cannot put it down!! You will be wide-eyed and open-mouthed through the whole book.

I am a true Ann Rule fan, but I had trouble following this book. It was not written chronologically, and the transitions were ineffective. For example, she wrote about the murderer's job hopping, ending with his being fired from a certain bar. She later switched to when he met certain women, and we were back at the time he worked at the job he was fired from. I could not keep track of when things happened or who each person was. There was not much detail given on the players, and it was hard to formulate an attachment to any of them as a result. Worth reading, but not the kind of book you'll want to read again and again (like most of her other books)."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"This being an early Ann Rule book it lacks in some areas, including the meticulous detail that she is known for.

I WISH SHE WOULD STICK TO WRITING LIKE THAT ALWAYS."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"The first book that I have read from Ann Rule was \\"Green River, Running Red.\\" In a review for that book, I didn't like it much. I had read a couple of other books about the Green River Killer, and I found those more thought-provoking and interesting. But after watching a movie called \\"Hunt for the I-5 Killer,\\" I decided to read this book since I was intrigued.I also wrote before that I'm not much of a fan anymore of printed material. I far prefer reading books on a Kindle device; the reasons are obvious. They became more obvious to me when I read this book - which wasn't available in digital form - when my \\"real\\" bookmark fell out of the pages and I had to find the place where I was reading, a couple of times. That wasn't fun. That, and the search capabilities, and WhisperSync of digital. . . . I probably will therefore only buy books in a digital form now in the future.All of this said, I found this book much better than GR3. This book followed the true-crime pattern that I'm looking for: What was the motivation of the killer? What did the police do to catch him? What historical events were going on at the time? To me, these things must be answered for an intriguing read of this genre. Otherwise, I lose interest.One minor complaint, of course. Ms. Rule discusses the defendent at one point, saying something like, \\"He complained that women in prison only had female guards to watch over them. He thought that therefore he and other men incarcerated should only have men watch over him in prison as well.\\" She mentioned this twice, and I had the feeling that she believed that he didn't have a right to an opinion on this since, well, he was a serial killer. Wrong. Far be it from me to defend the man who was found guilty, but his logic was correct. Why should women held in the prison system get benefits that men do not? That is faulty logic from the author, if she is implying this opinion.Much better effort here from Ms. Rule. I will probably now give another book or two a try. . . ."},{"Title":"The I-5 Killer","review":"I have been getting back into my reading mode and stumbled upon one of Ann Rule's books and have been reading her collection ever since.

Why don't irrational beliefs die? Why do we, and those close to us, cling to odd beliefs? This small book is a gentle, clever, yet rigorous work which actively engages readers in developing scientific psychological thinking. This book is intended for both psychology students and for readers who want to better understand the pitfalls that often prevent us from thinking carefully about ourselves, our relationships, our thoughts, and our emotions.Why did people, who were just as intelligent as us, believe for centuries that bloodletting was the best medical treatment for most illnesses? Possibly, because most of the time ill people do recover (in spite of blood loss) therefore it was easy to conclude that the bloodletting treatment was responsible for the cure. In the rare cases in which the patient died, the explanation was that, \\"He was so ill that even bloodletting was not able to save him\\". They organized their thoughts to confirm what they already believed. Do you think we are beyond this 'confirmation bias' in terms of our beliefs about relationships, emotions, psychic phenomena, gender differences, and so on?I once had a student who had a strong belief in sasquatches, the giant hairy beasts that supposedly live in the Pacific Northwest. When I questioned her on why the evidence for these creatures was so lacking, she told me in a whisper, \\"they have the power to make themselves invisible and undetectable to skeptics\\". This would only be a funny and trivial story if it were not the case that Sigmund Freud had, and continues to have, a huge impact on our perceptions of ourselves by making statements about our minds and motivations that are just like the student's statement about sasquatches. The similarity is that, as stated, neither claim can be tested, therefore both are unfalsifiable.How to gently create doubt about our cognitive processes and consequent misinformation and open up learners or seekers to empirically based information? A frontal assault on individuals' current beliefs and ways of thinking may not be the best approach. It may only further convince the believers in psychics, horoscopes, alternate healers, and effortless self-improvement that empirical psychology holds nothing for them. It may have the same discouraging effect on those who are struggling in other ways with the inevitable problems that human beings have.In the war between the forces of organized irrationality and the methods of science, this book holds a unique place. Through a series of ten interconnected narratives or 'fables', it explores the cognitive processes that make us vulnerable to irrationality and provides a world view based on psychological science. Issues such as confirmation bias, illusory correlation, hindsight bias, attributional errors, and unfalsifiable claims are covered in the narrative format. The topics of the fables parallel the organization of standard introductory psychology texts. For example, the first five fables deal with critical thinking, sensation and perception, consciousness, learning, and memory.Both psychology students and lay readers have found this approach to be an active, engaging, and memorable way to learn.About the AuthorDr. John Marton, Ph.D has been a psychologist for over 30 years.

Why don't irrational beliefs die? Why do we, and those close to us, cling to odd beliefs? This small book is a gentle, clever, yet rigorous work which actively engages readers in developing scientific psychological thinking. This book is intended for both psychology students and for readers who want to better understand the pitfalls that often prevent us from thinking carefully about ourselves, our relationships, our thoughts, and our emotions.Why did people, who were just as intelligent as us, believe for centuries that bloodletting was the best medical treatment for most illnesses? Possibly, because most of the time ill people do recover (in spite of blood loss) therefore it was easy to conclude that the bloodletting treatment was responsible for the cure. In the rare cases in which the patient died, the explanation was that, \\"He was so ill that even bloodletting was not able to save him\\". They organized their thoughts to confirm what they already believed. Do you think we are beyond this \`confirmation bias' in terms of our beliefs about relationships, emotions, psychic phenomena, gender differences, and so on?I once had a student who had a strong belief in sasquatches, the giant hairy beasts that supposedly live in the Pacific Northwest. When I questioned her on why the evidence for these creatures was so lacking, she told me in a whisper, \\"they have the power to make themselves invisible and undetectable to skeptics\\". This would only be a funny and trivial story if it were not the case that Sigmund Freud had, and continues to have, a huge impact on our perceptions of ourselves by making statements about our minds and motivations that are just like the student's statement about sasquatches. The similarity is that, as stated, neither claim can be tested, therefore both are unfalsifiable.How to gently create doubt about our cognitive processes and consequent misinformation and open up learners or seekers to empirically based information? A frontal assault on individuals' current beliefs and ways of thinking may not be the best approach. It may only further convince the believers in psychics, horoscopes, alternate healers, and effortless self-improvement that empirical psychology holds nothing for them. It may have the same discouraging effect on those who are struggling in other ways with the inevitable problems that human beings have.In the war between the forces of organized irrationality and the methods of science, this book holds a unique place. Through a series of ten interconnected narratives or 'fables', it explores the cognitive processes that make us vulnerable to irrationality and provides a world view based on psychological science. Issues such as confirmation bias, illusory correlation, hindsight bias, attributional errors, and unfalsifiable claims are covered in the narrative format. The topics of the fables parallel the organization of standard introductory psychology texts. For example, the first five fables deal with critical thinking, sensation and perception, consciousness, learning, and memory.Both psychology students and lay readers have found this approach to be an active, engaging, and memorable way to learn.About the AuthorDr. John Marton, Ph.D has been a psychologist for over 30 years.

I wish I had this kind of book at Graduate school. This book takes the theoretical and puts it right into the day to day everyday practice of clinicians. It challenged my assumptions, beliefs and made me re-think different cases. What a great addition to psychology courses - I'm surprised we didn't have this kind of book at Graduate school. I really made me think, and when I supervise new clinicans, I'll use this book. Great book...."},{"Title":"Blood in the Ashes","review":"Blood in the Ashes is terrific! Just when you get the idea that William Johnstone is going to bore us with the IPF and Hartline, he takes a wild twist. It has been talked about for decades by sociologists that should a disaster of this magnatude happen, cults of all types would rise up around the world. The Ninth Order is as despicable as Sam Hartline, only more of them. And the surprising discovery that Ben makes concerning Sister Voleta is enough to have your eyes popping out and re-reading it to see if what you thought you read was really that. This is also another great example of how each installment of the Ashes series is a book unto itself, but a part of the whole story. Sit down, strap yourself in, and get ready for a wild ride. Just don't expect the story to slow down long enough to get off..and who would want to?"},{"Title":"Blood in the Ashes","review":"This book is full of deciet, while it doesnt fool you, the reader, it fools the characters of the book pretty well.

Ike gets taken prisoner and escapes with Nina to reek havoc on the Ninth Order while waiting to meet up with Ben on his quest to free the Rebels from the corruption facing them. Ben must handle an internal coup to overthrow him and takes some time away from the Rebels with his soon to deliver girlfriend. Facing internal and external corruption Ben must push forward and defeat the hatred thrown at him from a distancedelivering swift justice to those who cross him and seek to throw him out of his leadership. I got a good laugh at how Emil gets put in his place within the story, but I'll leave that for you to read. This book was an excellent follow-up to Aanrchy in the Ashes and gets Ben back on track as he seeks to go out on his own to complete his tour of the former USA, documenting life after the apocalypse. Excellent book and one of the best I have read in his series thus far. I'm on Alone in the Ashes now, and am loving it.

The book is a quick read that uses considerable facts to back up fairly interesting comments on the urban condition. It offers a very broad and general look at the social, economic, cultural and environmental issues as well as the government policies that have affected cities. It is enjoyable to read when so many other text books on these issues can be very boring. The only draw back I had with the book is the that it often focuses on presenting facts without giving enough commentary as to why they might be important, especially in chapters 2 and 3. However the remaining chapters did provide me with what I think are some valuable starting points for further study and interest with further reading as well. I would also say that the book is not limited to the Australian experience (although it is strictly about Australia) and could provide others from other countries valuable insight into the urban condition due to similarities among the developed countries of the world.Overall, a very intelligent book that is enjoyable to read, that introduces a vast topic to the inexperienced and with only a few minor flaws."},{"Title":"Australian Cities (Meridian: Australian Geographi)","review":"The third edition of this book offers an accurate, up-to-date and illustrated analysis of all major aspects of contemporary Australian cities (their evolution, their population, the changing patterns of segregation, etc.).

More than just an account of the various reform movements addressing the issue, Pegram also discusses the social role of drinking during the era as a way of explaining both what motivated the reformers and why reform was so difficult. The result is a concise account that packs a considerable amount of interesting information into a short, accessible book that is an excellent starting point for anybody interested in learning more about the prohibition movement or the role that alcohol has played in American history."},{"Title":"Battling Demon Rum: The Struggle for a Dry America, 1800-1933 (American Ways Series)","review":"This book examines the American history of politics and temperance during the 19th and early 20th century. In the late 18th century the local tavern was a meeting place for resistance and revolution, and became a symbol of freedom and egalitarianism. Whiskey and brandy were considered healthful or medicinal from Puritan times (p.7). In the early 19th century treating voters to drinks suggested sociability, equality, and the principle that the purpose of government was to help citizens. Others would say it was an attempt to corrupt or manipulate voters. Increased alcohol consumption was often followed by family violence and public disorder. Consumption between 1800 and 1830 was more than double from today. This led to treating alcohol as a social problem to be solved by temperance: drinking beer, cider, or wine, not distilled liquors. Men drank at work or in taverns, women and children at home. The spirit of progress and improvement, along with temperance, began in the 1830s. The religious revival emphasized the perfectibility of mankind, and the need to abolish wickedness. Temperance became the standard for middle class behavior (p.31). Alcohol consumption dropped to its lowest in the century in 1845. Efforts began to prohibit the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages (Maine 1851), but these were repealed or ignored by 1860.The factory system resulted in a permanent class of wage laborers who could never own their own shop, and this frustration was followed by more drinking (p.10). Increased alcohol use was followed by tavern and street riots (p.12). Science found that alcohol was not good, whether in whiskey or beer. This refuted the long-held beliefs from olden times, and was used to support attempts to restrict or ban alcohol.The economic problems of the 1870s and later marked the formation of the WCTU and the Prohibition Party. But some believed that poverty and hopelessness bred alcohol dependency, not the reverse (p.71). (Could this explain obesity today?) Most saloons were tied to breweries to provide outlets for what was now a big business (p.94). (Like gasoline stations today?) Many offered a free lunch with a nickel beer, often better or cheaper than in restaurants (p.104).Prohibition in America came about from the Anti-Saloon League founded in 1895. It was the first modern professional lobby composed of salaried employees supported by donations from the public, and millionaires (pp.113-4). Chapter 6 explains how this was done. Chapter 7 describes the background lobbying used to bring about prohibition as needed for the war effort. Prohibition would result in order, efficiency, and alertness (p.149); it would win the war and create prosperity too. Here's how the trick was done: the 18th Amendment banned the sale and manufacture of \\"intoxicating beverages\\"; many thought this only applied to whiskey and brandy. Afterwards the Volstead Act was passed to set the standard at 0.5% alcohol, which now applied to beer and wine as well! Instead of peace and prosperity, the 1920s had crime, violence, and then the Depression. Chapter 8 tells of the problems of prohibition, and how it was repealed almost as quickly as it was enacted. Some say it was a \\"noble experiment\\", as if ordinary Americans were laboratory rats to be tested by social engineers. This book is important as a short history. Are the same lobbying tricks being repeated today?"},{"Title":"Battling Demon Rum: The Struggle for a Dry America, 1800-1933 (American Ways Series)","review":"\\"Battling Demon Run\\" gives the reader great insight into Prohibition, its history, its failures and its repeal. It is a good comparison to the insane, un-winnable War on Drugs that has also had similar results. One would think that history would teach us something. Alcohol prohibition led to fortunes being made by criminals,corruption of law enforcement personnel and judges, rampant killings and violence, the rise of organized crime syndicates, harsher and harsher sentences for violators, more and more prisons built, and tremendous damage to many communities across the country.The difference at that time was that the Congress of the United States adhered to the Constitution. In order to outlaw alcohol, a Constitutional Amendment was needed since the act of prohibiting alcohol was beyond the purview of the Federal Government under the Constitution. When Congress passed drug laws the legislators saw no need to bother any more with such trivialities and passed laws that are clearly unconstitutional. The result has been a disaster for our country, Mexico, Colombia and many other countries across the world.Battling Demon Rum is very instructive to those interested in seeing how ineffective law enforcement is in going after victimless crimes and personal behavior.>>"},{"Title":"Battling Demon Rum: The Struggle for a Dry America, 1800-1933 (American Ways Series)","review":"Well researched and written. Informative, entertaining, and adds to an understanding of factors that are mostly ignored by other historians relating to the development of trade, power and politics in the New World. I would highly recommend this for students of history who wish to broaden their understanding. It is also entertaining and accessible and should be enjoyed by anyone interested in the role that the rum trade (and alcohol in general) played in the history of our hemisphere."},{"Title":"Battling Demon Rum: The Struggle for a Dry America, 1800-1933 (American Ways Series)","review":"This is a short history of the struggles for alcohol prohibition in the United States. Prior to the early 19th century strong drink was regarded as good if not medicinal. (Most houses had no central heating.) Women and children drank at home, men drank at work and in social gatherings (p.9). Industrial capitalism changed the economic fortunes of artisans and laborers, and there was an increase in drinking binges (p.10). The temperance movement started to grow from the 1830s on, as science discovered the bad effects of alcohol. So far it was just a personal choice, like styles in clothes. By the late 19th century effort began to control this choice by force of law. The newly powerful class of economic aristocrats decided to abolish alcoholic drinks. Since they would need to pass new laws, they decided on a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. Little by little, laws were passed to limit choices. As soon as one restriction was passed, they went on to advocate new restrictions. You can see something similar today in the prohibition of smoking. Laws are passed every few years, or taxes are raised. The end results becoming clear. Another example is the activities of Gun Prohibitionists.The Anti-Saloon League, created in 1895, spearheaded Prohibition. Rather than attack the drinker, they attacked the saloons where beer was sold. [Gun Prohibitionists attack gun stores and gun shows rather than gun owners.] The ASL asked their members to support the candidate, not the party. [Gun Prohibitionists operate in the shadows, and can influence officials better that way.] There were few women members in the ASL. [Gun Prohibitionists often feature women in leadership roles, even if the money men keep out of sight.] Control of the ASL remained in the hands of professional staffs. [Gun Prohibitionists use professional liars from advertising, public relations, and such.] The ASL ran on money donated by millionaires, and other donors. [Gun Prohibitionists are funded by front groups for millionaires, such as the Joyce Foundation or Open Society Institute. One millionaire created the Million Mom March, Inc; his withdrawal of funds ended it.]Chapter 7 provides a seminar on influencing laws. Supporters were asked to write personal letters rather than sign petitions (p.1210. The ASL promised low taxes, peaceful politics, and a booming economy. [Gun Prohibitionists also make promises.] The ASL made use of democratic innovations such as initiative and referendum, and primary elections to advance their goals, yet tried to block their use against prohibitionists! The ASL wanted home rule where they could win, but banned it where they would lose (p.123)!There are two things unmentioned (or unmentionable) in this book. First, the creation of public water supplies provided a safe alternative to beer (the historic remedy against polluted water). Second, the prohibition of alcohol provided a steady support to newly created organized crime (which still depends on local funding). Industrial capitalism needed criminal gangs to do its work in subjugating and exploiting wage earners. Were they needed to to the job that lawyers couldn't do?"},{"Title":"The transcendence of the ego;: An existentialist theory of consciousness","review":"The Transcendence of the Ego is Sartre's refutation and response to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and his idea that a transcendental ego stands behind consciousness.

That having been said, you will also find a man that was devoted and even affectionate toward the dogs he raised and bred. He was a consummate technician with breeding plans, and a driving force behind todays German Shepherd organizations. The book is replete with history, opinion, and proven fact.

Not only are the characters never developed, they are never true characters as they change with the flip of a page. The plot is a complete affront to anyone creative and the dialogue is an affront to anyone who has ever spoken a word. I actually used the word 'trainwreck' and I'm glad that my observation was shared by another reviewer. I don't generally like to give a bad review so think of this as more of a warning: Unless you want your pets/children/spouse to think you have completely lost your mind then don't read this book. You will continually close it and roll your eyes and speak out loud to yourself. It's that bad. In order to review it I was FORCED to give it at least one star.

Granted, I wasn't expecting much when I picked this book up, but I was disappointed nonetheless. The only reason I finished it was because watching it \\"unfold\\" was like watching a trainwreck. I could easily tell what was going to happen next. The characters were flat, cliched, and portrayed immaturely, the plotline was trite and about as believeable as a soap opera plotline, and the dialogue and inner monologues were stilted and immature. There is a sad lack of concrete detail in the back story, and I kept waiting for this other shoe that was constantly hinted at to drop, but it doesn't exist. I've seen better stories written by many of my high school students. Parvin spells out the Southern drawl of one character (but not others), in case I've forgotten what it sounds like and her portrayal of a 6-year old boy has him acting the way my girls do now, at age 3.

In fact, Mr. Burr's sister \\"Two Gun Annie\\" was Mom's school principal and recently passed away at a ripe old age. After hearing my mother chuckling, I picked it up, read a page or two and figured, \\"What the hee-haw?\\" I finished it quickly despite battling my widowed mother for possession of it.Small Town Merchant is a quick, simple read and captures the atmosphere of most every American town in its salad days. I was vaguely reminded of Thorntown Wilder's Horace Vandergelder and envisioned many similarities between Yonkers and New Jersey. If you are lucky enough to find an old faded copy treat yourself some rainy day to this book and some hot chocolate."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"When I picked up this book, I was only familiar with it for one reason: it is listed as the source material for the Stanly Kubrick dark-humor classis _Dr. Strangelove_. I was honestly expecting some sort of cold-war boiler-plate thriller in two or less dimensions.Thankfully, I was wrong. The book is an edge-of-your-seat adventure. It is a bit claustrophobic at times as the characters spar across the hotline and with each other, but these are real characters that the authors give shape to. In fact, in the early chapters I thought that the authors were giving too much back-story about the several characters to the deficit of the plot. However, as we readers began to see how the characters react to these very stressful events that earlier building is fundamental in moving away from my expectations.Although in the end I was very surprised with this book in terms of story-telling quality and with the twist at the end, there was a nagging sense of moralism attached. While I understand the drive considering the geopolitical environment this was written in, the moral of the story struck me as odd. Instead of looking at how we must respect the common humanity of all people, the book in the end delved into a neo-luddism that just struck me weird as preaching ultimately against blind trust in technology. While I moderately agree on the point, it just didn't fit. No wonder Kubrick needed the ending he chose."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Some parts i felt were a little long, and just dialog, but the ending was a shock and the majority of the writing was really good.There is also a movie that is pretty true to the story, so if you want an animated view, check it out as well."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Well... 5 stars for the suspense and excitement and three stars for the unrealistic mechanism which precipitates the crisis as well as the 'preachy' feel at times. Overall, I strongly recommend this book.Due to some mechanical/electrical malfunctions, a group of bombers heads towards Moscow with nuclear bombs believing they have valid orders to drop them. Any more story details will give away too much, so I'll limit the rest of this review to general points.It has an alarmist feel with regard to technology rapidly outpacing man's ability to control it, and I think in some ways it is quite dated both in terms of the attitude towards technology as well as the specific technologies involved. Of course, it was written over 40 years ago, so to some extent that is to be expected. The author's point that no system is foolproof is certainly valid, but I think this point is brought up too often and in artificial ways. It gives a feel of 'taking a break' in the action of the story and delivering a brief sermon, then resuming. The suspense and the tension in the story are gripping, forcing me to devour this book in two sittings.All-in-all, an exciting cold war thriller with a little alarmist philosophy thrown in, slightly dated but still a great read!"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This book is one of the best that I have ever read. It makes you think about how much could happen within our government that we never hear about.

It is a great book that I think everyone should read."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This is an excellent fictional tale of what happens when a minor electronic malfunction sends a group of strategic bombers with a nuclear payload towards Moscow. It is one of those short and hard to put down novels that you may be tempted to complete in a single sitting.Co-author Eugene Burdick was also co-author on The Ugly American with Bill Lederer. And . . . Fail-Safe has his same fingerprints all over it. An otherwise perfect edge-of-your-seat global war thriller is tainted with anti-nuke preachiness. The right wing characters are portrayed with near fringe craziness, while the anti-war crowd is, of course, reasonable and thoughtful. It is not credible and this lopsidedness is a distraction from what could have been a perfectly constructed thriller.This book was authored in 1962. As evidence that the scare tactics of authors Burdick and Wheeler were overstated, may I point out that now, 45 years later, the dreaded and inevitable human/mechanical error that plunges us into nuclear holocaust HAS NOT HAPPENED (no \\"buts\\" or \\"what ifs\\" -- it has not happened). Granted, there is a new problem regarding proliferation among rogue nations that would willingly use nukes. I will also cede that the authors revealed an uncanny prescience, in 1962, regarding the future role of computers.Still, a rewarding and entertaining read that will cause you to think about things that certainly should be thought about. I'll go ahead and give this 5 stars as a classic and important Cold War literary piece."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"I first read this book in high school and the ending practically knocked me from my seat. The characters and events depicted immerse you totally in the story, without going too heavily on the &quot;technology gets away from us and destroys us&quot; genre so prevalent in the sci-fi era of the time.An excellent warning about what happens when soulless machines are not watched by people who have them."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"In this day and age we have more to fear from a biological holocaust than nuclear destruction (though it is still there), but Fail-Safe helps to bring back the terror of the Cold War. It's Dr. Strangelove without the humor (yes, I know Strangelove was based on another book). It's a what if scenario, an accident. There is no one to blame. No one went mad. A simple accident, that starts the bombs on their way. This book is tragic, and written full of tension. But the best part is how it ends, which is too good for me to spoil here. This book is worth reading if only for the last few pages.

The first is because I felt the characters in the book (a Kennedy-esque President, not to mention they actually call the Soviet Premiere by the name Krushchiev!) were utterly believable. The second is for the end! It was a pleasure to see the deed carried through on the Soviet side, but especially to see it happen here stateside. I know I expected the pilots to be stopped before reaching Moscow. Shocking, real, and provocative, this is a timeless and timely classic!"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"It's a wonderful novel about the disastrous effects of nuclear war, the world should learn a lot from in the present scenario of warfare activities all around the globe."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Fail-Safe is all about the technology and problems with it during the cold war. After the plot kicks in, Fail-Safe becomes a griping novel that is difficult to put down. I really enjoyed the very suprising ending, it is a real shocker."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This is one of those books you can't put down. I read it back in 1973, saw the original movie )very faithful to the book) and the remake, all of which were excellent.This novel captures perfectly how something can go wrong with nuclear weapons. Even with all the built in safety features (so called 'fail-safes'), the missiles and bombers are controlled by flawed human beings. Several things make this book so terrifying - it is entirely believable, possible, and the consequences are utterly catastrophic. Aviation buffs will be enthralled by the B-58 Hustler bombers.This movie unfortunately was overshadowed by Dr. Strangelove which was more of a dark comedy.The Cold War is over, but the possibility of accidental nuclear war still exists. A classic, timeless novel. Author Eugene Burdick captures the imagination not just with a technological thriller, but blends the human emotions into the story perfectly."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"A group of American Vindicator bombers, armed with nuclear weapons, go flying past their fail-safe point, heading towards Moscow. A recall of the bombers is attempted, but to no avail. Several attempts are made to take down the bombers, by both the United States and the Soviets, but two of the six bombers still make it to Moscow. Facing total annihilation, the president has a tough problem: how to make the Soviets believe that the bombing of Moscow truly was an accident. The president decides that the only way to convince the Soviets not to launch a full-scale counter offensive is to sacrifice our largest city, New York City. I would recommend this thrilling cold war novel to anyone.One reason for my recommendation is because of the immense detail that was put into each of the characters. Burdick and Wheeler went into much detail about each major character's life, and how each detail fit into the story. A good example of this is how the book went into detail about General Black's dream about the \\"flayed bull\\", and it became easy later in the book to link his dream to the events that were taking place. The detail really gave the book a more personal feeling, like you actually knew the characters.Another reason for my recommendation is because of how that this book tied directly into the fears of the day. This book was published soon after the Cuban Missile crisis, and highlighted some of the serious fears that were going through American's heads. This book is based on one of the major fears, which was a fear of \\"accidental\\" bombings, or attacks. And, that accidental attack in the book is a result of another of the fears, which was that computers controlled too much, and that there was too much room for error. The reasons in this book really made it seem more realistic, and made it chilling to think that the same could very well happen today.The last reason for my recommendation is the ending of the book. It was honestly one of the last things that I expected to happen in the book. Though it made sense, it is hard to accept the fact that doing anything like that would ever be necessary. The thought of having to sacrifice such a populated city is not a pleasant one, but this book makes you accept that it could happen.I would recommend thrilling novel to anyone, but particularly those who have lived through the Cold War, because they would be able to recall on the fear that it brought. This book was very thrilling, and kept me on the edge all the way to the shocking conclusion. If you're looking for and exciting historical thriller, then this book should be right for you.-Bill L."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"&#34;Fail-Safe&#34; -- originally published in 1962 in serialized installments in The Saturday Evening Post -- and the earlier novel &#34;Red Alert&#34; by Peter George (1958) share many similarities. In fact, Mr. George sued the two Fail-Safe authors (Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler) for plagiarism and ultimately received an out-of-court settlement. Red Alert was the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34;, and Fail-Safe has seen more than one screen adaptation.I like Fail-Safe very much; it's smart, well-written, and engaging. It's definitely worth your time if you're a fan of Cold War stories. However, between the two books, I prefer George's Red Alert. It's more of a thriller and moves at a faster pace. I found the characters to be richer and there's certainly more action in Red Alert. I own both books but I recommend reading Red Alert first."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"I gained a better understanding of the cold war from this thriller than from any documentary. The military and civilian procedures, the dialogue and the scenes show what it was to live under the threat of thermonuclear destruction.Read in two days. A great plot. Captivating characters."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Way back in the day, my mom bought this movie for me as a kid. I was surprised, because I did not care for black and white movies other than Night of The Living Dead or Psycho. It became one of my all time favorite movies and still is to this day. I now have read the book and I love both the film and the book that much more. Fail Safe is about accidental nuclear war. During a check of a low flying aircraft over US airspace, a computer sends a go signal to a vindicator bomber group flying a holding pattern over Alaska. The bomber group heads into Russia to drop its nuclear payload on its target; Moscow. What follows is desperate attempts by the US and Soviets to stop the bombers from hitting their target. This book has it all, great action great tension, the greatest ending ever imagined and great characters like the hawkish Professor Groteschele and doveish Lt. Col. Grady posing debate about nuclear war, General Bogan's cold and brilliant command of the war room, and the steel nerve of the president while he works with the Soviet Premiere. This book is a classic for a reason and I recommend this to anyone who loves political/Armageddon thrillers."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Arms Race, Space Race, Cuban Missle Crisis. A book written describing the 'Red Scare' period of the 1950's 'Nuke' days, this is one story which shows the heigthened tensions both American and Russian citizens lived with and feared.While the story's focus aims at the political leaders of the two super power countries, the fate of the world truly lies in the intepretations and intoned language of one lower level administation employee.Well written and classic in presentaion, before 'Information Age' technology, when nerves of steel and patriotic beliefs were all the backbone one had to go by for survival, or possible destuctive anniliation."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Started reading and is an easy read. The movie is supposed to be a good copy of the book, and hence the interest to read it"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This is a novel that takes us back to the time of the Kennedy Administration when Kennedy's Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted him to send a nuclear missile to Cuba. The book is fictional but timely. It's message is true today. Like the earthquake in Japan and the nuclear reactors releasing their poison and radiation into the air and they can't control it.This book was written by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler. They wrote Fail Safe to show that nuclear war could break out by accident. It's message is sobering as well as frightening. At that time, other books or films shared the same message. A comedy on this very subject was \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" with Peter Sellers in 3 roles, including the American President. Nuclear destruction was sure in the air in the early '60's."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This novel, depicting a scenario where an American bomber erroneously receives a signal to carry out its wartime mission to drop 40 megatons over Moscow, is probably a top 5 novel in the nuclear war fiction drama. The novel starts out very slow with a deliberate and sometimes laborious development of the characters, but once the author finishes \\"setting the stage\\" by mid-novel, this book takes off into the stratosphere and is next to impossible to put down for the last 125 pages or so. A realistic and belieavable scenario, and a must-read in the genre even for a 40+ year old work of fiction."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Though by today's standard this book is quite old I found it very enjoyable. I have been extensively researching the topic of nuclear warfare for school and I found this book quite entertaining. As a teenager I am was privilidged enough to only live in the tail end of the Cold War and this book provides an insight to what might have happened if the you know what hit the fan."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"FAIL-SAFE is the most shocking thriller of the Cold War. The premise that a concatenation of mechanical failure coupled with deliberate human intervention based on computer logic could result in a nuclear death for both Moscow and New York is as timely today as when it was written in 1962. Authors Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler use the deeply buried War Room in Omaha as the setting for most of the action. It is there that the nation's top military brass must decide what to do when Group Six flies past its fail safe point on its way to drop two atomic bombs on Moscow. The characterization of Walter Groteschele, special advisor to a Kennedy-type President, winds up as the surprise dramatic center. Groteschele is a Jewish writer and adviser on issues of nuclear security, but as the time draws nearer to advise the President, the reader can sense that when Groteschele is talking about the options available to the President, he is really talking more about himself, reliving the hurt that his fellow Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis. He advises the President to follow up this accidental launch with a full-scale nuclear assault on the Soviet Union. Backing up Groteschele, Colonel Cascio refuses to accept the more cautionary advice of his superiors not to attack in force by trying to sieze control of the command bunker at gun point. The President orders his own planes to overtake and attack Flight Six, but they fail, and he is faced with the unforgiving inevitability of convincing the Russians that the destruction of their capitol was a mistake. His only option: to destroy New York City with the same type bombs that fell on Moscow. This is done and peace returns to a badly shaken world.The pace of FAIL-SAFE is rapid and suggests that in the real-life occurrence of such an event, all decisions must be equally rapid and decisive. It is both disturbing and comforting to know that for each Groteschele advising escalation to each American and Russian leader, that such criers of doom often give away their true inner motivation in tones clear enough for all men of reason to heed."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"i haven't read the book yet but i will pretty soon. i just saw the movie yesterday and i am still stunned about it. it was so intense and it really makes you think about how fast something like that can happen...about ten countries in the world have nuc's and i think that is scary......"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This novle goes far beond the thrillers in today's movies. It makes you aware of how close the world is to an accedental distruction. Acording to Murphy's law this will happen, weather it's mechanical or human error we will suffer for our own creations."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"The real thing? The best ever? You Amazon reviewers let me down again. I didn't mind that it was 44 yrs old and quite dated. Still, the authors didn't convince me they had even done their 1960's homework. Example: the authors always have military personnel pulling \\"levers,\\" whether in the state-of-the-art war room, or the command bunker in DC. That's right, levers! To pull up Big Board displays? They also have the Vindicator bombers launching Bloodhound missiles which have remote-controlled thrust capabilities. The pilot asks his co-pilot, \\"How much more speed can you get from the Bloodhounds by putting them on fullblast?\\" Fullblast? Nice USAF lingo, right out of a kid's dime novel, or a 1950's Flash Gordon flick. And remote-control variable thrust missiles? Get real. The novel had import in its day solely because of its premise: that no system is perfect, and therefore accidental nuclear war IS possible. But its authors certainly couldn't be praised for their stilted prose or their obvious disdain for fact-checking and technical accuracy. Michael Crichton did a far more eloquent job explaining how even the most perfect system can fail in his description of chaos theory in Jurassic Park. And finally, the most unrealistic and unbelieveable gimmick was the ending, which I shall not spoil for you. You want a modern version of this novel? Eric L. Harry does a better job in his 1994 novel \\"Arc Light,\\" which is technically more accurate, and reads better. Eric L. Harry's president even reminds me of crazy Howard Dean - HeeHaw! Imagine if he'd become president? Another option for you is Tom Clancy's \\"The Sum of All Fears.\\" Clancy writes well, knows his history, takes time to do the technical research and fact-checking, and succeeds in creating a believeable scenario whereby a nuclear confrontation between the superpowers might come about. Ironically, the movie based on Fail Safe was better than the movie based on Clancy's novel. But Dr. Strangelove is still my favorite story of accidental nuclear war."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"In the novel Fail Safe, nuclear war destroys the cities of Moscow and New York.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"i really don't like this book just look for information on it for my english report"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"The arms race takes a turn for the worst as a nuclear strike is accidentally started. The fate of millions depends on the diplomacy of the highest echelons of government and the act of one man. It all seems like a bad movie plot now but thirty years ago, this was the fear in the hearts of all. I read this book in 1982 when the nuclear threat was still quite real but nowhere near as intense as it was during the early 60's. You'll finish reading this book wondering, &quot;Were we ever this close to the end of the world?&quot;. The greatest horror stories are the ones that could actually happen. As dated as it is, Eugene Burdick still manages to take you on a wild ride to the Apocalypse."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Although somewhat dated, \\"Fail-Safe\\" is a taught novel that ranks among the best Cold War thrillers. The characters have real depth, and the writing moves at a brisk, tense...but not hurried pace. In fact, the authors do such an excellent job of cranking up the tension in one long, slow pull, I felt almost physically drained upon finishing it.Of particular note, the authors have succeeded in writing a novel that operates on two levels. In the tradition of \\"On the Beach\\" by Shute, \\"Fail-Safe\\" is both a gripping novel, and a thoughtful commentary on the almost absurd politics of the Cold War. The authors examine what was at the time a very real concern about the hair-trigger between peace and global destruction; the concern that machines were supplanting humans. In so doing they reveal more about the mentality of the Cold War than many works of history.In the end, \\"Fail-Safe\\" does a superb job of capturing the terror of the Cold War. It succeeds as both a thriller, and as a work of thought provoking literature. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"I had read this book maybe 40 years ago when I was in school.

If you read the book, follow it up with the movie... the original (black and white) NOT the remake! Larry Hagman plays the role of Buck superbly!!!!!"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"A fictionalized, but chillingly realistic depiction of the men and machines who nearly brought the world to extinction during the height of the Cold War. An unidentified blip approaching North America appears on an automated tracking system. Is this the long-feared attack, or just another in an endless series of false alarms? Rather than find out after it's too late, the bombers are once again sent out, none of them certain if it's just another drill, or the real thing. But this time a mechanical failure in the automated system causes the bombers to go beyond their Fail Safe points, past which there is no return. Should we go ahead and launch an incapacitating first strike, since retaliation is assured anyway? Or do we help the enemy to shoot down our own planes, hoping to avert nuclear holocaust?Among the cast of spare-drawn characters is Peter Buck, a natural linguist who is the White House's Russian translator despite his acute disinterest in politics, General Bogan, commanding officer of the information center known as the War Room, Colonel Cascio, who can't quite escape the poverty of his working-class roots, Lieutenant Colonel Grady, commander of a group of Vindicator bombers, and the President, who is faced with a situation that could win the Cold War - or destroy human civilization. The action takes place amidst the bomber group and in the War Room, but especially in the calculating minds of the men charged with making the most dangerous of all possible decisions.As one might expect from a forty-year-old novel, the technology is rather out of date, but the moral lesson is as strong as ever. Every system, no matter how redundant, will eventually break down, making nuclear weapons far too dangerous to keep around. The president's final, grim decision is a lesson in moral courage, but even that may be insufficient in the dangerous years ahead, as nuclear proliferation continues. Written very convincingly in simple and straightforward prose, this book is not so much an entertainment as a call for political action. Let's get rid of these things before it's too late for all of us."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Although it is now close to FORTY years old, &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; puts today's crop of political novelist to shame. A more compelling story has not been written.The story is simple: a mechanical error send a group of U.S. Bombers towards the Soviet Union. The President tries mightily to recall them, in an effort to avoid the inevitable Soviet retaliation. He has to make an incredible sacrifice to keep the world from World War III.Forget about the incredibly complex turns of my favorite writer of this genre, F. Forsyth. T. Clancy 's interwoven stories and mind numbing detail does not even come close to this simple, chilling story. Could it happen? Of course not, because of the fail-safe system. Or so they tell us...Like Coke, this is the real thing."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"I first read this book back in junior high school shortly after it had originally been published (I'm dating myself here). It was a cutting edge thriller then and the subsequent movie was Dr. Strangelove without the laughs. I read it again recently and while it pales pyrotechnically (and just plain technically) compared to Tom Clancy fare, it is a thrilling snapshot of the paranoia of the early 60's."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"The ultimate &quot;What if...&quot; novel of the post-War era, FAIL-SAFE still holds up remarkably [and tragically] well in the post-9/11 era. Several critics have pointed up the political aspects of this book, but in a way this is more of a sci-fi novel in the sense that the technology of war would safeguard us against danger when the opposite is the truth: reliance upon technology is equally dangerous. Read this novel as a precursor to the film &quot;War Games&quot; or the t.v. movie of early 70s, &quot;Colossus: The Forbin Project&quot;.But even as political thriller, this book is still powerful. All the characters stand up well and are truly believeable. The plot and pacing are gripping. Considering Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler had had no real writing experience previous to FAIL-SAFE, it is just as compelling and well-crafted as anything written by Tom Clancy. That's how good this book is.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS"},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"Fail Safe epitomized the dangers of the Cold War, and no less than Herman Kahn at the famous Hudson Institute think tank gave the novel's thesis even more credibility by predicting that every year there was a 2 percent chance of the U.S. and Soviet Union having a nuclear war. It was scary stuff, and as a young junior high student reading about the world for the first time, I ate it up, wondering if there was a future for the human race after all.For many years, I was certain that the 35,000 nuclear weapons that the U.S. had built, along with the tens of thousands built by the Soviets at the height of the Cold War, were simply too impressive an arsenal not to lob at least a few of them at each other at some point, so no one was more surprised than I when nothing of the sort ever happened, not to mention the fact that the Cuban Missile crisis of 1962 was a harrowing recent memory for Americans. But fortunately the novel's prediction never occurred, but no book of the period surpassed Fail Safe's realistic portrayal of how such a catastrophic misshap might come to pass. Fail Safe was a taughtly written, tense, dramatic, and credible book that still packs a punch today, and who knows, maybe in an age of terrorism it might still turn out to be true some day after all?By the way, Burdick was also the author of The Ugly American (not to be confused with Graham Greene's The Quiet American), a book whose central message about the dangers of cultural absolutism and cultural ignorance in the U.S. remain as valid as when the novel was published in 1958. This attitude continues to influence and drive U.S. foreign policy today, often with disastrous results, and the book is still worth reading for its cautionary message about the dangers of such ignorance."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"I used this book for a very small group of high schoolers to satisfy an American Lit requirement as well as to introduce an American History unit on The Cold War. Excellent piece of lit. and a book that the boys could really get their teeth into."},{"Title":"Fail-Safe","review":"This 1962 thriller is one of the most frightening novels ever penned. The story grips the readers with tension and fear after the U.S. accidentally launches a nuclear strike against Moscow. Can the bombers be called back before it's too late? What happens if they get thru and destroy the Soviet capital? The story is set in the White House and Pentagon, and occurs in the space of a few short hours - from the launching of the bombers due to false alarm, to frantic but unanswered calls that they return to base, to their terrifying approach to the Soviet capital. Readers feel as if they are on the scene, and we see in stark terms how tragedy can result from a combination of mistrust, miscalculations, and technological errors.This fast-reading thriller by Eugene Burdick (1918-65) and Harvey Wheeler (1918-2004) captures the tenure of the Cold War - it was published the same year as the Cuban missile crisis. FAIL SAFE was also made into a solid 1964 film starring Henry Fonda and Walter Mathau."},{"Title":"A Pacific Crest odyssey: Walking the Trail from Mexico to Canada","review":"In April 1977 the author began his trek at the Mexican border, in search of the magic that is wilderness. The journey took him first through the arid lowlands and mountainscapes of southern California, then on to the Sierra Nevada, whose pellucid lakes, glacial sculpture, and gleaming, granite spires are a peerless exhibit of Nature's art. Then Northern California: the southern Cascades with the volcanic wonderland of Lassen National Park and the remarkably diverse geology and botany of the Trinity Alps, the Marble Mountains, and the Siskiyou Range. Then Oregon and Washington, with their statuesque strato-volcanoes and lush conifer forests. All this passed beneath his feet and into his trail journals.Through photographs, excerpts from his journals, and post-trek recollections, the author describes the trail and his experience of it, inviting you to share in the harvest. It is not strictly travelogue, nor simply an adventure story. It is a tale of the poet more than the pioneer. Nature wasn't conquered - nature never is - yet there was victory: \\"It is an acutely personal triumph, for only I know the game that has been played these several months,\\" wrote Green.A Pacific Crest Odessey is also an aid to prospective hikers of the Pacific Crest Trail and to anyone planning a long-distance backpacking trip, whether it be for six months or six days.

I understand and fully agree with the previous reviewer that Detroit seems to love to tear down the beautiful architecture of its past, only to be replaced with the drab, bland structures of today. The past, present, and future can compliment each other tremendously, as in so many other cities (especially in Europe), but Detroit seems to want to forget about its past. Many people do not realize that Detroit was once a vibrant, alive city from the later part of the 19th century through the mid-1950's. A city where people chose to live, not move from. This beautiful book will show in pictures why Detroit was the place to be. Unfortunately, it also shows why it's not the place to be anymore. What the photographers have successfully done was to print original photographs of many different parts of Detroit from around the 1880's through the 1950's, and then print how the exact spot looks today. The results are startling. To see what once was to what is, is very sad.There is hope, however, with the restoration of the Fox Theater, the Gem Theater, and now, quite possibly, the Book-Cadillac Hotel. Will Tiger Stadium also be on the restoration list? One can only hope. What was done to the Michigan Theater was a sin, and the tearing down of the Monroe Block was a crime!Detroit, please do not tear down what's left of your past."},{"Title":"Detroit Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"Sadly, this book wasn't really needed.

However, the Detroit book has an illusory feel that borders on being dishonest.In short:1) No auto factory pictures! This would be like a book about NYC with no Times Square pictures, or a book about DC with no pictures of the Capitol or White House.2) You have to wade 42 pages into the book before you find a pair of pictures where the 'old' view even resembles the newer (~2001) view. This was due to ignoring Detroit's industrial past, and the hulking ruins that are now all over the city.3) Some pictures are just plain insignificant to the city's history, like the \\"Pewabic Pottery Company\\" and a water fountain on Belle Island.4) Several of Detroit's largest skyscrapers, which are now derelict boarded up ruins, are largely ignored in the book.One of the very few pages where the author admits a 'failing' of Detroit is a pair of pictures of the Michigan Central Depot rail station. There are dozens of other large Detroit buildings, in a state of disrepair just like rail station, either omitted from this book or presented misleadingly. For example, the 'Now' view of the Cass Technical School looks attractive in this book, but the building turned into dangerous monstrosity (of trash, broken windows, and gang graffiti) just a few years after being closed. Other picture books about Detroit present an accurate view of the Cass.I can't help but wonder why the author of this book was trying to go out of her way to present Detroit in such an optimistic light.

Almost amatuerish. Should have included more interioir shots.

The 12 academics and authors that Dawes selected are known for being pioneers in one sense or another in the study of the historiocity of the New and Old Testaments.Each of these researchers/writers are introduced with a brief biography and overview of their work and thought, with an excerpt following of some of their more famous works. Unfortunately, the introductions are pretty brief and the information cursory. The excerpts leave a bit to be desired as well, as the editor is trying to compress a lifetime of study and perhaps thousands of written pages by each of these noted scholars into a few pages.If you are new to the topic, the book may provide an OK introduction, but in general, there is not enough depth to interest the more knowledgeable reader, and the excerpted information and the introductions are going to be tough for a novice to really absorb and understand."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"Carol Shields hooked me in with Stone Diaries and I have subsequently enjoyed Happenstance, Larry's Party and a Celibate Season. I have just completed Dressing Up for the Carnival and am yet again amazed by Carol's ability to take the simplest things and see into them and beyond their common use. The story Mirrors is a typical example - we take them so much for granted and yet we do not look at them but &quot;into them&quot;. Her language is rich, descriptive, insightful and makes me want to hear her voice. I love the glimpses she gives into married lives and the various swings and roundabouts of relationships, the distances between people and the tiny, meaningful, tender moments - Windows is a typical example. I am delighted to discover that I have many more of her books to enjoy and am now about to continue my research on Carol with the help of this site."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"Carol Shields can take an ordinary word and polish it into a shining gemstone. Finely-tuned phrases are scattered plentifully throughout each chapter of _Dressing Up for the Carnival_, straddling the gap between poetry and fiction. This collection of stories is so spare, it almost feels empty at first. But you find Shields has emptied her work of distractions and needless explanations so you can more clearly see . Her focus on minute details is selective and purposeful. She reveals deep insights on the human condition through small observations-ones only a keen observer could see, and only a master writer like Shields could translate into words. If you want to be entertained, this book may not be for you. If you want to think deeply and be stirred to a higher level of emotion, pick up this book. You'll find yourself setting it down after every story so you can absorb each word."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"After the disappointment of Carol Shields' last book, the novel Larry's Party, I thought I would give her a second try with this collection of short stories. At times Shields doesn't disappoint - Dressing Up For The Carnival has a few wonderful stories - I particularly like 'Mirrors'. However, in many stories Shields tries to put an imaginative and poetic slant on the everyday banal - but sadly with little success. Most of the stories here seem forced, the result of some self-imposed writing excerise that in the end read like teenage creative writing exams. For such an accomplished writer many of these stories seem young and naive - even unfinished perhaps. Her themes of aging women, often disappointed by life or the infidelities of men, are bittersweet but in the end left me with nothing."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"book in perfect conditionarrived in 3 daysread the book in one daycarol shields was a wonderful author----much like wally lamb.the book is a collection of short stories about normal people in normal situations.it is nice to read an actual book to take a break from my kindle"},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"It's hard to describe the effect of these stories -- perhaps mindbending would be as close as you can get. Who else would devote whole stories to keys, or a meteorologist strike or the founder of a nudist camp? My only small complaint is that at times some of the stories, especially those taking place in the academic realm, are almost too clever for their own good. The collection as a whole though is strong and quite imaginative and profound. Shields is certainly an interesting writer -- there is nary a dull moment and some quite enlightening ones."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"Carol Shields is an amazingly talented author and her books amaze me. I am a huge fan of &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; and I personally think it's one of the best novels of our time, but I must confess that I don't enjoy her work in short stories. I think that her talent is better suited for novels and I certainly think she deserves a world of praise for her books. But, again I didn't really like this one as much. I found it fragmented and hard to follow. It was lackluster and I was really hoping for more. Sadly, I can't rave about this book as much I would have liked."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"Meteorologists go on strike and the weather disappears; a summer home has no mirrors anywhere, not even any shiny pots to see yourself in; a young boy goes to a nudist camp with his grandpa - these are gorgeous, magical, surprising stories."},{"Title":"Dressing Up for the Carnival","review":"I recently finished reading Carol Shields' short story collection, Dressing Up for the Carnival.

Good humor - definitely a book boys will love!"},{"Title":"Giggle, Giggle, Quack","review":"This companion to \\"Click, Clack, Moo\\" reunites author Doreen Cronin with her illustrative foil, Betsy Lewin. Those bossy farm animals are back and here, they decide to turn things to their advantage when Farmer Brown goes on vacation. Leaving his easygoing brother Bob in charge is a mistake, as the animals get manipulative--demanding pizza, videos at night (\\"The Sound of Moosic,\\" naturally!) and so on.I can't say enough about Betsy Lewin's illustrations. With just a few swooping lines and a sensitive use of color, she manages to give each animal its own personality while simultaneously carrying along the narrative thrust of the story. Her pictures are a joy to behold and a testament to the power of simplicity.Poor Bob does what he can to make the animals happy, and by the time Farmer Brown arrives home, everything is in hilarious disarray. Although this isn't quite up to the level of \\"Click, Clack, Moo,\\" it'd be a fun gift for a child who already has the earlier book."},{"Title":"Giggle, Giggle, Quack","review":"Farmer Brown is taking a much needed vacation, and brother Bob will be taking care of things around the farm until he gets back. &quot;I wrote everything down for you.

The dynamic duo, Doreen Cronin and Betsy Lewin, who authored Click Clack Moo: Cows That Type, are back and in fine form with this clever and hilarious sequel. Ms Cronin's droll text is engaging and sets the scene. But it's Ms Lewin's bold and busy, cartoon-like artwork that really steals the show, and youngsters will revel in the fact that they're in on the joke as they enjoy all the subtle details, marvelous animal facial expressions, and entertaining barnyard scenes. Perfect for youngsters 3-7, Giggle, Giggle, Quack is a silly, funny, manic adventure that definitely shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Giggle, Giggle, Quack","review":"Click Clack Moo is one of my favorite kid's book, and conveniently my kids like it as well (see my listmania of my eldest's top ten books on the verge of turning four). Giggle Giggle Quack is a cute, fun follow-up but it lacks the subversive undertones that I enjoyed so much in the first book. If Click Clack Moo is the Animal Farm of pre-school lit, than Giggle Giggle Quack is something closer to Animal House.In Click Clack Moo, the animals unite and strike, refusing to do their animal duties unless Farmer Brown improves their working conditions. That's some serious stuff. In Giggle Giggle Quack, Farmer Brown goes on vacation and leaves his brother, who appears to be a nebbish perhaps from the big city, in charge. No longer are the animals noble workers becoming empowered and agitating for their rights. Instead, this time out the animals act like mischevious children taking advantage of the hapless substitute teacher. For example, they manipulate the farmer's brother into ordering them pizzas. That ain't exactly the Tompkins Square Riot.The drawings are cute as ever, and I gave the book an energetic reading which managed to save it. So, it certainly works at the level of mediocre kids books. But Click Clack Moo is a very special book that is great on many levels. In comparison, the sequel is a let-down."},{"Title":"Giggle, Giggle, Quack","review":"This book is about a duck writing notes and he is trying to fool Bob.

It's the sequel to \\"Click, Clack, Moo,Cows That Type\\" and continues the story of how a bunch of farm animals, lead by a pencil toting duck, pull the wool over the eyes of Farmer Brown's brother when Farmer Brown goes out of town. Betsy Lewin's illustrations just help to convey how mischievous these guys are. I laughed harder with every page turn. Now I ask the question....will there be a third???"},{"Title":"Giggle, Giggle, Quack","review":"\\"And watch out for Duck, he's trouble!\\" warns Farmer Brown to his brother Bob who has come to watch the farm so Farmer Brown can get a much needed vacation. This book follows the same formula as Click Clack Moo in that the animals get the upper hand on a human, in this case Bob. Bob does his best to follow what he thinks are Farmer's Brown's notes but they were really written by duck. The animals have traded their typwriters in for pencils and now they are running poor Bob ragged. With Duck doing the dictating bubble baths with Farmer Brown's good bubble bath and the movie the sound of Moosic are on the itenerary. The giggle giggle quack in the title refers to the sound the animals make as they get their scheme over on Bob. Of course all good things must come to an end. Farmer Brown catches on to what the animals are up to when he calls and duck answers the phone. If you loved Click Clack Moo you will love this book. Click Clack and Giggle Giggle are my two favorite books to read to my daughter. I never get tired of reading them to her and she loves them just as much.

All your favorite characters are back. Farmer Brown. His eloquent cows. His pigs. His chickens. And of course, the Duck. Duck firmly establishes himself to be as quick with the pencil as the cows once were with their typewriters. It is in \\"Giggle, Giggle, Quack\\" that he first truly comes into his own.Somewhere along the line, Farmer Brown figured out that the craftiest animal in his barnyard was that no good sneaky-peek Duck. So when the farmer leaves on vacation, his tells his brother in no uncertain terms to \\"keep an eye on Duck. He's trouble\\". And sure enough, with the discovery of a wayward pencil, Duck starts taking farm matters into his own hands/beak. He figures out that Farmer Brown left Bob, his bro, copious notes regarding the running of the farm. It doesn't take long for Duck to deftly swap the farmer's notes for his own livestock friendly ones. Before you know it, the farm animals are munching pizza, getting lovely spa-like baths, and enjoying \\"movie night\\" on Farmer Brown's couch. When their absent landlord finally catches on via the telephone, Duck presents his babysitter with the note, \\"It's for you, Bob!\\". The last image is of a Hawaiian-shirt wearing Farmer Bob pelting it quicktime back to the farm once again to restore some semblance of order.\\"Giggle, Giggle, Quack\\", doesn't have the snappy ending that \\"Click Clack Moo\\" had, admittedly. And the phrase, \\"giggle, giggle, oink\\" (or whatever animal noise being used at the time), isn't really going to compare with the satisfying sounds of \\"click, clack, moo\\". Still, there's a lot to enjoy here. The animals take a special pleasure in outwitting the dullard humans around them. Kids reading the book will enjoy pinpointing the exact moment that Farmer Brown's pencil slips from his back pocket and onto the ground. And Duck's discovery of it is well accompanied by surreptitious glances exchanged between the cows. For kids who've already grown to love these characters, \\"Giggle Giggle Quack\\" provides more of the same silly subversive fun. For kids who've never encountered the series before, they'll probably still find something to enjoy here.

The Russians and the Americans knew the Arabs did not want to destroy Israel, nor were they capable of doing so; they simply wanted to break the stalemate that was ending in a deadlock and lasted for a long time. The situation had become intolerable since the end of the Six Days war of 1967. Six years later, the Arabs, independently and without USSR's energetic guidance, realized that without some shock treatment neither the Israeli nor the Americans would be willing to move and find a settlement (instead of a solution) to this deadlock.Sadat's presentation almost certainly met with Soviet approval. Day by day the local media assured the Arabs that Soviet leaders had often stressed the necessity of a just and fair political solution to the conflict. Nobody ever wrote about a just and fair settlement of the conflict that started from the beginning of the twentieth century.Brezhnev gave a speech at Alma-Ata that can rightfully be regarded as a roadmap. He concluded the following among the most urgent tasks the USSR had to discuss with friends \\"\\"The achievement of a political settlement in the Middle East on the basis of the declaration of U.N. Security Council and General Assembly that provides for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab lands\\"\\" . The Arab Left saw this was the Communist Party line and the statement was reiterated in many speeches and articles up to the outbreak of the 1973 war. Arab radios repeatedly voiced Soviet leaders that it was unacceptable to acquire territory by force - unless of course the country in question happened to be a superpower such as the Soviet Union.In 1971, within the context of \`d&eacute;tente', USA and USSR signed agreement to sell $ 136 million wheat and $ 125 million drilling equipment to Russia i.e. to export surplus American wheat to USSR. In return, Brezhnev agreed to help Nixon push North Vietnam to negotiate end of the war and Nixon began trade with Russia, sale of wheat, Siberian Gas investment. (Just a marginal observation in this context: Senator Henry Jackson led passage of Jackson-Vanik amendment to withhold most favored nation status until Russia allowed unlimited Jewish emigration and guaranteed human rights)So,and still within the context of detente, when the Arab Oil Producers decided at their meeting in September 1973 to use the Oil weapon, Pravda encouraged them and expressed hope that oil warfare would escalate. The Arabs Right (then labeled \\"\\"Reactionaries\\"\\" by their \`'brothers\\" of the Left, saw this as a venue for Moscow to benefit from any consequential increase in the price of Oil). In fact the Soviets were then suffering from severe shortage of wheat. The price of bread was much below the cost of the wheat used to produce it. Russia simply subsidized the cost of wheat that, in some cases, farmers fed their livestock bread rather than grain because bread cost them less. (Just another marginal observation of how detente, supported by Corporate America, is faring these days: Today, with the price of Oil soaring to $ 100+ Russia is able to benefit up to One billion American Dollars per day - yes per day. Russia has settled all her outstanding debts and is in positive cash flow)Too much \`blessings' from D&eacute;tente."},{"Title":"Killing Detente : The Right Attacks the CIA","review":"Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA; Review; book reviewsBulletin of the Atomic Scientists January, 1999No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70Warnke, Paul C.Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly overstating Soviet military expenditures.In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by \\"projecting a sense of complacency.\\" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by \\"independent\\" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the \\"intellectual godfather\\" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the \\"intensity, scope, and implicit threat\\" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that \\"Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded.\\"It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided \\"intellectual fodder\\" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that \\"the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup.\\" The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, \\"has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated fromz a single center--Moscow.\\"Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But itis the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.Paul C. Warnke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., was director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and chief arms negotiator in the Carter administration, and assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the Johnson administration.Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA; Review; book review Perspectives on Political Science June 22, 1999Perspectives on Political ScienceJune 22, 1999No. 3, Vol. 28; Pg. 164THOMAS, STAFFORD T.Cahn, Anne Hessing Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA University Park, PA: Penn State University Press 232 pp., $ 35.00 cloth, $ 17.95 paper ISBN 0-271-01790-2 cloth ISBN 0-271-01791-0 paper Publication Date: October 1998The basic thesis of Killing Detente is that a group of conservative ideologues worked deliberately throughout the 1970s to undermine the U.S. policy of detente with the Soviet Union. The main focus of their efforts was the National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) of Soviet military, nuclear, and strategic capabilities and intentions, which are produced by the U.S. intelligence community, especially the Central Intelligence Agency. The group sought to diminish the credibility of the NIEs and to substitute their views of the Soviet threat to influence U.S. foreign and national security policy. Author Anne Hessing Cahn, a scholar in residence at American University, has worked at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Committee for National Security.The book is divided into nine chapters and also includes an appendix, a glossary, an index, and an extensive bibliography. The bibliography lists fourteen interviews with key figures and numerous documents secured under the Freedom of Information Act.In chapter 1 Cahn explains the importance of Albert Wohlstetter to the detente opponents. In chapter 2 she reviews the domestic and international factors that contributed to their \\"loose coalition,\\" including a wide array of individuals and groups, some of whom were not politically conservative but had other reasons to oppose detente. In chapter 3 Cahn describes aspects of the international setting in the early 1970s that favored the coalition: confusion about the meaning of detente, Soviet opportunism (especially in the Third World), perceptions of U.S. diplomatic failures in the Helsinki and Vladivostok negotiations, and concerns about Soviet compliance with arms control agreements. In chapters 4 and 5 Cahn discusses the NIE process, the substance of NIEs in the early 1970s, and how the NIEs became the conduit for \\"conservative\\" attempts to sabotage detente. Chapter 6 describes the role of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), which ostensibly reviewed intelligence policy and performance but became the tool of the detente opponents in their effort to undermine the CIA and the NIEs.Chapters 7, 8, and 9 are devoted to \\"Team B,\\" a group of nonintelligence Soviet experts who used the same data as the NIE analysts but reached different conclusions. Cahn discusses three reasons for the creation of Team B and the membership and formation of the three Team B groups. She contrasts the alarming Team B results with the more reassuring NIEs on the Soviet threat. An epilogue summarizes her arguments.The book will appeal to scholars and general readers interested in a detailed history of national estimates. Its view of the Team B episode is based on material not available elsewhere. The book is polemical at times but persuasive. It is perhaps best read together with John Prados's The Soviet Estimate and Roy Godson's Intelligence Requirements for the 1980s: Analysis and Estimates.The United States Foreign AffairsMay, 1999 / June, 1999Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA. BY ANNE HESSING CAHN. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998, 232 pp. $ 35.00.In 1976, another group of outside experts sounded an alarm about the Soviet threat. (Once again Paul Nitze was there, although historian Richard Pipes was more influential.) Known as Team B, its goal was to critique the official intelligence estimates (those of \\"Team A\\"). Cahn is angry, since she views detente as \\"a time of great hope for the majority of Americans and of great fear for Cold Warriors.\\" But she bites her lip through enough of the book to provide a straightforward narrative of the controversy and the maneuvers that produced Team B. The real and gnawing uncertainties at the time about Soviet capabilities and intentions do not, however, evoke her sympathy, or comprehension. Team B did not kill detente, which was already dead by the time the report appeared at the end of 1976. In another echo of the Gaither Committee, however, Team B had its greatest effect by coalescing the worldview of like-minded neoconservatives who later so strongly influenced the early Reagan administration."},{"Title":"Killing Detente : The Right Attacks the CIA","review":"This is a very readable, interesting book written on a topic that few of us as ordinary citizens have been informed about - yet it has impacted our security, our international policy and our financial future for decades to come!!

Patriots were glad to have won the Cold War, and progressives were crushed over the collapse of international socialism. But detente? That dishonorable hodgepodge of political expedience and moral equivalence?The author seems to think that the Soviet Union's decline and fall was obvious and common knowledge, and the right-wingers agitating for the administration not to be snookered by the Soviets' peace offensive were out of line. So, therefore the military buildup in the late Carter and early Reagan years was unnecessary, because the money could have been spent on various liberal social programs. It's a case of \\"yes, he saved the patient, but the _way_ he did it was wrong\\".

Numerous former KGB agents have revealed the Soviets true intent at the very beginning of detente. Subsequent efforts by U.S. agencies to end detente were born of a very serious threat to U.S. national security.

She accuses a group of well-informed and respectable American experts -- myself among them -- of deliberately misinforming the US government about Soviet nuclear strategy.

The intention of Team B was not to \\"kill\\" detente but to alert the US that the USSR did not share its belief in nuclear parity or MAD.

Dead Easy is Super Bolan #6 and represented Gold Eagle's attempt to give Executioner series dedicated readers new and much larger books about Mack Bolan. Many readers not monthly readers of The Executioner series feel these Super Bolans are too long, while dedicated readers to the series enjoy the chance to have the Bolan plots enlarged. These types of books are still in the Gold Eagle line appearing as Mack Bolan or Stony Man books, while the regular size monthly Executioner series continues along side of these super books which have more pages.In this Super Bolan 6, \\"a high speed train races across the Italian countryside on the overnight run from Rome to Vienna\\". An early morning explosion rocks and wrecks the train causing 60 deaths. At the bottom is a KGB-Mafia plot to eventually wreck the economy of America. As usual Mack Bolan is there to battle terroism in his dedicated crusade of good against evil.If you have read any of the Gold Eagle books you will know what to expect, but should you not be familiar with the vast number of Gold Eagle books from the 1980s right down through today, this book may offer a reading change where men's adventure is concerned. There are several hundred of these Super Bolans in print today!

This book was confusing in the middle, but the ending made up for it. In this book Santiago goes on a 3-4 day fishing trip, trying to change his luck. This book had me confused because the main character Santiago went on the fishing trip alone and was always talking to himself, and I didn't know he was talking to himself until half way through the book.This novel had good drama and action. The drama part was weird because fishermen were making fun of Santiago because he didn't catch a fish in eighty five days. The fishermen told him that \\"he probably wouldn't catch another fish for the rest of his life\\". The biggest part of drama was at the end of the book. I can't say the ending or it will give away a good story that everyone has to read themselves.Ernest Hemmingway is descriptive in his writing, he writes as if he were describing him self, but he's actually describing his life stories. When Hemmingway writes about action he writes in detail and it get a clear picture in your head as your reading. When he had to fight the shark he described the shark in detail. Also when he was using a boat oar as a weapon he described it the exact same way as it was in my head. In other words Hemmingway doesn't leave anything out in his writing. I would want other people to read this book because it's a really short book and it's easy to follow. This book only gets confusing for one chapter and then I caught on quick. In the ending of the book Hemmingway started to write like a tearjerker, but I can't give away a good ending.All in all I thought The Old Man and the Sea was a good book, even though it got confusing for a chapter. I request this book for younger readers because it has easy vocabulary and it will take three days to finish it if younger readers read thirty minutes a day for three days. Hemmingway didn't leave out anything in the book it seemed like. The reason why Hemmingway gave good description in this book is because it actually happened to him in real life, it's not like he made it up. I give all the credit to Hemmingway as an author; he makes me check out his other books he wrote about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaHe was an old man that fished alone in the skiff and was very unlucky with fish since he hadn't caught a fish in the past eighty four days. The fisherman, Santiago, struggled all throughout the story with his many different problems, such as his problem of not being able to catch a fish. The novel The Old Man and the Sea is about a struggle with a man verses himself.This story is very compelling and meaningful in many ways. For example, it was very compelling when Santiago would not give up on catching this huge marlin because Santiago's pride was at risk. The struggle between the two made the plot more interesting and entertaining for the reader. Most people would have given up pretty quickly when trying to catch one the biggest marlins in the Cuban Sea, but Santiago had enough pride to keep going. I have great respect for Santiago for not giving up when it looked like there was no way to succeed for him. But his persistent was one of his greatest qualities. Another example of how this story is meaningful was Santiago and the boy Manolin's friendship. If Santiago never had a friendship that strong with someone he wouldn't have had the will power to fight that marlin. Manolin is the reason why Santiago would not give up, because Manolin believed in him and Santiago didn't want to let the boy down. Santiago and Manolin's friendship is the most meaningful thing in this novel. Although the story is short and easy to read it is also very overwhelming.I would recommend this book to all readers of all ages, because everyone can enjoy this story. Above all odds The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. I think Hemingway's writing in The Old Man and the Sea was one of the best stories I've ever read in a long time. His writing carries meaningful things, such as the way he writes about how Santiago and Manolin have a friendship that no one can break and the way Santiago felt while he was battling the huge marlin. No book I've read carries so much meaning. In 1954 Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for his powerful and meaningful writing. Although Hemingway wrote many great novels, I feel that The Old Man and the Sea was the main novel that got him the Nobel Prize. The Old Man and the Sea had to be one of the best novels ever written by any author throughout history. He deserved the Nobel Prize earlier than he got it, but with out this novel the Nobel Prize would have been out of his grasps so the critics think. This novel is a very compassionate story and should be read by ever single person out there.To sum up, this story is about struggle, and is one the best pieces of work I've ever read. Any critic or reader that doesn't like this novel or says it is a bad story has no taste in novels. In my mind this story was Hemingway's best work throughout his entire career as an author."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThe Old Man and the Sea is a beautifully written story about an old Fisherman's 3 day struggle with a giant Marlin. It is a great example of Ernest Hemmingway's great passion and talent of writing. After reading this book I am glad that I read it.The Old Man and the Sea is a very good read. Ernest Hemmingway has a very unique writing style that appeals to me personally and to other fans of Hemmingway. His style makes his books interesting with descriptive and interesting words that keep your attention and make you think. He uses phrases like \\"strong full blooded fish,\\" and Santiago refers to the fish as \\"his brother.\\" His words and sentences make his characters and their conflicts seem more interesting even if the event itself is not. After reading this book you can see how much of his time and effort goes into each paragraph to make it perfect. In this book, the scenes with the sharks and the fish Hemmingway keeps your attention throughout the whole thing. His actions sequences are very eventful and exciting. Ernest Hemmingway's style is so unique that you cannot tell who would win the shark battle, and it makes the reader want to read farther. This great book for a specific audience and if a reader is in it, they will like this book.The Old Man and The Sea is suited for a specific audience. Only a specific reader would enjoy reading this book. Hemmingway inserts hidden meanings and strong morals. I would recommend this book to somebody who likes who likes a fairly easy book to read but likes to be challenged with hidden meanings. Also this book has strong morals such as \\"never give up\\" like Santiago never did, even though it didn't exactly pay off. I would also recommend this book to someone to likes a good moral or just someone who has just read other Hemmingway's and enjoyed them. I personally enjoy hidden meanings, morals, descriptive words and just plain good writing, so I suggest that this book is a good one to pick up for anyone.I strongly believe this was a good book and a great read. Ernest Hemmingway was clearly a great writer maybe that is why he won the Pulitzer Prize for this book. The Old man and the Sea was clearly a very good book and is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I liked this short novel.The description of the situations goes into details without being boring, but interesting to the reader instead.Spanish expressions are mixed with English text in some parts of the novel, but you could easily infer their meaning thanks to the &quot;flow&quot; of the story. Moreover, Spanish-like English is also used with or without warning: Call a fish &quot;he&quot;; the sea is &quot;she&quot; for those who love her, and &quot;he&quot; for those who see him as a rival.A dictionary might not be useful because some words are spelled as they are said colloquially, like &quot;salao&quot; for &quot;salado&quot; (unlucky).Get no frights, and be no bored. Enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read today that the actual &quot;Old Man&quot; who EH based this story on died yesterday in Havana at age 104!! So I looked thru some of my Hem Collection, including THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. It is a beautifully written true to life story in every way, more so to me now than when I first read it, I think in 9th grade a long time ago. It is a story of the nobility of life,yes again, the famous &quot;grace under pressure&quot;. Just thinking about it you can imagine being alone on a small fishing boat out there plugging away, catching the great fish, and then losing him to the carnivores beneath the surface. But still keeping your dignity after the whole expedition is thru..The Old Man's obituary in the recent paper fits right into Hemingway's immortal tale. They were friends for life!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of those rare stories that is so far above and beyond other novels that it can only be regarded as the work of a genius. Regarded, rightfully, as a classic, Hemingway's story has also been heavily criticised for its obvious parallels with biblical events and also for being overly-autobiographical. Of course, it's easy to pick apart any work of art. I cannot bring myself to criticise the book on any level as I enjoyed it so much. I realised early in the book that Hemingway had written alot of his own personality (and then-personal circumstances) into the lead character, Santiago, an old fisherman who longs to catch that one big fish before it is too late. What makes the story so wonderful is the way Hemingway involves the reader in Santiago's struggle. Rarely have I felt so excited while reading a book - the author makes the reader feel as if it is they who are in the small boat, dragged out to sea by a huge marlin, and eager to return home safe with the prize catch. I would recommend this book to children, as an easy to read adventure, and to adults as a multi-faceted, must-read classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the Seaby Ernest HemingwaySometimes people take for granted how closely we're connected to nature; In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" by ernest Hemingway, a titanic struggle reveals the humanity in nature and the nature in man. \\"The Old man and the Sea\\" is the story of an old fisherman who is down on his luck. He goes out on what is interpreted as his last quest for a fish and the end of his bad luck. Far out at sea and all alone, he lands a great fish larger than his skiff. The rest of the story is the hopeless struggle between the old man, sharks , the great fish, and the sea.Hemingway uses the motif that the old fisherman and the great fish are the same or parallel each other. Hemingway gives examples by comparing the two during the struggle back to land. Neither the old man nor the fish give up. The two characters parallel each other through the book one above in the skiff, and one below in the deep sea. By examining beginning and the ending situations of the old man and the fish, readers see the similarities in the two characters and their lives."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is just one example of what an extrodinary writer Ernest Hemingway was. This book was clearly written after Hemingway had reached his prime, and it's still excellent. The deceptively simple story of an old man fighting for his place back into society. It's filled with powerful emotion and description."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book provides satisfying reading. Within 150 pages, one enjoys a wonderful fishing adventure story and a glimpse of a friendship between Santiago (a Cuban fisherman, El Campeon of his village in his prime, now gone old), and Manolin, a young boy who shares the love of fishing and the love of baseball with Santiago. It is artistry as Hemingway weaves words to describe scenes, dreams, thoughts and fears. The fishing adventure story -- old man in a skiff, battling to land a marlin and fending off sharks - this story by itself is well-worth the 3 hours that it takes to read the book. Then the reader is provided a bonus of Hemingway's musings on a man maintaining dignity as he get older or a man bemused with the difficulties of his day's challenge with the thought of wretchedness if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun. This book is representative of Hemingway's literary genius and is worth making required reading in high schools."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is a very good book. All of the great detail and discriptive words, although sometimes it does seem to get boring. Well hey, that is probably because I am still young and like to keep things simple. My dad had read the book when he was young to and felt the exact same way I did, but when he read the book as an adult he liked to read and remember every single word.Now I think I would like to share some of my thoughts with you. I really liked the book the way it was excithing after the long intro duction, and the way he told with lots of detail so I was able to understand a whole lot easier.

This book is a short tale and an easy read. Hemingway describes the fishing master Santiago and his colossal battle with a giant marlin in vivid detail. Hemingway writes this story in such a way where you can imagine the sights of the ocean with great accuracy.Santiago is a veteran fisherman who is well past his physical prime and on a long streak of bad luck. He has a boy who is his friend, but the boy was ordered by his parents to leave the old master and get on a ship with better luck. Santiago is forced to go on a fishing trip on his own. He hooks a giant marlin and had an epic fight with the fish for close to three days.Santiago may be an old man, but he has fierce determination to haul in the catch of a lifetime. Hemingway describes the stress on every sinew during the long reeling in process. Santiago wins the victory, but is unable to fit the eighteen foot fish in his boat. The sharks come after the fish and slowly eat away at its flesh. Santiago tried with all his might to fight off the sharks. He clubbed several of them. The fight was in vain and Santiago returned with just the head and a skeleton remaining.Hemingway has great character development in the book. He presents Santiago as a simple man with a lot of pride in his profession. Santiago is from the pre-Castro island of Cuba. He loves baseball, especially Yankees great Joe DiMaggio. Hemingway gives a running commentary of Santiago's inner dialogue. This is a brialliant literary strategy and a key highlight of the book.I thought this was a terrific book. The descriptions of the setting were exquisite. The inner dialogue was compelling. The old man fought against all odds to maintain his dignity and pride. He respected his rival the fish and the battles fought between man and animal were shown to be part of the same circle of life. Santiago inspired his young friend with his valor. This shows that a man can have a great legacy, even in a failed endeavor. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in Spanish before.

Great work on struggle, perseverance and overcoming adversity."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An absorbing story, wonderfully written, a pleasure to read. Many layers of meaning in a simple tale. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This short novella earned Ernest Hemingway the Pulitzer prize in 1953. Having seen the movie, starring Spencer Tracy, and thus being familiar with the story, the book lacked the suspense that would have been present had I been introduced to the story for the first time. However, the writing is sublime and the philosophy suffusing the story is transcendent. The imagery is stunning. This is Hemingway at his very best.In reading several of his renowned full length novels, I was of the opinion that they could have been condensed into tighter stories. Conversely, I've found many of his short stories too abbreviated. It is in the longer short story/novella genre that Hemingway is most effective, in my opinion.As the title suggests, this is, at its core, the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman and his battle, not just with the sea, or the monster fish he is seeking, but with the obstacles and challenges of day to day existence. The old man faces each challenge resolutely and unflinchingly. He does what he has to do, because \\"that is what a man does.\\" Hopelessness and sure defeat are not met with resignation, but instead with renewed strength and effort to the limits of his worn out body.The only other human character of consequence is a young boy, a former apprentice of the fisherman, who has been forced to leave the old man and join the boat of \\"luckier\\", more productive fisherman. He doesn't abandon the old man, however, but instead takes care of the old man.This novella is at times sad and inspirational. It can be read in 2-3 hours. I struggle with how to rate works such as this, given their brevity, but in the genre of short story/novella, this is clearly one of the best of its kind, easily deserving of five stars. If you haven't seen the movie, or heard the story, you will be blown away."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One September day an elderly man and lifelong fisherman named Santiago heads out alone before first light into the Gulf Stream in a sixteen foot skiff in hopes of breaking his streak of bad luck, \\"he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.\\" His constant companion, Manolin, a boy who had fished with him since he was only five years old, was absent, sent off with another fisherman after day forty of the fishing dry spell at the insistence of his parents, \\"The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\\" Around noon that same day, he hooks the big one (an eighteen foot long, 1,500 pound swordfish), and spends the next couple of days (three all told) trying to take and keep control of it. Unfortunately, a Mako and a pair of shovel nosed sharks have other plans for his catch.The Old Man and the Sea is a small but wonderful tale about a perseverant man and a mammoth marlin.

It's about big game fishing, marlin, sharks and a proud old man...and...it was written by Ernest Hemingway, a man who lived, or tried to live, by the \\"words he wrote.\\"The story is so powerful that it is a shame that it has wound up as a staple of High School and University literature classes. Books should be for those who enjoy them, not those who are required to read them. I also think it a shame that instructors who have never felt the strike of a great fish or the despair one feels when the line parts or the fish breaks the line should be the ones attempting to interpret this tale. Usually they read too much...and too little...into the story.The truth is that Hemingway was a depressive and a fatalist. He was the one who wrote, \\"All true stories end in death\\" and \\"The Old Man..\\" is death in the form of total defeat. There is no glory for the old man. He is whipped by the sea, the marlin and sharks just as the old man, Hemingway, was ultimately defeated by life. He had predicted it in most of his stories, \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber\\"; \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"; \\"The Snows of Kilamanjaro\\"; \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" and, to a very real extent, in his non-fiction stories: \\"The Green Hills of Africa\\" and \\"Death in the Afternoon.\\" I wonder what Hemingway was thinking when he loaded his shotgun...?Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is without question one of the best short stories ever written. Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman whose luck has apparently run out. For some time, he has been unable to catch anything. The story begins with him talking with a young boy about his lack of success and major league baseball. Due to Santiago's lack of success, the boy's father has forbidden him from going with Santiago. Santiago then takes his boat out alone and after some time, catches a huge marlin.The fish battles for hours, taking Santiago far away from land. His skills as a fisherman allow him to finally kill the marlin and it is the largest he has ever seen. It is too big to place in the boat, so he is forced to lash it to the side where it remains in the water. This attracts sharks and even though he battles them, killing several, they eat all the meat and he is left with the skeleton. Santiago arrives back at port and everyone marvels at the size of the skeleton and appreciates his accomplishment.What makes this story exceptional is the descriptions of Santiago's thoughts as he fishes, battles the fish after the strike and then the sharks. He knows the battle with the sharks is hopeless, yet he never gives up. The story of struggle, attempts to make a living doing what you know and succeeding through failure is a timeless one, in this case told by a master."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I've read it three times, and as I age, I find more truth, pain, and life than I had previously.

This is one novella that I will read again and again.Santiago is an old fisherman in a fishing village in Cuba. Santiago has gone 85 days without catching a fish and he sets sail to the deep waters to try and land a large fish."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The title of my review could apply equally to Santiago, the hero of THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, and to Hemingway himself when he wrote it. After giving the world such brilliant works as THE SUN ALSO RISES in 1926, A FAREWELL TO ARMS in 1929 and FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, Hemingway seemed to run out of intellectual steam but, alas, not out of a desire to write, producing mediocre works that really were below him.Yet what a comeback. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, which came out in 1952, is Hemingway's best work and led directly to his receiving the Nobel Prize. The strength of the story, as is true for many great works, is its simplicity.Santiago may be past his prime, but a man, as Hemingway states in the book, can only be destroyed, not defeated. And Santiago has no intention of being defeated by the swordfish on the other end of his fishing pole, no matter how far away from his native Cuba the fight may take him.The fish, however, is not Santiago's biggest fight. That fight is with himself. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is the story of a man's fight against his own old age and the fear he might have of not having the grit still in him. He is still young enough in spirit to lock horns in the toughest battle of his fishing career, even though the eventual prize, the swordfish, is minimal, indeed skeletal by the time things are done. Of course, this makes the book open for interpretation. Despite Santiago's victory over the fish, man's prize, his life and what he stands for, is only temporary. Any victory is pyrrhic against the tides of time.Hemingway's works after THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA may have been of the same lackluster quality as those in the middle stages of his career. Few are the authors in which one must separate such good wheat from chaff. Fortunately, the test of time has made the separating easier for the rest of us and this book withstands that test."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hadn't read a Hemingway novel since I tackled \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" during my freshman year in college. And granted, to call this one a novel is a bit generous, but it won the Pulitzer (1953), so it has to be at least considered in that company.I read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" last week simply because I never had before. Somehow I escaped reading it during high school and read Dickens instead. I think that had I read this in high school, I would have found it kind of boring. Now that I have almost 20 years under my belt since high school, it's a much more meaningful book than it would have been then. What's the point of explaining symbolism to bored students? Once you're old enough, you can see the symbolism right there, because you've lived through some of the same things that the protagonist has.A great book, and well worth the 1-2 hours you'll only need to spend reading it. Santiago is an everyman, and his struggles on the sea during a 72 hour time period mirror the struggles that we all face in our lives."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a simple story with a powerful impact. It's about an old man, and, well, the sea. He goes out day after day, trying to catch a fish and comes up empty handed over and over.This book is a great read because, unlike some of Hemmingway's other books, it is not overly long. It's 'short and sweet', as people say. As is his style, Hemmingway writes in clear, reticent sentences that are packed with meaning.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Aside from a few short stories, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is the first Hemingway book that I have read. Of course, I am familiar with his persona, and the idea of the \\"Hemingway man,\\" and was well aware as his stature as one of the greatest writers of modern times. But I had never read his books.Wow. I mean, really. Wow. With \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" it is so easy to see why Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize, and why he deserves all of his accolades. This short novel is fierce, full of vibrant energy and humanity, all the while being a slave to the realities of finite power, of the inability to struggle against something greater than yourself. Of course, this is the standard \\"man against nature\\" story, but it is told with such craft that even cliches ring true.Santiago is a fully-realized character. His strength of will is all that holds together his failing body. The great marlin that he struggles with is like a true fish, lacking personality or anthropomorphism, but just a powerful beast that does not want to die. There is no Moby Dick animosity, and the fish is under the water for the majority of the struggle. All of it, the sharks, the flying fish, the small boat and the ocean, each is what it is, lacking metaphor and saying that life itself is enough. No need to wax poetic.I never knew a story a little over 120 pages could pack such a punch."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I feel compelled to write a few words for Hemingway here after reading some of the negative reviews here. It seems that many of the people got bored of the book because there are no sucessive excitements throughout the story; and many just thought that this was merely one of the many books which has murmurred throughout on a boring theme---fishing.But I think some of the commentators here have missed some important points. Firstly, Santiago is an Old Man as well as an experienced fisherman. It will be quite absurd to expect such an old experienced fisherman to become over-excited and hyper-sensitive because of some petty wounds or expected struggles with the fish. And as we all know one of the most important quality of a fisherman is to stay calm whether one has been waiting in idle for many hours or one is trying desperately to deal with a struggling fish. I think it is just unjust to expect Santiago to behave in a way that a younger college boy would do to make fun of himself and cheer up the audience in a Hollywood comedy. Anyway, you would not really expect to read some exaggerated sensational treatment of the theme by Hemingway, hear Santiago screaming because a few bloods came out of his slightly hurt right hand, or whine helplessly because the big fish was chopped off bit by bit by the sharks, would you?Furthermore, some remarked that, despite whatever they have said negatively, they were still inspired by the theme, that if you persist on pursuing something, even if others think you are unlucky as well as incapable to achieve that, at the end of the day you will achieve that very goal. But in my opinion that is not the real inspiration of the story; the true inspiration comes from the dramatic plot towards the end that the big fish was eventually totally torn off and eaten by the sharks when Santiago finally came back to the shore. And I think this is where this story of Hemingway has distinguished itself from many of the other petty attempts by others to encapsulate the same theme. The message is that even if one has won something for a while, one may not be able to hold it for long and soon it will reduce to nothing. But one should not be discouraged by that. For the highest virtue and courage lies in doing something purely for something's sake instead of for its other rewards. Even if one fails to achieve something at the end, the very process that one has ever tried and persisted till the last minute alone is enough to justify one's effort. It is this 'attitude of a true man' that has driven us to build up what we refer to as the human civilization. And it is also this attitude that has embodied some of the most admirable elements of humanity.The crying of the boy also showed that Santiago did not achieve nothing; at least he has inspired a boy, who was obviously much more 'valuable', if one wants to speak in this way, than the big fish. So, by changing one's perspective, one can see that Santiago's 87 days attempt was not futile at all; it has brought about a heart as passionate and courageous as his in his younger friend. Material treasures will not last, and it will have to go anyway when one moves his leg into the grave; But spiritual transformation can endure, and be spread from one to another and yet another, as through Hemingway's account of it, eternally from generation to generations to come."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Hemingway wrote THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, he was no longer the writer he had been twenty years earlier. His talent was declining, he had over the past ten years written far more bad books than good ones, and was very much the worse for wear from the hard life he had lived. But somehow, he managed at this late stage in his life to produced one final masterpiece, and one of his very finest novels.The story is one of Hemingway's simplest. All of his books are simple on the surface. THE SUN ALSO RISES is very simply told, but it contains a wealth of psychological and interpersonal complexity beneath the simple narrative. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is truly simple, a story about a simple man, with simple ideas, with a simple life, with a simple, elemental encounter with the natural world: he catches a massive marlin that he battles unsuccessfully to bring to market. It is a tale of success in the midst of failure, of quiet stoicism and courage, and refusing to give in to the challenges the world throws at him. Most of all, it is a story about courage.The tale that is told is so clearly told that a very young child can understand it. It is so marvelously told that an adult can marvel over it. When my daughter was six, I read this to her, and he loved it (even developing a child's fascination with Joe DiMaggio).Although the Nobel Prize is given to a writer for his or her work as a whole, and not just one book, it may well be that without this book Hemingway would not have won the Prize. His best work had appeared in the 1920s, and much of his work of the 1930s and virtually all of his work in the 1940s had been far, far below the quality of the early short stories, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, and THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA was his great comeback, and it is quite likely that it was the book that made the difference in his being chosen as the recipient of the award."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"While many claim that Spencer Tracy's portrayal of Santiago in the film of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" was the actor's finest performance, Hemingway deemed him to be totally unsuited for the role. Be that as it may, whether on film, in print or as an audio edition, the story stands as of the author's finest.First published in a 1952 issue of Life magazine, the tale received almost immediate praise. Thus, while the author had originally intended it to be part of a larger work he then decided to publish it as a stand alone book. Some surmise that his inspiration for Santiago was Gregorio Fuentes, a Cuban fisherman hired by Hemingway to look after his boat. Others are equally adamant that Santiago represents everyman. Whatever the case, it is a rousing story undimmed by time.Santiago, as many remember, is an unlucky fisherman - he has not had a nibble in 84 days. His luck is so poor that the parents of his young apprentice, Manolin, have forbidden the boy to accompany Santiago and instructed him to fish with someone else.Telling Manolin that he will go farther out than he has before, where he will surely catch a fish, Santiago goes alone. He luck does indeed change and a fish takes his bait that he is sure is a marlin. An epic struggle begins.If you have not read this Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning story , listen to it and discover wheat happens to Santiago and the enormous creature that he comes to respect enough to call \\"brother.\\"Hearing this landmark tale by Hemingway is pleasure in itself. Enjoyment is more than doubled when the narrator is acclaimed film, stage, and television actor Donald Sutherland. His voice is low, resonant; his diction distinct. He reads with sympathy and superb timing, especially when the huge fish first tugs at Santiago's line.More than highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"call me a throwback, but this slender novel contains more wisdom than entire libraries of self-help books. hemingway tells the story of an old cuban fisherman on his most memorable trip with characteristic simplicity. the man's respect for the fish, courage and inner battle are a fitting finale to hemingway's career. there is more here about character and what life is about than a thousand self-help books.i listened to the audio version and donald sutherland's performance is the best reading i've heard."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a triumph of the bare necessities. The old man goes far out to sea in a flimsy wooden boat, fishing with only a hook, line and bait. Alone, he manages to catch a thousand-pound, eighteen-foot marlin. A life and death struggle ensues as the old man works the fish for days trying to bring it in, but his struggle has only begun as he has to battle the sharks in order to keep his prize.Like the old man in his story, Hemingway uses only the bare necessities. This is a textbook example of how to write a short story--not one wasted word. The conflict of man versus nature is a timeless one, but Hemingway's is a classic because he does so much with so little.Could a story like this one be written today? And if it were, would any publishing house print it? What--no sex, no violence, no angry young men showing how tough they are by threatening and swearing at one another, no liberal idealists purveying an underlying political message, no sorcerers, magic or monsters. Where's the entertainment in that?The beauty of The Old Man and the Sea is its pure and simple realism. No fluff, no filler material, no publisher's formula fiction, just a timeless classic told by a master of the short story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. In this book, \\"The old man and the sea\\", he writes about a lonely old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, that goes out fishing, desperate to catch a big fish. A fisherman's crusade for final glory.Santiago, the fisherman, is poor and his only friend is a young boy. The young boy used to be his fishing-buddy, but as the luck left Santiago, the boy's father asked the boy to go out fishing in someone else's boat.We enter the story as Santiago has gone 84 days fishing without catching any fish. On the 85th day, alone in the boat, he manages to hook a huge Marlin, the biggest he's ever seen. A fish that is much stronger than himself. Santiago's effort and suffering are brought to us in such a way only Hemingway could do. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever. We follow Santiago's fight with the huge Merlin, and his return to town after days of fighting, catching the fish. What happens on his way home is just heartbreaking... He succeeds, but only to lose it in the end.Hemingway writes in such a way that you feel the pain of the fisherman struggle yourself, and you can nothing do but to love the old fisherman. \\"The old man and the sea\\" is a moving story, of a man with great persistence, and with a message to never give up. Very highly recommended!(If you like this book, I suggest you read Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" too...)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am giving this book a 3 stars, but I consider this on the more \\"positive\\" side of the 3 then the negative. I believe that \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" is not one of Hemingway's best works, however there are many aspects of this novel and themes covered that make this a significant novel. I teach this novel and find many students complaining about the lack of action. This book's main point, or moral, is the theme of struggling against the obstacles in life. What many do not realize is that much of the book is symbolic, with characters (Santiago, Manolin, the fish) representing allegorical figures of society. It might help to first look online for some reviews of this novel before plunging into the book if you are unsure about giving this novel a try. As usual, Hemingway uses simple structure in his narration. However, the book's structure is like this for a reason, and there are variable changes in structure and point of view as you read. The bottom line is that a reader might want to know a little about the symbolism and themes presented before beginning reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is perhaps one of Ernest Hemingway's finest achievements. Here you will find the lean descriptive prose that made him one of the finest writer's of the twentieth century.It tells the story of a fisherman who is down on his luck, but whose spirit is strong as the tropical winds that have tanned his skin and the sun that has made weak his eyes. He is devoted to the sea and knows all of its wildness and subtle moods. He goes out alone one day without his sidekick boy companion, because the boy's family has forbidden him to help his teacher for he has bad luck.He hooks a Marlin, a huge mythical Marlin, the kind that fishermen only dream of catching. And the fish drags him out deeper and deeper into the ocean, farther than he's ever traveled. The battle is fierce and his hands are even bloodied as he ties himself to the rope and the fish in a struggle that is somehow symbolic of man's eternal quest to gain control over natural forces.I would say more, however, Hemingway has done such a fine job that I suggest you read and read this wonderful tale. The ending is of course classic Hemingway. And it was for this book that Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" was almost instantly recognized as a classic when it was published in 1952...and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature not long after its publication. Part of this was due to a near panic on the part of the Nobel Prize committee in 1953 after seeing headlines flashed around the world that Hemingway was near death from two separate plane crashes on his safari in Africa- and not wanting to fail to recognize the literary genius who had produced several memorable works. Hemingway also won the Pulitzer Prize around the same time.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" shows an older, wiser Hemingway...and it was somewhat of a surprise to many people when they read it. Readers had been used to stories of barroom brawls...fistfights along the waterfront...battling determined enemies who wanted to kill him....yet this story- a novella- tells of an old fisherman who tries for many days to catch a fish to feed himself....and he has gone weeks without catching anything to bring home....The story is apocryphal and supposedly based on a true account of a Cuban fisherman (Hemingway was living in Cuba at the time) who went out to sea and finally caught a huge fish...but by the time he made it back to shore, the fish had been ravaged by sharks and nearly destroyed...The fish of the news accounts would apparently have been one of the largest sailfish on record- if it had survived intact...Hemingway was intrigued by this account and determined to make the story his own....Hemingway allows us to see through the old man's eyes....sense his emotions...feel the pain in his hands as he tugs on the fishing line that cuts through his well-worn fingers...The old man senses a camaraderie with the huge fish he has just killed...and loves it even though he has taken its life away...Hemingway understood that fight...he had been through it many times...and survived to tell his stories...and this one allows us to sense what is within the mind of the fisherman...and in Hemingway's mind as he enters his later years....The story describes both the outer landscape of the boat on the open ocean...and the fight for the huge sailfish....but also the inner landscape within his mind...truly Hemingway's mind as he faces perhaps his last good fight....The old man knew he had one good fight left in him...so did Hemingway....they both won...as we gain insight into what it means to struggle...to fight against long odds....and succeed....only to be beaten at the last moment....\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" brings us a new awareness not only of age...and what it means to struggle...but also tells us that we are all in the same struggle...against the grim reaper who will come for all of us someday...and despite our efforts...will win the last fight...However, Hemingway knew that the only way to truly win in life was to create something of value...something that would stand the test of time...and he succeeded with this great work...-by Gene PisasaleAuthor of \\"Vineyard Days\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"How many times have you just laid on the grass and stared at the sky? How many times have you been able to escape? Well, in this hectic world The Old Man and the Sea is the perfect book just for that. It's a very slow paced book that's an easy read if you just want to relax. It gives a deeper look on life...inquisitive, open minded. This is great if you don't want just any ole' slow book, if you want one with new looks and meaning.Sometimes it's hard to get away. This book makes it easy with its reality and the sense of sympathy it creates. The main character (the old man) is a man that you can really connect with. Although there's pity you can't help but to admire him. He is also a very curious man who feels like he's on top of the world. The sad truth is the world as ripped, such an honorable man, off.The story is of a simple fisherman in the nation of Cuba. His whole life is fishing although he doesn't make much money because of his supposed bad luck. He once apprenticed a boy but the parents had him practice with fisherman of good luck. He has always had a deep relationship with the man and has never given up on him. He considers fishing more than commerce or as a sport, as do the other fisherman. He has a deeper love and understanding of the sea and its wildlife.Well, day the fisherman goes out fishing like any other day. At first there is no success but...later he hooks the biggest fish in is life, probably ever. But he only hooks not catches it, the fish pulls the boat out farther to sea and begins an interesting journey for the old man. He lets it pull him hoping to tire it out. After the fish jumps once he realizes the full size of this fish. He uses much strength and nobility for a courageous battle between the god of fish. The question is...is that enough? Can the old man take on one of the biggest monsters of the sea? Find out by reading it!All in all it's a great book. It has more layers than can be counted. It seems deeper than the sea itself. I think that if you don't just read books to read books, you read them for life and meaning, well, this is your book. I recommend to most everybody. Be aware some people could be to shallow to understand it"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am amazed at the simplicity of this book, sometimes Hemingway speaks in parable and sometimes he expresses the inner thought of the characters.I specially liked the struggle to catch the fish, because of what it meant to the old man. The fight to catch this fish lasted 3 days, not giving up!It is a journey filled with hope and fear, struggle and defeat, death and life.It is a must read! But mainly a \\"Must have book\\", because I believe it should be read more than once and every once in a while."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Old Man And The Sea is the story of an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, and the several days and nights that he spends alone in his skiff catching, killing and bringing to shore a large (bigger than his skiff) Marlin.Santiago has gone eighty-four days without a catch, and on this day he goes out farther than he normally does and catches his prize (or maybe it's not a prize at all).The man-against-nature aspect of the story is intriguing in itself, but I've always seen this book as a wise parable that teaches several lessons about life and living. The fish is a symbol of a sought after prize, the sea is a symbol for life itself and the frustrated old man has gone out too far (there's much, much more, but I don't want to give the story away). It actually can be interpreted many different ways, and because of this it's like piecing together a different puzzle each time you read it.I have read this interesting story many times in my life (I've just finished reading it again), and I always find new ways to interpret it, and new ways to enjoy it. It's only 120+ pages, so it's a book that can be read without a great deal of labor. Hemingway's vivid imagery of the ocean and early 1950s Cuba is fascinating, and the simple, honest, and humble lives of Santiago and his devoted young friend, Manolin, are refreshing and heartwarming. The Old Man And The Sea is a book that I have read for years, and one that I will continue to read for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Are all of Ernest Hemingway's books following For Whom the Bell Tolls that bad? No, and The Old Man and the Sea justifies that answer. This is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, who has not caught any fish for eighty-four days and is seen by the other fishermen as unlucky. Even the boy that often fishes with him, Manolin, is not allowed to do so anymore by his father's authority, but still helps him out when he is not fishing. The old man goes out onto the Gulf Stream to make some catches and eventually has an arduous struggle with a large marlin. I am not going to give off any big spoilers (for now at least) in this introduction, but I will say one thing: this is a story about how life can reek of misfortunes but in the end, make prosperity.Hemingway's novels do not just happen as any ordinary fiction based on some random idea, but rather they are inspired by his real-life experiences. What is The Old Man and the Sea based off of? It is based off two things: his time living in Cuba in 1940 and his favorite past experiences: sailing and fishing. The old man, Santiago, is believed to be based off of Cuban fisherman, Gregorio Fuentes. As another fact, The Old Man and the Sea - Santiago's story - was previously intended for a bigger project of Hemingway's: \\"The Sea Book.\\"Hemingway has a very unique way of fleshing out the book's situations with words. For most of the book, the old man is out at sea, alone with nobody to talk to, but does that mean he does not talk at all? No, it does not. Often at times, he will talk to himself, usually talking to his own appendages almost as if they had their own degree of sentience. For example, he would say to his arm, \\"How do you feel, hand?\\" (Hemingway 58) when it felt pain and then say, \\"I'll eat some more for you\\" (59) when he eats some of his recently caught fish to replenish his arms strength for bigger, upcoming catches. He also talks to the fish he has caught or is going to catch, whether they are dead or alive. He communicates with the marlin in his vicious struggle as if it were a sapient creature.*Warning! Spoilers Ahead!*Even after the monstrous fish is caught, he still communicates with it, and forms a spiritual bond with his prize. This is evident during the shark attack, which may have been another great battle for the old man, but results in the loss of most of the marlin's edible parts. He feels that he has failed to protect the fish, which was like a brother to him.*Spoilers end here*The Old Man and the Sea is a book I would recommend for anyone that usually has poor reading comprehension skills, like me for instance. In fact, I would recommend it for just about anyone. This book is fairly short but interesting enough to keep you engaged, though if you are reading this for school, you may be compelled to take day-to-day breaks with it. Also, this book is not divided into chapters; it is just one chapter the length of the whole book, so it might be a little hard to know when the best time to take a break is. If you think books of this size are just for pre-high school kids, I would say you are bit too judgmental. As they say not to judge a book by its cover, I should also say not to judge a book by its size. If you just started reading this novel, I will say it should take less than a week if you are not too break-heavy. As this is Hemingway's last major novel, Hemingway's literary career sure did end successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One line says it all: \\"It is he that has the hook in his mouth...\\"But the question remains, after all these years, \\"Who has hooked whom?\\" Does the old man have the fish or does the fish have the old man?Yes, in our grown and mature understanding, we now understand that the Old Man has hooked the fish and the great fish has hooked the Old Man. They need each other. Like much of life, most of life really, there is a \\"Yin/Yang\\" effect,two opposing forces that combine to make us who we are and what we are.No matter how many times you have read it, it is always worth reading again..and again, and again...One suggestion: To really enjoy reading it, for the first time or for the umpteenth time, read it by the ocean or on the ocean, with the sights, sounds and aromas of the the sea, all around you. Still, after all these years, a moving experience. Perhaps more moving as we age.An often overlooked, but the saddest, most touching line of the book: \\"Did they look for me...\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is a fisherman who had not caught a fish in 84 days. He lives in a small village in Cuba. He fished with a young boy named Manolin. Manolin helps take care of Santiago. He gets his coffee in the morning a and helps him on the fishing boat. Manolin's father does not allow him to go out fishing with the old man after not catching anything after 40 days .The men in the village think he is unlucky. The boy is sad and thinks Santiago will be lucky again. Most of the story takes place out at sea while Santiago is fishing.When he leaves the shore he says to himself I will catch a big fish. He hooks a large fish on this day and the struggle between him and the fish begin. He is alone and is missing his young friend. He is multi tasking alot. He needs too keep the line taught for the fish he has to catch fish for food, and he has to sleep without letting go of the line. He is tiered and his hands are cut from holding the line. During the 3 days the fish brings him out further to sea and Santiago begins to wonder about the fish and would Joe DiMaggio be proud of the struggle with the fish.He talks alot about himself to the fish . He talks alot about he wished the boy was there to help him bring it in. When sees how big the marlin is he realizes he will need all his strenght to bring it in. He will finally get the respect he deserves in the village. When he brings it back sharks start to eat part of the Marlin and Santigo has to beat the sharks and kill them before it takes all the marlin. He uses an oar with a knife attached to it to kill the second shark attacks because the spear he had broke. He feels a since of winning over the sharks deaths.When he arrives back at the village it is late and he is exhausted. With what little energy he has he leaves the skiff with the marlin still attached and he carries the mast on his shoulders. He falls many times but finally gets home and sleeps until morning. When Manolin wakes him,, the village is talking about the fish and it is the largest any one has caught. This makes him a being a hero in the village.Manolin is very proud and wants to go back out with him.This book is very interesting if you have time to read the book carefully and can read between the lines. Hemmingway has the reader really find the meanings in the book. It s not just a man who is out tring to catch a fish its aabout pride and faith and luck.A.L."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I expect many people to hate this book, as it seems to be a hopeless story about nothing in particular, and that is fine. If this book was ever included on Oprah's list, it should not have been. It is far too subtle, profound, and simple to ever be applauded by the pop-lit audience.That being said,The Old Man and the Sea is my favorite book of all time. I am a fisherman and a very frequent denizen of Hemingway's beloved Gulf of Mexico, so perhaps I am biased, but for me, it really does not get better than this."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Like many people I read this book in high school. I liked it better than many of the things I was forced to read, but now, decades later, I pick it up again...and discover that it truly is a masterpiece.The best indication of that comes from scanning the reviews below. Some people see a myriad religious symbols. Others give it an existential interpretation. Some see defeat; others see triumph. Some see an allegory of Hemingway's life. Others see no allegory at all, but rather, a simple tale of a man doing his job with honor and respect. All from a single, short book. Hemingway's genius is that he wrote a story capable of so many interpretations: a story that speaks to readers more on their own terms than his.So what do I see? Well, again, that reflects who I am. As a Christian, I see the Christian symbols. The old man, Santiago, is clearly a Christ figure. He even has disciples-or (in Hemingway's typical spare manner, *a* disciple (the boy). Even his name, which translates to English as \\"Saint James\\" reinforces this. But Hemingway leaves it to the reader to decide on whose behalf he suffers, and why. But I am also a marathoner and Ironman triathlete. So, of course, I see something in this book cast in my own mold: a man who endures-who accepts pain as the inevitable cost of pursuing his goal.The bottom line; whatever your background, I suspect that you'll find something to resonate with in this book. That's what makes it a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book from head to tail, awe-inspired. A simple story about an old Cuban fisherman who rages against the sea and the creatures that live in it. What appealled the most was his persistence, purity at heart and patience in the face of adversity. Santiago's 84th. The marlin that will prove his luck and triumph. The sharks that ravage his possession. His sorrow and tiredness of life itself. Yet persistent courage that brings him home, to his bed. A haunting last line.Hemingway's autobiography in metaphor. A kind of soliloquy that is simple yet profound."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is simply a a joy to read. The language is simple and clear, and yet it evokes extremely powerful images. I think the Old Man in the Sea is not Hemingway's best or most important book, but I do think it contains only what was good about his writing, and nothing that was bad. To me, despite its length, it is biblical in scope and vision, painful, meaningful, and very sad. The old man's return to his home after the sharks have eaten his marlin is one of the greatly tragic moments in all of literature. Be sure to read this beautiful novella over and over."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Now I know why he is so admired, great writing skills all about catching one fish. Amazing"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hate even trying to use the term \\"review\\" when in regard to a literary classic. I'm not reviewing it -- not passing judgment and critique, but rather lending my own comments on what I thought of the book. So in this case,\\"commentary\\" is likely the better choice.Frankly, I love Hemingway. I love this style, his approach, and this is one of the best true \\"classics\\" that I've read. It's his phrasing and sentences that I've always liked -- the short, abrupt, near-drone is soothing, after a time. The Old Man and the Sea, like some of the other short works I've read by the author, takes a bit of time to settle into. When I'm half-expecting extravagant style and dialogue and vocabulary, the simplicity is calming. Hemingway is a literal writer, and his realism is starkly penetrating.The main character -- Santiago -- is realistic, honorable. One can't pin the title of the \\"hero\\" of the novel to him -- he's anything but that. But he is the protagonist, alongside his marlin co-protagonist and foe. Brief insights into his life prove interesting and expand the character. He's likeable, and Hemingway's clarity provides us with a good mental picture of him.All in all, there's nothing whatsoever to complain about in the novel. If you haven't read it, just go read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book takes place in Cuba between and old man and his young apprentice. The book is a very simple book to read and can be read in one quick sitting. Part of Hemingway's brilliance was his ability to make prose, both interesting and very simple to read. You get the feeling that it was written much in the same way that Mr. Hemingway would speak, without any unnecessary convoluted words that are often used to \\"refine\\" the story and give the work an intellectual aspect. After reading about Hemingway's life I got the feeling that the old man could have easily been him drunk and old, living life on his own terms, although it has been written that the story was inspired by an old Cuban fisherman that he knew. The respect the boy had for the old man in the book is indicative of another era where admiration and respect for the old was commonplace. This book won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"No one ever said, or should have said, that Hemingway was not a master writer on the theme of the basic struggle for existence with honor. The short classic Old Man and the Sea is an almost unbearably taut distillation of that tension. It is extremely hard to realize how much work is necessary in order to sustain a dramatic physical encounter between a man and a fish over 5 pages never mind 100 pages. But an aging Hemingway, pulling on some inner reserve, like the old man in his tussle with the fish pulls it off. Unfortunately the old man does not make it at least not with his fervently desired marlin. But that is beside the point of the story. Today's audience probably has a very different conception of personal honor and courage than Hemingway's. This stripped down tale of a man as he struggles with his inner demons, however, everyone can relate to. That is probably where its power comes from."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think the best comparison to Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" would be Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\". They're short, quick classics, but deserving of the name. However, be aware that the two books, aside from being of very different styles, are entirely different.While \\"TOMATS\\" was my first Hemingway, after having read a few others, I find that the style here is different. First, most of Hemingway's works (or the major ones) are about war. In a sense, \\"TOMATS\\" is about a private war - a private struggle. Hard work leads to good rewards... right?Well, not here. That's what makes this interesting. Plotwise, it's a good thing this book is short. As is, some parts are drawn out and repetitive. Even so, it's a quick read. You can finish this book in a very short amount of time and still remember the basics afterwards. Even now, anyone who read the book years ago can say: big fish, struggle, no gain. It's not complicated, but it's still Hemingway.And we've reached another roadblock. Hemingway. Some love him, some hate him with a passion. If you like his style and his writings, I doubt you'll be disappointed. And even if you are one of those people who hate him, you'll find that this is very different from his other works. It's a nice book, a good read, but it is, after all, still him, meaning that you MAY like it, even if you disliked his other works.Like all Hemingway books, \\"TOMATS\\" is complicated. It's confusing. But EVERYONE should read it. Even if it's not required reading in school, it can lead to a whole range of other classics, or just a whole range of Hemingway books, some of which are very good. So like Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", you have a thin book here that says a lot with just a few words.In other words: You may like it. You may not. But you're going to read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Greetings,The Old Man and The Sea is a book that should inspire each one of us.

It was a tough read for a teenage boy so I recommend a parent to read as well to provide direction for summer reading homework."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the 5th book of Hemingway's that I've read, and certainly not the last. While I still think that \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is his finest work in novels (at this point, any way), this book goes beyond a mere novel.On the surface, the story is rather simplistic. An old man, well past his prime, takes to the sea by himself after 84 days of unsucessful fishing. He is determined to catch a fish, something, anything. He does in fact catch a large fish. He comes home. But there is so much more to take away - a triumph of mind and spirit. To be faced with potential defeat, the idea of simply giving up and no one else being the wiser, and how to be true to oneself. How to maintain hope in the midst of despair. How to fight the good fight when the odds are against you. And how to maintain a good attitude when all you can say is, \\"I did all that I could do.\\"For a small book, it packs a lot of punch. And Hemingway, in his usual style, is somehow able to place the reader in the boat with the old man to fully experience what is happening. I doubt the same impact would have been made had I read this book at a younger age. I probably would have found fault with the old man or found the story simply boring. In that, I find it bothersome that schools select this book to introduce young readers to Hemingway (though it's probably done because it is a shorter work). I think this story would work for older readers who have had to face adversity in their lives. It does strike a chord."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a short good read.

Hemingway writes in such a way that you feel you are on the skiff with Santiago as he is struggle with this great fish...his brother.

Hemingway was at the peak of his powers when he wrote this brutally tender tale. Epic struggles are the theme here. Man against Nature, and more poignantly Man against Himself. Hemingway gracefully explores the deep emotions Santiago has towards the fish and the boy. If you fail to become misty-eyed at some point during this yarn, you are a tin-man. I like to read this on an annual basis. It is my very favorite story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is about an old man's determination to catch a fish. In the story of the old man and the sea, a man shows that he can do what he sets out to do. The story shows his strong will and struggle against the weather, fatigue, pain and other elements that he encountered while at sea.In the story, Santiago said, &quot;A man can be destroyed, not defeated.&quot; I really like this statement. I think it is true. He faught to the end. Even when the sharks attacked his fish, he didn't give up. He still tried to protect the fish. He uses every method that he can think of not to be defeated by his enemy.The old man called the sea &quot;la mar&quot; which is masculine. He liked fishing and baseball. What I like about the old man is his dream. He always dreams about a lion. It's in a beautiful gold sea in Africa. I say I like it because not very many people dream about such beautiful places.In the end, the old man did catch the fish and made it back to his village. However, his physical conditionwas nearly distroyed. With his determination, he proved to the people of the village, the boy and himself that he was able to accomplish his dream in &quot;La mar.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"No matter what happens to you right now while reading this book review, you will always have your memories. Memories of when you were younger, strived for more, were stronger and more talented. Even at a very old age, one can think back and \\"live off his past\\". The prevailing message in The Old Man and The Sea by Ernest Hemmingway that is true now and forever is that a man can keep his faith in tomorrow by remembering yesterday.The lion in Santiago's (the old man's) dream was an example of how a man has fond memories from his previous years. In my opinion, the lion was a symbol of Santiago himself as he used to be. A lion possesses the same characteristics as a good fisherman like Santiago, and more so how Santiago was when he was young. Both a lion and a good fisherman must be strong and courageous. Santiago also displays feeling of affection and connection when he says on page twenty-five,\\"He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish... He only dreamed of places now and of lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them just as he loved the boy.\\" The lions remind Santiago of his current weakness as well as his previous strength. He sees how he was compared to how he is which depresses him but it also helps him keep faith for tomorrow.The boy that was once Santiago's helper symbolizes the faith in tomorrow that Santiago has. The boy used to go out with Santiago to sea everyday and helped him until they lost all luck and didn't catch any fish for months and months. The boy was forced to leave Santiago and help another fisherman. Throughout the novel, the boy had a spark of inspiration for Santiago and always had hope. Even though Santiago and the boy's father constantly recommended the boy not to go out with Santiago, he always wanted to. Even at the end when Santiago returns from his battle for the Marlin, the boy attempts to take care of the old man, convinced that everything will be alright. Santiago's dreams about the lions and the boy that once helped Santiago are both examples of how The Old Man and The Sea demonstrates the importance of memories and the strive for happiness in tomorrow. The reader is made sure to differentiate and assimilate between the two key examples on page twenty five when it states, \\"...He loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy.\\"Overall, this very figurative and inspirational novel was a pleasure to read because of it's simplicity and relaxed tone. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes in symbolism and that things happen for a reason."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by: Ernest HemingwayErnest Hemingway's novel, The Old Man and the Sea, is the classic struggle of man against nature, where a single man has to fight against a great marlin, the sea, and the hot sun. Santiago, the main character, is an old fisherman who lives in Cuba. He has been without a catch for eighty-four days, but as William J. Handy once said, &quot;To be defeated in the business of fishing is not to be a defeated man.&quot; The old man is depicted as a pathetic figure in his external appearances, but Hemingway describes his spirit through his eyes. &quot;Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.&quot;(p.2) Hemingway obviously believes the old saying: The eyes are the windows to the soul. His characterization in this book is far better than any other novel I have ever read. I like it so much because Hemingway uses extensive descriptions that let you picture the old man and get to know him on a personal level. He lets you into the old man's mind and you get to study his thoughts. This is only one of the many qualities that make The Old Man and the Sea such an astounding novel. Hemingway perfectly ties his theme into this story through the basic plot and the mood. This story is not only about man versus nature but it is also about the love and respect man should have for nature. In this book Santiago states, &quot;Fish, I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.&quot;(p.28) This is a reoccurring theme in this phenomenal novel that Hemingway believes should be taken to the heart. The plot of this novel is perfectly executed and makes your mind wanting to know what will unravel next. In the beginning the old man sets sail with his skiff on the eighty-fifth day of catching nothing, but this time he knows this will be the day he would catch a great fish. On his way out to sea, Santiago thinks of his days of youth and his essence of being back then; and he realizes that his essence of being hasn't changed but only his outward appearance. While he continues to ponder his life, he hooks the enormous fish. Immediately the focus switches and the battle begins. Now it is a contest of endurance, will, and spirit. The old man &quot;tried not to think but only to endure.&quot;(p.23) Jackson J. Benson said that Ernest Hemingway has &quot;perhaps the best ear that has ever been brought to the creation of English prose.&quot; In The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway uses a wonderfully descriptive style that causes the reader to hang on to every word and always wanting to read more. This is very unique that he can write with such details and still keep it from getting boring or dull. One thing that makes Ernest Hemingway's writing so admired is the fact that even with all the details and imagery he puts into his writing he is still able to hold the reader's focus. Although his sentences are full of detail in this book, Hemingway still keeps them clear and simple. The simplicity of these sentences are like human thoughts in the sense that they are short but meaningful. One excerpt from The Old Man and the Sea clearly illustrates this: &quot;They are good,&quot; he said. &quot;They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish.&quot;(25) This book is simple yet thought provoking, and for these reasons it can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I loved it and I think you will feel the same way about this Nobel Prize winning novel. The Old Man and the Sea is a marvelous piece of writing by Ernest Hemingway that will remain an American Classic forever."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA successfully reinstated Earnest Hemingway into literature after about a ten year absence, and what books he did have had little critical acclaim. He returns to his classic themes, the Hemingway Code (endure against all odds, conflicts being man against himself and man against nature) brilliantly enacted by an old Cuban Fisherman named Santiago. Actually, it is closer to a novella than a novel, short though still packing a powerful message of not giving up, which is the central theme is almost anything Hemingway wrote. A similar scene, if I remember correctly, also finds its way into ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, a posthumously published work wherein a boy fights for hours bring in a shark in the Gulf Stream, where this book is set.The story to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is simple enough. A fisherman named Santiago goes out in a little boat, attempting to bring in a giant marlin. The fisherman must go out, beyond the circle that is normally accepted, and travel in grounds (in this case waters) to a new place that would challenge his skills. The same theme is touched on in the short story &quot;Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, about the leopard who was high on the mountain, out of his usual bounds. He must endure the pain, must endure everything to get that giant marlin. The book, as noted in the amazon.com review, the gun element is eliminated from this, for the fisherman Santiago has to much age to deal with that. As Hemingway deftly weaves, in his vintage style of stripped and bare stye of prose writing, a spell that will leave you entranced. Ultimately, however, the story may end in what others view as tragedy, but to me this furthers Hemingway's maturity. Earlier, his life was one of big game hunting (&quot;Short Happy Life of Frances McComber&quot;, &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot;), and Hemingway's own need to bring down game and receive glory marvelously does not find itself in here. One thing that is notable is the movie follows this book to the tea, with the changing of only ONE WORD, which in itself probably resulted from a mistake.The quote about that anyone receiving the Nobel prize didn't write anything worthwhile, in this case, was true.. It is because of this work that got him the Nobel Prize, which is given as a whole for the body of work, just not a particular book. However, because of the 10 year absence, this book brought Hemingway back to the attention of the public - also the attention of the Nobel people."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a simple tale, but not one told by anidiot. I first read it when I was 12-years-old and can't say it is anovel I want to return to, just as I don't particularly want to return to Steinbeck's The Red Pony. But I would maintain that it is a wonderful introduction to Hemingway for a young reader. I believe that papa had his best period of production in the twenties and thirties, (Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms). He also wrote his better short stories during that time (The Snows of Kilimanjaro, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber [sic?]), but one can't dismiss this work entirely. The Old Man and the Sea reminds me of a Neruda poem, simple on the surface, yet reflecting larger themes. I'm sure you were all taught about microcosm vs. macrocosm in high-school English class, right? Well this is an example of the former, similar in some respects to Camus and Sartre and other existentialists. Santiago's struggle is similar to Camus' depiction in the Myth of Sysiphus. The old fisherman's struggle with his marlin is similar to Sysiphus' eternally rolling that stone uphill in Hades. It's something he is compelled to do by his very fibre and is thus comepletely resigned to. Yet choice is also involved, and thus we have an existentialist novel, produced from the simplest of stories. Ne-c'est-pas? We tend to dismiss this tale as a simplistic allegory, but should remember that this came out at the time when Sartre and Camus were producing their most important work. I don't think Hemingway was out-of-touch with the French literary movement of which he had always tried to remain a part."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a wonderful book that tells a story of an old man and his art of fishing. The author Earnest Hemingway uses intricate symbolism and a great story line to draw readers into this story. With these techniques he protraies a livable story that applies to many abroad./One aspect of this book I enjoyed was the old man, Santiago. His character, to me, helped me to become involved in the story. Earlier in the book , the old man was struggling with a large Marlin. Even with his body beaten and broken, he continued to fight the fish. The old man's strength and persistence helped me to appreciate his art of fishing./This is definitely a good book to read, not only once but many times over. It is a story that truly was one of Hemingway's greatest novels. Within it is contained beautiful writing and a meaning close to life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"As I started reading it was hard to put down, and it was a perfect length for any type of reader."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"AMAZING Gives lots of the important details. Very well written. It is one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is by far my favorite Ernest Hemingway story. As a fisherman myself I love how Santiago wrestles with the fish and himself through Out. I love the dialog as it goes back and forth with the man and his thoughts while in the boat. I equally like the ending how nothing needs to be said. I do not want to ruin it so I will go no further. Great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I wonder if, at first, he wanted to call this The Old Man and the Fish.I wonder if people accused him of dumbing down Moby Dick , sort of the Reader's Digest condensed version.My first experience with Sir Hemingway and I enjoyed every moment of this novella. He sure had a gift; one crazy-ass man, but a gifted writer, no less."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I always wanted to read Hemmingway since I started to write, mostly as an outlet for creative writing since last year. I learned one thing. How he abnoxiosely uses the word \\"and\\". Old English I loved the story"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I suggest reading this book in one sitting and preferably while you are exhausted either mentally or physically. You will experience what the old man feels and will be the better for it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book makes a great story with only a man, the sea and a fish (a big one). It's simple and great."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book has stood the test of time and there are several reasons for this. The story is easy to read and at 140 pages, easily read in a short period of time. IT is about an old man in Cuba who pits his wits against a marlin. It is a wonderful story of perseverance and friendship through the eyes of an old fisherman. I enjoyed it a great deal and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A well written, engrossing, but ultimately fatalistic story by one of the 20th century's masters. It is clear why this book is a classic, but it is not a feel-good read. Hemingway reels the reader in from the beginning as the Old Man and the Boy talk about fishing and life. You can't help but cheer for the underdog as the Old Man is trying to end a 3-month dry spell. But you can sense from the beginning of the Old Man's solo journey that things will not be ending well. For those of you looking for a happy ending, go elsewhere. If you are looking for a man's soul, this book will reveal it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a good story for anyone even those who might not fishing. Even though this is about a fishing trip it really not all of the story. This is a classic book that if you have some down time or just enjoy reading should be read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was possibly the worse choice I've ever made for a read-a-thon. The old man spends most of the book fighting the fish, weary, exhausted, tired. As I read, I tried desperately to stay awake, weary, exhausted, tired.I'm not at all interested in fish but Hemingway is a writer I love, thin and lean."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"So, my only complaint is that the book I received did not have the same cover as the one in the product picture. In my opinion, the pictured on in nicer. At the end of the day, the book isn't about the cover. (Noted: They gave me a two dollar refund, pretty good consider the book was only $7.20 when I purchased it)For being so short, this book has a lot of depth. Hemingway really has you in the head of Santiago or \\"The Old Man.\\" The story is a great story and I do not want to reveal too much. The book is very short, about 100 pages but certainly a must have on your shelf and a book you will read multiple times for sure.The book is nice because you can debate a lot about what is going on and what it may mean, but not in a way that is that will cause heated debate. If you have not read, get your hands on a copy, a classic story of struggle and perseverance!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old man and the Sea,\\" by Ernest Hemingway, is about a man who dreams about lions and sleeps on newspapers. His life is devoted to being a fisherman, and the book takes place mostly at sea. The Old Man dosen't have a name and is descibed as a strong person with the dedication and the will to hold on to a fish that he hooked that swims farther out to sea.This book has a lot of detail and builds pictures of the ocean's surroundings not only above the sea, but under the sea. Setting comes from the descriptions of the fish and the sea as the days turn from light to dark. The Old Man is alone and he descibes out loud his thoughts of how he knows where he is."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea when I was a freshman in high school. I still read it. I have gone through about three copies of it (when there is no room left on the pages to right notes, I purchase a new copy). Hemingway writes dialogues that sit right with me. That is how I am capable of describing it. I love the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway was brief and I will be as well. The purity and determination of the old man is gripping and touching. He boats the big one with his bare, bloody hands. It's his most glorious moment, and we have the opportunity to share in it and incorporate it into our lives. Sitting on a loung chair facing the ocean, this novel of immense proportion can not be put down. Thank you Ernest."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought that this was a great book. It was a story of an old man who had great perseverance and determination. He never gave up hope no matter what the circumstances. I recommend this book to everyone, so they can experience the book themselves."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book was exciting and on the edge cliff hangers. The book was better than the movie so go read the book now !!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think this book should be read by everyone that likes a bit of kinkyness and coolness mixed togeather.If you do read this book you must try to watch the movie when your done.If I had to read this book again I probably would understand more of the emotional parts.If you like books with adventure this book is the one!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"it is a pretty good book. it was kinda boring though. Basically it is about a fisherman who catches a marlin and about his struggles"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The story was very simply written almost like almost like a story from Aesop. If this were a fable then I would say that the moral would be about loyalty, from begging to end. The boy shows so much loyalty towards the old man by helping every morning before they go out on their own separate boats. When they come in for the evening the boy waited on the old man and fixed him supper even though everyone in the town thinks it unlucky to be around the old man. The old man shows much respect towards the fish by bringing him in even after the marlin has been almost completely devoured circling sharks. The towns people show their respect to the old man by hanging the marlin skeleton by the docks for every to see."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"one must understand when reading this novel that is not what ernest hemingway writes, using a fisherman as his muse, but rather the underline meaning within that muse using the symboles that creats mystery and intregues the mind. I found myself combing the novel trying to find the story within the story, so to speak. The way each person is able to see something different and each word is left open to interpritation."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"To read this book and come away with simply a story of fishing is mocking the true story line and Hemingway himself. The story reaches the depths of the human experience of lonliness, survival, and courage. The old man is a wonderful character with qualities of a hero."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a classic; it is wonderful fishing epic. Only Hemingway could write this book in a way that keeps it simple yet is very descriptive. It is my favorite book mostly because it is about fishing but also because of the deep meanings and allegories it has. Deep meanings about how he struggled and fought the fish for days after not catching anything for 84 days, is in a way related to Hemingway at the time. He had been in a slump with bad writing for a long time then came out of the slump as Santiago in the book had. This is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was in my opinion and good book, but with a few exceptions. When I was first assigned to read this book for English class I immediatly procrastinated when I would yet to begin reading this book. Days passed, then weeks, and I still had not even glanced at the book. After a few weeks I finally decided to look at the book. I read about ten pages and immediately found myself bored with the book. I out the book away and didn't retreave it until later. I was sitting home one weekend watching TV when I came across a movie that looked familiar. After watching about twenty minutes of this movie I realized that it was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. I was very taken back when I continued watching the movie. I really liked it and best of all I found it easier to understand. After the three hour movie I was very surprised about how much I like the story. But I was even more surprised when I kept thinking in my head about the story and wanted to read the book. I immediatly ran to my backpack and got the book. I read the whole thing in about 1 hour and enjoyed it greatly. I apprecited it alot more too. I espechially like it because the story was indeed well told and focussed on so many other things than I thought it did. One part in the book that I liked alot was when the old man talked about his days when he was younger and how he had spent so many long hours, and sometimes days giving everything he had just to win a simple arm wrestling match. But, everytime he was able to earn a victory. I also liked how Ernest Hemingway captured the moment just right. E.H. featured many places and scenes in the book and did not always ficus what was important but really set the mood and tone for the events that were about to, or yet to happen in the book. Another thing I must mention that I liked was that the old man had so much respect in the book. I just loved this story so much and how it captured everything so well. I think it was really well written and even though it took me awhile to discover the true meaning in this book and can honestly say that I am pleased and happy that I gave the book and chance. In a way I can refer myself to the book, alot of people in the book did not really want to give the old man a chance, and didn't think he would ever catch a fish again but the old man proved them wrong and only the people who had true respect for the old man understood that he would always succeed. This is what I did, I gave the book a chance and myself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I always enjoy reading Hemingway's book The Old Man and the Sea. It is a great book because it can be read on so many levels. There is the adventure of the catch, but it is more. It is a great example of love and sharing between two people, Santiago and the boy. It also brings back memories of the Native American ethic of loving your environment. Santiago loves the sea. He cares about its creatures even as he is attempting to land the fish. He feels the same way about the sky, wind and sun. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves classic literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I love this book. I read it for the first time in seventh grade and have read it 4 times since. I love it even though it may be boring to some people. The imagery is great and the story, even better."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was one of the best classics that I ever had to read for an English class. When our teacher first told us that we were to go buy it, I was very reluctant. I didn't want to read a stupid book about fishing, I can't stand to fish! However, I took a trek to the store and brought it home and wow! I couldn't put it down. I was finished with the story in two days. I found that Hemingway's style of writing was fascinating to me and the way he described things made them come alive. When he would talk about Santiago, I was able to envision him standing in front of me and he used great figures of speech. For instance, one of my favorite lines in the book was, &quot;his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish...but none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.&quot; I was glad I read this book, it taught me a lot about life and materialism and made me realize just what you can achieve for yourself if you put your mind to it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;This is a book just about fishing&quot;. Many people think this is what The Old Man and The Sea is about, but it more than just fishing. It is about the struggle of a man, Santiago, to catch his fish, and his perseverance through all odds. He is an old man, but he is determined, and he never gives up on reaching his goal. Even though there are a good sixty or so pages of Santiago being dragged by the fish, the pages pass quickly due to Hemingways great writing style. This book at first glance may appear boring, but if you get to discuss it with a book club or classmates, you will discover that it is a great book with multiple hidden meanings that are fun to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"To be completely honest, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is not a book I particularly cared for. I thought that too much time was taken to describe the fishing trip. I thought that the overall idea had a very powerful underlying meaning, but I feel he wrote about it the wrong way. The struggles Santiago had to undergo were very important aspects in this book, but they were too drawn out and that often caused me to lose interest in the novel. So, in conclusion, I liked the idea of self-respect in the face of defeat and being a true hero, but the book was uninteresting and far too lengthy in many of the passages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea had some really interesting thoughts in it that made me think about hero's in a new way. The story of Santiago's struggles and how he returned with no physical rewards or prizes, seemed very relatable, very realistic. I really admired the old fisher, amazed at what he endured, and sympathetic to his fate. It would have been romantic if he had returned with his marlin, and the story had ended happily. However, just like you learn from struggles in life, I learned a lot more from the struggles in the book. The thing that I liked the most about the book was that Hemingway challenged most people's view (at least in the western world) of a hero. I liked that he showed in this story that the superficial and worldly prizes aren't necessary to make a human being worthy of admiration. Also, just like the tourist's at the end didn't understand what the fisherman had gone through, most people don't recognize the true hero's that are alive now, but not to let that discourage you. Though the story was sad, I really enjoyed it. It made me think that maybe, even though though I might not become wealthy or beautiful or famous, that I still might attain true worth through obstacles that I face and overcome, by my character, not my prizes."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Over the last few months, I had the pleasure of reading Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. I found the book extremely easy, fast reading, and interesting. The constant struggles of Santiago were particularly interesting in the way it was described. Not only could you get the sense of what he was feeling, but also you felt as if you were in the boat alongside him. Where others may find his time at sea drawn out and uninteresting, I thought it only added to the fascinating complex and personality of the book itself. Even though I am a strict science fiction reader, I found that this book captured my attention and kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In the tradition of great Ernest Hemingway books, The Old Man and the Sea is another success. In my opinion the book was written and very descriptive. The caracter Santiago was close to being an excellent example of a Christ-like figure. The last chapter of the book you get a good comparison of Santiago to Christ on the Cross. The book really shows the similarities. Manolin was also a interesting representation of a disiple. He looked up to Santiago as Jesus' disiples had done. I would very much so recommend this book to anyone it is easy for kids to read but still entertaining enough for adults."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In my opinion, this book is just flat out boring, but i can see why it won an award. It just tells a story of a group of fisherman who live off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere in Cuba. it gives a perspective on how poor people are in some places and how poor people can be. i gave it three stars becaues half the people that read it will like it and half the people that read it will hate it. i dont care if you dissagree with this review, infact i think its awesome if you do because it sheds a light on how different people are. NRG"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I respect Hemmingway in the fact that he was a very good writer, but I just didn't like this book.

Looking at in general it is not exciting book and it lacks a real plot that makes a person really want follow the book with out putting it down. In that sense i did not enjoy the book , because i like exciting books filled with happening stuff. On a deeper level Santiago is represented as a courageous man who is determined to catch the fish.

While out fishing he would come across different things and connect with them. He would come across fish and creatures from the sea.I think the story meant that even if you are alone you can always find something to connect with. i also think that the author and his passage he is trying to tell the reader would be conflict and mental conflict he had to deal with being alone and how to interact with different things.

No highlighting, markings or anything, so I am very appreciative. Would do business again if need be."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"...Page after page of predictable events leave much to be desired by a reader. When a book wins the Pulitzer Prize, I would expect it to be more detailed and interesting. When I sit down to read a book, I want it to be something that catches my eye, not something that bores me to death from the minute that I begin. The Old Man and the Sea, written by Ernest Hemmingway, is an uncaptivating story lacking details and excitement.With an ongoing plot of persistence Santiago faces his unexpected fate. For example, Santiago, who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-five days, is confident and keeps trying. Santiago's fish seems to never come. He never gives up, knowing it will work out in the end. When he finally gets his fish, there seems to be a barrier keeping him from his prize. Furthermore, Santiago's fate of persistence does not turn out how he planned. He expects to bring in this glorious fish, but little does he know that fate is trying to stop him. Through the obstacles he faces, he finds that life isn't always how it is expected to be. Santiago's persistence kept the book going, with the same lack of detail in everything that happened.Through Santiago's persistence I can relate this story to my life, though I found it dull and boring. For instance, no matter what happened to Santiago, he stayed positive and persistent. There have been many times I have needed to be persistent to go on. Even if in the end it doesn't turn out how you want it to and you feel as though you have failed. I, like Santiago, have found it is better to have failed trying then to just give up. Moreover, I found the story to be boring and definitely not a page turner. I was not looking forward to reading it, for the simple reason it didn't keep me interested. It seemed like the same events kept occurring and that I have read it before. The lack of details made it hard for me to stay hooked on each moment in this book. Even with relating this book to my life, I still dreaded what was to come next.The Old Man and the Sea is the first, and the last book that I plan to read by Ernest Hemmingway. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a book that would put them to sleep. Going through the book, only anticipating the end is not what I see as excitement. This book just leads to disappointment toward an award winning author with every page that is turned."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I asked my classmates when I was in school to select the Hobbit as a reading assignment instead, but they insisted on The Old Man and the Sea because it was a few pages shorter and they were just a lazy bunch of semi-literates. I normally like the classics, whether 20th Century classics or Shakespear, Wilde, Dickens, Shelly, Lord Byron and so on. No one has to force me to read books by those authors. That is why I was surprised that I hated so much a book by such a highly regarded author, such as Hemmingway. The characters were just boring. I didn't care for teh old man or the kid. It seems that nothing really happens in the book. You could skip the entire middle part of it and end up with pretty much the same story. By the way, this is the only Hemmingway story that I have read so maybe he has some other better stuff. This book has, however, put me off him and I don't expect to pick up another by him for the foreseable future, unless I get a really good recommendation."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"While this book was well written as far Hemingway's style is concerned, I fail to comprehend the point of a man trying to catch a fish (which is what the book basically focus's on) If you are looking for an easy fast read, and enjoy the sport of fishing, I would then go on to say yes, read it if you like. But if you want a comprehensive book...this book is NOT for you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I must've (literally) fallen asleep at least five times before making it through the first 50 pages... the beginning is hard to get into, and basically a total drag... once you get past that, however, it gets more interesting (although, by that time, you're halfway through the book). The end is incredibly disappointing, but has a lot of meaning to it. The entire book is filled with hidden meanings and allusions, but some are hard to catch. Overall, an okay book, but I certainly wouldn't label it as a classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was boring because it said the same thing over and over.

Although I could not possibly understand all of the hidden meanings that Hemingway had put in, I loved the way the book was simple.

I never put this book down once. Hemingway writes in such amazing detail, that I felt as if I was sitting in the boat next to the old man watching everything play out in front of me, and I didn't want to miss anything. I felt as if the story might somehow change if I were to put it down and I needed to know what would happen next. I will be reading many more of Hemingways novels because of his ability to translate storytelling to written literature so effortlessly. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Truly a masterpiece, this book perfectly describes a man's life on the sea, and the bond he feels towards the fish.

The Old Man's desire to catch the fish was displayed throughout the entirety of the novel. I enjoyed the climax of his catching of the fish, though I believe the joy of the story was ruined when the sharks ate his well deserved fish. I will say that the characters' traits are very well portrayed and the Old Man, especially, touches the heart.

The book is packed &quot;to the gills,&quot; with symbolism comparable to daily life, daily struggles and events.Santiago (the old man) hooks a marlin that is gargantuan, an enormous creature, worth an immeasurable lot when contrasted with his extreme poverty. Him and the fish do battle. Santiago spends the book finding himself, fighting himself in his mind, warring over failure and the impossibility of letting that happen.I think this book, as a whole represents following one's dreams. Despite the looks of the onlookers, to follow through with it even if you don't end up with any results, its about how much you've grown getting there. An excellent book. I recommend it for any age group, for the younger readers the fascinating imagery is enough to satiate there imagainist fancies and for adults Hemmingway's novella over growing old, and the symbolism there of is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my husband and he loved it.

For 84 days, the old man Santiago hasn&iexcl;t been able to catch a thing. But bad luck and others&iexcl; lack of faith in him, with the exception of his former apprentice, don&iexcl;t stop Santiago, who remembers his greatest catch back in 1985 and decides that things will improve greatly on the 85th day. He sails his skiff far into the Gulf Stream and that is where he feels the great marlin attach. Santiago tries to reel the marlin in, but it&iexcl;s too strong and so he hangs on and lets the marlin pull him across the open sea. For three days, Santiago hangs on to the line, despite cuts, pains, and no sleep. During this time, Santiago talks to himself to keep his mind fresh, and has discovered a deep bond with this huge fish, the catch of his life. &iexcl;Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought, but are they worthy? &iexcl;He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth.The punishment of the hook, the punishment of hunger and not comprehending his adversary is everything&iexcl;&iexcl; Finally on the third day, Santiago manages to pull the marlin close enough to kill it with his harpoon. But as Santiago turns back for his island, sharks sense the marlin&iexcl;s blood and attack the skiff. Santiago defends them both as best as he can, but new pods of sharks are always arriving. In the end, the marlin is so badly mutilated that santiago realizes that he has ruined them both by going too far and forcing the marlin&iexcl;s defeat. Santiago makes it back home, without any great catch, but a blissful dream of lions on a golden beach in Africa."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am not enthusiastic about this book but I respect it and I understand why it is considered a classic. The Nobel Prize for literature is more of a lifetime achievement award even though this book was specifically cited as follows: \\"For his powerful, style-forming mastery of the art of modern narration, as most recently evinced in 'The Old Man and the Sea.'\\"The book tells the story that is so familiar that I won't bother to repeat its details here. The original true story which Hemingway described in a journalism piece available in \\"Byline: Ernest Hemingway\\" was a brief account of a Cuban fisherman who hooked an enormous billfish in his little boat and got pulled out into the open ocean. The fish is attacked and partly devoured by sharks. A large fishing boat rescues the unnamed fisherman; he is delirious, having gone for days without food or water. The fish is brought back to the dock in Cuba: there's a picture of the huge and still formidable half eaten fish hanging by the tail.Hemingway fictionalized this story almost two decades later to make it a symbolic parable about man's struggle against nature and against his own frailty. The old man, Santiago, holds on by sheer willpower, at one point he says to the fish, let me kill you or you can kill me, I don't care which.In addition to speaking to the fish and to the sharks that attack at the end of his voyage, Santiago also spends time talking to his injured left hand, an obvious reference to the looming Communist revolution in Cuba. The fish and the old man Santiago represent the huddled masses of Cuba yearning to breathe free. The sharks that attack represent, variously, worldwide mercantile Capitalism, jingoistic American gunboat diplomacy and the oppressive authoritarian Bautista regime under which poor Santiago is starving to death. Santiago is able to beat down attacks by the first two but the last succeeds in picking clean the marlin's carcass. Thus, Hemingway shows that Cuban revolution had not yet developed sufficient strength in 1952 to overcome the brutal Bautista dictatorship."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An Original StoryDo you know what makes a great story well I think I do. I believe that The Old Man and the Sea is a great original story. I will tell my thinking about a great story.The Old Man and the Sea shows how life experience can make a great story.For example Ernest Hemingway was a great fisherman; I know this from watching his biography. I like the way Ernest uses the intelligence of his own life in his story The Old Man and the Sea. I like this story very much; it is one of the best I have ever read. In the same way, other authors use bits of information from their lives. I do not like books or stories that I can't learn anything from it. I like to find information on the person or what they do. Therefore the style of writing in The Old Man and the Sea is the kind of writing that catches my attention the most.In this story Ernest Hemingway uses voice very well. For instance Ernest didn't use voice in conversations with characters talking to other characters very often, he made up little blurts of speaking. I like Ernest's way of including a lot of voice without using vary many characters. Santiago talks to a bird that lands on the skiff that show Ernest's originality and how he uses voice. Likewise Ernest Hemingway's use of voice contributes to his overall story The Old Man and the Sea. I say this because Ernest used the exact right amount of voice in this story. When making a story I find that using original voice might make the story much better. All in all I say that voice was used very well in this story.Using personal experience, originality, and great voice all contribute to a great story. This kind of writing is good for any kind of reading. This book is the second best I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think this book is not for young people to read.

I recognized the metaphors about life, but I didn't care because the story just wasn't engaging. Eat raw dolphin, pee over the side of the boat, pull the fish. Rinse and repeat.I thought maybe re-reading it as an adult might change my perspective, but no. It's still boring. I didn't even finish it this time.

I read this many years ago as a child and have returned to it and have come away profoundly affected.This time for me.....The book brought a sense of peace - an appreciation for the indomitable spirit of a man who refuses to give in to self-pity - who accepts that the simple life often delivers more richness than that cluttered with possessions and fraught relationships.The Sea plays a major part - representing life and eternity. Here we have a little old man - on a fragile boat gliding across this powerful monolith - subject to the whims of powers outside of his control.And isn't that just like our lives?But he embraces this with courage, acceptance and love. His indomitable spirit refuses to give in even when he catches an enormous fish and then loses it - he treats it all the same: gain and loss - two imposters.It's more than a story of a man catching a fish. It really is. And if you view it just like that then disappointment will follow.It is an allegory of life and we must be grateful for this insightful and magical account. The writing is sparse and simple without embelishment or exaggeration and this adds to the temperate effect."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was extremely well written.

I love novels of colors and flavors, novels with variety and awkward sentences. The Old Man and the Sea would certainly get an 800 on the SAT II, but, well, Shakespeare would've barely gotten the 200 for his name. Still not comprehending? Once upon a time, in all of our lives, we have had to take a course titled &quot;grammar.&quot; If you enjoy simple sentences that get the point across quickly and bluntly, this book will by far exceed your greatest expectations. Hemingway is for the impatient readers.

I thought the beginning was good and captured my attention, but as the book went on it got very dull. When he was following the fish the imagery was good, but it was boring. I also didn't get the comparison to God. I really don't think that it was intentional of Hemmingway to have Santiago to appear as a Christ-like figure.

On the 85th day, Santiago sets out determined that this is the day he will end his unlucky streak.He has decided that in order to catch something, he must sail out farther than usual, go beyond the \\"safe zone\\" with all the other fishermen near the shore.When Santiago feels a tremendous tug at his line, he knows that this is it. This is what he has been waiting for. This is the big catch.The fish, a marlin, proves to be bigger than anything the old fisherman has ever handled. It challenges Santiago's strength, courage and endurance. For days he hangs on, his fishing line cutting deep into his hands and back. But he will not give up the fight. The marlin pulls him farther and farther from his home, from all mankind. It is just him, the marlin, and the open sea. Finally, the fish gives up and the old man wins the battle.But the war is not over yet. On the journey home the old man's boat sails into shark-infested waters. Ironically, Santiago now has to protect the marlin he just killed.This story is about a man's place not against, but within nature. Out at sea, all alone, he develops a relationship with the marlin and the sharks, and we come to understand that perhaps man is not always the superior species. His part in nature is the same as all creatures: he has a place in life and in death."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Official words of praise for a set of randomly-selected Nobel laureates (available at nobelprize.org): 1) Jos&eacute; Samarago (1998): \\"who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality\\"; 2) Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez (1982): \\"for his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts\\"; 3) John M. Coetzee (2003): \\"who in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider.\\" Now for Hemingway's (1954): \\"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style\\"While the first three commendations speak of substance, praise for Hemingway refers to style. This answered my question -- my reading experience of the book had been unexpectedly dry. An old Cuban fisherman Santiago, who dreams of lions on the shores of Africa, sets out sailing for his biggest challenge/catch. While the solitary narration of Santiago vividly reconstructed the challenge, and most of all revealed his own life-like character, I could not help but expect for more from this famed novella. Yes, it made me ponder over life, but shouldn't there be more to it?In all justice, the book must have been great in earlier years. Deducing from the words of praise above, I surmise that the novella had been a victim of its own success. For how would it be possible for a reader to be impressed by its style when all contemporary works are influenced by it?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hello, my name is Billy Blanks and i am a high school senior. I have read Old Man and the Sea countless times since i was forced to read it my freshman year(that was before i found out about a litle thing called cliffnotes). But any way back to the book. Old Man and the Sea is a great book for anyone who loves a great story or in my case just loves fishing. It is the best book ever, and i think everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"... Isn't it great to be swept away into the thrill of the adventure in a story? I love that too, but that's not the experience I had when reading The Old Man and the Sea. Even this story's title lacks excitement! But the title really says it all. It's about an old man ... on the sea. I was expecting a little more from a book that won an award. It's not what I had anticipated. I was hoping to feel the sensation of the open sea snatch me away from the real world and drop me into a wet wonderland, but instead I ended up being taken to the land of slumber. The Old Man and the Sea needs more action.From reading this book, I have come to find that The Old Man and the Sea has no point. For instance, half the book's dialogue is Santiago, the main character, talking to himself or the fish. A one sided conversation is like talking to a wall or in this case, it's talking to a fish. Conversations are interesting because people get to express their opinions; it's boring to read about an old man rambling on about his problems. What makes a story exciting is the adventure the main character has. Additionally, while having those \`' fish conversations'' Santiago is just sitting in a boat. While he bobs up and down on the waves like a log on the sea, not much action is taking place. This book lacks the intensity that is essential to keep readers hooked.Because I did not see the point of this story, I was not satisfied with The Old Man and the Sea. There is no stimulation when reading this book. The thrill of a book is like frosting on a cake, it's what makes it so good! For example, when I got to the middle of the story, I almost fell asleep! Additionally, I never felt a connection with any of the characters. It's important to know the characters to understand how they feel in different situations. If the readers can't make a connection then it's like being excluded from a group.I wouldn't recommend this book to any one who likes to actually stay awake when reading. This book was very bland and boring. The reason for reading is to experience things you can't otherwise do in your own life. People know what it's like to be board. The Old Man and the Sea just isn't anything new."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Agonizing. This describes my emotions while reading Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Although it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, it reeks with dreadful writing. The protagonist is Santiago, an old, unlucky fisherman. After suffering through over 80 days without a catch, he captures the largest fish on record. It becomes a great struggle to make it home with the fish and his life. A simple story it is, but not nearly as simple as Santiago's character. Not to mention the dreadful manner in which the book was written. The Old Man and the Sea is a plain book, especially with the old man as the main character.Hemmingway didn't invent any complex characters; nor did he create an original one. Most men have several attributes and flaws that make them who they are, but this isn't evident in the Hemmingway tale. For instance, Santiago spends the majority of his time fishing and he does this near flawlessly. A character needs to be more complex. No man is perfect and no man spends all of his time doing one thing. Likewise, Ernest Hemmingway was a fisherman himself. He didn't produce his own unique character. He only borrowed some aspects of his own life and threw them upon Santiago. Therefore, Santiago is a basic version of Hemmingway. His writing demonstrates the same simplicity.The so-called style of The Old Man and the Sea is merely a poor model of exceptional literature. Through the words of Hemmingway, I am left uninspired and my imagination is not satisfied. For example, a sentence from his book reads, \\"It is strange\\" (84). Believe it or not, this is an entire sentence from the book. Reading this is like staring at a blank wall. There is no creativity present and it leaves a person feeling like the wall...empty. On top of that lackluster sentence, the book uses little figurative language. All decent works are coated with artistic similes, metaphors, hyperboles, and personifications. In Hemmingway's novel, finding such writing is like looking for Waldo in a sea of red and white stripes. All in all, nothing inventive was used when composing The Old Man and the Sea.One would expect a Pulitzer Prize winning story to be a fascinating account, bursting with creativity. However, The Old Man and the Sea is better suited as an inadequate example of literature. Considering a horrible lead character and the dull manner of the book, Hemmingway does not deserve such a great honor for such a bad book. On the next visit to the library, make sure The Old Man and the Sea is as far away as possible."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The review of The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemmingway is a great author but he is a little slow. He used his characters quite a bit, almost too much; it made the book drag on and on and on. But he also showed his emotions very well, you could tell that he had experienced fishing before. The Old Man and the Sea is a vivid yet boring book that has a good story.I didn't like this book because of how Hemmingway had Santiago talk so much, and the book had no action. For example, the entire book was Santiago talking to himself, this kept me from getting into the book. If he explained more about the conflict or added action, the book could have been a great one. I don't think Hemmingway could have written a more boring story. In addition, there was no action up until the end, before it's just Santiago speaking to himself. If Hemmingway had a good rising action in this book it could have been a more exciting book because you anticipate the ending. It also seemed like Santiago kept repeating the same exact schedule making me want to put the book down. Because the book was fairly boring not too many people would get into the book and know what they read 5 minutes ago.Hemmingway also used a lot of detail making you feel inside the book along with a lot of info. For instance, every fact Santiago states Hemmingway gave you a descriptive and good explanation to it. I think this may have helped the book out by creating a good picture in your head. Along with giving you a lot of information so you can predict what will happen next. Additionally, Hemmingway made you feel you could feel what Santiago feels. With all of the detail and descriptive wording it gave you a touch of emotion and a feeling that Santiago may be feeling. Also Ernest let you know he knew what he was talking about by giving you so much information. For these reasons I would recommend this book to adults and not children.If Hemmingway didn't use Santiago as a source of speaking so much this book could have been great. Because he did and I wouldn't recommend this book to many people except for adults. Though, I did like how he showed his emotions through his writing making the reader feel involved. All in all this entire book isn't for kids and it isn't for someone who wants action or a good story to pump them up, it's for someone who is very emotional and likes slow stories."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaAn old man goes on an exciting adventure of catching a marlin. The book, The Old Man and the Sea had a good plot but didn't have any good details to keep you interested in the story. I found myself dozing off while trying to read this book. Hemingway does do a good job at connecting the main character (Santiago) to himself.Overall the book is a good story but lacking in interesting details which would have made the book a lot better.Hemingway's writing style is good for adults and old people, but most kids would not find this book enjoyable. However, he uses simple words to make his book easy to read (about a 6th grade reading level). It also seems like hes got massive run on sentences that go on forever. His word choice is boring and puts me to sleep, for example: When Santiago attacks the sharks; he should have referred to them as something like blood-thirsty beast like mutants, instead of the plain boring \\"sharks.\\" On the on the other hand, story has a good plot and his story is sort of based upon his own life. The character Santiago is similar to Ernest Hemingway in that their both old fishermen and have similar personality traits. Santiago is faced with his biggest enemy, \\"bad luck\\" (which reflects upon his own life) and that he must over come it by catching a giant marlin in order to feel that he has succeeded in his goal. book is nothing without exciting details.The plot in the book starts out where Santiago is in a fishing slump and is desperate for a big fish. Although, he has bad luck, Santiago is determined to catch a giant marlin in the struggle between man vs. fate. Santiago is very persistent in pursuing his goal but has mental problems. Since he has no friends he talks to the sea. He faces many hardships when at sea like the ferocious sharks which almost kill him. In addition, Santiago finds and hooks a giant marlin but it is very strong andputs up a good fight. Since he has problems, Santiago talks to fish and I even think he became friends with the marlin as he was struggling to capture it. Santiago did not have to go on a possible suicidal mission to catch a dumb fish. Throughout this book, Hemingway had great ideas but no interesting details to add which made this boringAnd hard to read.If I were to rate this book out of 10 it would get a 2. It may be a good book for old people who like boring books, but I hated this book. It is trash, I don't know how this book won the Pulitzer Prize. Going on a fishing trip to catch a big fish, just doesn't catch my interest. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 30."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Some people think of Ernest Hemingway as an outstanding writer of great imagination and creativity. But I think the exact opposite. I find his writing very dull and confusing. That's why I am simply puzzled at knowing that this book won the Pulitzer Prize.Fishing is not what most people would like to read about, even though that is the plot of the book. The main character, Santiago, is considered an unlucky fisherman. His Salaoness (is what they call it) has made him not catch a fish for 84 straight days! He does not want to live life like that so he decides to set out on a journey. A journey that he will never forget and never give up on. That's why this brings me to something that I can relate to. Persistence is the main key word here. Santiago doesn't give up when he can't catch a fish. I can relate to that on many ways because I am also a very persistent person! If I give up at something I will regret it for a very long time!Speaking of regretting, I regret reading this book! It wasn't a book that I enjoyed. Its dullness really made it hard to concentrate. It was hard to follow and confusing to read. I feel that the author should have made the plot more exciting and have some more adventure in it. That's why I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has a lower level of reading. I would say that a person from the ages of 14 or above would do well reading this. It uses larger words which would make it a little hard for younger readers to comprehend.The book The Old Man and the Sea was a very unusual book. It was many mysteries that you will have to find out when you read it. I am sure that anyone interested in this topic would enjoy it a lot! So get on your marks, get set, and read!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Old man and the sea; a Pulitzer prize winning story about an old fisherman named Santiago, a large fish named Fish, and a four-day struggle that ended badly. Sounds romantic doesn't it? Well, not to me. Maybe it's because I'm a high school junior. Maybe it's because I was forced to read it. But I did not think this story good enough to be even considered for the Pulitzer let alone win the prize.Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is boring, tedious, and repetitive. And this story was no exception. From beginning to end it was one depressing trial to another. When Santiago was not in some type of pain (emotional as well as physical) such as when he got a rope burn when the fish got a sudden burst of speed. he was remembering some type of almost surreal memories that might have added to the story if they had anything to do with it. This shows that hemmingway's style of writing may have reflected his life. In an A&E; documentary about his life we were shown that he had several wives. I believe that the fish symbolized the wives that he lost by the plain fact that Santiago struggled for so long and when he caught the fish he only lost it to sharks.The four day struggle between the old man and the old fish was hard for both of them, but when the sharks came was harder on the fish. Ripping the very flesh off his cold, dead, lifeless carcass until the fish was nothing but a skeleton. I find that while I do feel sorry for Santiago who fished for eighty-four days straight without caching any fish, and then struggled for another four days with one fish only to loose it to sharks in the end, I am the most sympathetic towards the fish. The Fish was just living at the bottom of the sea when he got hooked after trying to find a bite to eat. If I were the fish I would have taken him into the Bermuda triangle or something like that, not just dragging him around until I died in vain.So, I would not read this book if I had a choice. But, since I don't, I would say that this book is perfect if I was living in the time of the story. But since I am not I feel that I should warn this reader that this book is a perfect flop."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you are an average Joe looking for a good book to read, this is not for you.

I do not recommend."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea ReviewUnclear and confusing. These words describe The Old Man and the Sea. It is about an old man, Santiago, who likes to fish. He hasn't caught a fish in 84 days and is very disappointed. He goes out to sea and hooks a Marlin, but runs into trouble. This book uses unfamiliar words and it leaves you lost.The Old Man and the Sea is unclear in the writing. For example, \\"Bad luck to your mother\\" is just one of the fragments Ernest Hemingway uses. Fragments leave the reader with an incomplete thought. An author should know not to use fragments in their writing. Authors should also know not to use unfamiliar words. For instance, Hemingway uses the Spanish word \\"Galanas\\". He doesn't give a definition or any clue of what the word might mean. A well written book shouldn't use undefined or unusual words. His writing was unclear, but the whole story was puzzling.The overall book was confusing. For example, the ending leaves the reader lost. I wasn't able to tell what the protagonist was felling. It left the reader hanging there. In addition, The Old Man and the Sea has no adventure. I don't enjoy fishing or reading about it. Catching a fish doesn't catch my attention! The entire book was confusing and boring.The Old Man and the Sea was unclear and confusing. It left the reader lost or -with an incomplete thought.

Boy, was i wrong!! I (usually) am a super- fast reader! a 400 page novel MAY take me 2 days if its good but Old Man and the Sea took me over a month!

So- unless you can't get yourself to sleep at night- DONT READ THIS BORING BOOK!..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book that I read was the Old Man and the Sea. This book is a novel written by Ernest Hemingway.The conflict is the old man struggling with the fish, the climax is sharks eat the fish, and it is resolved when the man gets home.The major character in this book was the old man. His name was Santiago. He was an old, weathered fisherman who was skinny and not very attractive to look at. He was always very determined and very strong. He never gave up hope and he always saw the good in things. He didn't have many friends; in fact, he only had one- the boy. Others thought that he was a stupid old man because he usually didn't catch anything and he was very poor. Over the course of the novel, he changes in the way that he realizes that people aren't always lucky, and that sometimes you just can't win.The theme of this book was that you will get defeated, but don't give up hope.I personally didn't care for this book. It was very boring and uneventful. It did, however, make me feel some emotion- I felt very sorry for the fisherman- so it did get me into the book in that way. Other than that, thought, I did not like this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book is based on one fishing trip in the middle of nowhere with an old man and a giant marlin. The only inspiring thing about this book is the old man's ability to stay strong enough to capture the marlin. Other than that, this book was so, so boring. First of all, why didn't they just summarize those three days with a couple of pages. Instead, I was forced to read an endless amount of pages that seemed to get longer about him catching and losing his prize fish/trophy. What's the point? He was already poor, and now he's lost one of the most important things to happen to him. It was a lost phenomenon. I would have cryed and jumped off the boat if I had been the odl man. That's how depressing this book is. You can't help but feel sympathetic when you read this book. This book doesn't teach any morals or writing skills; it teaches us to avoid reading anything by Hemingway. Even though Hemingway was praised for this novella, I question &quot;what is true literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"i had to read this for english class a few years back...yuck. this was probably one of the most boring, simple books i've ever read...i realize hemingway writes very simply but jeez....here's the plot...this old man goes out into the sea with a dinky little boat....he fishes...and fishes...and fishes...and fishes...then some sharks come..he fights them..they come again...and again...and eat what he has caught...and then....here's the climax...he goes home...Zzzzzzzz"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever watched anyone fish? Pretty boring, isn't it? Well, just imagine how much more boring it would be to read about somebody else fishing. That should give you a sense of how mind-numbing an experience it is to read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; I am not ignorant of its deep religious symbolism. It is certainly a profound story, but it also happens to be a very dull one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Out of the mind of an author so famed and prestigious comes the story of a fisherman who goes out to catch fish. That's all this story contains within its pages, in the literal sense. A man who hasn't caught fish in a long time goes out to catch fish and then comes home.But what's even worse than the long stretches of endless detail and description and the old man talking to himself and to his left hand and to the sea and to a fish and to the dolphin and te tuna is the overpowering sense of symbolism. We are taught that the man is a symbol for Jesus Christ and that the Sea is God and that &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is a parallel story to that of Jesus. In the end, Santiago (the main character) hauls his mast up the hill in likeness to Christ bearing the Cross. It almost seems as if Hemingway wrote this book specifically to call to mind the story of Jesus. But I don't remember the story of Jesus ever being this boring, this drawn-out, and this underhandedly self-righteous.This book is definitely not an adventure book, and that's fine, people often look for a book that is not action packed and filled with good/bad warring against each other. But this book barely even qualifies for a thought provoking novella. It is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Stories that win awards, especially the Pulitzer, usually cause people to have high expectations when reading them. This can lead them to be disappointed in the writings. I believe this is the case with the story: The Old Man and the Sea. The book is very interesting, but it lacks the ability to make the reader empathize and there is an absence of evenly distributed action and excitement. Because of this I don't believe this story deserves the Pulitzer.While reading The Old Man and the Sea, I did not share or experience the suffering that Santiago felt. For example, Santiago felt a large amount of pain, but it was not expressed in a way that the reader could feel it. When the reader can not feel what the protagonist or any other character is feeling, it makes it very hard to connect with the writing. After reading a story where little or no connection is made, I feel empty and unsatisfied with the story. For instance, when Santiago's hand is cramping, all he states is that his hand hurts. The author should have used figurative language to bring the reader in to the story. This would have made the pain seem more real. The Old Man and the Sea provides the reader with some excellent writing, but the emotions are not portrayed with much detail.This story lacks action and excitement to bring the story to life. Fishing is not a very popular event in the current age. And most of the story revolves around Santiago playing the fish. Only a select few that truly enjoy fishing find the story exciting. Furthermore, there is one instance where the author could have brought a pinch of action into the story to liven it up (102-106), however the encounter with the sharks is very brief and short lived. The story needs to have more action spread throughout it's pages. A little bit of excitement, and a tad bit of action, could make this story much more interesting and fun to read.While I was reading this book, I did not feel compelled to turn the pages or continue with the story. I would still recommend reading it because it is shows a young writer, or reader, how to write a realistic piece. I would not recommend this book for a light read, or for entertainment purpose. The Old Man and the Sea is a simplistic story that drives one to think very deeply and comprehend the little things in life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If the reader's looking for an adventurous and suspenseful book, then steer away from Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea! It is very slow and short. It starts off with Santiago saying his 85th day of fishing will bring in the mother of all fish. When he finally catches the Marlin it takes time to bring it in. This book is slow and way to short.Because The Old Man and the Sea is so slow, is causes major boredom. For example, it takes Santiago approximately 50 pages out of the 127 page book to catch the Marlin. I think if it took a shorter time, it would keep the story moving. If there was more action and wasn't so much silly talk, it might keep the reader's eye longer. In addition, Hemingway's style of writing doesn't keep me interested. There are no points where I really feel like I want to keep reading. If there is a difficult scene, it is not clear enough and I get lost. The Old Man and the Sea is slow and takes a long time to show progress.The Old Man and the Sea is shorter than the other books I have read. For example, this particular book is only 127 pages long. I am used to reading 300+ page books. I feel like Hemingway can't even finish the book. In addition, the reader may feel lost with the shortness. Many people can't see how they can finish the book successfully. Readers may feel like they have to read it again to understand it. I know I felt that way. The Old Man and the Sea is so short it can make people feel lost thinking \\"Is there really an ending?\\"The Old Man and the Sea is good but not a well thought out book. It seems to be written in a hurry. It is slow to get to the point and confuses the reader. The book's shortness can leave the reader extremely lost and might even force them to read it again. I would not recommend this book to anyone who cannot understand what they read the first time. It is for more of an experienced reader. I credit anyone who can read this book successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I liked this book because it was a page turner. It kept me HOOKED until the fish was hooked. The struggle between the man and the fish was too drawn out. Pages went on saying the fish dragged him and the fish dragged him for like 30 pages. Otherwise, this book was exellent,and I think everyone who reads it will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a very good book. I like it. It's really adventurous, and the old man is funny in it. I like how he talks. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After finishing this book in a few hours, I had mixed feelings. It was certainly not at all what I had expected from hearing about this book, which was pleasantly suprising. The more I reflected on this book, and as things were pointed out, I found myself truly appreciating Hemingway's genius. This is a very layered novella, which means that anyone can appreciate it. Looking for a mildly exciting high seas adventure? This could be filling, but if thats all you're looking for, find a different book. But, on the next level you have many themes (such as the relationship between man and nature, Christiological symbolism, and sentimental reflection over one's life) in this book that are fascinating, moving, and very well done. Overall, this is a masterfully written, yet mercifully short book (if it had been over 200 pages this book would have been a disaster.) After reading this I definitely plan to read more Hemingway works.[...]."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is the classic tale of a man's struggle against the one obstacle which never seems to take care of itself: the pursuit of happiness. In the novel, we are taken through a three day journey with an old man named Santiago as he tries to capture a fish for the first time in 83 days. The novel shoes excellent symbolism, along with Santiago's struggles with himself, and the fish he has hooked. The Old Man and the Sea is a quick easy read, and although some might not enjoy it, the novel present itself as a classic, and turns out to be close to that."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea got me hooked on reading again after I abandoned books for other less intriguing passtimes. The style with which Hemingway writes is simple; there are no words that are too complicated for even young readers to understand. That the book is so lush with detail and full of emotion despite its simplicity is credit to Hemingway. The Old Man and the Sea captivates not with physical action but with mental and emotional combat.For the first 1/3 of the book the reader is introduced to Santiago, the unlucky fisherman whose only friend is a \\"boy\\" who has jumped ship to fish with a luckier crew of fishermen. As Santiago sets off to find his catch, the reader is fixated, along with Santiago, on finding a fish and changing his luck. The reader sticks by Santiago because he is us: not always perfect, not always lucky, but the better for his dedication to his goals.When Santiago hooks the Marlin the joy is short lived as the reader questions whether this old man has the stamina left for such a battle. When the fish is finally subdued the question is whether Santiago can make it back to land since the fish has towed him so far away. The sharks come and ravage the fish and Santiago returns to port with nothing but bones and a story. Though his catch is destroyed, Santiago is a hero to the other fishermen in the village and he goes on dreaming about the lions on the beach.Santiago's struggle is our struggle: with life, death, faith, loneliness, and the demons within. We identify with Santiago because we struggle with these beasts too. Sometimes they are too big, but the only way to defeat them is to face them. Hemingway created an enduring work of great depth, but it is wrapped up in a nice little package."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Earnest Hemingway was a good book overall. The things I liked about this book was that the whole book was exciting. Basically every part of the story wants to make you continue reading it. The author describes the characters in great detail in this book. In describing the &quot;Old man&quot;, he says, &quot;his eyes were as blue as the sky and his face was as pale as a ghost.Some of the dislikes I had in this book was that for basically the whole story the old man is in the boat. Also, when the old man sees the big fish he keeps trying to catch it for a long time. Another dislike is that the old man almost dies trying to catch the fish. Overall, this book is excellent and I would recommend it to any type of reader."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway was a great book. I liked this book because it had a lot of drama. I also liked it because I was amazed that Ernest could make a good book out of catching a fish.This book was about an old man's desire to catch the biggest fish in the sea. He goes through many obstacles through the story to delay him from possibly catching the fish. His line almost breaks, and he needs to somehow get food for his long journey.I would encourage everybody to read this book. If you like drama and excitement, you will like this book. I would recommend the book for all reader's except for beginners."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In this story, the old mans characters background isnt written so much. Hemingway treated their character like anonymous by not using their proper names. It has effects such as appearing to be a fairy tale, abstracting or symbolizing characters, and focusing on his current thinking and acts. The author especially seemed to want to focus on his character present being.The old man is written as the figure, which barely balance the erosion of the sea with inner aging. The old mans features are aged, patient, being wounded. In his experience endurance had similar meaning of victory. It is showed by the arm wrestling scene (p.69-71).The fish might be a symbol of the sea, nature, luck, absurdity, life, death, shadow of the old man. I feel the last one is rather good, because I dont remember the scene of the old mans shadow reflected on the surface of the sea. Ordinary it is natural there is that kind of scene.Also, the environment is a big component of this story. The environment suggests and allures characters into a new feeling. For example, His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises(13). In this case, the environment is the breeze. It made the old man relax and refresh, so the old man brought himself into new feelings. In addition, the environment in the old mans memory is wholly crystallized. For example, in the arm wrestling scene, There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and at the negros face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees every four sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negros hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands an forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched(69). It has a symmetrical structure. I feel as if it expressed the bars shape itself: from the wall bettors lean through the wrestlers, referees, to the other wall. It is circular and closed structure. It is highly crystallized, and I feel also that is because this scene has already been taken in the old mans memory and cherished for long time by him. The environment in this story has very important role. I think it is as if it was one of the main characters."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have a stranger take than most about this novel. It's the story about a fisherman who basically tries to catch this one really beautiful fish he's been tailing after 80+ days of not catching anything. It is a book you have to read between the lines and understand what is really being said, full of symbolism. However some people say its about Man vs. Man and I say its Man vs. Society... Santiago represents the man and the fish represents the goals of society and whether a man can actual reach them or if it will be destroyed but others out for their own needs. However you interpret it Hemingway won the Pulitzer and Nobel Prize shortly after its publication, though is Nobel was more for his entire body of work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old man who loves to fish.

I felt Hemmingway's personification of the sea was a nice touch that made the book even better. You also couldn't help but like Santiago. His hard work and sacrifice was noble and he kept his humility throughout the book. Well, I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the struggles we all have or will face, and the effort that one put forth to achieve his goal."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book though short was very motivational. It is an excellent tale of how a man can overcome great tasks and survive terrible tragedies, while still having a will that is not defeated but rather presses on.

Santiago displays great courage and honor while he gets dragged out to sea by this gigantic fish. So if your looking for a good book to read and don't have a lot of time I recommend The Old Man and the Sea as an exceptional book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought this book was interesting, but slow. I really like Hemingway's style of writing, using short declaritive sentences. I do have one complaint, this book could have been written in about 20 pages. It takes this man 100 pages to catch the 18 foot marlin. I thought the old man was crazy because he had an unusual habit of talking to himself. As I said though it's very slow I had trouble getting into the book. It also lacked a true climax."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the sea is a great book about a man who just lost the swing of things.

It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and also the Noble Prize in literature in 1954. Santiago an old Cuban fisherman does not have the best of luck and has fished for 84 days straight and has not caught one fish, but on his 85 day his luck seems to all change.Santiago decides to travel out further into the sea then any other fisherman has ever done before to see if he can caught a big fish. He is not out there long till he gets a fish on his line. A marlin is on his line and he has to struggle with it for two days. Till finally the marlin gives up. Now Santiago is lost in sea and does not have enough strength to go back but some how he is able it make it home.However on his way back to land he runs into some troubles cause the marlin is so huge and left a blood trail form when Santiago speared the fish. Sharks are coming up to the boat and are eating part and almost all of the fish that Santiago caught.This was a great book with some long dragged out details that could of being taken out. It shows the struggle between man and nature, and the wiliness of one human and how nothing can drop his sprits. Even when the other fishermen make fun of him for not catching any fish. This is a great book and I do suggest that any high school student should read it. It was is a nice easy read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There's just too much minute fishing detail going on in this story, and not enough of it is interesting. Hemingway writes well here, even though I've never cared for his style, the almost staccato short, declarative sentences. It's certainly more elegant here than in \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" (I've never cared for his dialogue), but we're talking about more than 100 pages about a fishing trip and all the interior monologue that goes with it. There are only two characters in this story, the rest are window dressing, and barely that. The old man (Santiago is his name, it took me a minute to remember it -- that should tell you something) is the central character, the boy (can't even remember his name, Manolo or Manolin, something like that) is the other. But, actually, the fish, a huge 1,800-pound marlin probably has a bigger role than the boy. There's almost no dialogue, it's all the man speaking aloud while he's alone in the boat. Just not that interesting, mainly because it takes so long for the man to really have to fight with the marlin and with his fate. I actually expected to be less interested, having read this in high school a million years ago, but once the old man starts bringing the fish up it gets more interesting.A good place to start if you've never read Hemingway. Quick, easy read. But maybe I need to be an old man to really appreciate the messages here. To me it seemed obvious. I'll have to pick up the Cliff's Notes to see about underlying symbolism, I'm sure there's a lot more to it than just a fish story. Man fights off loneliness and death, becomes a hero despite failure; fish represents death, old age, etc., whatever. But as an entertainment, it's just average. I'm sure \\"Jaws\\" is probably a lot more entertaining, and I know \\"Moby Dick\\" has far more layers of meaning and symbolism. You might consider one of those two instead."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about an old man named Santiago, who has been down on his luck. He has been fishing for 84 days and has not had a catch. On the 85th day, he decides he will fish out farther in sea than any fisherman has ever done before. His has faith that he will make a big catch by going out that far. After being out at sea for some hours he has a bite. For two days he let the marlin (big fish) pull him out farther in to the sea. The marlin finally gives up and Santiago harpoons it in the heart. The blood from the marlin is leaving a mile trail behine the boat. Sharks begin to come and demolish the marlin. Santiago kills off each shark that takes a bite at the marlin but by night fall it is to late to save the marlin. When he returns to his island, he tries to carry the mast out of the water. He falls 5 times the he just leave it on the beach after that. The scene reminds you of when Christ carried the cross and continues to fall because of the weight. Santiago makes it home, and his good friend Manolin is glad to see he's home safe. Manolin tells Santiago he saw the skeleton of the marlin he caught and the size was 18 feet. Santiago would be reconized forever for his catch although he feels he have been defeated."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Well, to start off, I first picked up this book because of the short amount of reading involved and the large print. After the first twenty pages or so I lost interest and the book sat in my room for weeks. After the book was given time to collect dust, my mom later told me that it was my Grandpa's favorite book; he passed away before I was born. So, after hearing that, I had second thoughts about reading this book. I tried to apply myself and really get into the book, but found it to be dull, but it had a good message to it also.The main character, Santiago, has had a streak of bad luck on his fishing skiff. The old man has been fishing with a young boy by the name of Manolin and this boy is later forced away by his parents to a more lucky ship to fish on. The boy is devoted to the old man and comes to visit him early in the morning to help prepare the ship before going off to another boat. The old man goes out for another day of unsuccessful fishing and comes back to see the boy on the docks. The boy brings the old man his coffee, newspaper, and scores of the baseball games from the day. They sit and talk about the old man's baseball hero, Joe DiMaggio, and end the day. The following day, the old man wakes up early and prepares the boat for a big trip out far past the warm waters of the Cuban coast. The spends the day tossing his nets without success in bringing in any fish losing all hope of bringing in a catch worthy of selling in the local marketplace. Right when the old man goes to pull in his nets, he caught the biggest Marlin he has ever seen. He fights with the giant fish for three days and three nights holding the rope with his bare hands giving slack so the fish doesn't pull the boat below water. Finally, the fish admits defeat and the old man is able to bring the fish to the side of the boat. With his hands bloodied and scared, he starts for home. After I finished this book, I have come to see why my Grandpa liked it so much. It depicts the determination that the old man gives in his job even after being unsuccessful for eighty-four days. The will that he has to get up in the morning and keep trying is the point to this story; never give up. When he returns home, he finds the boy there waiting for him, but the old man has nothing to show for his days out at sea but a large skeleton of the Marlin. The boy is impressed by the skeleton of the fish and wants to hear the story of the old man's fight with the fish. They sit and the old man begins to talk about his Marlin and as he continues, more and more people gather to hear the story and walk down to his boat to see the skeleton for themselves. This gives the old man hope after seeing that he can be a great fisherman and can be successful."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Just prior to reading this book, I decided to start reading American 'classics'.

Not much perhaps, but the one thing that struck me about this book was Hemingway's grasp of the natural world. Of course, Hemingway was addicted to the outdoorsman's life - but his narrative and descriptions show such incredible attention. Not only to detail, but more importantly to the details that count. This old man is in tune with nature's brutality and beauty, and his thoughts - which are really Hemingway's - are a guide to life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An old man spent eighty-five days to catch a large marlin fish, while other people spent only a few days to fish tons. Though he sleeps in a single room hut and he couldn&iexcl;t catch a fish, moreover he has been isolated by other people and he has been experiencing tough luck to survival, he will always have the endurance to live his life. Though the condition has been negative, he still thinks positively and can cope with the stress with confidence. He finally caught a marlin that was eighteen feet long on the eighty-fifth day, yet the bloody smell of the dead marlin attracted ferocious sharks, and unfortunately the marlin became a meatless skeleton when the old man finally got home.Hemingway had use the way of switching between reality and the old man&iexcl;s thought to show a person&iexcl;s psychological world. The old man kept on being challenged with difficulties and attacks from the brutal sharks. He suffered to fight against super natural force of nature and non-stop frustration and setbacks, but his confidence has always been there whatsoever and he always harbors hope in mind.The old man is a symbol of man&iexcl;s indomitable spirit. The spacious ocean gives a sense of an endless feeling of loneliness, distance, and hopelessness. Hemingway wrote this short novel in a simple style that a primary student can understand in terms of language, however he communicated his perspective regarding the meaning of life in depth.Though life is tough, just like how the old man fought against the gigantic marlin that was larger than the boat, we should always try our best to face the obstacles and find a way to solve the problems instead of escaping away from the difficulties. This refers to the old man in the book where he did not give up fighting to catch the marlin for the sake of survival. The old man seemed to be defeated when the marlin is eaten all up by the sharks, however he had made a success for he had fought against packs of sharks, and people had learned the spirit of dauntlessness from the old man."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Can you imagine being stuck in the middle of the ocean for 84 days with nothingto eat but raw dolphin and flying fish? Consider fighting a battle with a marlin thatweighed more than 1,500 lbs. and measured up to 18 ft in length. Now you can with thisaward winning novel by Ernest Hemingway.The novel The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a wonderful book.It takes place in a small fisher village on the Gulf Stream. Santiago is a very kind,thoughtful, loving, generous old man; an old man alone in a skiff fighting a greatmarlin with a harpoon, a club and his life. He has some unwelcome company also. I'll trynot to give away what the company was but it sure loved the way the great marlin tasted,and possibly the way Santiago tasted as well.The book is wonderful no doubt but has some poorly written spots. The book iswonderful but what are the chances that a man could survive for 84 days. Other than thatthis novel is full of characteristics like hope when he was near to his home, andendurance when he was stuck in the ocean and all hope was almost lost."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is really good and very adventurous. I liked it because it was exciting and about fishing. I liked it because I go fishing. They used freaky tools. The fish he caught dissapered by the time he got back. He did it all for nothing. The author wrote the book very good."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"i actually fell asleep reading this book &amp; it wasn't even 3 a.m. &amp; I wasn't even tired! The book was so boring. the story seemed to drag on. Nothing kept my interest.It's horrible how high school English teachers force students to read this book--cuz this may very well cause young people to NEVER pick up another book ever again!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I couldn't finish the book coz it was soooooo slow. Sutherland attempts to use exclamations and such but it is just monotonously(?) written. I get the idea behind it and all but can't understand why this is THE book for Hemingway. Ah, but I got through it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Placed the order in Nov. but never got the book. After one month, I wrote to the seller to check it out, then I got a refund without any explanation. I need the book for my kid's school project and the seller messed it up. How can we trust the seller any more?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book sucks. Only a depressed person would like this book. The old man is lonely and keeps trying to fish but doesn't catch any. It's like that old saying, if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything, but this old man failed. Only a depressed person would like it"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After finishing this book, I can't help but feeling that someone pulled a big joke on me. This story is be considered a classic? Why? It's boring, futile and utterly unbelievable, to the point where I am still picking up the bits and pieces of my shattered willing suspense of disbelief.First of all, there's a marlin bigger than the dingy it's pulling around. Yeah, right. A fish that size would need to be cut off quickly before it sounds and drags the fisherman into the deep with it--although the line would likely snap first anyway.At one point we get a detailed description of how the fisherman catches a dolphin on one of the other lines, and prepares to eat it by slicing it open and cleaning out its ... gills? First, am I really to believe he manages to catch a dolphin with a line and bait? Second, dolphins are mammals, and they breathe through lungs, not gills. Hemingway even keeps calling the dolphin a \\"fish\\", a blunder of monstrous proportions.The scene with the dolphin also brings me to my biggest problem with this story: the egregious display of immense cruelty against animals. The old man drags the dolphin into his boat and unceremoniously bashes its skull in. And then of course there's the poor marlin, which gets gruesomely tortured for days before the old man finally skewers it with a harpoon. For crying out loud, old man, just cut it loose already! For most of the story I wished the old man would simply croak, or fall out of the boat to drown, so the marlin would finally be freed from its ordeal.The anticlimactic ending doesn't help either. What does it all amount to? Did the marlin's excruciating suffering and the dolphin's brutal death serve a purpose? Nope. Not even in the slightest. The marlin carcass gets devoured by sharks before the old man can reach his home port. Of course, he could have decided to cut the carcass loose so he and the sharks could share the sea in peace. Instead, the old man decides to kill a few sharks with savage fervor, mostly by poking their eyes out with a knife tied to his oar. Lovely.I am baffled that there are reviewers who actually praise this man's love for life around him, considering how he hacks and slashes his way through the story, leaving blood, guts and cut off body parts all over the place. He's not a caring or brave soul, but a stupid old fart with a sadistic streak, and it's a shame the sharks didn't get to end his worthless existence.The only thing I can say in this story's defense is that it's not as badly written as, for example, \\"A Farewell To Arms\\". The prose is terse, but Hemingway does not go out of his way to bash all the flavor out of it, although I still find it lacking punch and imagination."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"So boring, just awful. Is Hemingway a good writer? Really? This is the only book I've read by Hemingway, it's got numerous tense problems, typos and dull repetitions, dialogue about baseball that goes on and on and on. It reads as though Hemingway got very drunk one night and started writing on a tangent (Which I've since been told is something that he did often). I wouldn't mind if I could find some significance or a point in it, at least a relevant point, but there isn't one, nothing that can't be summed up in a sentence, or perhaps a two or three page story. All I can imagine is that the legacy of the book is one of those stupid 'word of mouth' things, where some reviewers and teachers said it was marvelous, so everybody else agreed due to fear of going against the crowd. It's boring and very dull to read. I've read much longer books in a much shorter period of time, because it's just ... so ... boring. When it was finished I was so angry and disappointed that I nearly threw the book at the wall (Which I might have done if I wasn't on a plane.) It felt like a severe waste of life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"An old man and his friend are fisherman. Without any luck for so long, Santiago catches a fish. He likes to be alone and talks to himself. I wound not recommend this book to anyone. It is very boring. The part I hated the most was when he was out to sea. I am not finished with this book, but my mind probably want change about it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Despite being tightly composed in the stripped-back, High WASP style for which he is renowned, Ernest Hemingway's novella, 'The Old Man and the Sea' (1952) remains an essentially sentimental story of little actual substance.The simple plot conveys how Santiago, an elderly, somewhat isolated Cuban fisherman, goes to sea alone in a small boat, vaguely hoping for a one last spectacular catch to justify his past to himself and glorify his reputation throughout his community. He successfully hooks, struggles with, and harpoons a magnificent eighteen-foot marlin over the course of a long day, but slowly loses its carcass to marauding sharks while returning to shore. During the capture and after, Santiago has doubts about the wisdom of killing the animal, with whom he identifies.Once at sea, with the exception of a hurricane, the faux-sensitive Santiago predictably encounters every problem imaginable, from hunger and exhaustion to cramps in his hands, a fact which lends a pronounced and unintentional note of parody to the text.Nor is 'The Old Man and the Sea' particularly dramatic, stirring, or evocative, and the relationship between Santiago and his admiring young friend, Manolin, frequently borders on the maudlin. While Hemingway probably had every intention of portraying the impoverished Cuban fishing community with dignity, the text is often as patronizing as it is respectful.Some readers may find themselves howling with derisive laughter when Santiago and Manolin discuss baseball via such unintentionally hilarious sentances as \\"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland\\" and that which follows it, \\"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago.\\"Passages such as that in which the fisherman recalls his participation in a twenty-four hour arm wrestling match are unconvincing on every level, and the old man's philosophical attempts to come to terms with life, aging, and mortality simply don't ring as deeply as Hemingway probably believed.Best taken as a topical meditation on human existence, 'The Old Man and the Sea' is a competent but pedestrian work with little to convey beyond the literal and very modest story it tells."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I rebelled against my honors English reading list in high school. As a result, I'm not well versed in the American \\"classic\\" novels. You know, the stuff that practically everyone has read or had an assignment on at some point in their academic careers. In an effort to familiarize myself with America's prize fiction, I obtained a list of all the past Pulitzer Prize winning novels and decided I'd slowly get up to speed on the classics. Well, perhaps I'll have to start with the most recent novels and work my way backward (thanks for the suggestion Amanda!) because this early Pulitzer winner did not interest this reader at all. Although a short piece, I struggled to get to the middle of the book, then just gave up. I found neither the story nor the characters interesting. The writing seems uninspired and remote. After reading half the book I'd like to think that I would have developed some sense of closeness and/or fondness for the story/characters but it didn't happen.If novels are a reflection of the time in which they are written, then this sterilized 1950's publication is well suited for the period. I fail to see the literary merit in this novel. If you can pick this book up for under two dollars (as I did) give it try. It's not worth its retail value."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is terrible. It has no main point, confusing, irritating, and stupid. Don't read this weird book, trust me. Ernest doesn't deseve a nobel prize. Listen to me OK?! What is this book, it is so crazy and I wont even call it a book. This book is nothing!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea, a novel wrote by Ernest Hemingway. It was about an old Cuban Fisherman who catches the biggest fish, he had ever seen, or caught. He struggles with the fish for three long days. Although he caught the fish, He feels he lost the battle. Utilizing the symbols of the lions, DiMaggio, and Santiago, Hemingway depicts the old man as transcendent.The Lions, the first symbol, relates to the youth of Santiago. As the old man sleeps, he dreams about the lions. &quot;He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences . . . he only dreamed of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk(25).&quot; The lions make Santiago feel young and rejuvenated. Without the lions, Santiago probably would not have the strength to wake up in the morning, non the less catch a gigantic marlin. As the fish continued and the chase dragged on, Santiago grows tired. &quot; I wish he'd sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the only thing left(66)?&quot;DiMaggio represents a cause or a purpose for Santiago to continue. Santiago feels that DiMaggio judges him and will be either proud or disappointed. &quot; But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly . . . (68)&quot;. Santiago wonders if he should stay with the fish, or give in and quit. &quot;Do you believe that the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I have stayed with you(68)?&quot;The final symbol characterizes Santiago as a Christ Symbol. During Santiago's Journey he wonders if the villagers are good enough to eat the fish. &quot; How many people will eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him...(75)&quot; The first part of the Christ Symbol, is the sin. The villagers committed a sin by being lazy, and letting Santiago do all of the work. Sacrifice, the second part of a Christ symbol, occurred when Santiago risked his life in going out into the deep water.&quot; \`Ay, he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood(107).&quot; When Santiago screamed, he relaxed that he had created the sacrifice. He knows that what he did was beyond his call of duty. The third and final part of a Christ Symbol is the rebirth. After Santiago returned to the village, he and the boy talked.&quot;'You must get well fast for there is much to learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?' \`Plenty', the old man said(126).&quot; The old man has been reborn therefore making him a Christ Symbol.Using these symbols Hemingway pictured Santiago as Victorious. The effect of the lions and DiMaggio work hand in hand. The lions give Santiago youth and DiMaggio gives him."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is one of the finest books I have ever read. Every year, I revisit my well worn copy and renew an old and dear friendship.This story of the honorable struggle between man and nature are highlighted here in the battle between the &quot;old man&quot; and a magnificent sail fish. As the sturggle continues over many miles and into the night, these two giants of the sea battle with, ulitmately the death of one. But, as this battle between the two ends, another battle begins in an alogory of the man's battle against the ravages of age. A battle, though bravely fought, cannot be won but accepted. But even in the loss of this battle, the ultimate beauty and accomplishment of the life cannot be destroyed. Honor in life and honor in death. By far and away, this is the finest and most thoughtful of all Hemingway's works and will hold the readers attention from the first page to the last.And, on a desert island, the fishing tips could be pretty handy."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is more than a tale about a man and a boy. It's about the opposites, the yin and yang that control and engross everything in the daily world.It's the black and white of typical poetry.On its surface, The Old Man and the Sea is about the relationship between an old man, Santiago, and a young boy, Manolin, both fishermen. The old man used to fish with the boy - the boy may in fact have been doing the majority of the work - but because of a string of bad luck, the boy's parents made him fish with a more fortunate person. The boy's allegiance, however, is still with the old man.Eventually, the story turns into the tale of Santiago's struggle against the greatest of competitors, an unbelievably large fish, one which he eventually learns to admire and love.In the end, it's still the boy's love and respect that help nurse the old man back to normalcy.Whether it's the struggle between life and death, human versus beast, old versus young, or day and night, The Old Man and the Sea is a powerful story that can easily relate to any difficulty in everyday life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Review of The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway was driven to create a book which exhibits the skills developed by him as a writer. Through time his books were published. Some were to the liking of readers while others weren't. After years of struggle came his magnum opus. The Old Man and the Sea was published and read by millions. It was created by Ernest Hemingway using his abundant knowledge and experience to prove himself as an author!Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece comes to life as he understands the literary elements of his story! For example, Hemingway knows the Cuban and fishing culture very well. He occasionally uses Spanish words to emphasize an emotion, such as dentuso to insult a shark. Hemingway also uses correct fishing terms. Instead of referring to the small boat, he calls it the skiff. In addition to his cultural knowledge, Ernest Hemingway gives his characters realistic personalities. Throughout the story, both Santiago and Manolin experience a variety of human emotions. Each character is imperfect, like any real life person. Santiago suffers from bad luck and loneliness, while Manolin is heart struck by the old man's condition. While succeeding in keeping his story realistic, Ernest Hemingway uses his experience in writing to arouse the reader's attention!The Old Man and the Sea is a perfect example of how experienced Ernest Hemingway is in writing. For example, his word choice gives life to his characters. When describing Santiago's appearance he goes in depth in detail by using appropriate similes and metaphors. When describing an oncoming shark, the words he chooses to use delivers a feeling of suspense to the reader. Also, Hemingway shows off his ability to create a smooth flowing story. He can fit a large amount of information and detail into a single sentence without it sounding rambled. Other sentences are only three words but still succeed in getting the point across. Because of his style, Hemingway can intoxicate the reader with a chosen feeling!In The Old Man and the Sea, all of Ernest Hemingway's skills were thrown together to earn himself a Pulitzer Prize. I was inspired not by the story itself but by the quality of his unique style of writing. In my opinion, Hemingway's career as an author was an immense success because of this book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are people who will tell you that the sharks in The Old Man and the Sea represent literary critics who wrote unfavorable reviews about Hemmingway's work or tell you that Santiago is a metaphor for Christ and that there are clues to this throughout the novel.These people need to give their heads a shake.The Old Man and the Sea is a straightforward novel about the pride and honor that a man feels when he faces a worthy opponent with integrity. To me, this isn't a man against nature novel, but rather a novel about how man is one with nature.This is a simple but powerful story about the strength of the human spirit. Hemmingway's strong, sparse prose is effective, making this compelling novel a genuine classic.There's no reason to read between the lines. This novel is exactly what it appears to be - the story of an old man and the sea. It doesn't need to be anything more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A short but powerful story, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" tells the story of an aged fisherman and his interminable endurance and strength in his pursuit of a prized fish. The \\"old man\\", Santiago, shows all the strength and determination of a true hero, although he is defeated in the end by ravenous sharks. Yet, there is glory even in defeat.Santiago is portrayed as a near Christ-like figure, although he is not a devout Christian, himself. Through the pain and bleeding, Santiago endures as the hours turn into days in his pursuit of an enormous marlin. And even though he eventually wins the fight with the marlin, his worthy opponent, he is betrayed in the end by sharks. Yet, he perseveres through it all. Although there is nothing left of his fish but the carcass, one can't help feel triumph for the old man's endurance and sacrifice for pursuit of the marlin.Hemingway portrays death as a natural occurrence that is inevitable. Although Santiago feels regret for having to kill the marlin, he knows that in the natural order the fish must die. He considers himself a worthy opponent to befall the mighty marlin, whom he greatly respects. Yet, he does not fret over his adversary and considers him a brother. Through their death struggle, Santiago and the marlin develop an intimacy of the soul and a special kinship. Santiago wishes no harm to the marlin, yet he knows that he must ultimately take its life.In the end, it is Santiago's pride that brings about his downfall, as well as the marlin's. If it wasn't for his immense pride, he would not have ventured so far from shore, and he would have never caught the marlin. If the marlin did not brazenly swim so far from its comrades, it would not have been caught by Santiago. Immense pride compels Santiago to fight for days, although he knows that the marlin is immense and almost too large for his small skiff. Yet, Santiago will not give up hope and he eventually succeeds in subduing the marlin.Overall, this novel provides a quick, but potent tale about man's endurance and struggle. This may be a relatively simple tale, but Hemingway delivers an entertaining, yet though-provoking story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's Nobel Prize winning novella (1954) seems starkly simple at first glance: an old Cuban fisherman pits his mind and his body against the sea--in the form of a huge marlin first, then battling vicious predators. Returning to shore several days later, he sinks in both physical and emotional exhaustion onto the beach--with only an 18-foot carcass to show for his grueling ordeal. Man catches Fish; Man Loses fish. Such a plot analysis would prove a pathetic tale--but I suspect that the author intended more than a skeletal storyline.In this small book Hemingway has captured the essence of a man who is truly born to catch game fish--a man who recognizes his place in the chain of Life. Hours--even days--alone at sea provide ample time to consider luck, sin and the mysterious maritime fraternity. Santiago's iron will and prodigious strength are tested to the limits of human endurance. Perhaps the ending is neither pathetic nor even tragic, as one theme may be to respect Nature's right to be itself and man's obligation to fit in with the great plan. Can man evolve morally enough to recogize his non-human Brothers--wherever they live? A short, intense read with seeminlgy little action, but plenty of mental dialogue and psychological growth, as a fisherman comes of age in his old age."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemmingway's book The Old Man and the Sea has a very good message and can be read by many people of all ages and reading levels. This book is inspirational and uplifting, however it is boring. Although this book is slow and repetitive, the story has an inspiring and uplifting message.Throughout the book The Old Man and the Sea, there were many parts I liked and some I disliked. A part of the book I disliked was when the sharks came and started eating the marlin Santiago caught. To me this was heartbreaking and somewhat painful to read because I felt bad for Santiago. My favorite part was when Manolin wants to fish and help Santiago, even though his parents don't allow him to. It was neat to see Manolin care for the old man and his fishing as much as he did. The part most inspiring to me was when Manolin believed in Santiago even though he was unlucky. There were many parts of this story that were both uplifting and devastating.People of all ages would like this book but mainly those who like slow, simple, uneventful books. For example, the word choice Hemmingway uses is quite simple. I like this because it makes the book flow better and doesn't make you think too hard about the words. This is also good because little kids can read and understand what is being said. I would recommend this book because it has more than words but also a good message. The message is uplifting and inspirational with all the struggles Santiago overcomes. I think by having a good message more people will read it and be touched. This book is great for people of all ages and reading levels.Hemmingway's book was very touching and inspirational to me. It gave me a sense of hope when reading.

He wanted to please his one and only friend and disdciple Manolin. Hemingway showed that if you ignore the pains of society you would always prevail no matter how bad your life is. Santiago went out to sea to fish and he only came back with only a skeleton. Santagio fished for many day and only came back with the shell of his prize, but knew in his heart that he was an all around winner.

Books that could stop my heart for a second, make sweat on my hand or surround my mind with saddness and pain, books like mysteries or dectective books. This book was really not my style.

It took me about 2 1/2 hours total to read it. Yet his person vs. nature is very interesting. I dont know why this book is so popular still today, but it is a pretty good book.

It sets him apart from the majority of modern writers as a brilliant story teller. It is also commendable for its mood and subtlety.The novel is almost exclusively about the isolated life and thoughts of an old fisherman who unexpectedly finds himself pursuing the largest catch of his life. As the old man hooks his prey and follows it out to sea for several days, it becomes evident that his motive centers more around personal challenge and a kind of silent (dare we say &quot;existential&quot;) heroism than commercial gain or notoriety. His recollections, thoughts and struggle have a peace and momentary savagery that is totally in keeping with the rhythm of the sea.I grew up on the ocean and spent a significant portion of my life living on boats. Speaking from my own experiences I can say that Hemmingway &quot;got it&quot; in this book. He captured the mood, rhythm and isolation of a sailor's thoughts with impeccable realism.Many of Hemingway's novels do not convey mood as successfully as this one. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; never fully convinces the reader of the desperate courage or its characters because the dialog is too canned. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; begins with one of the greatest openings of any Twentieth Century novel and then dissolves into unremarkable turmoil and argument. Even &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; seems a little too self-conscious of the image it attempts to portray. But &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is flawless in its ability to draw us into its mood."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my second favorite Hemingway book. The first being For Whom the Bell Tolls. However, this classic is timeless and crafty in that, its written just right.

One, was I should have parceled a few hours to sit down and read this book in one sitting. The other was that I wanted to savor it and let it go on forever.I am not a huge Hemingway fan. For me, this is by far his best. A story of an elderly fisherman who catches his greatest fish after days of bone-wearying battle only to lose it to sharks.One can see so much in the book - winning/losing, catching dreams/losing dreams, dreams not living up to expectations - if one wants to go the literature class route.Or, one can just savor the language and the human angst so wonderfully portrayed. I felt I was in the boat with the old man and when he was talking to himself, he was talking to me. Plainly, a terrific book.One other note. Years ago I listened to this book on tape. Although not as good as reading it (obviously), it is a good book to listen to on tape."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Okay, I'll start by conceding the obvious: 1. The plot is a down-on-his-luck old fisherman hooks a huge marlin, is pulled out to sea before killing it, and loses it to various shark attacks on his return voyage. 2. There's not a lot of action. 3. Yes, the old man talks to his hand (and a bird, and the fish).Personally, I feel that the most compelling aspect of this wonderful novel is the struggle inherent within the old man's task. It's a labor for something he not only wants but needs. It's an uphill climb against a gradient that only gets steeper. He succeeds, but only to lose the prize in the end.Yet, at the end of it all, he is not defeated. He is ready to sleep, to wake, and to do it all again.Call it the triumph of the human spirit when pitted against all odds.I first read this book in the fourth grade, after one of my parents left it laying around the living room. I finished it within three hours.Ever since, I've made it a point to pick it up at least once a year. I'm now 24 years old. And I still find it to be an absolutely captivating novel.-J."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"SantiagoBy CarolineThe book The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is full of adventure, love between an old man and a little boy, determination and struggle. This book is a classic that tells a story about an old Cuban fisherman Santiago. The old man doesn't believe in luck and he doesn't believe he has any even though he has much experience in fishing all his life.One regular day going about his regular routines of getting up early to go fishing he catches a huge fish. This is not a normal fish. To overcome the fish and catch it all by himself in a little skiff he must have great courage. He has to face many hardships. His hands are cut, he becomes tired and hungry but he stays with the fish for days. But this is only the beginning.I liked this book because it has a lot of meaning even though it is a simple, short book. It is a descriptive and enduring story, between man and animal. I enjoyed how the Old Man had so much courage and determination to fight a fish. But also, after he had defeated the fish the old man had to solve the fish from even more problems that came along.Caroline"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you stopped and thought about what exactly it is that you are complaining about maybe you wouldn't be complaining at all. Is it the fact that one of the most complete, most respected pieces of work from one of greatest men to ever pick up a pen is not full of flashing lights, hard hitting bass beats, and hot steamy kisses? Is it the fact that you were made to think, that someone cares about your intelligence enough to wrench you away from your Rogue Spear or your Instant Messeging just long enough to see that people could sit, enthrawled and trapped by their lust for something fourty years before CD-ROMs? If you hated reading The Old Man and the Sea, if it was a torturous task indeed, go deep sea fishing for giant marlin with nothing but the same heroism, heart, and primitive tools your ancestors have been using since the creation of man. What do you plan to do? Do you think billions of people will still know your work and still celebrate your birth almost 40 years after you die? In case the cliff's notes didn't say so, Hemingway is still one of the most celebrated creatures to ever walk. So I hope your little brain doesn't ache so badly after being forced to think and contemplate something farther away than a monitor you would have to go 12 hours without jumping back online to pretend you are doing something important. And I certainly hope you will never be forced into such a horrid position, one in which you will be forced to appreciate, or at least tolerate not being flakey and shallow for just long enought to read a 130 page book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea lets us see our own lives more clearly, by experiencing the challenge to and empathizing with the fisherman in this classic tale of man versus nature and man versus himself that explores the true nature of human nobility.Even if the story was not so compelling and universal in its appeal and themes, the book is worth the trip just for the writing. Simple words, simple sentences, and metaphors on top of metaphors make for a magnificent experience for you. Seldom has so much complexity been portrayed with such simplicity. What's even more astonishing is how short this novella is. Amazing!Just to let you know how much I love this book, The 2,000 Percent Solution was designed to draw on many of the novel's elements to convey important ideas.Communication is what people have the most trouble with in cooperating with each other. Any time you run into that stall, think about how Hemingway would have solved the problem. Tell a story like this one that makes the point you want to share.Read this book, reread this book, and enjoy ... enjoy ... enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The writing of Ernest Hemingway is said to be an American treasure. While Hemingway may have been revolutionary in his day, I find his writing to be excruciatingly long-winded at times. Even as a fisherman, I found myself saying to Hemingway, \\"Catch the fish already!\\"Santiago is a great fisherman that has run into a string of hard luck. This is realistic for all fisherman. Then came the day that Santiago was fishing alone and hooked an enormous fish. Regretably, he could not bring his great catch into the boat. When he finally did catch the fish, sharks kept coming to pick away at his prize. In the end, Santiago only brings the head and bare bones of his great catch to shore.Like much of Hemingway's work, the story is quite depressing in the end. The main character ends the story as a flawed hero and somewhat of a failure. Not every book needs a happy ending, but some stories can be condensed to have a more rapid pace. The pace of a book can make even the most thin plots seem more appealing."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest HemingwaySantiago, an old man who has made his living fishing from an old skiff far out in the Gulf Stream has run into some bad luck of late. It has been many days since he has caught anything. Even the boy who had been helping him has been ordered by his father to work on another luckier boat. This isn't new to Santiago as he had previously gone 87 days without fish and caught plenty for many days to follow. Maybe his luck is about to turn again...It would appear that for those who found great joy in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" found it in its allegorical aspect and the attempt by Hemingway to demonstrate a struggle of then modern man of biblical proportions. The actual story in and of itself is very simple as it relays the tale of an old man fighting the fish of his life after a long spell of bad luck.The Good: In no way am I trying to discredit Mr. Hemmingway or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" or the merit of this book as a literary gem. Reading for me (for the most part) is about being entertained or connecting to the material in some way. I found this story to be a plodding story about a man trying to reel in a fish. I of course realize that the attempt was to demonstrate the struggle etc but as a story the book just didn't reel me in (pardon the pun).The Bad: At the opposite end of the spectrum I didn't find \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" to be a terrible read either. I just wasn't grabbed and pulled in either direction.Overall: While I feel no more than luke warm about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" I think you should try it for yourself and see what you think. It is considered to be a literary master piece and is only slightly over 100 pages either way so it isn't a story that will demand hours of your time to complete."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a book about a man, a fish, and the sea. Throughout the book, I couldn't help but admire the old man's, a.k.a. Santiago's, endurance, and his love for all life is staggering compared to the average human one can meet on the streets. To me, Santiago embodies the love and beauty that too many people don't display, but Santiago has more than that, he has enough for everyone the little Cuban village he lives in. The saddest part of the book, for me personally, was not that the magnificent fish Santiago caught was destroyed, but was the fact that the little boy was his only friend despite his seemingly endless love for everything. However, one friend is much better than no friends at all, and I think Santiago understands that. All in all, my only problem with this book is its shortness, but when I think about it, there really wouldn't be a good way to extend the story without taking away some of the charm.If you ever get the chance, stop and read this book. 120 or so pages may not look like much, but the lessons taught by Hemmingway in this book are some of the most important many people will ever learn."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book arrived on time and in good condition.

I would recommend it to people of all ages. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Marlin would be a more accurate title, but of course \\"Sea\\" sounds better. In a way you could say it's Moby Dick condensed to just under 80 pages. The word count is 26,610. It's barely a novella. With only two characters, three if you count the marlin, it's more of a stretched out short story.** spoiler alert **A luckless peasant fisherman who's returned from the sea empty handed every day for 84 days sets out, alone this time, to try his luck. He hauls in a monster marlin after a monumental 3-day struggle. But he's gone out too far and sharks allow him to return with little but a skeleton. He risked everything in his heroic battle. He lost the prize but he won something more valuable--his pride and self confidence and the respect and admiration of the boy who loves him.The book is a study in prose style, and I see it as an allegory on the lives of artists. Santiago represents the aging artist, elevated in status to near sainthood through devotion to his work. The marlin symbolizes that work, the awesome result of a lifetime of Herculean effort. The sharks represent the destructive force of critics.Everyone has an opinion, including people who wouldn't know a masterpiece if it bit them in the ass, people who couldn't wield a pen or a paintbrush or a baton if their life depended on it and haven't the slightest concept of the suffering an artist may have gone through to lay bare his most tender feelings for them to blaspheme. And the artist, having invested merely his heart, health, life and soul can only stand by and watch the critics hack away at his creation.The innocent unspoiled and loyal Manolin represents redemption, renewal, unconditional love and Santiago/Hemingway's lost youth, for only the boy within the man, the child inside the artist, has witnessed every moment, thought and movement and can appreciate the full sacrifice and accomplishment. When Santiago repeats: \\"If the boy were here, if the boy were here.\\"Hemingway is lamenting the loss of his own youth and vigor.Here are two paragraphs to illustrate narrative style:Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.\\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,\\" he said. \\"You're holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.\\"The narration is in third-person; so in the first sentence Hemningay announces that we're in the head of the main character, Santiago, sharing his naked thoughts. There are few adjectives and only one adverb, \\"suddenly,\\" used twice. No contractions. No complex sentences. The bare minimum of punctuation. In the dialog, the simple language continues because Santiago is actually talking to himself aloud. And the language is in character for Santiago, an uneducated, simple man. I believe this is one of the secrets to the success of the book. Hemingway's simple and straightforward sentence structure fits perfectly the peasants, Santiago and Manolin.Notice there are no digressions. Prose doesn't get any simpler. It's the complete opposite of Salinger in The Catcher in the Rye, which is a book of digressions. You have to be a mental gymnast to keep with Holden but not Santiago. Nothing gets in the way of the flow of logic. You feel like you are in the head of a peasant because every possible barrier between the reader and the character has been removed. The reader becomes Santiago. You feel his feelings, his pain, his bone-aching fatigue. You think his thoughts, his strategizing, his worrying over weather and tools and food and time.As an aside, the word \\"benevolent\\" leaped off the first page at me. Could this really be a mistake: \\"The brown blotches of thebenevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic seas were on his cheeks\\"? Benevolent means kind. \\"Benign,\\" meaning harmless, is more accurate."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am on a Hemingway kick and this was the only one of his which I simply did not like.

I was instantly drawn into the story of the old man, and his fishing boat, and his struggle against a worthy adversary, a once in a lifetime fish. The crux of the story relies on this lonely, small, withered old man, using the last power and energy he has in his tired frame to catch one last fish. This fish happens to be the biggest fish he has ever seen. The fight goes on day and night until the old man finally lands the fish, but it is so large he cannot put it in the boat and has to drag it behind him. Once he sails his boat back to warmer waters, the sharks set in, and he tries to fend them off with an oar. All the time the catch of his lifetime, the end to his streak of much time without catching any fish, is dragging behind being torn apart by these atangonistic sharks. The outcome, you will have to read for yourself, but this book is a classic, and worth reading. Once you start to read it, you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"read this book again and you may appreciate it more now than when you read it for the first time in grade school...Hemingway tried a daring thing and succeeded in many ways. He wrote a beautiful story with few characters and little dialogue, focusing on the old theme of the struggle of the human spirit. The critics' claims that it contains heavy-handed symbolism (the shark represents the critics that berated H's earlier works) are hogwash...The simple, stilted speech of Santiago and the boy seems to me to be Hemingway's attempt to capture Cuban speach patterns in English. Rather than having them speak English as we would expect, he had them speak as if he were listening to them speak Spanish and translating it to himself word for word into English, thus strengthening their simple, uneducated, working-class characters.This also leads to the major negative element of the book - the characters are not well-rounded. They are all simple working-class Cubans, either friends of Santiago or not. Hemingway loved Cuba, but I'm not sure he respected Cubans as full human beings."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book because I had to, and I thought it was O.K.

Santiago was going on eighty-four days without a good catch, returning to the dock empty handed again and again. Santiago's apprentice, Manolin was forced by his parents to find another boat to shadow because the old man's bad luck would soon rub off onto their son. When the old man gains enough energy to make a big day out to the sea, he finds himself encountered with a big marlin, one that he couldn't possibly carry back to shore on his own. But, as it is said, the elders always know. The turning point in this novel comes when the old man comes encounter with the nibbling on his lines and soon finds he has finally received a bite. In my opinion, I think that Ernest Hemingway is a very talented and experienced writer, his style of writing is simple, but complex all at once. His choices of words are very elaborate, but his story line is very basic and simple. I really am enjoying Hemingway's writings, but I could see why some would not.

This is a randomly composed book about some old guy who goes fishing. Maybe if this book was set over the mans lifetime, and it described the trials and tribulations of his fishing as he ages, then it might be good. But the whole book was about one fishing trip.

Don't waste your time reading this one when there are plenty of books out there with an actual plot."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"this book was really, incredibly horrible. it was horrid, even. it was by far the worst book i've ever had the disgust in reading. i hated this book with a passion. i recommend it to no one. you will be disappointed. after all the awards it has recieved, you'd think it would have been better."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have read in some of the submitted reviews on this page that &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was a boook frought with religious symbols, even if Hemingway himself didn't particularly want his book to have any symbolism. I am writing to give what I think is a more accurate symbolism of the themes in the novel. I have read, for instance, that the old man represented Jesus-Christ, or God himself, and one of the most convincing reviews sees the book as a story in which the old man, i.e. God, lonely and full of years, but his eyes still young, as the text says, sails the sea of creation in search of the deep self of man. When he hooks the fish, it is with the intention of bestowing on him all the love which he had in store for him since the origin of the world. But the author of this review goes a great length to make sure this God is not misunderstood as a cruel, man-killing God! For the old man does indeed kill the fish, beautiful as he is. And there is no allusion in this review to the passage where the old man wonders whether this killing might not be a sin. Now, would God wonder that? In fact, we may see the old man as Man, and the fish as Christ. The first Christians had adopted the cryptic word &quot;Ichtus&quot;, which in Greek means fish, to represent Christ, because of the fact that its letters, in Greek, are the letters which begin each word of the sentence &quot;Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour&quot;. This in itself would not be a sufficient element to interpret the story, but also bear in mind that the old man's name is Santiago, or Saint James, one of the apostles, whose letter in the New Testament urges christians to show their faith not just in words but in deeds. The old man therefore represents man stuggling with God, who injures him, just as Jacob had fought with God's angel at the Yabbok and had hurt him after the fight. And Jacob, like the old man, had been victorious. The fish is Jesus caught by man, accepting to be caught by man, accepting to be killed by man, beautiful though he is. The old man is here in the position of all men who have killed God on the cross (the wood of the boat, on which the fish is tied), and it is natural that he should ask himself the question of transgression: hasn't he &quot;gone too far&quot; in fishing such a fish? The answer is no, for out of the evil of death springs the good of the eucharist: the sharks represent men nourished by the body of Christ, men both evil and good, for the kingdom is given to all. One can also see a sort of vision of the resurrection of the &quot;fish-Christ&quot; in its last jump out of the water, the word &quot;rose&quot; being used by Hemingway in that beautiful passage, in which the fish shows all its glory. (But naturally it is before the death of the real fish here.) One of the commentators rightly saw everyman carrying his cross when the old man goes back home, carrying his mast to the shed, while the skeletton of the fish is still (as it will ever be) tied to the wood as a memorial of his capture by men. The last ironical- but profoundly telling - trait comes when some tourists, seeing the skeletton of the swordfish, confuse it with that of a shark:God has really become one of us."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I do admit that the book was a little slow. I don't recommend it for those with low attention spans. But if you do read on, after about 1/3 of the book, it get really good and you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is not in my mind Hemingway's best work but it is the one story that I feel he felt the most for while writing. Hemingway lived life on his terms and he paid in many ways for that lifestyle. The old fisherman to me represents Hemingway's lifelong struggle to write clearly and simply. The story has a lot of heart in its depiction of an old man's struggle to never give up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorites. Up there with 'Of Mice and Men'. Nothing better than to have such a complete story at a length that you can read in a day.Perhaps my most remembered aspect of this book comes not from its text, but from a quote Hemingway wrote when addressing a critic who praised all the symbolism in the story: &quot;There isn't any symbolism. The sea is the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The sharks are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is sh*t. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know.&quot;Is there symbolism in this book? According to Hemingway, no. But one can't help but see it when one reads it. And perhaps Hemingway had different intentions when he scolded the critic. Either way, this is a great work of art. The reader can decide for themselves if Hemingway indeed did have an hidden agenda."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; although, not one of the finest books I have ever read, it is an exceptional and gritty discription of one mans (a Cuban fisherman) struggle with nature and himself. The battle rages in a hostile environment against a fish (marlin) doing only what it does best, survive. Not suprisingly, and unlucky for the fish, man finally reigns supreme, only to be bested by another fish, a shark which eats the marlin. With only the skelton remaining, the Cuban fisherman returns home to brag of his win. Man has survived for centuries because of his ability to struggle against unsurmountable odds and win.The same is still true today, regardless of the battle ground. The stock market, football, space travel, or taking the kids to the grocery, the goal is the same, to survive.When reading, see it as a reflection of your life and maybe you might have a better perspective on your place in the food chain."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"this book is a wonderfully written book which catches the reader's minds and does not let go until the end. another great book by hemingway which should not be avoided. filled with symbolizism the old man is representing Jesus Christ. Not only is it filled with symbolizism but it also has a good plot. After strugguling with the largest marlin the old man has ever seen he catches it. This is a long and willful battle that occurs between two worthy foes. When the old man seems as though he has lost all his strength he finds a way to continue.this book is a must read and should not be missed"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The incredible symbolism and the power of Hemingways descriptive style gives this booka powerful read. This is the finest piece of literature I have read in a long time.I recomend this book to experienced readers only. The indepth style and symbolismmay confuse some people into believing that it is for children"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is a book that I feel I will remember for all of my life. I had to read it for a class, so I'm not thinking very highly of it now. Santigo is a wonderful old man and Manolin, the boy, is a great character also. This book was one of the most dissapointing books that I have read in my classes, and I feel bad becase of it. I didn't want to tell you how horrid it was, but it is a waste of time, and Hemingway didn't do himself justice with this peice of literature"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In The Old Man and The Sea, Hemingway succeeded in giving a simple depiction of our communal struggle that is called life. We may fail or succeed in tasks that we attempt, but it is the trying that makes the individual who he/she is. The marvel of a book that is less than 200 pages and that has only two real characters (three if you count the fish) is not lost on any generation of reader that picks this book up. The language is simple, as was always Hemingway's style, and yet so artful that the reader feels it is him/her in the novel and not some stranger. Only Hemingway could have gotten all this into the scant number of pages we see here. Anyone that is fooled into believing that the simple words make for a simple work are just too ignorant to see what is really there. This is a must read for any pleasure reader"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is no mistaking the vast religious symbols in &quot; The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. First the book starts out with a fisherman teaching a boy basic values and good behavior.Then Santiago (the &quot;old man&quot;) goes out and upon catching the fish slashes his hands, symbolizing the nails jesus encountered, the cuts on his back that symbolized the whipping Jesus endured, and the horrible headache that hit the heat struck old man during the fight, that symbolized the crown of thorns that Jesus was forced to wear during the crucifiction. Also at the very end of the book, when he gets back home, he ends up carrying the mast of his vessel up to his hut on his shoulder and falling several times to rest. Nothing more than that summerization can give a better paralization of Christ carrying the cross on his horid journey and falling three times. Even though Hemingway would never admit to any of this as religious symbolism, anybody can easily see the many examples of it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's classic novels or novella or story, whatever you want to call it. Many consider it to be his finest work (it played a big part in his winning of the Nobel Prize). I put it with his finest work, like A Farewell to Arms, though his best work is found in The Complete Short Stories, The Sun Also Rises, and The Garden of Eden.The novella carries a tone of depression and tiredness and a feeling of religiousity. Many have pointed out the Christ-image of the story, and make no mistake, it is there. The story divides itself into three parts of the narrative. Before he goes to sea, the battle with the fish (which is the bulk of the narrative) and the fight with the sharks--where much of the Christ symbolism kicks in. The novella is written in the type of prose we have come to associate with Hemingway: that of the tough, terse declarative prose. This is truly a classic.What I wish most about this novella is that it was included in The Complete Short Stories, where it truly belongs. With the greats. To truly appreciate it read it as the ending of The Complete Short Stories."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a short parable about the food chain. I read an amazonian editorial review which baldly stated that the old man is \\"triumphant as the other fishermen marvel at the size of the skeleton.\\" Perhaps this reviewer read a different book ... there is absolutely no \\"triumph\\" or any other strain of hubris in the old man's character. Only a strong resolve and bucketloads of humility. The old man is not even around when the fishermen and tourists are \\"marvelling\\" - he's in his shack, in bed, recuperating. Maybe this reviewer never even read the book. Just up to the bit where it starts to get boring, after the old man actually hooks the fish, and then figured on a good Hollywood ending. Fair enough. Actually reading a book is a hindrance to writing a good review. Check out my only other amazonian review, on \\"Recollections of a Bleeding Heart\\" and see what I mean. Never even read it. Good review though, don't you think? Sure, no one has yet voted that they found my review helpful. I would be very hurt if anyone did. Bleeding utilitarians. If you want to read something helpful, read the instruction manual for your dvd player or something. Don't waste time reading reviews by mark coddington.But I did actually read Hemingway's novella. Sort of felt obliged. You know, when books start to reproach you each time you glance at them? I've got a 614 page biography of Arthur Miller on the bookshelf in front of me, with Arthur's face on the spine looking at me through those crazy black minimalist glasses (they never really caught on, did they?) and he knows that I'm never going get around to reading \\"Timebends\\" in this lifetime, and he's staring at me with reproach.Back to the parable. This old guy hasn't caught a fish for yonks. Everyone thinks he's bad luck, except the boy. One day he goes out deep, hooks himself one big effoff fish. Too big to fit in the boat, he straps it alongside and by the time he brings it in, sharks have picked it clean.I mean, there you have it. Its not about spoils going to the victor. Its not about overcoming great challenges against all odds, then rubbing your detractors' noses in it. Just because The Old Man and the Sea is written by an American, doesn't mean it's about winning.The book's 127 pages long. After the old man hooks the fish, he takes 83 pages to bring the creature in. 83 pages of Hemingway's unrelenting and unembellished prose. Think of the most uncomfortable chair you've ever sat on. Now pick a number between one and ten. Imagine sitting on that chair for that many hours. It will start to give you some idea of what reading this book is like, particularly if you are an empathetic type like me. The cuts on the old man's hands from the line - ow! Now, multiply this number of hours by nine. If you get a two-digit number, add those numbers together, otherwise stick with what you got. Now subtract five. Just do it! (Oops, I think I've broken copyright laws. Ignore that last sentence). Next, count along that number of letters in the alphabet and think of a country starting with the letter you came to. Take the second letter of that country's name and think of the first animal that comes into your head. Got it? Now when you've finished reading this review, I'll tell you what animal that was. And I'll bet you right now that you didn't think of a fish or an old man.) Okay, do we have a deal? But I digress. The idea of the animal kingdom provides one key to understanding this tale. Firstly, the old man constantly dreams of lions on the beach in Africa. Why? What do lions represent? I do not profess to be proficient in, or interested in, psychoanalytic approaches to literature. But the lions must represent something important to the old man, or why would Hemingway waste his valuable - sorry, useful - time by writing about it? Secondly, the old man (his name is Santiago, by the way, but is seldom referred to as anything other than \\"he\\" or \\"the old man\\", so I'll follow Ernest's lead) continually refers to the fish he has hooked as his \\"brother\\". During the old man's three day fishing marathon, he eats raw fish, as he has no other sustenance, which further emphasizes this \\"brotherhood\\". Hemingway is asking, where does man stand in relation to the animal? Then he goes a long way toward answering it: \\"I am only better than him though trickery and he meant me no harm.\\" And: \\"But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\\"The old man is alone, locked in a battle with both himself and the fish. Yet he identifies with the fish; he feels sorry for it: \\"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish.\\" The fish's name is Alberto, but is only ever referred to as \\"fish\\" by Hemingway. In a struggle to come to terms with his own life and imminent death, the old man talks aloud to himself, asking questions both simple and profound. Death is a central motif in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", but not one I'm much interested in.Perhaps looking for motifs, and pondering their significance, is to read too much into a book. Maybe this one is just a story about an old man who catches a big fish. Here's an interesting question. Do Jehovah's Witnesses read all books in their literal sense, or only the Bible? Hmm. Furthermore, are there any good customer reviews of the Bible on Amazon? I'm off to have a look. Oh - before I go, I must keep my part of the deal. Was it an elephant?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This powerful book defined the essence of Hemmingway's style, and captures his prose at it's best.Life is a struggle. Our measure in life is how we face up to this struggle, despite our imperfections. In the end, it is our strength and courage in adversity that matters more than the outcome. This is what I got out of the Old Man and the Sea.On the surface it is about the story of the fish that almost got away, and the struggle to bring it to shore. By another author, and with weaker prose, the book would have been a non-event. Brought to life by Hemingway, the book is a compact masterpiece, bringing you into the boat and struggle with the Old Man himself.It is tough to judge what makes a book Nobelworthy. I certainly find most in that genre unapproachable. This book did speak to me, and I encourage you to let it speak to you. In terms of impact, it stylistically encouraged those books beyond it to be tighter in style and impact. The allegorical style was most recently copied in the Life of Pi."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, a story by Ernest Hemingway, its value as a novel is debatable. Some loathe the novel for its dryness and others praise the novel for its simplistic beauty. I believe that Hemingway's novel is a work of genius. Its carefully crafted plot and tragic ending leave the reader feeling as if they had actually witnessed the ordeal, and wishing that in some way they could help the main character, Santiago, who had been wronged by fate.The Old Man and the Sea keeps a very interesting plot while incorporating the theme of blue into the details and mood. The story includes characters with simplistic motives, but realistic emotions as they cope with the lasting pain of one single character. This character is Santiago, an elderly Cuban fisherman. He's luckless, meaning his attempts to catch fish are futile, but he still carries hope. His only friend, a young boy named Manolin, soaks in his pain, making the story look bluer then Santiago's old, deep blue eyes. The melancholy story is all about \\"man verses fate\\", as Santiago continues to fail because of his lack of good fortune. Reading this, one has to relate to Santiago, because everyone has their anticlimactic moments. Normally people like to read about victories and glory but this story seems to have a gravitational effect on readers.Hemingway's unique writing style is part of this interesting gravitational effect. While in the beginning one may have a dislike of Hemingway's writing because of its word repetition and *simplicity, but after awhile one takes a strange liking to it. It's because of the emotional bond between the audience and Santiago that hooks the reader to the story. One becomes obsessed with the image of Santiago succeeding, which mockingly dances ahead. It's not the writing that attracts readers; it's the plot that fits perfectly with the style.I recommend this book to all people who enjoy a classic, because The Old Man and the Sea is definitely a fantastic and original book. Though everything about the story seems simplistic at first glance, it is actually the simplicity that makes it a story that I encourage all readers to finish. The well crafted novel is a work of genius that well deserved its Pulitzer Prize if not much more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a short little book primarily about optimism and never giving up. In a nutshell, an Old Man who hasn't caught a fish for many moons suddenly has snared himself a fine piece of fish that isn't going to be brought in easily. Lots of insomnia, bloody and cramping hands, letting line in and out, and beating off sharks who want to claim the fish as their own.I did find the language, lack of plot, aimlessness, and general lack of substance to be a disappointment (I guess we're never to admit that about a &quot;classic&quot;, but I'm honest), hence the 3 stars; however, a few things DID impress me, such as how the old man never gave up no matter how bad the outlook, how he maintained a sense of survival - a sort of one-foot-in-front-of-the-next attitude, and how he always corrected his negative self-talk. Even in the end of the book, despite disappointment, the man had a peaceful existence. He wasn't dismayed. He simply went to sleep. These qualities in and of themselves make the book a definite worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is actually the first Hemingway book that I have ever read. I enjoyed reading about the killer sharks, and the main character, who seemed to be more unlucky than I am. Though the book does not give names, until the end, it does not bother me because during this book there is no need for names. It is a simple old fisherman verses a 1 and 1/2 ton marlin who drags him out to sea.The story begins with the Old man and the &quot;boy&quot;, whom helps hiim fish. The old man has been very unlucky, in fishing, lately and decides that since he has gone for 84 days without catching a simgle fish he will go out and try one last time, which ends up to be the best time of his life. After he cannot see the lights of his city anymore he gets this huge grab, but what he doesn't realize is that the grab is almost 2 tons. I admit that this story is boring at times mainly because he is alone and he talks to himself, maybe that is why it is so short. It really does pick up after he finally kills that marlin. That is where sharks come and feed of the fish. Though I would like to say more, it would ruin the end of the book.I think that if you read a lot of books where the main character goes nuts by being alone with himsel, and not being prepared, this is the book for you. Though if you get woozy from reading about half eaten fish or eating fish raw, you should probably stay away. I know I enjoyed this book, and I didn't even know what the tools he used to kill the fish were called. But don't take my word for it read it yourself and see how a classic, noble peice winning book effecs you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Anyone who denies that Hemingway was a genius is probably either 1) a fool or 2) a dilettante intellectual trying to impress you.This story is about the incredible impact work has on human beings.

This edition of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; does not do that, however. I would, though, suggest to people who are considering the idea of experiencing this work for the first time that you read the book instead. Reading the book tends to wring out more emotion, which only makes this classic better. If you want to listen to it, however, and you want to choose the right version, for goodness sake, choose an unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is Ernest Hemingway at his simplest, and most powerful, as a story teller. The sentences are short. The meaning is clear. The cadence of the prose advances your sense of what is happening.An old man goes out fishing alone from Cuba and hooks the fish of a lifetime. This fish could make a lifetime of disappointments and setbacks all worth while.After an incredible and exhausting fight, the fish is his. Now all he has to do is get it back to shore. Then the struggle really begins!The Old Man and the Sea lets us see our own lives more clearly, by experiencing the challenge to and empathizing with the fisherman in this classic tale of man versus nature and man versus himself that explores the true nature of human nobility. What does life mean? What is striving for? From what do we gain our dignity?Anyone who thinks that he who dies with the most toys wins will can learn a great deal from this story.Even if the story was not so compelling and universal in its appeal and themes, the book is worth the trip just for the writing. Simple words combine into simple sentences that build into metaphors that pile on top of metaphors in order to make for a magnificent vista and experience for you. Seldom has so much complexity been portrayed with such simplicity. What's even more astonishing is how short this novella is. Amazing!Just to let you know how much I love this book, I often use the techniques and concepts in The Old Man and the Sea in my own writing. Miscommunication is what people have the most trouble with in cooperating with each other. Any time you run into that stall, think about how Hemingway would have solved the problem. Tell a story like this one that makes the point you want to share. Then tell the story again and again. Thirty times or more, and everyone will begin to get it. When your listeners start telling the story thirty times to others, you have made an important first step.Read this book, reread this book, learn from it each time, and enjoy ... enjoy ... enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a very short story and I think it is worth reading for the time it takes.

A classical novella, The Old Man and the Sea, displays emotional sentiment virtually throughout the story. This is a heroic story that is perfectly written and that is filled with perseverance, pride and friendship. This novella mostly takes action at the sea.Santiago, the old Cuban man, goes for eighty-four days without catching a fish. His buddy, Manolin, strongly believes in the old man that he can catch a fish. Manolin has been deprived of going with the old man who has worst luck. The two of them like to talk about baseball in their conversation. Santiago's favorite baseball player is the great DiMaggio.On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago goes sailing far beyond the island's shallow coastal waters and ventures into the Gulf Stream. Like always, whenever he throws the line that has the bait fixed to it, a fish would eat whatever is attached to that line and rapidly move away. The following is a battle which tests the old man's skill to suffer to the limit. It was as if perseverance was in the man's blood. At noon, this particular marlin catches on the line and actually moves the skiff along. The strange man points out that the fish was two feet longer than the skiff. During some time, when the line was steady hard, Santiago's left hand got cramped. He disgustingly looks at his hand and asks it how it is doing after eating fish that he caught earlier.While weariness hit him, he remembers the time when he and an African American went one day and one night arm wrestling. By remembering this event, he gave himself confidence. At daylight, the old man defeated the African American and became known as \\"The Champion.\\" This memory effectively shows that the old man has sustained before and can still endure the encounter with the enormous fish.During the whole story, the old man wishes that the boy was with him to see this magnificent fish. He has only three things that are his brothers, his two hands and the fish. He greatly admires this marlin but at the end, he pities the great fish that he had hooked. On the third day of the struggle, the fish circles around the boat which means exhaustion. This was the time for the old man to strike into the fish.Hemingway effectively shows his objective by describing an old man against society (the fish and the sea). Frankly, this simple book is mostly about fishing, friendship, and endurance. I strongly encourage anyone who enjoys to fish to read this novella. Its suspenseful climax really lures the reader to finish the book. I liked this book because of the structure on how it is written and its simplistic wording.If you would like to read more book reviews, please visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When I first read The Old man and the Sea, I was probably too young to realize its significance. I didn't enjoy it. The second time however, it was much better. Hemingway is an excellent writer, and Santiago is an extremely well-developed character. In short, this book is a piece of literature that shines like a beacon among lesser works. I highly reccomend reading it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One aspect unnoticed in the modern, industrial world, is that many jobs that are now done by man and machine used to be done by man himself, with maybe the aid of some hand-made tools. As such, this book is a good portrayal of this type of economic transition. Santiago, a very old fisherman, goes a very long time without catching any fish. His competitors pass him by with improved technology and machines. One day, Santiago heads out to sea with the promise that he will not return until he catches a fish. He finally does catch one, but the catch is eaten by sharks before it is pulled on board. This book is short and easy to read, and portrays very well the plight of those who make their life from the land, or sea, and what happens to their livelihoods when technology and progress pass them by, and nature refuses her help."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway had the skills of an anthropologist. Theodor Adorno wrote of the characteristics of late art. This work is a good example of late art.After forty days and no fish, the old man, Santiago, lost the services of his boy companion. Nevertheless, the boy, Manolin, brought him food for his supper, rice, black beans, fried banana.The old man had three fishing lines. He straightened them. Then he felt the pull. Imagine, fishless for days, the old man was being pulled by a large fish. During the night two porpoises kept the old man company. Santiago told the fish he would stay with him until he was dead.A cramp is humiliating when one is alone. The hands of the old man were cramping from the work of holding onto the fish. The old man had to make his plans in accordance with the fish's plans. Santiago noted the fish was two feet longer than the skiff. Later he estimated the fish weighed one thousand five hundred pounds.The old man and the boy had been in the habit of talking about baseball. Out on the water alone Santiago thought about the baseball leagues. He thought the great fish was his friend. He felt sorry for the fish because he had had nothing to eat for two days and two nights. The old man felt his lack of sleep was dangerous. He hooked a dolphin. It was not good to eat raw. The old man killed the fish with his harpoon line. Next he had the slave work of cutting up the fish and hauling the fish to do.A Mako shark swam on the same course as the great fish and the skiff. The old man killed the shark. The shark, dead, sank with the harpoon and the forty pounds of fish it had taken. Other sharks attacked the fish until the fish was a skeleton when Santiago arrived at the harbor. The old man, Santiago, was joined by the boy, Manolin, who told him he would not leave him again, whatever his family commanded. Manolin said the two would fish together."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought that it was a very good book. The only reason I did not like the book was because the boys parents did not let the boy go. In the first couple of pages I did not get it but after a while it got clear to me. I thought it was cool when Santiago killed like ten sharks. I think more kids should read this book!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The story is about and old man named Santiago, who has been at sea fishing, and has terrible luck catching fish. Santiago has such bad luck that he hasn't even caught a fish in over 80 days. There was a boy he had helping him for a while, but due to the conditions, the old man must go out on his own. So for 80 days, the old man has not caught a fish, until finally he spots a huge Marlin. He uses a make-shift fishing line to hook the Marlin. He struggles with it and it pulls him out to sea. The problem is that his fish is swimming right into a school of sharks that could rip the marlin off of the hook and consume it for themselves, destroying the old man's hopes and dreams. Santiago, has to struggle with starvation, and dehydration as he fights for his life going after this fish. Will Santiago ever reel in his fish?, or will the sharks ruin his chances of making his life a little easier? You will have to read the book to find out. I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This story is an adventure story that happens to end tragically, but it is more than that. It is also written in a deceivingly simple style, but the novel itself is as near perfection as any. On a deeper level the book is a fable of the unconquerable spirit of man, and it is also a religious parable that utilizes Christian symbols and metaphors. The book has only two characters - Santiago, a Cuban fisherman and Manolin, a young Cuban boy devoted to Santiago. Hemingway's realism is very strong in this book, and his pragmatic view of life comes through loud and clear. It's not a very long book, but it is a masterpiece. I also saw Spencer Tracy in the film adaptation of this book, and I thought that movie captured the essence of Hemingway's genius."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I remember reading other Hemingway works when I was in school, and I also remember feeling truly satisfied after I read the last pages of those books. I felt as if I had just learned something of value, and believe it or not, those lessons have stayed with me through the years. Somehow, I missed out on reading The Old Man And The Sea, or else I read it and don't remember doing so (which could very well be), so I recently bought it and I read it in about three sittings. Again, Hemingway didn't disappoint me. Santiago, the main character, reminded me of a few friends and family members, who are on the downside of...let's say fifty ;-), and who are not ready to throw in the towel and fade away into oblivion just yet, despite the unbeatable odds against them. I actually felt as if I was sitting out there in the boat with poor old Santiago, or better yet, I felt like I was the man himself, which is a little tricky since I'm a woman. Hemingway has a truly unique style of writing, which defies a lot of the \\"rules\\", but he knows how to tell a tale and he knows how to get into the brains and minds of his characters. If you've never read Hemingway, perhaps it's time. God rest his blessed soul.Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Read this book in high school and was thoroughly bored by it, but reading it again as an adult I have a better appreciation for it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm not the biggest Hemingway fan in the world, but I like this book. I first read it in high school, just like millions of kids still do every year. The Old Man and the Sea is an American classic, and for some pretty good reasons. It signified the author's return to greatness, it shows an old man who is full of both resolve and wry humor, and lastly it is a moving story told in very simple, straightforward language.I can appreciate what this novella is about. You take a guy down on his luck and send him on a journey of unearthly demands. How does he react? Santiago could have given up and quit any time he wanted - before or after his catch - so it is interesting to see what drives a man onward. Hemingway thought that Santiago's qualities were what was important in a man; he makes a good case for them here. Compassion, perserverance and a sense of order to life all come into play. Santiago respects the fish, and that is what makes this story most memorable.I don't know whether this was symbolic of Hemingway's own struggle with the literary critics of his time, nor do I think that this is his best . But I think the Old Man and the Sea should be read...in all ages. Perhaps it is fitting that a book like this is told in such simple language. Like the ocean itself, great things lurk just below the surface for those who wish to look."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature, Hemingway is also renowned for books such as \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (1929) and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1940). But his classic 1952 Pulitzer Prize winning novella \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of his most accessible works. It recounts the battle of an old Cuban fisherman against the sea, during a fishing expedition filled with triumph and tragedy. After 84 fruitless days of fishing, Santiago finally hooks a huge 18 foot marlin which he battles for three days of personal suffering, only to lose his prize catch to sharks on his way to shore.Although the plot can be summed up in just one sentence, Hemingway excels in creating a rich atmosphere in describing the old man's battle against nature and against himself. \\"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?\\" By primarily referring to the protagonist as \\"the old man\\" instead of using his personal name Santiago, Hemingway emphasizes the human struggle, and touches on important themes about triumph in tragedy and human courage in struggle (although perhaps Hemingway gives too much credence to human pride as a motivation). In the beginning, the old man's sail is characterized as \\"the flag of permanent defeat.\\" But despite losing his catch, there is a note of triumph at the end: \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" The young boy Manolin, the baseballer DiMaggio, and the lions of Santiago's youth all represent images of youth and strength that sustain the old man on his road of suffering toward this triumph.The writing style is terse, easy-to-read, yet the resulting picture is tremendously powerful and beautiful in its simplicity. While a child can read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", only adults will truly appreciate the symbolism of the sea in representing human trials, and Santiago's struggle in overcoming them. Some see Christ-like symbolism in Santiago's bleeding hands, and in the final journey of the defeated but triumphant old man carrying his mast up the hill, representing a spiritual triumph of a new life and resurrected respect for the old man attained through physical suffering and defeat. Certainly Santiago is explicitly identified with Christ when he makes \\"just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the woods.\\" Others have interpreted the novella autobiographically after the failure of Hemingway's 1950 novel \\"Across the River and Into the Trees,\\" with the sharks representing Hemingway's critics.In short, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a relatively quick and easy read, yet leaves you with a sense of depth that most modern fiction lacks. As a companion that can help increase appreciation for the book, check out the 1958 movie version starring Spencer Tracy, which sticks closely to the book and features lengthy quotations as part of the narrative. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea does not tell simplistic tales of obvious adventure, it paints beautiful worlds with words that tell of an old man who battles internally against himself and externally against the harsh violence of nature-- and ultimately wins in the end. If you do not have the patience and insight to see into the depth of meaning, maybe this is not a 'classic' to you...but if you are one who has the taste and appreciation for great literature, you will love this short and powerful masterpiece that takes place on a higher intellectual level."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Surprised that this book of rare greatness is averaging only 4 out of 5 stars among the reviewers. Just goes to show you that no judging system is perfect when it comes to art, including a 'democratic' one such as at amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What is really amazing about this book I first read in elementary school, is that after all this time so few people have realized the metaphor.Hemingway and Faulkner were bitter rivals, and Hemingway wrote this piece after Faulkner recieved the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. Ironically it won him the Pulitzer in 1950, which Faulkner had yet to win, and surely helped in his 1954 Nobel.Now go back and read it again, and see what the story is really about, and don't forget to think who those sharks represent, just by writing a review, you may be one of them."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am 17 and have read too many books. This remains after all the best piece I've ever read.It's true when people say the read is not entertaining or surprising. It's not meant to be either. It was written to mean something deep about life and the struggle that it is.Hemingway more than any other author understands passion and love, that life was what Helen Keller said, &quot;A great adventure or nothing at all.&quot; and that great experiences lead inevitably to great pain and glory. That we almost never succeed the way we want but can still be glad with our efforts is a harder lesson to learn but is also demonstrated brilliantly in this work.If you look for a fun read, or enjoy easily digested fiction, this is NOT a book you should buy.For those of you who want something greater and deeper in thought than what our spiritually tranquilizing entertainment can provide, read this."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemmingway uses a short and refined style to tell a story of an old man and hisperilous journey through the sea. His writing is superb, and clean. The story flows well and is without flaws. The wording and structure of the story is as if it flowed freely from his mind to the paper without error.Hemmingway creates a good feel for the story by being very descriptive. Although, the paragraphs are short and simple, the descriptiveness is superb. Hemmingway uses simple but concise word choice. Because of the simple wording it makes for easy reading. In the same way, he uses words such as, treachery. Because of this, it eliminates useless jargon. And you are able to grasp the meaning of the sentence or paragraph easily because of the descriptive words.Because of all the descriptive writing you are able to fully grasp the story aswell. For instance, \\"the line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water.\\" And \\"Fish... big fish.\\" Because of the descriptiveness you are able to fully understand what Hemmingway is trying to relate, through simple, refined writing. \\"They were strong shoulders, still powerful although very old.\\" Again, this is a good example of Hemmingway's short concise style in this book. As he is describing a part of Santiago's figure, easily, smoothly and in a short amount of words.As you can see, Hemmingway has a writing style unlike any other, and unparalleled by any other. He is undoubtedly one of the best writers in American history. Although he is no longer alive, he still lives on through his classic writing, which will also go on for ages to come. This book is definitely a classic, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway is not a famous author for nothing. I just enjoyed the prose, and the bond between the Young man and the Old man. But I found the old man's defeat a bit too unfair and sad."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I ordered this book for my American Literature class. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. It was exactly what I needed. Great price too!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Quite frankly Hemingway is one of my favorite American 20th century authors. His clarity of writing style had a profound influence on the teaching of American writing throughout the century and cured Americans of the verbosity and opaqueness of British English. Unfortunately, Hemingway was a man in the fullest sense of the meaning in his age and he has suffered for this with the rise of multiculturalism in the teaching curriculum. The trend is not wrong but it is tragic that students will often not be exposed to such a great writer.Hemingway is also damned for his lack of experimentation both in his narrative style and his lack of sexuality. Obviously, the contention that he was not experimental is false because he crafted the American writing style and wrote many great American novels, precious gems populated by male characters who operated with \\"grace under fire\\". As to his lack of sexual content Hemingway wanted to be successful and followed the advice of Gertrude Stein and kept the smut out of his work with various mechanisms and narrative arrangement. However, his work is filled with romance and passion appropriate to American mainstream sensibilities of the early 20th century. But Hemingway also wrote the great Cubic novel with Henry Miller: \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"/\\"Tropic of Cancer\\". The two works intersect in the middle when the two primary characters meet in a cafe - Miller broke and starving, Hemingway paying his tab. Hemingway's character is sexless, Miller's debauched in the demimonde of interwar Paris. Hemingway would be a famous and successful writer in America while Miller's work would be banned in the States until the 60s by which time Hemingway was dead by his own hand. Together the Cubic novel captures the reality of Paris for Americans between the two world wars and has fired an ongoing love of the city and French culture among some Americans to this day.But it was \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" that solidified Hemingway's career with Pulitzer and Nobel prizes in literature. This is due to the fact that like Melville before him this \\"fishing story\\" is simply so much more. It is a story of Man's struggle with life and is no better illustrated than by the following quote from the book:\\"\`Ay,&#8242; he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\\"In this short passage Hemingway captures the agony of the fisherman, the dangers of the workingman, and the Passion of Christ. It is pure brilliance and one of the great moments in American literature.Read it and, if possible, read it in one setting. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's simple but powerful language and striaight forward sentance structure are alone enough to justify this story's place in the best segment of American literature.However, Hemingway more than manages to put you in the old fisherman's mind and later, in his exhausted body in this story of an elderly, unlucky, fisherman who finally hooks the fish of his lifetime, only to lose it after a valiant struggle with sharks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Great story from the greatest of storytellers I highly recommended reading for all.
