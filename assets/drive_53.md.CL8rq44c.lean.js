Developed in the 1960s by dance therapy pioneer Mary Whitehouse, it is today both an approach to dance therapy as well as a form of active imagination in analysis. In her delightful book Joan Chodorow provides an introduction to the origins, theory and practice of dance/movement as active imagination. Beginning with her own story the author shows how dance/ movement is of value to psychotherapy. An historical overview of Jung's basic concepts is given as well as the most recent depth psychological synthesis of affect theory based on the work of Sylvan Tomkins, Louis Stewart, and others. Finally in discussing the use of dance/movement as active imagination in practice, the movement themes that emerge and the non-verbal expressive aspects of the therapaeutic relationship are described.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ch2M4iRV6NsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The International Who's Who of Chefs 2004-2005","description":"3000 biographies of the best and leading chefs of the world, including thousands of signature recipes of the leading chefs of the world.

Focused on the period from the start of sound cinema to the final end of Fascism in 1945, this book examines the development of an Italian star system and evaluates its place in film production and distribution. The performances and careers of several major stars, including Isa Miranda, Vittorio De Sica, Amedeo Nazzari, and Alida Valli, are closely analyzed in terms of their relationships to the political sphere and broader commercial culture, with consideration of their fates in the aftermath of Fascism. A final chapter explores the place of the stars in popular memory and representations of the Fascist film world in postwar cinema.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6wFPAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DSL: ADSL, RADSL, SDSL, HDSL, and VDSL","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Garden Cuisine: Heal Yourself Through Low Fat Meatless Eating","description":"The inventor of the Gardenburger? veggie patty, Paul Wenner knows about delicious, low-fat food, and in GardenCuisine he offers more than 150 sensational recipes for everything from tempting appetizers to sumptuous desserts, all of them as satisfying and high in flavor as they are low in fat and nutritionally sound.

However, John Cook has done it in a most compelling, sensititve manner. Here, for the first time, is one of the most incredible stories produced by Vietnam. This is the story of the men who risked everything to fly their evacuation helicopters into the teeth of the most intense fighting the war produced to achieve a single goal evacuate the wounded. And that is what they did, day after day, night after night, under every condition imaginable. They flew through enemy fire, cloud banks, monsoons, fog, and darkness to reach the wounded. When it was all over, the men of Dustoff had performed an unbelievable feat hundreds of thousands of wounded had been snatched from the battlefield. After exhaustive research and countless interviews, John Cook has skillfully woven all the threads of this epic story into a seamless fabric of dedication, sacrifice and courage. While it reads with the smoothness and consistency of a first-rate novel, there is no fiction here. The Dustoff crews are real, these events happened and Cook provides the absolutely critical human dimension that makes this story come alive. John Cook is also the author of The Advisor: The Phoenix Program in Vietnam (available from Schiffer Publishing Ltd.).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WlAOAAAACAAJ&dq=Rescue+Under+Fire:+The+Story+of+DUST+OFF+in+Vietnam+(Schiffer+Military/Aviation+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deep Things of God","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Years of Pottery","description":"Pottery making is one of the oldest and most widespread of human activities, with a history that can be traced back to the Stone Age. Stylistic and technical changes over time reveal a great deal about the societies in which the pottery was made, so that clay vessels serve as essential cultural and dating indicators, as well as objects of individual skill and creativity. This lavishly illustrated and comprehensive account begins with the earliest civilizations of the Near East and Middle East and follows the production of pottery chronologically around the globe, from the Mediterranean and the Orient to the Islamic world and ancient America, from neolithic Britain to the factories of Wedgwood and de Morgan, from contemporary Africa and India to Scandinavia and Australasia. The final chapters analyze the development of ceramics as a medium of personal expression by artists and studio potters during the twentieth century. This is the fourth edition of a work that has been deemed a classic since its first publication in 1972 and, for this new edition, has been completely revised, expanded, and redesigned, with new illustrations throughout. The illustrations are drawn from museums, collectors, and practicing potters across the word and offer representative examples of the major styles, materials, and forms of all periods, allowing us to make comparisons and see relationships between the works of potters who may be widely separated in space and time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zBzkmRVQ2tYC&dq=Ten+Thousand+Years+of+Pottery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nostradamus: The man who saw through time","description":"Lee McCann's riveting book gives us a fascinating glimpse into the life of Michel Nostradamus.

Imagined Communities, Benedict Anderson s brilliant book on nationalism, forged a new field of study when it first appeared in 1983. Since then it has sold over a quarter of a million copies and is widely considered the most important book on the subject. In this greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates on the core question: what makes people live and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name? Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the  imagined communities  of nationality, and explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kinship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of secular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time and space. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was adopted by popular movements in Europe, by imperialist powers, and by the movements of anti-imperialist resistance in Asia and Africa. In a new afterword, Anderson examines the extraordinary influence of Imagined Communities, and the book's international publication and reception, from the end of the Cold War era to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bWrnDwAAQBAJ&dq=College+Reading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey outside","description":"The Raft People live in darkness and travel a circular journey on an underground river.

With little more to his name than a winning smile, his life takes a turn for the interesting as he befriends Serina, a rebellious young woman among the god-like Devas that control his realm. Being a test subject for her magic seems innocent enough, even if she occasionally tinkers with things she shouldn't. Unfortunately, her experiments on him don't go unnoticed and as soon as her family finds out, he's as good as dead. About to be pulped by dozens of angry higher powers, Serina saves him the only way she can: by binding his soul to hers and flinging him through a portal to another world. Landing in the realm full of dangerous creatures and sinister adversaries, he finds that the pact has changed him in more ways than claiming his soul. The newly minted adventurer has his work cut out for him, especially since he doesn't have any idea how to use the magic that's been stuffed into him, much less what to do about the oaths that require him to love freely and spend his nights carousing. Join TJ on this riveting adventure that spans multiple worlds and help him discover the secrets of the Devas as he struggles to survive and fulfill his oaths.Disclaimer: This series features a protagonist raised in a higher realm where free love and indulgence are the norm and has a set of morals and ethics that are different from our own.

Everyone knows the story of Abraham Lincoln s assassination in 1865, but few are aware of the original conspiracy to kill him four years earlier in 1861, literally on his way to Washington, D.C., for his first inauguration. The conspirators were part of a white supremacist secret society that didn t want an abolitionist in the White House. They planned an elaborate scheme to assassinate the President-elect in Baltimore as Lincoln s inauguration train passed through, en route to the nation's capital. The plot was investigated by famed detective Allan Pinkerton, who infiltrated the group with undercover agents, including Kate Warne, one of the first female private detectives in America. Had the assassination succeeded, there would have been no Lincoln Presidency and the course of the Civil War and American history would have forever been altered.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_QoqEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Lincoln+conspiracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of a Wife: The Diary of a Southern Jewish Woman","description":"This new book reflects Apte's unorthodox, complex, and independent spirit during a very conservative time.

A team of scholars at Cambridge University Press has worked for more than thirty years to restore the definitive texts of D. H. Lawrence in The Cambridge Editions. Written while he was dying, Apocalypse is Lawrence s final book. In it, he presents both a radical criticism of our civilization and a statement of unwavering belief in man s power to create  a new heaven and a new earth.

The authors, leading Levinas scholars and interpreters from across the globe, explore the philosopher's relationship to a wide range of intellectual traditions, including theology, philosophy of culture, Jewish thought, phenomenology, and the history of philosophy. They also engage Levinas's contribution to ethics, politics, law, justice, psychoanalysis and epistemology, among other themes. In their radical singularity, these essays reveal the inalienable alterity at the heart of Levinas's ethics. At the same time, each essay remains open to the others, and to the perspectives and positions they advocate. Thus the volume, in its quality and diversity, enacts an authentic encounter with Levinas's thought, embodying an intellectual ethics by virtue of its style. Bringing together contributions from philosophy, theology, literary theory, gender studies, and political theory, this book offers a deeper and more thorough encounter with Levinas's ethics than any yet written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_ERoysZdqW0C&dq=Addressing+Levinas+(SPEP)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex Pistols","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Good Yarn (The Knitting Books #2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mi Ano/ My Year","description":"The months of the year are taught through engaging text and photos that symbolize each month.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WW6dAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thislewood in Jamaica, 1750-36 (Warwick University Caribbean Studies)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Color Management for Photographers: Hands on Techniques for Photoshop Users","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bury My Heart In Birmingham, the Lamar Weaver Story: Warriors Of The Civil Rights Movement","description":"This book is about the courage and dedication of many unsung heroes of the early Civil Rights Movement.

Indeed, the violence we witness daily in our own society and recent revelations about the continued use of torture, seems proof that inflicting extreme mental or physical pain on an individual to achieve one's own ends is not a taboo practice buried in the past. This incomparable, extremely thorough book   told with a frightening and factual honesty   examines every aspect of torture: professional torturers, theories and techniques, the role of torture in history, moral implications, and the refinements brought to the practice of torture by individual fanatics, religious groups, the military, and, indeed, entire cultures. For such transgressions against society as adultery, heresy and espionage, from the primitive snake pit to the sophistication of brainwashing, there have been literally thousands of techniques devised to distort both the body and the mind in order to satisfy the sadistic needs of those who command, perform and witness human torture. At the time of its first publication (1964), The History of Torture was the most complete repository of information on the subject ever assembled in one volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ktX9AwAAQBAJ&dq=History+of+Torture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Customers Rule!

America s black market is much larger than we realize, and it affects us all deeply, whether or not we smoke pot, rent a risqu  video, or pay our kids  nannies in cash. In Reefer Madness, the award-winning investigative journalist Eric Schlosser turns his exacting eye to the underbelly of American capitalism and its far-reaching influence on our society. Exposing three American mainstays pot, porn, and illegal immigrants Schlosser shows how the black market has burgeoned over the past several decades. He also draws compelling parallels between underground and overground: how tycoons and gangsters rise and fall, how new technology shapes a market, how government intervention can reinvigorate black markets as well as mainstream ones, and how big business learns and profits from the underground.  Captivating . . . Compelling tales of crime and punishment as well as an illuminating glimpse at the inner workings of the underground economy. The book revolves around two figures: Mark Young of Indiana, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for his relatively minor role in a marijuana deal; and Reuben Sturman, an enigmatic Ohio man who built and controlled a formidable pornography distribution empire before finally being convicted of tax evasion. . . . Schlosser unravels an American society that has  become alienated and at odds with itself.

It is, in fact, because of her tenacious faith in the world that Helen Hayes decided to write this book as a legacy for her grandchildren; to be read one day when they are grown. In setting down all the family stories, the backstage anecdotes and her recollections of spiritual struggle, she has produced a legacy for all of us. After years of unwillingness to discuss her private world which even her bestselling book A Gift of Joy did not do she has looked beyond her legend and directly at life s lessons as she was forced to learn them.

Efficiency in the raging debate about public goods is often used as a code word to advance political agendas. When it is used correctly, efficiency is important: it must always be part of the conversation when resources are scarce and citizens and governments have important choices to make among competing priorities. Even when the language of efficiency is used carefully, that language alone is not enough. Unilingualism will not do. We need to go beyond the cult of efficiency to talk about accountability. Much of the democratic debate of the next decade will turn on how accountability becomes part of our public conversation and whether it is imposed or negotiated. Janice Gross Stein draws on public education and universal health care, locally and globally, as flashpoints in the debate about their efficiency. She argues that what will define the quality of education from Ontario to India and the quality of health care from China to Alberta is whether citizens and governments can negotiate new standards of accountability. The cult of efficiency will not take us far enough.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kxOMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Combinatorial Problems and Exercises, Second Edition","description":"The main purpose of this book is to provide help in learning existing techniques in combinatorics.

Conventional wisdom sees the economic woes afflicting the region -- declining pay, growing inequality, persistent poverty -- as a direct result of increasingly strict environmental regulations that have crippled natural resource industries such as mining and logging.In Post-Cowboy Economics, economists Thomas Michael Power and Richard Barrett provide a new interpretation of the economy of the Mountain West. Based on evidence from a wide variety of sources, including data on individual employment and income histories of more than 300,000 residents, they clearly demonstrate that the region's economic misfortunes are not the result of changes in regional industrial structure but rather are local manifestations of pervasive national and international trends. The authors: discuss and critique entrenched conventional wisdom and its policy implications present an empirical analysis of changes in the region offer a new interpretation of events affecting the regional economy set forth public policies that will work to protect and enhance the economic well-being of its residents and communitiesThe authors' analysis and interpretation make a compelling case that despite incomes that are low compared to the rest of the country, the region is not suffering from general impoverishment, and that environmental protection, rather than threatening economic well-being, enhances welfare and protects the very source of the economic vitality that the Mountain West enjoys. Throughout, they argue that fearful, crisis driven environmental and economic development policies are unnecessary and inappropriate, and often counterproductive.Post-Cowboy Economics is an important work for professionals and scholars involved with environmental policy, economic development, and resource management, as well as anyone interested in the future of the American West.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dzAQnwEACAAJ&dq=Post-Cowboy+Economics:+Pay+And+Prosperity+In+The+New+American+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars Jedi Mace Windu One Shot","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Away (Between the Covers Collection)","description":"A BBC TWO BETWEEN THE COVERS BOOK CLUB PICK After a car accident Jarred discovers he ll never walk again.

In 13 eloquent essays, Stoltenberg articulates the first fully argued liberation theory for men that will also liberate women. He argues that male sexual identity is entirely a political and ethical construction whose advantages grow out of injustice. His thesis is, however, ultimately one of hope - that precisely because masculinity is so constructed, it is possible to refuse it, to act against it and to change. A new introduction by the author discusses the roots of his work in the American civil rights and radical feminist movements and distinguishes it from the anti-feminist philosophies underlying the recent tide of reactionary mens movements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WoQBAAAQBAJ&dq=Refusing+To+Be+A+Man+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day Trips with a Splash: Swimming Holes of the Southwest","description":"Hiking for its own sake is fine, but wouldn't you rather have a hike with an objective?

Both rural and urban in scope, it covers wilderness fires that rage in such places as Alaska and Yellowstone National Park to the \\"urban interface\\" fires that sweep out of the mountains and into neighborhoods in such places as Los Angeles and Oakland, California. For generations, fighting fire in the forest has been a Western rite of passage. Almost everyone who lives in the West knows someone who has done it - a neighbor, a friend, a co-worker, a college roommate, a son, or these days, a daughter. The region is home to tens of thousands of adults who have had this experience. Those who go to battle against wildfire range from college students to Native American crews to perennial fire bums. Seasonal combatants led by full-time professionals, they work in a little-understood, paramilitary world that is America's version of the French Foreign Legion. In their annual campaigns, daring pilots dive into flaming canyons with retardant tanker planes.

Today, in the age of powerful, graphically based computers, and the world wide web, databases are likely to contain a much greater variety of data forms, including images, sound, video clips, and even handwritten documents. When multimedia databases are the norm, traditional methods of working with databases no longer apply. How do you query a video library, or an image database containing x-rays, or sounds in an audio database? Principles of Multimedia Database Systems explains how to work with these new multimedia data forms. It is the first comprehensive treatment of the skills and techniques required to build, maintain, and query multimedia databases. This book presents the mix of techniques necessary for working with multimedia databases, including synthetic solutions for the design and deployment of multimedia database systems. Because rapid technological developments are constantly changing the landscape of multimedia databases, the book teaches basic theoretical principles applicable to any database. * Covers the major issues of multimedia database design, with a strong focus on distributed multimedia databases. * Discusses important topics including how to organize the vast data types, storage and retrieval, and creation and delivery of multimedia presentations. * Organized around the lively scenario of a crime-fighting database that evolves as new concepts are introduced. * Includes numerous exercises and suggestions for programming projects. * Additional materials on the web include updates, on-line supplements, and links to downloadable software.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QY5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Multimedia+Database+Systems+(The+Morgan+Kaufmann+Series+in+Data+Management+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal to Edible","description":"An anthropological study of the abattoirs of south-west France.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l10bk262Y3YC&dq=Animal+to+Edible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Earl and the Heiress","description":"Responsible for her orphaned aristocratic family, Noelle Armstrong supplements the family income by selling Maltese puppies to fashionable ladies and finds her life complicated by an encounter with Justin, Earl of Wrenthe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TA9GAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Earl+and+the+Heiress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pose File 2: Theatrical & More (Pose File, Vol 2)","description":"A critical history of avant-garde performance and the problematic relationship of text to performance","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CU2WD5xBSTMC&dq=Pose+File+2:+Theatrical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now Face to Face","description":"Widow Barbara Montgeoffry, Countess Devane, finds heartbreak, love, and intrigue in early eighteenth-century Virginia and London as she struggles to build a new life for herself following the devastation of her husband's death, in the sequel to Through a Glass Darkly.

Bennett always knew he would live a life of science. From the homemade rockets and experiments of his childhood to the complex equations he solved as a professor of physics, his vision has transformed the uncertainty and frailty of life into an order and beauty that he inhabits with deep satisfaction. But his vision betrays him, revealing a profound incompleteness, an inadequacy to confront the contradictions his life: the black maid who raises him and loves him but cannot welcome him into her own house, the mentally absent father who wishes he d died a hero in World War II, the self-destructive wife who invites Bennett s cruelty. As Bennett struggles between reason and intuition, he slowly learns to allow the imperfections of daily life the chaos he has worked so hard to control to broaden his understanding of the world and his place in it. Written with lyrical sparseness, hilarity mixed with sadness, the story of Bennett s struggle becomes both a beautifully rendered portrait of the emotional life of a scientist and a resonant tale of the disillusionment that haunts us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TIuyKSm3juoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Become One: A Christian Wedding Planner","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding the Racing Rules of Sailing Through 2008","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6n-8AQyYkJwC&dq=Understanding+the+Racing+Rules+of+Sailing+Through+2008&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traci Lords: Underneath It All","description":"The moving, gripping, and tellall autobiography of Traci Elizabeth Lords, a former child porn queen, electronica maven, and cult movie and TV star.

This book is less a comprehensive collection than it is a mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted friend-a sampler of underground classics, rare grooves, and timeless summer jams, poetry and prose juxtaposed with the blues, hip-hop, political speeches, and the world's funniest radio sermon. The subtle musings of Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, and Harryette Mullen are bracketed by the profane and often loud ruminations of Langston Hughes, Darius James, Wanda Coleman, Tish Benson, Steve Cannon, and Hattie Gossett. Some of the funniest writers don't write, so included are selections from well-known yet unpublished wits Lightnin' Hopkins, Mike Tyson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Selections also come from public figures and authors whose humor, although incisive and profound, is often overlooked: Malcolm X, Suzan-Lori Parks, Zora Neale Hurston, Sojourner Truth, and W.E.B. Dubois. Groundbreaking, fierce, and hilarious, this is a necessary anthology for any fan or student of American writing, with a huge range and a smart, political grasp of the uses of humor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RFuA323WsLIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life","description":"A new approach to design traces its role throughout history, focusing on the special relationship between people and objects, and examines the role of design in architecture, multimedia, computers, software, and government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QvbihdUj2NoC&dq=Toothpicks+and+Logos:+Design+in+Everyday+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Give Up Volume 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Summer Cottages of Islesboro, 1890-1930","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=thGUGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Summer+Cottages+of+Islesboro,+1890-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Haunting: A Jim Kirkwood Novel","description":"The Haunting, a Jim Kirkwood mystery: Jim is drawn to Scotland by the lure of the Highlands where he hopes to become the laird of a great estate.

Anderson's reputation as a scholar and a Latin Americanist will be enhanced when this study has time to make its imprint. American Political Science Review This new volume provides an up-to-date survey of the Central American states involved in the current conflict. While several studies of the individual countries in the region have appeared, there have been no recent attempts at a synthesis of the problems of the area. Politics in Central America fills this gap, analyzing the roots of the current crisis and suggesting solutions to the problems of the region. The author's chief assertion is that the roots of the problems in Central America are not to be found in the East-West struggle but in the competition within each country for control of the scarce natural resources. This crisis in Central America calls for drastic and economic changes. The key question, Anderson claims, is whether or not these changes can be brought about within a democratic framework.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uar_iWVhSaIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Equity Happens: Building Lifelong Wealth with Real Estate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3E9DAwEACAAJ&dq=Equity+Happens:+Building+Lifelong+Wealth+with+Real+Estate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Things (Prowlers, Book 4)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Basic criminal law","description":"For courses in criminal law and criminal procedure (as well as supplementary readings in constitutional law) in the paralegal and more general criminal justice programs.

Walking through Fire takes up the story of her extraordinary life. Famous for her novels, short stories and writings on women, Saadawi is known as the first Arab woman to have written about sex and its relation to economics and politics. Imprisoned under Sadat for her opinions, she has continued to fight against all forms of discrimination based on class, gender, nationality, race or religion. This autobiography shows the passion for justice that has shaped her life and her writing. We read about her as a rural doctor, trying to help a young girl escape from a terrible fate imposed on her by a brutal male tyranny. We follow her attempts to set up women's organizations and to publish magazines later banned by the authorities or endangered by fundamentalist threats. We travel with her into exile after the publication of her name on a death list. We witness her first marriage to a freedom fighter hounded into drug addiction by a system that has no mercy. We share her struggle against her 'false self' and a second husband who offers her financial security and comfort - provided she stops writing. We live the beautiful moments of her third marriage with a man released after fourteen years of imprisonment and hard labour - their love, companionship and shared struggle. Nawal El Saadawi has carved a place for herself in the universal struggle against oppression. 'Words should not seek to please, to hide the wounds in our bodies, or the shameful moments in our lives', she says. 'They may hurt, give us pain, but they can also provoke us to question what we have accepted for thousands of years.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QhRjDgAAQBAJ&dq=Walking+Through+Fire:+A+Life+of+Nawal+El+Saadawi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emma (Clasicos Universales Planeta) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Emma (1816) is Jane Austen's most characteristic work.

Theirs were cultures in delicate social balance and in economic harmony with the natural order. Rites of Conquest details the struggles of Michigan Indians - the Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi, and their neighbors - to maintain unique traditions in the wake of contact with Euro-Americans. The French quest for furs, the colonial aggression of the British, and the invasion of native homelands by American settlers is the backdrop for this fascinating saga of their resistance and accommodation to the new social order. Minavavana's victory at Fort Michilimackinac, Pontiac's attempts to expel the British, Pokagon's struggle to maintain a Michigan homeland, and Big Abe Le Blanc's fight for fishing rights are a few of the many episodes recounted in the pages of this book. -- from back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GX5eybKyxHcC&dq=Rites+of+Conquest:+The+History+and+Culture+of+Michigan%27s+Native+Americans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vampiro: Vampire Bat In Fact & Fantasy","description":"Zoologist David Brown has sifted through the mythology of the vampyre to present a picture of the vampire bat in true-life form.

Somebody else knows, or they couldn't have written that song in that particular way. Those songs tell us that we have something in common with their writers, but often it seems that the songwriters know more about us than we know about them. In Hold On, the Light Will Come: And Other Lessons My Songs Have Taught Me, Michael McLean lets us read the songwriter's most personal journal entries. We are invited behind the scenes to experience the parts of his life that led to more than twenty albums of songs about hope and healing and holding on. Candid, insightful, hopeful, funny, and honest, this book gives an account of the lessons Michael's songs have taught him -- or rather, how writing his songs has helped him to process the lessons that life sooner or later tries to teach us all. Included is a CD with the songs he writes about so personally in this memoir. \\"By writing this book,\\" says Michael, \\"I hope that people who've heard some of my songs before will hear them differently. And maybe those who are hearing them for the first time will understand my belief that songwriters know that they don't really own the songs they've written ... they just heard them first.\\" Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dzp0Jz7CKBMC&dq=Hold+On,+the+Light+Will+Come:+And+Other+Lessons+My+Songs+Have+Taught+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Maryknoll Sisters in Hong Kong, 1921-1969: In Love with the Chinese","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shut up and Eat Your Snowshoes!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dAQVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Shut+up+and+Eat+Your+Snowshoes!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Sister (Sweet Dreams Series #5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IwpvEl7HapwC&dq=Little+Sister+(Sweet+Dreams+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winning of Barbara Worth (The Best Sellers of 1911)","description":"Books for All Kinds of Readers.

And the missing heir to the Imperial Throne! In the swashbuckling, extravagant manner of The Phoenix Guards, Five Hundred Years After, and The Paths of the Dead, this is an old-fashioned adventure--moving at a twenty-first-century pace. The Interregnum is over. To everyone's astonishment, Zerika, a very young Phoenix, has coolly emerged from the Paths of the Dead, carrying with her the Orb, which everyone had thought was lost in Adron's Disaster. The Orb is the heart of the Dragaeran Empire, the source of all its magic--and the infallible sign that Zerika is the new Empress. But not everyone is happy to hear the news. It's been 250 years since Adron's Disaster, and power vacuums never stay that way for long. Kana, a Dragonlord, has been expanding his holdings. He now controls almost half the area that was once the Empire -- in effect, the Empire re-created, with himself on the throne. Among those opposing him is a young Dragonlord named Morrolan - the same Morrolan familiar to every reader of the Vlad Taltos adventures.

The Temple of the Ninth Daughter sits on a hill at the edge of Newton-upon-Sea, an aura of mystery lingering over its tall, gray silhouette. Villagers whisper about the treasure housed inside, protected by local Freemasons who are bound by clandestine oaths. Dr. Alexandra Gladstone has no time for such nonsense. Between the patients in her surgery and the rounds she makes with her faithful dog, Zack, her days are busy enough. But Alexandra has no logical explanation when the Freemasons start dying, one by one, with no sign of foul play other than smears of blood on their Masonic aprons. And what to make of reports that a Knight Templar rides through the village before each passing? After the constable disappears in the midst of the crisis, Alexandra reaches out to her dashing, diligent friend, Nicholas Forsythe, Lord Dunsford, for assistance. Is someone after the treasure, or might a more sinister game be afoot? In order to solve this puzzle, Alexandra must somehow catch a killer who shows no remorse and leaves no witnesses. Praise for Paula Paul s Alexandra Gladstone mysteries  I love the way real personalities from the past keep popping up to intermingle with Paul s fictional characters.

For cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that things like magic and cinematic love stories don t exist, and the only smart way to go through life is alone. She can t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there s certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures. But then, there s this gorgeous girl on the train. Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August s day when she needed it most. August s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there s one big problem: Jane doesn t just look like an old school punk rocker.

The issue has more than semantic importance. Many RMA proponents have begun to argue for major changes in Pentagon budgetary priorities and even in American foreign policy more generally to free up resources to pursue a transformed U.S. military and to make sure that other countries do not take advantage of the purported RMA before we do. This book takes a more measured perspective. Beginning with a survey of various types of defense technologies, it argues that while important developments are indeed under way, most impressively in electronics and computer systems, the overall thrust of contemporary military innovation is probably not of a revolutionary magnitude. Some reorientation of U.S. defense dollars is appropriate, largely to improve homeland defense and to take advantage of the promise of modern electronics systems and precision-guided munitions. But radical shifts in U.S. security policy and Pentagon budget priorities appear unwarranted especially if those shifts would come at the expense of American military engagement in overseas defense missions from Korea to Iraq to Bosnia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iy6P9_-QSUoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurricane Survival Guide: How to Prepare Your Family and Home for the Next Hurricane?","description":"Shows the dangers of hurricanes and the methods that can be used to combat and prepare for them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R9LoAAAACAAJ&dq=Hurricane+Survival+Guide:+How+to+Prepare+Your+Family+and+Home+for+the+Next+Hurricane%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calde of the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","description":"Young Silk, inspired by the gods, fights for survival against the shadowy rulers of the city of Viron, who command the technological wonders of the future","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kNLCAdoA6xMC&dq=Calde+of+the+Long+Sun+(Book+of+the+Long+Sun)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talleyrand","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture (Plume)","description":"The author, an American who has previously written on environmental issues, provides a critical analysis of the role of the beef industry in the course of western civilisation.

Also included are two photographs of the artist, consisting of private portrait studies by Frederick H. Evans. Over 180 beautifully reproduced black-and-white plates capture the uniqueness of Beardsley's vision and reveal the seductive power of his art. Among the illustrations are brilliantly conceived vignettes from \\"Le Morte D'arthur, Venus and Tannhauser, Salome, \\"and\\" Lucian's True History\\" as well as enchanting creations for \\"The Yellow Book\\" (an influential British arts quarterly), and much more. Characterized by bold black masses, elongated shapes, and sensually provocative figures, these works are the product of a remarkable individual style that transformed the art of illustration. Reproduced here in an inexpensive high-quality format, they are certain to thrill not only Beardsley enthusiasts but anyone interested in the early years of modern graphic art.

Diego, the son, is disillusioned and bitter about the limited freedoms his country offers him as he endures compulsory military service. Mariana, the mother, is unwell, prone to mysterious seizures, and forced to relinquish control over the household to her daughter, Maria, who has left school and is working as a chambermaid in a state-owned tourist hotel. The father, Armando, is a committed revolutionary, a die-hard Fidelista who is sickened by the corruption he perceives all around him. As each member of the family narrates seemingly quotidian and overlapping events, they grow increasingly at odds for reasons that remain elusive to them each of them holding and concealing their own secrets. In meticulously charting the disintegration of a single family, The Fallen offers a poignant reflection on contemporary Cuba and the clash of the ardent idealism of the old guard with the jaded pragmatism of the young.

Does the stone provide evidence that forces a rewrite of American history, or was it merely a well-executed hoax? In the absence of written records documenting a Norse expedition into Minnesota, most historians have dismissed the Kensington Runestone as a forgery. However, Kehoe approaches the question holistically. She examines not only historical and literary evidence, but also brings in data from archaeology, geology, linguistics, and biological anthropology. She concludes that the stones authenticity should not be dismissed as readily as it has been so far, even if that means re-thinking deeply ingrained ideas about contact between Europeans and indigenous Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TdIYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buster, Where Are You","description":"This colorful, beautifully illustrated children s book invites children ages three through eight into Buster Bunny s world to learn alongside him how to bring his worries and stress to Jesus. Buster loves racing, but the more he thinks about the upcoming competition at the county fair for who will be the fastest animal in Mulberry meadow, the more stressed he gets. No matter how hard he trains, he can t eat or sleep, and eventually he decides he wants to quit running. Buster s parents talk with him about quieting the noise in his head so he can listen to Jesus instead of all his worries. Parents and children will learn concrete, grace-based ways to deal with stress. Based on David Powlison s minibook Stressed Out and edited by Nan Powlison, Buster Tries to Bail ends with a special section that guides parents in teaching their children to respond with faith when worries take hold in their hearts. Buster Tries to Bail is part of the Good News for Little Hearts series, bringing gospel help and biblical counsel to families. Based on CCEF s model of hope and help, each story focuses on an animal family s real-life issues, encouraging young readers toward a growing relationship with Jesus in the midst of challenging circumstances. Each individual story guides parents toward meaningful conversations with their kids, based on what Scripture has to say about living by faith in everyday life. By providing biblical help and hope to issues every child faces through vivid illustrations and a story based on a different animal family, even the youngest child will be engaged. Each story offers practical ways to follow Jesus in difficult situations. Instead of a moralistic message, young readers are encouraged to develop a real relationship with the God who cares for them. Buster Tries to Bail, along with all of the Good News for Little Hearts books, will become a lifelong gift for parents and children, as well as teachers, biblical counselors, and anyone hoping to provide concrete, grace-based help for young children.

Set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, the story revolves around the lives of its inhabitants in the years leading up to the Reform Act in 1832, particularly those of Dorothea Brooke, Tertius Lydgate, Nicholas Bulstrode, and Mary Garth. The novel deals with a variety of themes and issues including marriage, religion, hypocrisy, education, political reform, and the status of women. Although published to mixed reviews, Eliot's  Middlemarch  is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language. A veritable classic of English literature without which no bookshelf is complete. Mary Ann Evans (18191880), more commonly known as George Eliot, was an English poet, journalist, novelist, and translator. Among the most prominent writers in Victorian England, she wrote seven novels in total, most of which are known for their realism and psychological analyses of provincial English life. Other notable works by this author include:  Adam Bede  (1859),  The Mill on the Floss  (1860), and  Daniel Deronda  (1876). Read & Co.

But without a theoretical understanding of the processes related to marital stability and dissolution, it is difficult to design and evaluate new marriage interventions. The Mathematics of Marriage provides the foundation for a scientific theory of marital relations. The book does not rely on metaphors, but develops and applies a mathematical model using difference equations. The work is the fulfillment of the goal to build a mathematical framework for the general system theory of families first suggested by Ludwig Von Bertalanffy in the 1960s.The book also presents a complete introduction to the mathematics involved in theory building and testing, and details the development of experiments and models. In one \\"marriage experiment,\\" for example, the authors explored the effects of lowering or raising a couple's heart rates. Armed with their mathematical model, they were able to do real experiments to determine which processes were affected by their interventions. Applying ideas such as phase space, null clines, influence functions, inertia, and uninfluenced and influenced stable steady states (attractors), the authors show how other researchers can use the methods to weigh their own data with positive and negative weights. While the focus is on modeling marriage, the techniques can be applied to other types of psychological phenomena as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vrxNEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mathematics+of+Marriage:+Dynamic+Nonlinear+Models+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ford Tractor Conversions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Enhanced Family Fun: A Greater Chicago Area Activity Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"These Savage Futurians Double Invaders","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qTu6AQAACAAJ&dq=These+Savage+Futurians+Double+Invaders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Chronicles of Henry Dashwood II","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Peter: Eyewitness of His Majesty As Disciple, Preacher, Pastor","description":"How the grace of God moulded Peter as a disciple, as a preacher and as a pastor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7LgKAAAACAAJ&dq=Peter:+Eyewitness+of+His+Majesty+As+Disciple,+Preacher,+Pastor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Torah: Theology and Social History of Old Testament Law","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Trees and Shrubs: Northeastern and north-central United States and southeastern and south-centralCanada (Peterson Field Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf Tells All","description":"For those who think they know the story of the Three Little Pigs and the Big, Bad Wolf, here it is as they've never heard it before.

Imprisoned for drug-smuggling, the lone Brit on Wing 13, Chance, reveals the horrors he experienced among cut-throat villains and screws in the netherworld of the Spanish prison system.Chance takes to writing in his dank prison cell in an attempt to escape his surroundings and recalls various episodes in his life: his time serving as a soldier in Thailand and Malaysia; his involvement with the 3 Para snatch-squad in the 1970s Belfast; and his subsequent descent into drug dealing and trafficking, which culminated in a high-speed boat chase and his imprisonment in a top-security Spanish prison. While inside, Chance fought his way to the surface of a cesspool of iniquitous scumbags using his fists: the only effective means of being understood in an environment of desecrated morality and non-existent integrity. With predators lurking everywhere, Chance had to be constantly on guard and in order to survive he had to be mentally prepared to inflict the necessary violent retribution on any would-be attacker or racist thug. As the sole British inmate, Chance was a prime target for the intimidating Spanish hardmen who thrived on cruelty and treachery. But his martial arts skills and Samurai philosophy proved to be more than a match for the aggressors. Once a respected and successful businessman admired by his peers - he had operated his own martial arts business in Spain before being jailed - Chance took one wrong turn in life and lost everything except the love and support of his loyal wife.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zvYI3xeH9RYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a Cafe: Selected Stories (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MicroC OS II: The Real Time Kernel (With CD-ROM)","description":"MicroC/OS II Second Edition describes the design and implementation of the MicroC/OS-II real-time operating system (RTOS).

She trained as a teacher and taught mathematics in Glasgow, Scotland, before resigning her position to go to Dublin to take part in the Easter Rising of April 1916. Skinnider's Doing My Bit for Ireland, published in the United States in 1917, is her account of her revolutionary activities in 1915 and 1916. She begins by telling the story of her first trip to Dublin, in 1915, when she smuggled detonators for bombs into Ireland for use by the nationalists. This is followed by a more extensive narrative of her role in the Easter Rising. Skinnider carried ammunition, served as a dispatch rider, and was a sniper. After spending seven weeks in the hospital recovering from three gunshot wounds suffered in the uprising, she managed to avoid arrest and to make her way back to Glasgow. During a brief return to Ireland in August 1916, she was trailed by a detective and fled to the United States, where in 1917-18 she campaigned for the cause of Irish independence. The book is illustrated and contains, in addition to Skinnider's narrative, facsimile copies of important documents relating to the events of April 1916, including the proclamation of an Irish republic by the provisional government, stamps issued by the republic during its brief existence, the last proclamation issued by Padraic Pearse, president of the republic, and Pearse's surrender document of April 29, 1916. The book concludes with the lyrics to the songs sung by Irish volunteers before and after the Easter Rising. After her stay in the United States, Skinnider returned to Ireland and was active in the Cummann na mBan, the women's auxiliary to the Irish Republican Army.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEs2AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Baldwin genealogy supplement","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IbowAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jutland, the German Perspective: A New View of the Great Battle, 31 May 1916","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Planets in the Signs and Houses: Vedic Astrologer's Handbook Vol. II (v. 2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Sun: Astrology in Light of Psychology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears and the Showdown at Chainsaw Gap (Big Chapter Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christ Stopped at Eboli: The Story of a Year","description":"It was to Lucania, a desolate land in southern Italy, that Carlo Levi a doctor, painter, philosopher, and man of letters was confined as a political prisoner because of his opposition to Italy's Fascist government at the start of the Ethiopian war in 1935.

Americans are aging faster and getting fatter than any other population on the planet. At the same time, our popular notions of perfect beauty have become so strict it seems even Barbie wouldn t have a chance of making it into the local beauty pageant. Aging may be a natural fact of life, but for a growing number of Americans its hallmarks wrinkles, love handles, jiggling flesh are seen as obstacles to be conquered on the path to lasting, flawless beauty. In Beauty Junkies Alex Kuczynski, whose sly wit and fearless reporting in the Times has won her fans across the country, delivers a fresh and irresistible look at America's increasingly desperate pursuit of ultimate beauty by any means necessary. From a group of high-maintenance New York City women who devote themselves to preserving their looks twenty-four hours a day, to a  surgery safari  in South Africa complete with  after  photographs of magically rejuvenated patients posing with wild animals, to a podiatrist's office in Manhattan where a  foot face-lift  provides women with the right fit for their $700 Jimmy Choos, Kuczynski portrays the all-American quest for self-transformation in all its extremes. In New York, lawyers become Botox junkies in an effort to remain poker-faced. In Los Angeles, women of an uncertain age nip and tuck their most private areas, so that every inch of their bodies is as taut as their lifted faces. Across the country, young women graduating from high school receive gifts of breast implants  from their parents. As medicine and technology stretch the boundaries of biology, Kuczynski asks whether cosmetic surgery might even be part of human evolution, a kind of cosmetic survival of the fittest  or firmest? With incomparable portraits of obsessive patients and the equally obsessed doctors who cater to their dreams, Beauty Junkies examines the hype, the hope, and the questionable ethics surrounding the advent of each new miraculous technique. Lively and entertaining, thought-provoking and disturbing, Beauty Junkies is destined to be one of the most talked-about books of the season.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l0wvAuOecegC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highland Vow (Zebra Historical Romance)","description":"In book one of a new Scottish trilogy that captures the lives of the spirited daughters of the Murray brothers, New York Times bestselling author Hannah Howell spins a passionate tale of a woman who risks everything to win the heart of the man who captures hers. . .

Everything in their lives -gestures, decisions, personality traits, eccentricities, even the most dissonant mistakes- are thus transformed into esthetic substance. We would want their lives to be masterworks, a perfect coherence- and continuity between the work and its creator. Roland Barthes has criticized this conception as a basically bourgeois aberration - the perennial realism of the bourgeois culture, its need to identify the signified with the signifier. And then we learn about the real human dimension of these heroes- their pettiness, narcissism, avariciousness, arbitrariness, and childishness, all of which are no more than their human specificity. We are scandalized; either the work or the figure lies. A harmonious painting, a novel or masterful symphony cannot possibly be the product of a person capable of such spiritual smallness. Then we are left with two choices to dismiss the work as an essentially hypocritical utterance, or to disqualify the creator as the accidental author of some work that happened to be marvelous but was simply by virtue of a great skill, not supported by an equally admirable human quality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5K26DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linux, DOS and Windows. . .

Carter, whose exquisite anatomical illustrations are masterpieces of art and close observation. Tracing the triumphs and tragedies of these two extraordinary men, Hayes brings an equally extraordinary erathe mid-1800sunforgettably to life.

As Hayes s acquaintance with death deepens, he finds his understanding and appreciation of life deepening in unexpected and profoundly moving ways. The Anatomist is more than just the story of a book. It is the story of the human body, a story whose beginning and end we all know and share but that, like all great stories, is infinitely rich in between.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sb0nQl9pmgoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stanley Sadie's Music Guide: An Introduction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel -- Why Everything You Know is Wrong","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pour man's friend: A guide and reference for bar personnel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Pulse Classic: A Translation of the Mai Jing","description":"The Mai Jing or Pulse Classic was written in the late Han dynasty by Wang Shu-he.

People In the little Irish town of Shancarrig, the young people carve their initials and those of their loves into the copper beech tree in front of the schoolhouse. But not even Father Gunn, the parish priest, who knows most of what goes on behind Shancarrig s closed doors, or Dr. Jims, the village doctor, who knows all the rest, realize that not everything in the placid village is what it seems. Unexpected passions and fears are bringing together many lives, such as the sensitive new priest and Miss Ross, the slight, beautiful schoolteacher . . . Leonora, the privileged daughter of the town s richest family, and Foxy Dunne, whose father did time in jail . . . and Nessa Ryan, whose parents run Ryan s Hotel, and two very different young men.

Jenijoy La Belle, who studied with Roethke, here describes the cultural tradition that he defined and created for himself. In so doing, she demonstrates how an understanding of Roethke's sources and the influences on his work is essential for its interpretation. The author considers the sources of Roethke's poetry and the influence on him of a wide circle of poets including T. S. Eliot, Yeats, Whitman, Wordsworth, Smart, Donne, Sir John Davies, and Dante. In addition, she traces the changes in Roethke's response to his literary past as he moves from his early lyrics to his final sequences. His imitation of selected poets began as a conscious effort but later became a basic component of his imaginative faculties, encompassing an historical attitude and a psychological state.

Why does the U.S. seem to support foreign dictators? Why has it invested so many of its resources in stockpiling nuclear arms? Why doesn't the U.S. act as a force for peace throughout the world? In this probing, provocative analysis, Michael Parenti reveals the hidden agenda of American foreign policy decsisions. No matter which party is in power, the U.S. acts to protect the interests of large American-based corporations, in order to maintain valuable overseas markets and cheap foreign labor. In lucid detail, Michael Parenti examines just how these very private interests determine America's public policy goals, from the impoverishment of developing nations to the building of an intimidating nuclear arsenal.

The Amazing Story of God's Work among the Poor of El Paso-Juarez","description":"The areas along the U.S.-Mexico border are commonly portrayed as a hot spot for gang activity, drug trafficking, and violence. Yet when Robert J. Dur n conducted almost a decade s worth of ethnographic research in border towns between El Paso, Texas, and southern New Mexico a region notorious for gang activity, according to federal officials he found significantly less gang membership and activity than common fearmongering claims would have us believe. Instead, he witnessed how the gang label was used to criminalize youth of Mexican descent to justify the overrepresentation of Latinos in the justice system, the implementation of punitive practices in the school system, and the request for additional resources by law enforcement. In The Gang Paradox, Dur n analyzes the impact of deportation, incarceration, and racialized perceptions of criminality on Latino families and youth along the border. He draws on ethnography, archival research, official data sources, and interviews with practitioners and community members to present a compelling portrait of Latino residents  struggles amid deep structural disadvantages. Dur n, himself a former gang member, offers keen insights into youth experience with schools, juvenile probation, and law enforcement. The Gang Paradox is a powerful community study that sheds new light on intertwined criminalization and racialization, with policy relevance toward issues of gangs, juvenile delinquency, and the lack of resources in border regions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HWNbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Der Prozess.","description":"Een jongeman staat terecht zonder dat hem duidelijk wordt op welke beschuldiging.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hk8bMQAACAAJ&dq=Der+Prozess.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Guardia in Congress.","description":"Fiorello LaGuardia is known best as the tempestuous mayor of New York City in the days when Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the White House. There had been, however, an earlier time, which matched his mayoralty years in sheer drama and perhaps surpassed them in lasting achievement LaGuardia's years in Congress. He served in the House of Representative almost continuously from 1917 to 1933, representing two ethnically diverse congressional districts: the Fourteenth (Greenwich Village), from 1917 to 1919, and the Twentieth (East Harlem), from 1923 to 1933. Although barred from important committee posts because of his political independence and thus denied from playing a direct role in lawmaking, he was a tireless and vocal champion of Progressive causes, from allowing more immigration and removing U.S. troops from Nicaragua to speaking up for the rights and livelihoods of striking miners, impoverished farmers, oppressed minorities, and struggling families. A goad to the era's plutocrats and their enablers in government, LaGuardia fought for progressive income taxes, greater government oversight of Wall Street, and national employment insurance for workers idled by the Great Depression. In this book, first published by Cornell University Press in 1959, Howard Zinn establishes LaGuardia's tenure in Congress as a vital link between the Progressive and New Deal eras, offering a lively and informative account of his many legislative battles, his political philosophy, and the distinctly urban (specifically, New York City) sensibilities he brought to the Progressive movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=La+Guardia+in+Congress.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Do Astronauts Scratch an Itch (An Imponderables Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wolf Queen: The Claidi Journals III","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Summer of the Green Star","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quest for Full Assurance: Legacy of Calvin & His Successors","description":"Against the background of the sixteenth-century Reformers (with special attention to Calvin), Beeke examines the theological development of personal assurance of faith in English Puritanism and its parallel movement in the Netherlands, the Dutch Second Reformation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MkYRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Quest+for+Full+Assurance:+Legacy+of+Calvin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE GREEK MYTHS VOLUME ONE","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sensual Memoirs of an Edwardian Lady II","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina","description":"Contains excerpt of Whitefern, sequel to My sweet Audrina.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t19BCwAAQBAJ&dq=My+Sweet+Audrina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of zoology, illustrated by the crayfish (The international scientific series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eZs3yAEACAAJ&dq=An+introduction+to+the+study+of+zoology,+illustrated+by+the+crayfish+(The+international+scientific+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clock Making for the Woodworker","description":"Provides detailed plans and instructions for making eighteen antique-style clocks, including grandfather, pillar and scroll, ogee, calendar, cottage, banjo, schoolhouse, regulator, steeple, mission-style, mantel, and tambour","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xwZiPwAACAAJ&dq=Clock+Making+for+the+Woodworker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the drift fence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Full Blessing of Pentecost","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rUNXx9XsPZgC&dq=The+Full+Blessing+of+Pentecost&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born In Tibet (Mandala Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves from Rough Surfaces (Artech House Radar Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Instinct: Tapping Your Entrepreneurial DNA to Achieve Your Business Goals","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hiring Contractors Without Going Through Hell: How to Find, Hire, Supervise, and Pay Professional Help","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nmgXtwAACAAJ&dq=Hiring+Contractors+Without+Going+Through+Hell:+How+to+Find,+Hire,+Supervise,+and+Pay+Professional+Help&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lapwings and Libyans in Ancient Egypt","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"WORKS OF FISHER AMES","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Plot to Kill Wallis Simpson","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GlgzPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Plot+to+Kill+Wallis+Simpson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer Island","description":"Talk-show host Nora Bridge insists that her estranged daughter Ruby, a struggling comedienne, come to her childhood home in the San Juan islands while Nora convalesces.

Before those juggernaut years of Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and sold-out crowds at Gillette Stadium came a hapless franchise that managed only a single playoff victory in a quarter century and spent its entire first decade of existence just trying to establish a permanent home field (and even when they did, none of the toilets worked). In From Darkness to Dynasty, bestselling author Jerry Thornton irreverently chronicles those easily glossed-over, downtrodden decades--years when the team claimed more headlines for lawsuits, arrests, power struggles, drug problems, and inept, bizarre, behavior from players, coaches, and owners than for anything they accomplished on the field. Relive the behind-the-scenes dysfunction, the turmoil of prolonged irrelevance, and the improbable way the Patriots finally ascended to greatness. By turns hilarious and eye-opening, this is an essential history for fans and disparagers alike, and a pointed reminder that the best stories of triumph start with humble beginnings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fo_xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A HAUNTED WOMAN","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sioux spaceman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Divorcing","description":"Now back in print for the first time since 1969, a stunning novel about childhood, marriage, and divorce by one of the most interesting minds of the twentieth century. Dream and reality overlap in Divorcing, a book in which divorce is not just a question of a broken marriage but names a rift that runs right through the inner and outer worlds of Sophie Blind, its brilliant but desperate protagonist. Can the rift be mended? Perhaps in the form of a novel, one that goes back from present-day New York to Sophie s childhood in preWorld War II Budapest, that revisits the divorce between her Freudian father and her fickle mother, and finds a place for a host of further tensions and contradictions in her present life. The question that haunts Divorcing, however, is whether any novel can be fleet and bitter and true and light enough to gather up all the darkness of a given life. Susan Taubes s startlingly original novel was published in 1969 but largely ignored at the time; after the author s tragic early death, it was forgotten. Its republication presents a chance to discover a splintered, glancing, caustic, and lyrical work by a dazzlingly intense and inventive writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DCFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Divorcing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Control Systems","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"One-Room School","description":"\\"This newly revised edition describes how building a school was a priority once an early community became established.

There, the formal government--president, parliament, and other official governing components-- is paralleled by more powerful revolutionary institutions that help shape regime policy. But a third influential stand in Iran's volatile political dynamic is more unfamiliar to many, namely, the vigilante groups used by hard-liners to intimidate reformers with raw violence.In this Washington Institute Policy Paper, historian Michael Rubin presents an incisive and comprehensive survey of Iran's vigilantes, or \\"pressure groups,\\" along with an exploration of the deep roots these groups have in modern Iranian history. Drawing on both a wide array of Persian language sources and his own research conducted in Iran, Dr. Rubin concludes that--despite the inevitability of political change suggested by demographic and economic realities in the Khatami era--the prospects for real reform in Iran within the existing system of rule are weakened by vigilante activism.The strategic use of vigilantes to frustrate reform also raises important policy issues for the U.S. government. The United States, Dr. Rubin argues should not tolerate a shell game in which vigilantes--sponsored by those in power--carry out hostile actions for which the regime then conveniently denies responsibility. If the Iranian president cannot effectively suppress the vigilante groups, then he may be too weak a figure to implement meaningful changes in foreign or domestic policy.Understanding the threat these vigilante groups pose can only improve America's ability to formulate effective policy toward Iran. This valuable Policy Paper, incredibly rich in detail, brings vital scholarship to bear on that understanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ChaKAAAAMAAJ&dq=Into+the+Shadows:+Radical+Vigilantes+in+Khatami%27s+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Word According to Eve: Women and the Bible in Ancient Times and Our Own","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Book of Sushi","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sDIEaAEACAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Sushi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Astonishing Story of the Saint of Cabora","description":"The Astonishing Story of the Saint of Cabora is a fictional re-creation of the life of Teresa Urrea, a popular Mexican heroine at the turn of the century.

Deeply engaging and witty  (Los Angeles Times). Long before Columbus arrived in the New Word, tobacco was cultivated and enjoyed by the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas, who used it for medicinal, religious, and social purposes. But when Europeans began to colonize the American continents, it became something else entirely a cultural touchstone of pleasure and success, and a coveted commodity that would transform the world economy forever. Iain Gately s Tobacco tells the epic story of an unusual plant and its unique relationship with the history of humanity, from its obscure ancient beginnings, through its rise to global prominence, to its current embattled state today. In a lively narrative, Gately makes the case for the tobacco trade being the driving force behind the growth of the American colonies, the foundation of Dutch trading empire, the underpinning cause of the African slave trade, and the financial basis for victory in the American Revolution. Well-researched and wide-ranging, Tobacco is a vivid and provocative look at the surprising roles this plant has played in the culture of the world.  Ambitious . . . informative and perceptive . . . Gately is an amusing writer, which is a blessing.   The Washington Post  Documents the resourcefulness with which human beings of every class, religion, race, and continent have pursued the lethal leaf.

Fifty years after its original publication, The Bottom of the Harbor is still considered a fundamental New York book. Every story Mitchell tells, every person he introduces, every scene he describes is illuminated by his passion for the eccentrics and eccentricities of his beloved adopted city. All of the pieces here are connected in one way or another--some directly, some with a kind of mysterious circuitousness--to New York's fabled waterfront, the terrain that Mitchell brilliantly made his own.

After a decade of sleuthing in the royal archives, Diarmaid MacCulloch has emerged with a tantalizing new understanding of Henry's mercurial chief minister, the inscrutable and utterly compelling Thomas Cromwell. History has not been kind to the son of a Putney brewer who became the architect of England's split with Rome. Where past biographies portrayed him as a scheming operator with blood on his hands, Hilary Mantel reimagined him as a far more sympathetic figure buffered by the whims of his master. So which was he--the villain of history or the victim of her creation? MacCulloch sifted through letters and court records for answers and found Cromwell's fingerprints on some of the most transformative decisions of Henry's turbulent reign. But he also found Cromwell the man, an administrative genius, rescuing him from myth and slander. The real Cromwell was a deeply loving father who took his biggest risks to secure the future of his son, Gregory. He was also a man of faith and a quiet revolutionary. In the end, he could not appease or control the man whose humors were so violent and unpredictable. But he made his mark on England, setting her on the path to religious awakening and indelibly transforming the system of government of the English-speaking world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tx1xDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cromwell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Topology from the differentiable viewpoint","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Forward with Christ;: Teacher's manual for grade VII (Augsburg series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h1QTPwAACAAJ&dq=Forward+with+Christ%3B:+Teacher%27s+manual+for+grade+VII+(Augsburg+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zoids, Vol. 13: Chaotic Century","description":"Van, who longs to be a ZOID pilot like his father, befriends Zeke, a ZOID willling to be his partner, as well as the amnesiac girl Fiona, and soon they engage on a quest to find the meaning of the ominous phrase \\"ZOID-Eve.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2S486eriygIC&dq=Zoids,+Vol.+13:+Chaotic+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Present Time: The Lost Prophet [VHS]","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Duluth (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","description":"A satiric look at the state of the union centers on a relocated Duluth and its assorted politicians, policemen and women, terrestrial and extraterrestrial aliens, Hispanics, feminists, mobsters, and other minorities","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHm6wAEACAAJ&dq=Duluth+(Classic,+20th-Century,+Penguin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Floyd Collins","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Instant Enemy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A History of United States Foreign Policy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fibre bundles (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"True Betrayals; Montana Sky; Sanctuary: Three Complete Novels","description":"Three dramatic tales of romantic suspense journey from a Montana ranch to a Virginia horse farm to an island off the coast of Georgia in an omnibus anthology that features True Betrayals, Montana Sky, and Sanctuary. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RM4CNsqScQ8C&dq=True+Betrayals%3B+Montana+Sky%3B+Sanctuary:+Three+Complete+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gay Guy's Guide to Love: The Dos, Don'ts, and Definite Maybes of Dating and Mating","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Family Creative Workshop (24-volume set)","description":"A positive and inspiring tale about a little girl who enjoys using her creativity to plan, fix, and make new things in her special place: 'Maria's Creative Workshop' This book offers a perfect example of perseverance and creativity.

It is a deep and rich biblical study of sanctification - how Christians grow in holiness and become more like Jesus. In a day when Christians are very prone to pursue self-help methods to grow in obedience to Christ, Walter Marshall lays out the biblical way of growth: obedience comes as Christians live by grace, in union with Christ, by faith. Growth comes, as Paul says in Galatians 2:20, through Christ living in me.  The message of this book is so important for Christians today, it is essential that it be rewritten in contemporary English.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GEZLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conservative Rebellion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Reward Plan Advantage: A Manager's Guide to Improving Business Performance Through People","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Universe: 365 Days","description":"Brings together a year's worth of visually significant images selected from the collection that has been published on the Astronomy Picture of the Day website, complementing each picture with a short explanatory text about the subject.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ivQ0AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Universe:+365+Days&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warren Bernhardt Teaches Jazz Piano: Volume 1 - A Hands-On Course in Improvisation & Technique","description":"Includes exercises in standard notation for straight time eighth note rhythm, basslines and endings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KWbsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Warren+Bernhardt+Teaches+Jazz+Piano:+Volume+1+-+A+Hands-On+Course+in+Improvisation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nervous System, Part 1: Anatomy and Physiology (Ciba Collection of Medical Illustrations, Volume 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Discourse on the Inexhaustible Lamp of the Zen School","description":"Based on the teachings of the great Zen Master Hakuin Zenji, The Discourse on the Inexhaustible Lamp of the Zen School is an essential guide to Rinzai Zen training.

But contrary to popular belief, the cultural relationship between the United States and the world has been reciprocal, says Richard Pells. The United States not only plays a large role in shaping international entertainment and tastes, it is also a consumer of foreign intellectual and artistic influences.Pells reveals how the American artists, novelists, composers, jazz musicians, and filmmakers who were part of the Modernist movement were greatly influenced by outside ideas and techniques. People across the globe found familiarities in American entertainment, resulting in a universal culture that has dominated the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and fulfilled the aim of the Modernist movement--to make the modern world seem more intelligible.\\"Modernist America\\" brilliantly explains why George Gershwin's music, Cole Porter's lyrics, Jackson Pollock's paintings, Bob Fosse's choreography, Marlon Brando's acting, and Orson Welles's storytelling were so influential, and why these and other artists and entertainers simultaneously represent both an American and a modern global culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PwLtClFGTSQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collins Gem Webster (Collins Gems)","description":"This American English edition, based on the world's bestselling pocket English dictionary, is a clear, up-to-date, reliable guide to spelling, meaning, and pronunciation.

Of all the virtues that have been passed on to us through the ages, from the great poets to the saints and scholars, throughout history and literature, love is the one virtue that we as a society cannot live without. The ability to love well and to love wisely is the most important trait that parents can pass on to their children.

He was also a leading astrologer of his day, whose predictions won him access to some of the most powerful people in sixteenth-century Europe. In Cardano's Cosmos, Anthony Grafton invites readers to follow this astrologer's extraordinary career and explore the art and discipline of astrology in the hands of a brilliant practitioner. Renaissance astrologers predicted everything from the course of the future of humankind to the risks of a single investment, or even the weather. They analyzed the bodies and characters of countless clients, from rulers to criminals, and enjoyed widespread respect and patronage. This book traces Cardano's contentious career from his first astrological pamphlet through his rise to high-level consulting and his remarkable autobiographical works. Delving into astrological principles and practices, Grafton shows how Cardano and his contemporaries adapted the ancient art for publication and marketing in a new era of print media and changing science. He maps the context of market and human forces that shaped Cardano's practices--and the maneuvering that kept him at the top of a world rife with patronage, politics, and vengeful rivals. Cardano's astrology, argues Grafton, was a profoundly empirical and highly influential art, one that was integral to the attempts of sixteenth-century scholars to understand their universe and themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GhkxjStiZfwC&dq=Cardano%27s+Cosmos:+The+Worlds+and+Works+of+a+Renaissance+Astrologer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vulpes, the red fox (American woodland tales)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Shadow of Death: The Hunt for a Serial Killer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHYONQAACAAJ&dq=The+Shadow+of+Death:+The+Hunt+for+a+Serial+Killer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"USAF for the 21st Century: Super Wing Total Force Integration (Osprey Military Aircraft)","description":"Subtitled: Super Wing Total Force Integration.

What we were not told was that the origins of the sickness may already have been here and suspected for a quarter of a century. This illuminating expos  of the threat to our nation's health reveals for the first time how Mad Cow Disease (a.k.a. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) has jumped species, infecting humans in the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), and may be hidden in the enormous increase in the number of Alzheimer's cases since 1979. Detailing the history and biology of Mad Cow Disease, Brain Trust discloses how an investigation into the mysterious deaths in a group of cannibals in a remote part of the world evolved into a research program in the United States that may have had unforeseen and frightening consequences. The shocking questions examined include: ? Have millions of Americans already been exposed to the prions known to cause Mad Cow Disease through years of eating tainted beef? ? Does the epidemic of prion disease spreading like wildfire through the nation's deer and elk pose a threat to hunters and venison eaters? ? Are the cattle mutilations discovered in the last 30 years part of a covert, illegal sampling program designed to learn how far the deadly prions have spread throughout the nation's livestock and beef products? Exposing the devastating truth about Mad Cow Disease and a new theory of the possible consequences of a little-known government research program and the potential national health catastrophe that may be the result, Brain Trust inoculates Americans with an effective cure: the truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AGAhAtI3kJEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations","description":"A multidisciplinary study of trust.

In Questions and Answers on Conversations with God, Neale, with characteristic wit and wisdom, responds to the most compelling and provocative of these letters; and the result is a book that is profoundly enlightening and inspiring. By relating the messages in the dialogues of CWG to the personal issues and everyday experience of individuals, Neale's answers illustrate the direct link between spiritual and physical reality, clearly demonstrating how what we do and who we are in our lives is a result of how we think and what we believe. This book gives us all the opportunity to look at ourselves, to change ourselves, and thus, perhaps, to change the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pocm1OY3A-0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buccaneers (Everyman)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Growth in holiness, or, The progress of the spiritual life","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

His analysis demonstrates the social intent of every reading and shows the influence of communicative context in such diverse readings of the Bible as Rudolf Bultmann's, the peasants of Solentiname, the Negro spirituals, and black-church sermons. Then Blount turns to Mark's account of the trial of Jesus, where he shows how this hermeneutical scheme helps to assess the emergence and validity of multiple readings of the text and the figure of Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_SNLAwAAQBAJ&dq=Cultural+Interpretation+(Reorienting+New+Testament+criticism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mitzvot: The Commandments and Their Rationale","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Accept No Mediocre Life: Living Beyond Labels, Libels, and Limitations","description":"Author, trainer, pastor, and radio talk show host David Foster urges readers to rip off the labels, libels, and limitations people have stuck on them and commit to a lifelong pursuit of excellence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2OpLhn-Ho7YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speaking Out","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Midnight Shadow (Zebra Historical Romance)","description":"Accepting a governess position at the Tremayne estate after her father's death leaves her penniless, Lucy Grey finds her new employer to be a sensual, brooding man who is tormented by tragic secrets.

Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, 'The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm' makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezs?. From 'The Frog King' to 'The Golden Key, ' wondrous worlds unfold--heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique--they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms' later, more embellished collections of tales.

In it, Wendell Berry argues that good farming is a cultural and spiritual discipline. Today s agribusiness, however, takes farming out of its cultural context and away from families. As a result, we as a nation are more estranged from the land from the intimate knowledge, love, and care of it. Sadly, his arguments and observations are more relevant than ever.

Leading Lutheran scholar Robert Kolb highlights Luther's use of storytelling in his preaching and teaching to show how Scripture undergirded Luther's approach to spiritual formation.

Like the governess, the figure of the needlewoman is ubiquitous in art, fiction and journalism in the nineteenth century. The fifteen articles in this book address the seamstress's appearance as a 'real' figure in the changing economies of nineteenth-century Britain, America, and France, and as an important cultural icon in the art and literature of the period. They treat the many different types of needlewomen in the nineteenth century-from skilled milliners and dressmakers, some of whom owned their own businesses selling merchandise to other women (forming a unique 'female economy') to women who, through reduced circumstances, were forced into the lowest end of paid needlework, sewing clothing at home for starvation wages-like the impoverished shirt-maker in the famous Victorian poem by Thomas Hood, 'The Song of the Shirt.' This volume assembles the work of leading American, British and Canadian scholars from many different fields, including art history, literary criticism, gender studies, labor history, business history, and economic history to draw together recent scholarship on needlewomen from a variety of different disciplines and methodologies. Famine and Fashion will therefore appeal to anyone studying images of work in the nineteenth century, popular and canonical nineteenth-century literature, the history of women's work, the history of sweated labor, the origins of the ready-made clothing industry and early feminism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=23VBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nevermen","description":"The greatest heroes who never existed are back!

Lies at the Altar is for couples who are planning marriage, are newly married, or who have been married for years. In Lies at the Altar: The Truth About Great Marriages, Dr. Robin Smith addresses the unspoken needs, unasked questions, outrageous expectations, and hidden agendas that often linger beneath the surface of the wedding vows and appear later to cause power struggles, suffering, and feelings of hopelessness in marriages. Dr. Smith discusses why it's important to have one's \\"eyes wide open\\" in a marriage; how to write true vows to live by; and why it's never too late to rewrite your vows. She illustrates her advice with detailed stories from her own life, as well as from couples that she has counseled. And in her inspiring conclusion, she invites couples to light up their lives by acknowledging each other as individuals, each of whom lights a candle, and who lights a third candle which represents \\"us\\".

Can we choose who to love? Is romantic love rational? Can we love more than one person at a time? And can we make ourselves fall out of love? In On Romantic Love, Berit Brogaard attempts to get to the bottom of love's many contradictions. This short book, informed by both historical and cutting edge philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, combines a new theory of romantic love with entertaining anecdotes from real life and accessible explanations of the neuroscience underlying our wildest passions. Against the grain, Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all. And love isn't even always something we consciously feel. However, love -- like other emotions, both conscious and not -- is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice. This engaging and innovative look at a universal topic, featuring original line drawings by illustrator Gareth Southwell, illuminates the processes behind heartbreak, obsession, jealousy, attachment, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEiPBQAAQBAJ&dq=Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolverine Is Eating My Leg","description":"Cahill is great!

In Gentling the Bull she offers an insightful explanation of the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures, showing how they are a metaphor of both one's Zen training and spiritual journey. The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures, also known as the Ten Bull Pictures, are believed to have been drawn by Kakuan, a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master, but became widely used as a means of Zen study in fifteenth-century Japan. They are used in formal Zen training to this day to show the stages of one's realization of enlightenment. Each of the ten pictures is presented here with a preface and general foreword to the series by Chi-Yuan, a monk in the direct line of Kakuan. Myokyo-ni provides a lucid introduction that sets the pictures in their historical context and shows their relevance to modern Zen training. In her own comments on each picture, she discusses how they are representative of our own search for \\"oneness\\"spiritual fulfillment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zboKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Gentling+the+Bull:+The+Ten+Bull+Pictures:+A+Spiritual+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun Run and Other Oxymorons: Singular Reflections of an Englishman Abroad","description":"Why is it that a man with a vacuum cleaner just has to discover exactly what it is capable of sucking up?

He celebrates simplicity, and lacerates pomposity. Among his many topics are consultants, cappuccinos, karaoke, therapy, apostrophes, dogs and golf. In his own words, 'If anything holds these observations together it is that I like people but not in herds. I distrust all beliefs, most thought and anything ending in ism. Most opinion is emotion in fancy dress.'

By following her program parents have seen their children's arguing, tantrums, and disobedience come to an end. In THE BRAT STOPS HERE, Dr. Jacobsen comprehensively outlines her program for giving parents the essential tools they need to set limits and expectations and follow through with their kids when they cross the line. The key to Dr. Jacobsen's program is the Privileges On/Privileges Off approach. When a child does not comply with the rules of the house (which are carefully explained to the child in an age appropriate manner), he or she loses all privileges and must earn them back by apologizing, acknowledging what they would do differently, doing what was asked of them in the first place, and performing an additional chore. Following this approach consistently over the course of five weeks will have a dramatic effect on the household--including reducing tension in the interaction between parents and children, developing skills that will help children get along better at home and at school, and laying the foundation for children to become self-sufficient, responsible adults.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ShcEGnu34sgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Path of the Kabbalah (Patterns of World Spirituality/Paths)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The PR Styleguide: Formats for Public Relations Practice (Wadsworth Series in Mass Communication & Journalism)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bats","description":"When Kevin Boland, a fourteen-year-old baseball player, catches mononucleosis, he discovers that keeping a journal and experimenting with poetry not only helps fill the time, it also helps him deal with life, love, and loss.

The same is true when you think of the top American restaurants:Gotham has been one of our most cherished culinary institutions for two decades. Led by executive chef and co-owner Alfred Portale, Gotham has been honored with four consecutive New York Times three-star reviews and has resided among the Zagat Survey's top five New York City restaurants for more than ten years. Known for Portale's defining modern American cooking, impeccable service, and soaring space, Gotham was recently named \\"Most Outstanding Restaurant\\" in the nation by the James Beard Foundation. But what does Portale cook when he's not working? In Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures, one of our most accomplished chefs invites you to taste the sublime and surprisingly easy-to-prepare, restaurant-quality dishes he serves to friends and family at home. The 125 recipes include home versions of Gotham classics as well as new recipes straight from Portale's home kitchen. They're all simple enough for any home cook, and spectacular enough to impress anyone who tastes them. At the center of Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures are elemental main courses such as Roast Cod with a New England Chowder Sauce, Filet Mignon with Madeira Sauce, and Saut ed Chicken Breasts with Button Mushrooms and Sage. Pick one, then build a meal by pairing it with recipes from the chapters of salads, starters, and small plates; soups, sandwiches, and pizzas; pasta and risotto; side dishes; and desserts. Along with the recipes, Portale offers pairing suggestions for building a menu, variations for adapting recipes according to season and personal taste, and flavor-building instructions on how to accent a dish with extravagant extras such as caviar or everyday additions such as flavored oils. In other words, home cooks will learn how to add a Gotham-inspired twist to their own favorite recipes. The supermarket-friendly dishes include modern classics such as Spicy Shrimp Salad with Mango, Avocado, and Lime Vinaigrette; Pumpkin and Caramelized Onion Soup with Gruy re and Sage; and Saut ed Spinach with Garlic, Ginger, and Sesame Oil. Alfred helps you transform everything from ordinary weekday lunches to Saturday night dinner parties into anything but ordinary. Of course, no meal is complete without dessert, and Portale delivers sweet and sophisticated send-offs, including Lime Meringue Tarts, a simple Summer Plum Pudding, and an elegant Chocolate-Grand Marnier Cake. Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures -- nothing could be simpler or more pleasurable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o5qQ6_TYYhoC&dq=Alfred+Portale+Simple+Pleasures+:+Home+Cooking+from+the+Gotham+Bar+and+Grill%27s+Acclaimed+Chef&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operators and things: The inner life of a schizophrenic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=46ULAQAAIAAJ&dq=Operators+and+things:+The+inner+life+of+a+schizophrenic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Embroidery","description":"Step-by-step instructions detail over one hundred embroidery stitches used in projects such as a baby's bib and a paisley shawl","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s44AAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Embroidery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tassajara Bread Book","description":"The Tassajara Bread Book has been a favorite among renowned chefs and novice bakers alike for more than thirty years.

Jack Kornfield, author of After the Ecstasy, the Laundry A week with the Trappist monks of Gethsemani Abbey in Kentucky left Norman Fischer feeling inspired by the uplifting, soaring verses chanted each day, but also astonished by the violence, passion, and bitterness expressed. This experience started him on a journey through Eastern and Western spirituality and his own Jewish roots toward these moving and intimate translations of the Psalms. In ninety-three poems of praise, celebration, suffering, and lamentation, Opening to You brings the Psalms alive, conveying their beauty and power in accessible English for today s readers of every spiritual path or religious background and transforming the sacred songs into the timeless music of enlightenment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9o1PEAAAQBAJ&dq=Opening+to+You:+Zen-Inspired+Translations+of+the+Psalms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wow The Dow!: The Complete Guide To Teaching Your Kids How To Invest In The Stock Market","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Giant Bones","description":"A study of the substantial evidence for a former race of giants in North America and its 150-year suppression by the Smithsonian Institution ? Shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been found, particularly in the Mississippi Valley, as well as the ruins of the giants  cities ? Explores 400 years of giant finds, including newspaper articles, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports ? Reveals the Stonehenge-era megalithic burial complex on Catalina Island with over 4,000 giant skeletons, including kings more than 9 feet tall ? Includes more than 100 rare photographs and illustrations of the lost evidence Drawing on 400 years of newspaper articles and photos, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports, Richard J. Dewhurst reveals not only that North America was once ruled by an advanced race of giants but also that the Smithsonian has been actively suppressing the physical evidence for nearly 150 years. He shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been unearthed at Mound Builder sites across the continent, only to disappear from the historical record. He examines other concealed giant discoveries, such as the giant mummies found in Spirit Cave, Nevada, wrapped in fine textiles and dating to 8000 BCE; the hundreds of red-haired bog mummies found at sinkhole  cenotes  on the west coast of Florida and dating to 7500 BCE; and the ruins of the giants  cities with populations in excess of 100,000 in Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Louisiana. Dewhurst shows how this suppression began shortly after the Civil War and transformed into an outright cover-up in 1879 when Major John Wesley Powell was appointed Smithsonian director, launching a strict pro-evolution, pro-Manifest Destiny agenda. He also reveals the 1920s  discovery on Catalina Island of a megalithic burial complex with 6,000 years of continuous burials and over 4,000 skeletons, including a succession of kings and queens, some more than 9 feet tall--the evidence for which is hidden in the restricted-access evidence rooms at the Smithsonian.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8FgoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carta Corregida a Mi Futura Ex Mujer (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OaxPW6Z02EkC&dq=Carta+Corregida+a+Mi+Futura+Ex+Mujer+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruth","description":"A reasonably priced, quality black hardcover pew and ministry Bible featuring a large 12-point font.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbQ4MAEACAAJ&dq=Ruth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The West of Wild Bill Hickok","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Egomaniac: Tales of an Unread, Unsaid, Unsung Loser","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PQxaMgAACAAJ&dq=Egomaniac:+Tales+of+an+Unread,+Unsaid,+Unsung+Loser&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Diapers for Baby ([bargin book[)","description":"Lists mail-order companies with discounted prices, featuring clothing, furniture, toys, and safety devices","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xaze7-90n6sC&dq=No+Diapers+for+Baby+(%5Bbargin+book%5B)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children's Jewish Holiday Kitchen: 70 Ways to Have Fun with Your Kids and Make Your Family's Celebrations Special","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"American wildlife & plants,: A guide to wildlife food habits; the use of trees, shrubs, weeds, and herbs by birds and mammals of the United States","description":"A richly illustrated survey of the wildlife of North America brings together four hundred full-color photographs of the animals in their natural habitats with a critical study of the habitats, characteristics, life cycles, behavior, and status of native creatures throughout the continent.

Even so, through the mid-1900s, ghostly stories of grizzly sightings continued to haunt remote corners of the dark-timbered San Juan Mountains in the southern-most part of the state. Then, one spooky September evening in 1979, a flesh-and-blood Grizzly sow was surprised on its daybed in the South San Juans by a bowhunter ... and the rest, as they say, is history. Or is it? As author and veteran outdoorsman David Petersen takes us along on his quest for evidence of \\"the next 'last' Colorado grizzly,\\" we find ourselves enjoying a masterful mystery unfolding, character by adventure, page by riveting page.

Such fragments lose their diversity over time and, in the case of redwoods, may even lose the ability to grow new, giant trees. The Redwood Forest, written in support of Save-the-Redwood League's master plan, provides scientific guidance for saving the redwood forest by bringing together in a single volume the latest insights from conservation biology along with new information from data-gathering techniques such as GIS and remote sensing. It presents the most current findings on the geologic and cultural history, natural history, ecology, management, and conservation of the flora and fauna of the redwood ecosystem. Leading experts -- including Todd Dawson, Bill Libby, John Sawyer, Steve Sillett, Dale Thornburgh, Hartwell Welch, and many others -- offer a comprehensive account of the redwoods ecosystem, with specific chapters examining: the history of the redwood lineage, from the Triassic Period to the present, along with the recent history of redwoods conservation life history, architecture, genetics, environmental relations, and disturbance regimes of redwoods terrestrial flora and fauna, communities, and ecosystems aquatic ecosystems landscape-scale conservation planning management alternatives relating to forestry, restoration, and recreation. The Redwood Forest offers a case study for ecosystem-level conservation and gives conservation organizations the information, technical tools, and broad perspective they need to evaluate redwood sites and landscapes for conservation. It contains the latest information from ground-breaking research on such topics as redwood canopy communities, the role of fog in sustaining redwood forests, and the function of redwood burls. It also presents sobering lessons from current research on the effects of forestry activities on the sensitive faunas of redwood forests and streams. The key to perpetuating the redwood forest is understanding how it functions; this book represents an important step in establishing such an understanding. It presents a significant body of knowledge in a single volume, and will be a vital resource for conservation scientists, land use planners, policymakers, and anyone involved with conservation of redwoods and other forests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kAMreeXpmIEC&dq=The+Redwood+Forest:+History,+Ecology+and+Conservation+of+the+Coast+Redwoods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Gorgeous: The Truth about Body and Beauty","description":"Emphasizes that every body type is normal and beautiful, and dispels many of the myths about physical beauty","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9EqGPwAACAAJ&dq=Real+Gorgeous:+The+Truth+about+Body+and+Beauty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wine Tasting","description":"This vastly expanded new edition to the most simple, concise and elegant way to hit the ground running and learn about wine tasting.

In 1937 Sirk left Germany, after a successful career in theatre and film, and came to Hollywood. From 1942 to 1958 he directed some 30 films, the most famous of which were a series of lush melodramas in the '50s, which were seen at the time as vehicles for stars such as Rock Hudson and Lana Turner. These films are now seen as perceptive dissections of the repressive conventions underlying American life, revealing a disintegrating society - a society of pretence and illusion, befogged by alcohol. Sirk's films are many-layered, the style transcending the melodrama and transforming the material into works of art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tUHchXsZ0h8C&dq=Sirk+on+Sirk+(Directors+on+Directors)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HOUSE OF THE FOUR WINDS.","description":"Mercedes Lackey is the New York Times bestselling author of the Valdemar series and romantic fantasies like Beauty and the Werewolf and The Fairy Godmother.

In this collection of sixteen stories, he explores such wide-ranging contemporary themes as galvanism, time travel and resurrection of the dead. 'The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfall' relates a man's balloon journey to the moon with a combination of scientific precision and astonishing fantasy. Elsewhere, the boundaries between horror and science are elegantly blurred in stories such as 'The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar', while the great essay 'Eureka' outlines Poe's own interpretation of the universe. Powerfully influential on later authors including Jules Verne, these works are essential reading for anyone wishing to trace the genealogy of science fiction, or to understand the complexity of Poe's own creative vision","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tq8rcQQItSIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thierry Mugler: Fashion Fetish Fantasy","description":"A collection of works by the legendary fashion photographer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BJ0NAAAACAAJ&dq=Thierry+Mugler:+Fashion+Fetish+Fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coming of the King James Gospels","description":"The Coming of the King James Gospels is a primary publication exploring the handwritten annotations of the Oxford New Testament Company, made as members completed Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Their original edited pages, gathered into one binding as the Bodleian Bishops' Bible ([1602] b.1), offer us the only known surviving record of their monumental work. Ward Allen's painstakingly produced collation of this Bishops' Bible is available for the first time in accessible visual layout. It allows a reader to study simultaneously the three texts, that of the original Bishops' Bible, the revisions suggested for the 1602 text, and the final King James version of the Gospels. The Coming of the King James Gospels, with Ed Jacobs's analysis of the revisions in the Bishops' Bible, makes it possible to trace the progress through the three distinct stages of the translators' work. Rejected readings reveal the reasoning which led to the wording of the final text. Beautifully produced, The Coming of the King James Gospels is now a prime resource for all students of the Bible and the English language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oi-ae6z2j8sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experiencing architecture (M.I.T. Press paperback)","description":"A classic examination of superb design through the centuries. Widely regarded as a classic in the field, Experiencing Architecture explores the history and promise of good design. Generously illustrated with historical examples of designing excellence ranging from teacups, riding boots, and golf balls to the villas of Palladio and the fish-feeding pavilion of Beijing's Winter Palace Rasmussen's accessible guide invites us to appreciate architecture not only as a profession, but as an art that shapes everyday experience. In the past, Rasmussen argues, architecture was not just an individual pursuit, but a community undertaking. Dwellings were built with a natural feeling for place, materials and use, resulting in  a remarkably suitable comeliness.  While we cannot return to a former age, Rasmussen notes, we can still design spaces that are beautiful and useful by seeking to understand architecture as an art form that must be experienced. An understanding of good design comes not only from one's professional experience of architecture as an abstract, individual pursuit, but also from one's shared, everyday experience of architecture in real time its particular use of light, color, shape, scale, texture, rhythm and sound. Experiencing Architecture reminds us of what good architectural design has accomplished over time, what it can accomplish still, and why it is worth pursuing. Wide-ranging and approachable, it is for anyone who has ever wondered  what instrument the architect plays on.

Senator Ben Sasse warns the nation about the existential threat to America's future. Raised by well-meaning but overprotective parents and coddled by well-meaning but misbegotten government programs, America's youth are ill-equipped to survive in our highly-competitive global economy. Many of the coming-of-age rituals that have defined the American experience since the Founding: learning the value of working with your hands, leaving home to start a family, becoming economically self-reliant are being delayed or skipped altogether. The statistics are daunting: 30% of college students drop out after the first year, and only 4 in 10 graduate. One in three 18-to-34 year-olds live with their parents. From these disparate phenomena: Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse who as president of a Midwestern college observed the trials of this generation up close, sees an existential threat to the American way of life. In The Vanishing American Adult, Sasse diagnoses the causes of a generation that can't grow up and offers a path for raising children to become active and engaged citizens. He identifies core formative experiences that all young people should pursue: hard work to appreciate the benefits of labor, travel to understand deprivation and want, the power of reading, the importance of nurturing your body and explains how parents can encourage them. Our democracy depends on responsible, contributing adults to function properly without them America falls prey to populist demagogues. A call to arms, The Vanishing American Adult will ignite a much-needed debate about the link between the way we're raising our children and the future of our country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0FVFDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cultures of the Jews: A New History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KIG8DAEACAAJ&dq=Cultures+of+the+Jews:+A+New+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to the meaning and structure of physics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Barbie: A Dancer's Dream (Fun Works Shimmer Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Corrie Ten Boom: Heroine of Harlem (Heroes of the Faith)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Courage to Lead: Leadership in the African American Urban Church","description":"This book focuses on pastoral and lay leadership in the African American church.

When Dickens died on June 9, 1870, he was halfway through writing his last book, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Since that time, hundreds of academics, fans, authors, and playwrights have presented their own conclusion to this literary puzzler. Step into 150 years of Dickensian speculation to see how our attitudes both to Dickens and his mystifying last work have developed. At first, enterprising authors tried to cash in on an opportunity to finish Dickens  book. Dogged attempts of early twentieth-century detectives proved Drood to be the greatest mystery of all time. Earnest academics of the mid-century reinvented Dickens as a modernist writer. Today, the glorious irreverence of modern bibliophiles reveals just how far people will go in their quest to find an ending worthy of Dickens. Whether you are a die-hard Drood fan or new to the controversy, Dickens scholar Pete Orford guides readers through the tangled web of theories and counter-theories surrounding this great literary riddle. From novels to websites; musicals to public trials; and academic tomes to erotic fiction, one thing is certain: there is no end to the inventiveness with which we redefine Dickens  final story, and its enduring mystery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bMWIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gift of Nothing","description":"Mooch the cat tries to think of a gift to give his friend Earl the dog.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6JYungEACAAJ&dq=The+Gift+of+Nothing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las ideas polticas en Argentina (Spanish Edition)","description":"In Redeemers, acclaimed historian Enrique Krauze presents the major ideas that have formed the modern Latin American political mind during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries and looks closely at how these ideas were expressed in the lives of influential revolutionaries, thinkers, poets, and novelists.

In his brilliant, deeply researched history, Enrique Krauze uses the range of these extraordinary lives to illuminate the struggle that has defined Latin American history: an ever-precarious balance between the ideal of democracy and the temptation of political messianism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IG7wXENVfkwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snakes in the Cockpit: Images of Military Aviation Disasters","description":"A collection of declassified photographs of military aviation accidents from World War II to the present day including ditchings, gear-up landings, fires, and engine explosions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zvXUwAEACAAJ&dq=Snakes+in+the+Cockpit:+Images+of+Military+Aviation+Disasters&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},I={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const D=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-bbea5c82"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/53.md","filePath":"drive/53.md"}'),W={name:"drive/53.md"},H=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(D)]))}});export{x as __pageData,H as default};
