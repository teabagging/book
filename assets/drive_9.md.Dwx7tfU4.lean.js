One Rainy Night is a spine-chilling horror novel from the highly acclaimed Richard Laymon, perfect for fans of Dean Koontz and Clive Barker. 'Laymon is unique. A phenomenon. A genius of the grisly and the grotesque' - Joe Citro, The Blood Review The strange black rain falls like a shroud on the small town of Bixby. It comes down in torrents, warm and unnatural. And as it falls, the town changes. One by one, the inhabitants fall prey to its horrifying effect. One by one, they become filled with hate and rage... and the need to kill. Formerly friendly neighbours turn to crazed maniacs. A stranger at a gas station shoves a nozzle down a customer's throat and pulls the trigger. A soaking-wet line of movie-goers smashes its way into the theatre to slaughter the people inside. A loving wife attacks her husband, still beating his head against the floor long after he's dead. As the rain falls, blood flows in the gutters - and terror runs through the streets. What readers are saying about One Rainy Night: 'The action does not stop for a second, dragging you brutally along at a breakneck pace. Do not start this book unless you have time to finish it NOW, you will not want to put it down!' 'Laymon throws in a collection of colourful characters that are brought to vivid life with their individual, loveable and instantly identifiable traits' 'The novel lasts for a total of 410 blood soaked pages, of which all 410 of these will keep your heart racing, as you sit there perched on the edge of your seat'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i_Xh0W8FVoUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Famous Guitar Intros (Riff Notes)","description":"You've started learning the guitar---what's the first thing you want to play?

His had little to do with his job, his marriage, or any nostalgic ponderings of lost youth. Instead, he questioned the very basis of life itself, of why we were all here, were dreams--his dreams--real, and did humanity dream itself a mass dream? Perhaps most important of all, he wondered who or what beckoned him ever deeper into the surreal world of conscious dreams . . . Unable to draw a clear line between reality and the imagined, Daniel awakens in the middle of a nocturnal roadtrip, meets up with the mysterious and precocious teenage Maggie-Leigh, and is taught life lessons he considers fantasy. His journey takes him beyond the edges of reality, upsetting the very foundations of life as he knew it. What he finds forever changes how he will live, think, and act--and even how life itself will continue to operate. And this is only the beginning. \\"If ever there was a truly suspenseful, real-yet-mysterious-and-complicated account of the known and unknown, psychic and psychological ingredients of our lives, this is it! F. P. Dorchak creates for us a most intriguing, interwoven and provocative account of our lifetime challenges in his Sleepwalkers, and I'm pleased to note this book is just the beginning of his published insights into the great probable mysteries of life, as we seek to explore and understand them.

It is very much more than a demonstration that 'to us it is enough that gravity really does exist and act according to the laws which we have explained and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies and the sea'. It is important to us as a model of all mathematical physics. Representing a decade's work from a distinguished physicist, this is the first comprehensive analysis of Newton's Principia without recourse to secondary sources. Professor Chandrasekhar analyses some 150 propositions which form a direct chain leading to Newton's formulation of his universal law of gravitation. In each case, Newton's proofs are arranged in a linear sequence of equations and arguments, avoiding the need to unravel the necessarily convoluted style of Newton's connected prose. In almost every case, a modern version of the proofs is given to bring into sharp focus the beauty, clarity, and breath-taking economy of Newton's methods. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar is one of the most reknowned scientists of the twentieth century, whose career spanned over 60 years. Born in India, educated at the University of Cambridge in England, he served as Emeritus Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, where he has was based from 1937 until his deathin 1996. His early research into the evolution of stars is now a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983. Later work into gravitational interactions between stars, the properties of fluids, magnetic fields, equilibrium ellipsoids, and black holes has earned him awards throughout the world, including the Gold Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society in London (1953), the National Medal of Science in the United States (1966), and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (1984). His many publications include Radiative transfer (1950), Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability (1961), and The mathematical theory of black holes (1983), each being praised for its breadth and clarity. Newton's Principia for the common reader is the result of Professor Chandrasekhar's profound admiration for a scientist whose work he believed is unsurpassed, and unsurpassable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qfJVNPQVHbsC&dq=Newtons+Principia+for+the+Common+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fly Fishing for Trout","description":"Here is the complete history of angling, as well as a comprehensive guide to every aspect of the sport: advice on tackle and accessories, instructions on casting and fly-tying, tips on locating likely trout spots, and more.

First and foremost among the myths it dispels is the idea that developing concentration is really of no consequence in the practical application of the art of meditation, as some so-called New Age gurus would have people believe.

As we helplessly watched two planes fly into the twin towers of the World Trade Center one after the other, an epic story of self-sacrifice was taking place. AMONG THE HEROES vividly re-creates the story of those passengers who decided to fight the armed hijackers who took control of their plane. September 11 is a tragic day to be remembered, but United 93 is its symbol of hope and courage. NEW YORK TIMES journalist Jere Longman covered the crash minute by minute. In AMONG THE HEROES he reconstructs the story of this flight, profiling the hijackers and the heroes -- Mark Bingham, Thomas Burnett, Jeremy Glick and Todd Beamer. From calls made to their loved ones, we know that these men had been informed of the attacks on the World Trade Center and that they knew they were likely to suffer a similar fate, killing thousands of innocent people in the process. Collating all available material, eyewitness interviews, phone calls and the black box, AMONG THE HEROES is a gripping account of a real life-and-death drama, a story of heroic self-sacrifice and nailbiting decisions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tB7w6ExlmEsC&dq=Among+the+Heroes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Long Way Home","description":"Lion is de indrukwekkende verfilming van Mijn lange weg naar huis, met Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) en Rooney Mara in de hoofdrollen Op een klein station in India is de vijfjarige Saroo zijn broer kwijtgeraakt. Hij klimt in een treinstel om hem te zoeken, maar raakt per ongeluk opgesloten en komt helemaal alleen aan de andere kant van India in Calcutta terecht. Zonder zijn familie en zonder te weten uit welk dorpje hij komt, zwerft hij wekenlang door de straten van de grote stad tot hij wordt opgenomen door een weeshuis. Ook daar weten ze zijn familie niet op te sporen en uiteindelijk wordt Saroo geadopteerd door een Australisch echtpaar bij wie hij gelukkig opgroeit. Als hij bijna dertig is, en de technologie zo veel verder is dan toen, gaat Saroo met behulp van Google Earth op zoek naar het station waar hij al die jaren geleden zijn familie kwijtraakte. Elke avond bekijkt hij urenlang de spoorlijnen die naar Calcutta leiden, tot hij na een jaar dat ene station denkt te herkennen.

The second part (Chapters 3-5) examines the industrialization of slaughter (of both animals and humans) that took place in modern times. The last part of the book (Chapters 6-8) profiles Jewish and German animal advocates on both sides of the Holocaust, including Isaac Bashevis Singer himself.

Much of the bloodshed was along the thousand-mile Texas/Mexico border because these were the years of the Mexican Revolution. Charles Harris III and Louis Sadler shed new light on this turbulent period by uncovering the clandestine role of Mexican President Venustiano Carranza in the border violence. They document two virtually unknown invasions of Texas by Mexican Army troops acting under Carranza's orders. Harris and Sadler suggest the notorious \\"Plan de San Diego,\\" usually portrayed by historians as a plot hatched in South Texas, was actually spawned in Mexico by Carranza. This irredentist conspiracy, which called for the execution of all Anglo males sixteen and older and the establishment of a Hispanic republic, was designed to cause a race war between Hispanics and Anglos. One of Carranza's goals was to end the support being given by border residents to his rival Pancho Villa. The \\"Plan de San Diego\\" caused the governor of Texas to order the Texas Rangers to wipe out the insurgency along the border. This resulted in an estimated 300 Hispanics being killed by the Rangers and others without benefit of judge and jury. The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolutionis the first Ranger history to utilize Mexican government archives and the voluminous declassified FBI records on the Mexican Revolution. \\"There is no other book that focuses on the Texas Rangers in the period 1910-1920. This will be the standard book on the Rangers for this period and probably the most thoroughly researched book on the Rangers in any period.\\"--Alwyn Barr, Professor of History, Texas Tech University \\"Harris and Sadler provide the first definitive evaluation of the Texas Rangers and their activities during the first and most violent decade of the Mexican Revolution, 1910-1920.

Honor, underpinning the legitimacy of Spanish rule and a social hierarchy based on race and class during the colonial era, came to be an important source of resistance by ordinary citizens to repressive action by republican authorities fearful of disorder. Claiming the protection of their civil liberties as guaranteed by the constitution, these &\\"honorable&\\" citizens cited their hard work and respectable conduct in justification of their rights, in this way contributing to the shaping of republican discourse. Prominent politicians from Arequipa, familiar with these arguments made in courtrooms where they served as jurists, promoted at the national level a form of liberalism that emphasized not only discipline but also individual liberties and praise for the honest working man. But the protection of men's public reputations and their patriarchal authority, the author argues, came at the expense of women, who suffered further oppression from increasing public scrutiny of their sexual behavior through the definition of female virtue as private morality, which also justified their exclusion from politics. The advent of political liberalism was thus not associated with greater freedom, social or political, for women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QMgtQk3xiCQC&dq=From+Subjects+to+Citizens:+Honor,+Gender,+and+Politics+in+Arequipa,+Peru+1780-1854&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of a Champion","description":"Jimmy Winter is a born star on the baseball field, and Seth Barnam can only dream of being as talented.

The people Martin Walker has chosen to portray are presidents, industrialists, artists, thinkers, entertainers, soldiers, spies, criminals, and evangelists, among others, and he makes the life of each individual serve as a framework for a discussion of the nation as a whole in a century when it was reinventing itself. Through Theodore Roosevelt, Walker examines America's ambition; through Woodrow Wilson, our idealism; through FDR, our triumph on the world stage; through Richard Nixon, our retreat into cynicism; through Bill Clinton, globalization and controversy about the right way to use America's unprecedented power. In Henry Ford he finds the creator of both the mass-market product and the mass-market consumer, and in Walt Disney, the revolutionizer not only of America's entertainment but also of the world's. William Boeing is the innovator who spurs the behemoth of American aviation; Walter Reuther defines labor's struggles; George C. Marshall represents the spread of America's economic genius in a war-ravaged Europe. In the lives of Duke Ellington, Frank Lloyd Wright, Katharine Hepburn, and John Steinbeck, Walker traces America's far-reaching cultural influences. Babe Ruth leads to a consideration of the role of sports in our society; William F. Buckley, Jr., to a discussion of conservatism; Martin Luther King, Jr., to matters of race; Betty Friedan to the shifting role of women; Billy Graham to an examination of religion; Emma Goldman to minority viewpoints and dissent; Black Jack Pershing to the place of the military; Lucky Luciano to crime and corruption; Albert Einstein to immigration; Richard Bissell to spies and the intelligence network; Alan Greenspan to finance and banking; and Winston Churchill to the American diaspora. At once intimate and wide-ranging, America Reborn is an altogether engrossing work of narrative history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XMD4cgtTJgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Love","description":"\\"She explores how to develop a \\"psychological immune system\\" to protect against the potentially destructive elements in relationships and allow for a constructive expression of love's dark side.

The history of Rome - as a tiny primitive kingdom, as an ever-growing republic, as a world-ruling empire dominating the known world, and finally as the ghost or legend of that empire - stretches back to the early Iron Age. Its history really ends only in the 19th century, when the last Holy Roman Emperor abdicated, and its cultural legacy is ongoing around the world. The first half of the book focuses on the political and military history of Rome. While the broad sweep of Roman history remains unmistakeable and remarkable, it is the story of individuals that has meaning for us. Rome's rulers from Julius Caesar and his nephew Augustus, to Claudius, Nero and the first \\"Christian\\" emperor Constantine the Great became living legends, whose memories lived on so potently that later generations were inspired by their deeds. The assassination of Julius Caesar, Caligula's decision to make his horse a consul, Nero fiddling while Rome burns, the building of Hadrian's Wall and the truth behind these and many other stories are revealed in this account of the rise and ultimate fall of a mighty empire. Every major military campaign and battle is described in detail, from the Punic Wars and Caesar's Conquest of Gaul to the conquest of Britain, Dacia and the East. The second part focuses on Rome's influence on the development of world art, architecture and society. Detailed cross-sections and beautiful drawings of the Colosseum, the Pantheon and other World Heritage buildings reveal Roman techniques and architectural styles. Roman law and Roman philosophy shaped the growth of Western thought. Ancient letters, records, and artworks are used to show how real people lived during one of the cultural peaks of world history. Daily life in ancient Rome is explored in contemporary accounts of sports and games in the arenas, work and play at the baths, the theatre, the forum, and the woman's world of the home. With its magnificent combination of over 1000 full-colour illustrations and an authoritative and absorbing text, this is the perfect history of Rome for any student of history, archaeology or the classical world. It will provide inspiration for anyone planning to visit Italy or other sites in the once-great Roman Empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=muRVMwAACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Roman+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IJ9PzQEACAAJ&dq=Capitol+Scandal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Die For","description":"\\"A seductive page-turner\\" about a murderously ambitious cable-news star by the New York Times-bestselling author of Labor Day (The New York Times Book Review). Local weather reporter Suzanne Maretto craves nothing more than to transcend life at her suburban cable television news station and follow in the footsteps of her idol: Barbara Walters. When she concludes that her unglamorous husband is getting in the way of her dream of stardom, the solution seems obvious: Get rid of him. She seduces a fifteen-year-old admirer, Jimmy, and persuades him to do her dirty work. Mission accomplished, Suzanne takes to the airwaves in her new role as grieving widow, in search of a TV deal. If that means selling Jimmy down the river, she's ready. Maynard's brilliant, funny, and groundbreaking novel--adapted by Gus Van Sant into the cult classic movie of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman--was first published in 1992 before the era of manufactured stardom and the phenomenon of televised murder trials as entertainment. The book still stands as a razor-sharp satire of celebrity-fixated culture and the American obsession with TV--a novel that imagined the phenomenon of reality television before its creation, with alternately bone-chilling and hilarious accuracy. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joyce Maynard including rare photos from the author's personal collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vV9zoAEACAAJ&dq=To+Die+For&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","description":"CliffsQuickReview course guides cover the essentials of your toughest classes.

Met zijn elegante en scherpzinnige verhaal biedt hij een verhelderend, nieuw perspectief op de Russische Revolutie. Waar andere historici zich hebben gericht op de jaren voor en na 1917, toont Figes hoe de revolutie, hoewel die tussen de hongersnood van 1891 en de val van het Sovjetregime in 1991 van vorm veranderde, tijdens die hele eeuw werd gedreven door hetzelfde ideologische vuur. Figes schetst daarbij drie generaties.

These seemingly harmless habits are soft addictions, and they form a powerful net that traps us and prevents us from realizing our dreams. Soft addictions satisfy surface needs but they ignore our deeper needs. They numb feelings and help us avoid anxieties, substituting a superficial high or sense of activity for genuine purpose and fulfilment. In a very real sense, we become hooked on these habitual behaviours. But unlike drugs or alcohol, our soft addictions arrive in the guise of a normal, socially acceptable activity. Judith Wright helps identify the deeper needs behind these addictions and offers a complete, eight-step programme that has been used by hundreds of her students to help them to open up their lives to a greater sense of purpose and happiness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tZgqAAAACAAJ&dq=There+Must+Be+More+Than+This:+Finding+More+Life,+Love+and+Meaning+by+Overcoming+Your+Soft+Addictions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in Turkey and Russia,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=keRCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Adventures+in+Turkey+and+Russia,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happiness Hill","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ValIYgEACAAJ&dq=Happiness+Hill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Square Mile","description":"\\"Museum of Brisbane is proud to present this inaugural social history exhibition Bite the Blue Sky: Brisbane Beginnings ...\\"-- P.

The long-awaited Blacklisted by History, based on six years of intensive research, dismantles the myths surrounding Joe McCarthy and his campaign to unmask Communists, Soviet agents, and flagrant loyalty risks working within the U.S. government. Evans s revelations completely overturn our understanding of McCarthy, McCarthyism, and the Cold War. Drawing on primary sources including never-before-published government records and FBI files, as well as recent research gleaned from Soviet archives and intercepted transmissions between Moscow spymasters and their agents in the United States Evans presents irrefutable evidence of a relentless Communist drive to penetrate our government, influence its policies, and steal its secrets. Most shocking of all, he shows that U.S. officials supposedly guarding against this danger not only let it happen but actively covered up the penetration. All of this was precisely as Joe McCarthy contended.Blacklisted by History shows, for instance, that the FBI knew as early as 1942 that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the atomic bomb project, had been identified by Communist leaders as a party member; that high-level U.S. officials were warned that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy almost a decade before the Hiss case became a public scandal; that a cabal of White House, Justice Department, and State Department officials lied about and covered up the Amerasia spy case; and that the State Department had been heavily penetrated by Communists and Soviet agents before McCarthy came on the scene.Evans also shows that practically everything we ve been told about McCarthy is false, including conventional treatment of the famous 1950 speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, that launched the McCarthy era ( I have here in my hand . . . ), the Senate hearings that casually dismissed his charges, the matter of leading McCarthy suspect Owen Lattimore, the Annie Lee Moss case, the Army-McCarthy hearings, and much more. In the end, Senator McCarthy was censured by his colleagues and condemned by the press and historians. But as Evans writes,  The real Joe McCarthy has vanished into the mists of fable and recycled error, so that it takes the equivalent of a dragnet search to find him.  Blacklisted by History provides the first accurate account of what McCarthy did and, more broadly, what happened to America during the Cold War. It is a revealing expos  of the forces that distorted our national policy in that conflict and our understanding of its history since.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vz42rDYmf3wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","description":"Since she bought her rambling old fixer-upper of a house, Jacobia Tiptree has gotten used to finding things broken.

Blatant intervention on the part of the Western powers in the domestic affairs of the eight regional states was a familiar feature from World War II until the British withdrawal in 1971, when it assumed more subtle forms. In addition, the oil shocks of the 1970s, followed closely by the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis, triggered economic dislocations across the globe, as well as political upheaval and the disruption of a long-established security structure. In The Gulf at the Millennium , the most prominent Gulf specialists from both the Western world and the Gulf are brought together to look at this extraordinarily active and influential part of the world. The scholars identify and examine the issues that have the potential to affect future developments in the region, including the rapid demographic changes which are taking place, the relationship of the oil market to political stability and progress, the resurgence of Islam as a political force, the often heavy expenditures on defence, and new geostrategic realities after the end of the Cold War. A dynamic, crucial volume, The Gulf at the Millennium provides an unprecedented view beyond the media hype into what is perhaps the most volatile and controversial region of the world today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=55u4wAEACAAJ&dq=The+Persian+Gulf+at+the+Millennium:+Essays+in+Politics,+Economy,+Security,+and+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welsh corgis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An American Renaissance","description":"This award-winning series is dedicated to making literature and its creators better understood and more accessible to students and interested readers, while satisfying the standards of teachers and scholars.

Using common sense, science, and imagination, authors Doug Swisher and Carl Richards developed a wide array of new patterns that were in sharp contrast to those offerings used by American fly fishermen up to that time. Their radical no-hackle dry fly, in particular, proved to be a more convincing, natural silhouette than anything anglers had ever seen before. With hatch charts covering different regions of the country, and featuring detailed tying instructions for flies that could be used in those regions, all liberally illustrated, the book provided anglers with a new arsenal of deadly fly patterns. Thirty years later, and after more than 200,000 copies of the first edition had been sold, a Thirtieth Anniversary Edition was brought out. Updated and revised by the authors, with new observations on trout behavior as well as detailed instructions on how to keep useful fishing logs, the book also featured detailed appendices on terrestrials, mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies. Not only that, but the new edition included hundreds of color illustrations by the renowned artist and fly-fishing innovator Dave Whitlock. It s hard to imagine how anything could top that. In this new paperback edition of Selective Trout we know that we can t top what s been done previously. But we do know that this deserves to stay in print, because it s the type of book that every fly fisherman should own and read. To add a new twist to this new edition, what we have done is added a new introduction by Doug Swisher (Carl Richards passed away in 2006), plus a new foreword by Nick Lyons, the book publisher who had the foresight to get behind the book in the first place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGeCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speed Mathematics Using the Vedic System","description":"Speed Mathematics using the Vedic system facilitates Mathematics learning.

Although they ceased to exist as an autonomous society within sixty years of the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the Taiacute;no -- skilled agriculturists and navigators and accomplished weavers, potters, and carvers -- developed a complex political, religious, and social system, and made a substantial contribution to the biological, cultural, and linguistic makeup of large areas of the Caribbean.

The impact of evolutionary theory on the religious consciousness of the nineteenth century has commonly been seen in terms of a 'conflict' or 'warfare' between science and theology. Dr. Moore's account begins by discussing the polemical origins and baneful effects of the 'military metaphor', and this leads to a revised view of the controversies based on an analysis of the underlying intellectual struggle to come to terms with Darwin. The middle section of the book distinguishes the 'Darwinism' of Darwin himself amid the main currents of post-Darwinian evolutionary thought, and is followed by chapters which examine the responses to Darwin of twenty-eight Christian controversialists, tracing the philosophical and theological lineage of their views. The paradox that emerges - that Darwin's theory was accepted in substance only by those whose theology was distinctly orthodox theology and of other evolutionary theories with liberal and romantic theological speculation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ppXB4mBY05AC&dq=The+Post-Darwinian+Controversies:+A+Study+of+the+Protestant+Struggle+to+Come+to+Terms+with+Darwin+in+Great+Britain+and+America,+1870-1900&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"30 Days Through the Bible: Understanding the Whole Story of God's Word (The Daily Bible)","description":"Each day's reading in this volume presents a thoughtful, unique look at one portion of God's Word and offers an unfolding picture of the whole story of the Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jcfOngEACAAJ&dq=30+Days+Through+the+Bible:+Understanding+the+Whole+Story+of+God%27s+Word+(The+Daily+Bible)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","description":"The homebrewer's bible everything you need to know to brew beer at home from start to finish, including new recipes, updated charts on hop varieties, secrets to fermentation, beer kit tips, and more from the master of homebrewing The Complete Joy of Homebrewing is the essential guide to understanding and making a full range of beer styles, including ales, lagers, stouts, pilseners, dubbels, tripels, and homerun specialty beers and meads.

His basic thesis is that our perception of the world and our ways of thinking about it are deeply influenced by the structure of the languages we speak. The writings collected in this volume include important papers on the Maya, Hopi, and Shawnee languages, as well as more general reflections on language and meaning. Whorf's ideas about the relation of language and thought have always appealed to a wide audience, but their reception in expert circles has alternated between dismissal and applause. Recently the language sciences have headed in directions that give Whorf's thinking a renewed relevance. Hence this new edition of Whorf's classic work is especially timely. The second edition includes all the writings from the first edition as well as John Carroll's original introduction, a new foreword by Stephen Levinson of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics that puts Whorf's work in historical and contemporary context, and new indexes. In addition, this edition offers Whorf's \\"Yale Report,\\" an important work from Whorf's mature oeuvre.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zZv6AQAAQBAJ&dq=Language,+thought,+and+reality:+Selected+writings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows and Cypress: Southern Ghost Stories","description":"A bewitching convocation of Dixie's most frightening ghost tales From backwaters as dark as a cypress swamp to nooks as mysterious as a musty college library, southerners have conjured spirits and told ghost stories. \\"Shadows and Cypress: Southern Ghost Stories\\" is a Dixie s(r)ance that summons ghost tales from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Collecting more than a dozen stories from each state, this book channels the South's entire panorama of creepy locales into one volume. The limestone caves of Kentucky, the swamps of Louisiana and Florida, the pine hills and hollows of Appalachia, and the plains of Texas -- these are perfect haunts for a host of narratives about visitors from the spirit world. The many cultures that converged in the American South enriched the region's ghost stories. \\"Shadows and Cypress\\" taps African American, French, Hispanic, and Scotch-Irish storytelling traditions to capture the distinctive signatures that each has left on ghostlore.

Mihesuah first examines how American Indigenous women have been perceived and depicted by non-Natives, including scholars, and by themselves. She then illuminates the pervasive impact of colonialism and patriarchal thought on Native women?s traditional tribal roles and on their participation in academia. Mihesuah considers how relations between Indigenous women and men across North America continue to be altered by Christianity and Euro-American ideologies. Sexism and violence against Indigenous women has escalated; economic disparities and intratribal factionalism and ?culturalism? threaten connections among women and with men; and many women suffer from psychological stress because their economic, religious, political, and social positions are devalued. ? In the last section, Mihesuah explores how modern American Indigenous women have empowered themselves tribally, nationally, or academically. Additionally, she examines the overlooked role that Native women played in the Red Power movement as well as some key differences between Native women \\"feminists\\" and \\"activists.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=55ZMaAkOhuQC&dq=Indigenous+American+Women:+Decolonization,+Empowerment,+Activism+(Contemporary+Indigenous+Issues)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in design,","description":"This book represents the emerging efforts of a growing international network of researchers and practitioners to promote the development and uptake of evidence-based pedagogies in higher education, at something a level approaching large-scale impact. By offering a communication venue that attracts and enhances much needed partnerships among practitioners and researchers in pedagogical innovation, we aim to change the conversation and focus on how we work and learn together  i.e. extending the implementation and knowledge of codesign methods. In this first edition of our Research Topic on Active Learning, we highlight two (of the three) types of publications we wish to promote. First are studies aimed at understanding the pedagogical designs developed by practitioners in their own practices by bringing to bear the theoretical lenses developed and tested in the education research community. These types of studies constitute the \\"practice pull\\" that we see as a necessary counterbalance to \\"knowledge push\\" in a more productive pedagogical innovation ecosystem based on research-practitioner partnerships. Second are studies empirically examining the implementations of evidence-based designs in naturalistic settings and under naturalistic conditions. Interestingly, the teams conducting these studies are already exemplars of partnerships between researchers and practitioners who are uniquely positioned as  in-betweens  straddling the two worlds. As a result, these publications represent both the rigours of research and the pragmatism of reflective practice. In forthcoming editions, we will add to this collection a third type of publication -- design profiles. These will present practitioner-developed pedagogical designs at varying levels of abstraction to be held to scrutiny amongst practitioners, instructional designers and researchers alike. We hope by bringing these types of studies together in an open access format that we may contribute to the development of new forms of practitioner-researcher interactions that promote co-design in pedagogical innovation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2rOhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Studies+in+design,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calendar Clocks/With Price Update","description":"This price guide features more than 600 photos of antique clocks with current values, plus collecting tips and historical information that will aid both beginning and veteran clock collectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ed84AQAAIAAJ&dq=Calendar+Clocks/With+Price+Update&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Can Draw Creepy Crawlies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f7bLAQAACAAJ&dq=I+Can+Draw+Creepy+Crawlies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Etruscans, The","description":"If you want to discover the captivating history of the Etruscans, then keep reading... The importance of the Etruscans can be traced back to Rome. The Roman Republic, and later the Roman Empire, was an unusual conqueror because it would absorb and assimilate elements of the cultures it dominated. A standing practice was to allow the defeated to continue practicing their culture and religion so long as they paid their taxes on time. Such a procedure was part of why Christianity would seep into the Roman Empire around the 1st century CE, for example. For the Etruscans, this meant they influenced aspects of Roman civilization, one of the most powerful cultures in the history of the Western world. The word \\"Rome\\" is Etruscan in origin as are the names of its mythological founders \\"Remus\\" and \\"Romulus.\\" Several of the Roman creation myths centered on branches of the Etruscans breaking off to found Rome, and Rome itself used to be a part of Etruscan civilization before it broke away and started to develop its own society. When the Etruscans were absorbed, elements of their culture, language, and religion would seep into Roman practice. Before their assimilation, the Etruscans gifted Rome with much of its political science and technology. Through the Etruscans, the Romans developed monarchy, walls, drainage systems, and the powerful forum. The Etruscans shouldn't only be studied as the influencer of Rome, but it is the connection through which most individuals have heard of their illustrious civilization. Other interesting developments of the Etruscans were their flamboyant fashion, complex political structure, urban planning, and fatalistic religion. As the reader of this volume, check and see where the Etruscans sound similar to the Romans but also interpret what made the Etruscans unique, what rings of assimilation of other cultures like the Greeks, and determine whether it was possible for the Etruscans to avoid their fate against the Romans during the 1st century BCE. In The Etruscans: A Captivating Guide to the Etruscan Civilization of Ancient Italy That Preceded the Roman Republic, you will discover topics such as Politics, Government, and Social Structure How an Individual Lived The Origin of the Etruscans The Etruscan Orientation, c. 600-400 BCE The Roman Conquest, c. 400-20 BCE Mythology and Religion Art and Music The Etruscan Language and Writing Architecture Surviving Text and Literature And much, much more!

In a recent contest, Bob has proved himself a matchless sheepdog, and if he wins the trophy two more times, he ll be seen as equal to the legendary sheepdogs of yore. But Bob has a real rival: Red Wull, with his docked tail and bristling yellow fur, a ferocious creature, just like his diminutive master, Adam McAdam, a lonely Scot, estranged not only from his English neighbors but from his son, David. McAdam just can t stop belittling this strapping young man, all the more so since David began courting Moore s beautiful daughter Maggie. But what McAdam really wants is for his beloved Wullie to wrest the prize from Bob once and for all. The story takes a darker turn when a troubling new threat to the local flocks emerges. A dog has gone rogue, sneaking out at night to feast on the flesh and blood of the sheep he is bound to protect. Again and again, new sheep fall prey to this relentless predator; again and again, he slips away undetected. This master hunter can only be among the boldest and sharpest of dogs . . .

Here the celebrated author and translator Lydia Davis, who first read and loved this exciting story as a child, has rendered the challenging idioms of the original into fluent and graceful English of our day, making this tale of rival dogs and rival families and the shadowy terrain between Good and Bad accessible and appealing to readers of all ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHwoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"dream Games","description":"This engaging study examines sports as both a symbol of American culture and a formative force that shapes American values.

The author, a feminist anthropologist, uses three texts developed out of her research in Taiwan--a piece of fiction, anthropological fieldnotes, and a social science article--to explore some of these criticisms. Each text takes a different perspective, is written in a different style, and has different \\"outcomes,\\" yet all three involve the same fascinating set of events. A young mother began to behave in a decidedly abherrant, perhaps suicidal manner, and opinion in her village was sharply divided over the reason. Was she becoming a shaman, posessed by a god? Was she deranged, in need of physical restraint, drugs, and hospitalization? Or was she being cynically manipulated by her ne'er-do-well husband to elicit sympathy and money from her neighbors? In the end, the woman was taken away from the area to her mother's house. For some villagers, this settled the matter; for others the debate over her behavior was probably never truly resolved. The first text is a short story written shortly after the incident, which occurred almost thrity years ago; the second text is a copy of the fieldnotes collected about the events covered in the short story; the third text is an article published in 1990 in American Ethnologist that analyzes the incident from the author's current perspective. Following each text is a Commentary in which the author discusses such topics as experimental ethnography, polyvocality, authorial presence and control, reflexivity, and some of the differences between fiction and ethnography. The three texts are framed by two chapters in which the author discusses the genereal problems posed by feminist and postmodernist critics of ethnography and presents her personal exploration of these issues in an argument that is strongly self-reflexive and theoretically rigorous. She considers some feminist concerns over colonial research methods and takes issues with the insistence of some feminists tha the topics of ethnographic research be set by those who are studied. The book concludes with a plea for ethnographic responsibility based on a less academic and more practical perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_jTHvVUFC8MC&dq=A+Thrice-Told+Tale:+Feminism,+Postmodernism,+and+Ethnographic+Responsibility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mercedes-Benz W124 Series Sedan Coupe Convertible 1985-1997","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vs1CDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mercedes-Benz+W124+Series+Sedan+Coupe+Convertible+1985-1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","description":"\\"I have known Michael for over twenty years.

Born in central Florida, James grew up on Long Island and received his first pair of skates for his 13th birthday. At 16, James left home to play in Canada, where he was the only black person in junior and, often, in the whole town. While popular for his tough play and winning personality, the teenager faced racist taunts at opposing arenas, and the prejudice continued at all levels of the game. In his two NHL stints, James defined himself as a smart team player and opponent, known for his pugilistic skills. Black Ice is the untold story of a trail-blazing athlete who endured and overcame discrimination to realize his dreams and become an inspiration for future generations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M-rYBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion and Society in Modern Europe (Making of Europe)","description":"In the pre-industrial societies of early modern Europe, religion was a vessel of fundamental importance in making sense of personal and collective social, cultural and spiritual exercises.

With a new foreword by Louis de Berni res, author of Captain Corelli's Mandolin. They joined for their country. They fought for each other. When war breaks out in 1914, Mark Fenner and his Sheffield friends immediately flock to Kitchener's call. Amid waving flags and boozy celebration, the three men - Fen, his best friend Locky and self-assured Frank, rival for the woman Fen loves - enlist as volunteers to take on the Germans and win glory. Through ramshackle training in sodden England and a stint in arid Egypt, rebellious but brave Fen proves himself to be a natural leader, only undermined by on-going friction with Frank. Headed by terse, tough Sergeant Major Bold, this group of young men form steel-strong bonds, and yearn to face the great adventure of the Western Front. Then, on one summer's day in 1916, Fen and his band of brothers are sent to the Somme, and this very ordinary hero discovers what it means to fight for your life.

This work of redemption is the basis by which all the counsels of God are accomplished. All that God does for man, all that He works out on mankind s behalf, has its foundation upon the death of the Son of Man. God will eventually gather all things in heaven and on earth into the raised and glorified Christ. God will be glorified in all that He does, and He has exalted the resurrected Son of Man to His right hand in glory. This is where it begins. When this Man had finished His work, He forever sat down in regards to a completed redemption (Heb. 10:12). From this point, all God s counsels begin to unfold. If the believer will read this book, and ask the Spirit of God to teach you, you will never be the same. All of Scripture will open up to you.

He has from time to time brought his skills to bear upon historical scholarship, most notably perhaps in his book Between Past and Present (1958, 2nd edition, 1973), his interpretive essays in the philosophy of history Philosophy, History and Politics (1976) and his scholarly work concerned with the influence of historical development upon modern Jewish thought, Tradition and Reality (1972). Related to these, and equally works of that philosophical humanity which Professor Rotenstreich embodies, are his Humanism in the Contemporary Era (1963), Spirit and Man: An Essay on Being and Value (1963) and Reflection and Action (1983). Rotenstreich combines both the naturalistic and the phenomenological attitudes in an interesting and illuminating way through the full spectrum of issues in the philosophy of history in this century. Surely he sets boundaries to any doubtful extrapolation. Not only would he bring the understanding of history back from those who claim it as only a positive science but equally would he prevent the transformation of that understanding into merely speculative inquiry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P8sLAqUAek4C&dq=Jewish+history:+An+essay+in+the+philosophy+of+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Magical Arts: Imagination and Magic for the 21st Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ML29GwAACAAJ&dq=Living+Magical+Arts:+Imagination+and+Magic+for+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brownies and other tales","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=114JAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women","description":"The phenomenal impact of The Prayer of Jabez is shown by reports of changed lives, expanded ministries, and spiritual breakthroughs among believers everywhere.

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London in 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character \\"makes a deliberate decision\\" and \\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\\" to achieve fantastic results.

Het is   n van de geheimen van een lang, tevreden en gezond leven, zoals de inwoners van Okinawa het leiden. Op dit Japanse eiland wonen meer gezonde en actieve honderdjarigen dan waar ook ter wereld. Sommige mensen hebben hun ikigai al gevonden, maar velen zijn er nog steeds naar op zoek. De auteurs vertrokken naar Okinawa en interviewden honderden inwoners om te ontdekken wat volgens hen het geheim is voor een optimistisch en gezond leven. Zo is een populaire Japanse uitspraak Hara hachi bu, wat betekent  eet tot je voor tachtig procent vol zit , dat is veel gezonder voor je lichaam. Ook hebben ze een moai, een groep mensen met dezelfde interesses die altijd voor je klaarstaan. En wat ze aanraden: ga nooit met pensioen, maar blijf altijd een doel hebben waarvoor je je bed uit komt. Garc a en Miralles kregen inzicht in wat de Japanners eten, hoe ze bewegen, werken en omgaan met anderen. En hoe het vinden van je ikigai betekenis geeft aan je leven en je laat zien hoe je honderd jaar in topvorm kunt leven. Dit boek helpt je om je eigen ikigai te vinden en vertelt over de Japanse filosofie die zorgt voor een gezond lichaam, geest en ziel.

Should I cut to the chase and reveal pivotal plot points like the one at the end of the book where the little girl on crutches points an accusing finger and shouts, \\"the killer is Mr. Porter\\"? No. I have too much respect for you as an intelligent consumer to attempt such an obvious ruse. But let's not play games here. You clicked your way to this page, so you either: A. Know who I am. B.

Sadly, no, which made it much harder to write. Is it an \\"autobiographical novel\\"? Yes. I am the lead character in the story (coincidentally an actor), and I am a real person, and everything in the book actually happened - except for the stuff that didn't.

Back in print in a newly designed edition, this influential cultural, architectural, and social history of New York is even more popular, selling out its first printing on publication. Rem Koolhaas's celebration and analysis of New York depicts the city as a metaphor for the incredible variety of human behavior. At the end of the nineteenth century, population, information, and technology explosions made Manhattan a laboratory for the invention and testing of a metropolitan lifestyle -- \\"the culture of congestion\\" -- and its architecture. \\"Manhattan,\\" he writes, \\"is the 20th century's Rosetta Stone . . . occupied by architectural mutations (Central Park, the Skyscraper), utopian fragments (Rockefeller Center, the U.N. Building), and irrational phenomena (Radio City Music Hall).\\" Koolhaas interprets and reinterprets the dynamic relationship between architecture and culture in a number of telling episodes of New York's history, including the imposition of the Manhattan grid, the creation of Coney Island, and the development of the skyscraper. Delirious New York is also packed with intriguing and fun facts and illustrated with witty watercolors and quirky archival drawings, photographs, postcards, and maps. The spirit of this visionary investigation of Manhattan equals the energy of the city itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=163oAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FALLACY THE COUNTERFEIT OF ARGUMENT","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oaQXAAAAIAAJ&dq=FALLACY+THE+COUNTERFEIT+OF+ARGUMENT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Catholic Customs and Traditions for Children's Faith Formation","description":"With the same classroom-tested style that made our Big Book of Ideas for Children's Faith Formation so popular, this book shows you step-by-step how to make learning fun for children ages 3 to 8, and beyond.

Iggers traces the basic assumptions upon which historical research and writing have been based, and describes how the newly emerging social sciences transformed historiography following World War II. The discipline's greatest challenge may have come in the last two decades, when postmodern ideas forced a reevaluation of the relationship of historians to their subject and questioned the very possibility of objective history. Iggers sees the contemporary discipline as a hybrid, moving away from a classical, macrohistorical approach toward microhistory, cultural history, and the history of everyday life. The new epilogue, by the author, examines the movement away from postmodernism towards new social science approaches that give greater attention to cultural factors and to the problems of globalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ro1Xmnzv-zMC&dq=Historiography+in+the+Twentieth+Century:+From+Scientific+Objectivity+to+the+Postmodern+Challenge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Fluid Mechanics","description":"ELEMENTARY FLUID MECHANICS BY JOHN K. VENNARD Assistant Professor of Fluid Mechanics New York University. PREFACE: Fluid mechanics is the study under all possible conditions of rest and motion. Its approaches analytical, rational, and mathematical rather than empirical it concerns itself with those basic principles which lead to the solution of numerous diversified problems, and it seeks results which are widely applicable to similar fluid situations and not limited to isolated special cases. Fluid mechanics recognizes no arbitrary boundaries between fields of engineering knowledge but attempts to solve all fluid problems, irrespective of their occurrence or of the characteristics of the fluids involved. This textbook is intended primarily for the beginner who knows the principles of mathematics and mechanics but has had no previous experience with fluid phenomena. The abilities of the average beginner and the tremendous scope of fluid mechanics appear to be in conflict, and the former obviously determine limits beyond which it is not feasible to go these practical limits represent the boundaries of the subject which I have chosen to call elementary fluid mechanics. The apparent conflict between scope of subject and beginner f s ability is only along mathematical lines, however, and the physical ideas of fluid mechanics are well within the reach of the beginner in the field. Holding to the belief that physical concepts are the sine qua non of mechanics, I have sacrificed mathematical rigor and detail in developing physical pictures and in many cases have stated general laws only without numerous exceptions and limitations in order to convey basic ideas such oversimplification is necessary in introducing a new subject to the beginner. Like other courses in mechanics, fluid mechanics must include disciplinary features as well as factual information the beginner must follow theoretical developments, develop imagination in visualizing physical phenomena, and be forced to think his way through problems of theory and application. The text attempts to attain these objectives in the following ways omission of subsidiary conclusions is designed to encourage the student to come to some conclusions by himself application of bare principles to specific problems should develop ingenuity illustrative problems are included to assist in overcoming numerical difficulties and many numerical problems for the student to solve are intended not only to develop ingenuity but to show practical applications as well. Presentation of the subject begins with a discussion of fundamentals, physical properties and fluid statics. Frictionless flow is then discussed to bring out the applications of the principles of conservation of mass and energy, and of impulse-momentum law, to fluid motion.

In this article, the author defines the whole procreation/sexual nexus as one of man, woman, and child, a nexus running through all things at all times from alpha to omega. Author Bio: Christopher Alan Anderson (1950 - ) received the basis of his education from the University of Science and Philosophy, Swannanoa, Waynesboro, Virginia. He resides in the transcendental/romantic tradition, that vein of spiritual creativity of the philosopher and poet. His quest has been to define and express an eternal romantic reality from which a man and a woman could together stand in their difference and create a living universe of procreative love. Mr. Anderson began these writings in 1971. The first writings were published in 1985. On a personal note, when Mr. Anderson was asked to describe the writings and what he felt their message was he responded, \\"Spiritual procreation. Mankind has yet to distinguish the two sexes on the spiritual level. In this failure lies the root of our problems and why we cannot yet touch the eternal together. The message of man and woman balance brings each of us together in love with our eternal other half right now.\\" Keywords: Man and Woman Balance, Relationships, Procreation, Spirituality, Love, Metaphysics, Eternal, Creation, Sexuality, & Soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=etTEjejBpAgC&dq=Man+and+Woman+and+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"South Downs Way (National Trail Guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0U_yPQAACAAJ&dq=South+Downs+Way+(National+Trail+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee and His Army in Confederate History (Civil War America)","description":"Was Robert E.

O Neil, too smart and cynical for the taste of the authorities who are apparently engaged in a massive cover-up, is rapidly removed from the case and quickly fired before justice is done. Frightened but determined, he gets help from an unexpected quarter and is privately commissioned to solve the case. He is faced by opponents of extreme power with an unremittingly evil agenda.

Microscopic fluctuations cause stochastic parameter fluctuations that affect the accuracy of the MOSFET. For analog circuits this determines the trade-off between speed, power, accuracy and yield. Furthermore, due to the down-scaling of device dimensions, transistor mismatch has an increasing impact on digital circuits. The matching properties of MOSFETs are studied at several levels of abstraction: A simple and physics-based model is presented that accurately describes the mismatch in the drain current. The model is illustrated by dimensioning the unit current cell of a current-steering D/A converter. The most commonly used methods to extract the matching properties of a technology are bench-marked with respect to model accuracy, measurement accuracy and speed, and physical contents of the extracted parameters. The physical origins of microscopic fluctuations and how they affect MOSFET operation are investigated. This leads to a refinement of the generally applied 1/area law. In addition, the analysis of simple transistor models highlights the physical mechanisms that dominate the fluctuations in the drain current and transconductance. The impact of process parameters on the matching properties is discussed. The impact of gate line-edge roughness is investigated, which is considered to be one of the roadblocks to the further down-scaling of the MOS transistor. Matching Properties of Deep Sub-Micron MOS Transistors is aimed at device physicists, characterization engineers, technology designers, circuit designers, or anybody else interested in the stochastic properties of the MOSFET.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w0G0lIH2aX0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family Enrichment Trainer's Manueal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPCdtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Family+Enrichment+Trainer%27s+Manueal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Need a Hug","description":"'I need a hug.

Yet this city is rarely mentioned in studies of ethnicity or immigration, and the rich diversity of its population is largely invisible to Las Vegans and visitors alike. Such ignorance can be partly explained by the effects of the city's rapid growth. Las Vegas largely lacks traditional ethnic neighborhoods, and the restaurants and markets that cater to its diverse population groups are mostly hidden away in anonymous strip malls. Nonetheless, a remarkable variety of nationalities and ethnic groups has been drawn here since the city's beginnings in 1905, and today Las Vegas's vital service industry, entrepreneurial opportunities, reasonable cost of living, and appeal as a retirement center attract many more. Recent world events and international currents of immigration have only enhanced this diversity. In The Peoples of Las Vegas, seventeen scholars profile thirteen of the ethnic groups that make up their city's population. kaleidoscope of ethnicity that helps define Las Vegas today and analyzes the economic and social conditions that make Las Vegas so attractive to recent immigrants. The individual contributors--most of whom are members of the groups they write about, and who come from a broad array of disciplines--discuss the motivations and processes of their group's migration to Las Vegas, economic pursuits, institutions and other means of preserving and transmitting their culture, involvement with the broader community, ties with their homelands, and recent demographic trends affecting each group. This collection of essays provides a provocative look into the vibrant ethnic life that lies just beneath the glittering surface of one of America's most unusual cities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P_R5AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Peoples+Of+Las+Vegas:+One+City,+Many+Faces+(Shepperson+Series+in+Nevada+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More William","description":"When Aunt Lucy tells William that 'a busy day is a happy day', William does his best to keep himself very busy indeed.

We are happy to make the book available again after more than a decade of scarcity. J. C. Cleary's translation is as noteworthy for its elegant simplicity as for its accuracy. He has culled from the voluminous writings of Ta Hui Tsung Kao in the Chi Yeuh Lu this selection of letters, sermons, and lectures, some running no longer than a page, which cover a variety of subjects ranging from concern over the illness of a friend's son to the tending of an ox. Ta Hui addresses his remarks mainly to people in lay life and not to his fellow monks. Thus the emphasis throughout is on ways in which those immersed in worldly occupations can nevertheless learn Zen and achieve the liberation promised by the Buddha. These texts, available in English only in this translation, come as a revelation for their lucid thinking and startling wisdom. The translator's essay on Chan (Chinese Zen) Buddhism and his short biography of Ta Hui place the texts in their proper historical perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uNAqEAAAQBAJ&dq=Swampland+Flowers:+The+Letters+and+Lectures+of+Zen+Master+Ta+Hui&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","description":"Trust is a non-negotiable for high performing relationships and organizations.

The evening's newscast began with three negative reports about black men--as rapists, muggers and murderers. The contrast between the black men on the news and the black man she was writing about suddenly seemed enormous. Where were the black men she knew? Stephens wondered. Why were they never featured on the evening news? Never publicly discussed or shown? From these questions, the idea for Men We Cherish was born. Waiting to Exhale and the Million Man March to the contrary, good black men are neither fantasy nor unanswered prayer. In Men We Cherish, thirty African American women celebrate these everyday heroes: fathers and grandfathers, brothers and best friends, sons and husbands. These essays, memoirs, and love letters offer moving portraits of the three-out-of-four black men who never make the headlines. The men in the lives of established black women writers, including Bebe Moore Campbell, Gloria Wade-Gayles, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and the Delany sisters, reflect the diversity, honesty, generosity and depth that is the reality of African American men. With Men We Cherish, Brooke Stephens has created a groundbreaking collection that stands alone in the market as a literary memoir, a social critique, and an affirmation of faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjIE_f5Kph8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"The author chronicles her travels throughout Central America and shares her observations on the hardship of the region","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VZwOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Nothing+to+Declare:+Memoirs+of+a+Woman+Traveling+Alone+(G+K+Hall+Large+Print+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The forged note: A romance of the darker races","description":"Oscar Micheaux's novel The Forged Note: A Romance of the Darker Races was published in 1915.

This illustrated history chronicles how C&NW emerged from a collection of regional carriers to become a strategic link between eastern railroads and the West. Author Tom Murray traces the railroads expansion as it extended secondary lines throughout the Midwest. He also explores C&NWs joint ownership of UP passenger trains and describes how the railroad answered challenges from regional rivals with the \\"400\\" series of passenger trains. As fascinating as the story are the hundreds of accompanying illustrations--historical photographs, archival images, route maps, and period print ads. The result is an entertaining and informative history of an iconic Midwestern railroad--a narrative that spans the decades from the 1850s to the 1990s and takes in steam and diesel motive power, freight and passenger operations, and all the key characters, events, and deals that figured in the Chicago & North Westerns rise and eventual demise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bqmbngEACAAJ&dq=Canadian+Pacific+Railway+(MBI+Railroad+Color+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gestures of Conciliation: Factors Contributing to Successful Olive Branches","description":"Gestures of Conciliation examines the ideas, assumptions and theories that underpin how leaders of parties in intractable conflicts begin and sustain a process of peacemaking by offering to their adversaries 'olive-branches' - in more modern terms symbolic gestures, concessions, tension-reducing moves or confidence-building measures.

Ridd's rivalry with the villainous Carver Doone reaches a dramatic climax that will determine Lorna's future happiness. First published in 1869, Lorna Doone was praised by R. L. Stevenson and Thomas Hardy and has remained constantly in print. The novel has many aspects: it is a romance; a historical novel set at the time of the Monmouth Rebellion in the seventeenth century; and a new development in the pastoral tradition. Underneath an ostensibly idyllic evocation of rural bliss and tale of love and high adventure lies a solid defence of Victorian social values, and a hero whose self-doubt prompts him constantly to prove himself.

Some military interventions explicitly try to transform the domestic institutions of the states they target; others do not, instead attempting only to reverse foreign policies or resolve disputes without trying to reshape the internal landscape of the target state. In Leaders at War, Elizabeth N. Saunders provides a framework for understanding when and why great powers seek to transform foreign institutions and societies through military interventions. She highlights a crucial but often-overlooked factor in international relations: the role of individual leaders. Saunders argues that leaders  threat perceptions specifically, whether they believe that threats ultimately originate from the internal characteristics of other states influence both the decision to intervene and the choice of intervention strategy. These perceptions affect the degree to which leaders use intervention to remake the domestic institutions of target states. Using archival and historical sources, Saunders concentrates on U.S. military interventions during the Cold War, focusing on the presidencies of Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. After demonstrating the importance of leaders in this period, she also explores the theory s applicability to other historical and contemporary settings including the postCold War period and the war in Iraq.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dKN-bKOtWuYC&dq=JFK+and+LBJ:+The+influence+of+personality+upon+politics+(A+Pelican+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Statistics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","description":"This wide-ranging dictionary covers over 2,300 statistical terms in accessible, jargon-free language.

He loses his faith but finds solace at the movies, respite from  the bleak facts of life, his life, gutted by God s withdrawal.  His son, Teddy, becomes a mailman who retreats from American exceptionalism, religious and otherwise, into a life of studied ordinariness. Teddy has a daughter, Esther, who becomes a movie star, an object of worship, an All-American goddess. Her neglected son, Clark, is possessed of a native Christian fervor that brings the story full circle: in the late 1980s he joins a Colorado sect called the Temple, a handful of  God s elect  hastening the day of reckoning. In following the Wilmots  collective search for transcendence, John Updike pulls one wandering thread from the tapestry of the American Century and writes perhaps the greatest of his later novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2fU_tHDyAHgC&dq=Lilies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PLAYBOY - BACK ISSUE - SEPTEMBER 1991 - BARBI TWINS","description":"The Making of a Man Called Maury All about tabloid host Maury Povich who first gained national fame as the host of Fox's TV show A Current Affair.

Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest, but they generally regard the Books of Enoch as noncanonical or noninspired.

But you should know that some people do mathematics all their lives, and create mathematics, just as a composer creates music. Usually, every time a mathematician solves a problem, this gives rise to many oth ers, new and just as beautiful as the one which was solved. Of course, often these problems are quite difficult, and as in other disciplines can be understood only by those who have studied the subject with some depth, and know the subject well. In 1981, Jean Brette, who is responsible for the Mathematics Section of the Palais de la Decouverte (Science Museum) in Paris, invited me to give a conference at the Palais. I had never given such a conference before, to a non-mathematical public. Here was a challenge: could I communicate to such a Saturday afternoon audience what it means to do mathematics, and why one does mathematics? By \\"mathematics\\" I mean pure mathematics. This doesn't mean that pure math is better than other types of math, but I and a number of others do pure mathematics, and it's about them that I am now concerned. Math has a bad reputation, stemming from the most elementary levels. The word is in fact used in many different contexts. First, I had to explain briefly these possible contexts, and the one with which I wanted to deal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n_TxBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","description":"W.E.B.

The IRA is taking advantage of the political turmoil by increasing terrorist attacks on the British mainland such as the Brighton bombing. Immigration is also becoming a major issue as Britain became the haven for social security. A new organization has sprung up,  The National White Front.  Their objective is to bring down the Thatcher government. What better way than to join forces with the IRA.  White Light  is the code name for what is to be the most controversial terrorist attack in the history of Great Britain. The main character, Taylor Armstrong, at forty-three, is going through a midlife crisis, with his marriage seriously in trouble as the result of being a workaholic and his pursuit of power and wealth, believing that money solves everything. He is handsome and has no trouble attracting the opposite sex, sometimes to his detriment. Armstrong is pressing for a main board appointment with his company, Global Inc., a multinational conglomerate, on the acquisition trail. His new assignment takes him to Malaysia to investigate the financials of Global's latest acquisition, ATE, only to find himself in a real-life drama where sex, murder, and drugs are everyday events.

The relationship between areas such as pilot selection, training, flight deck design and safety management is continually emphasised within the book. It also affirms the upside of human factors in aviation - the positive contribution that it can make to the industry - and avoids placing undue emphasis on when the human component fails. The book is divided into four main parts. Part one describes the underpinning science base, with chapters on human information processing, workload, situation awareness, decision making, error and individual differences. Part two of the book looks at the human in the system, containing chapters on pilot selection, simulation and training, stress, fatigue and alcohol, and environmental stressors. Part three takes a closer look at the machine (the aircraft), beginning with an examination of flight deck display design, followed by chapters on aircraft control, flight deck automation, and HCI on the flight deck. Part four completes the volume with a consideration of safety management issues, both on the flight deck and across the airline; the final chapter in this section looks at human factors for incident and accident investigation. The book is written for professionals within the aviation industry, both on the flight deck and elsewhere, for post-graduate students and for researchers working in the area.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YVaoDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Taylor Complete, Volume One","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4459zgEACAAJ&dq=James+Taylor+Complete,+Volume+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Regency Summer (Super Regency, Signet)","description":"A collection of romance tales, each celebrating summer love, features the work of Mary Balogh, Charlotte Louise Dolan, Sandra Heath, Melinda McRae, and Sheila Walsh.

Mitch Rapp was a gifted college athlete without a care in the world and then tragedy struck. Terrorists attacked innocent American citizens, and Rapp s girlfriend was among the murdered. Two hundred and seventy souls perished on that cold December night, and thousands of family and friends were left searching for comfort. Mitch Rapp was one of them, but he was not interested in comfort. Now he wants retribution. Two decades of cutthroat partisan politics have left the CIA and the country in an increasingly vulnerable position. Cold War veteran CIA Operations Director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. America must confront Islamic terrorism with full force. Stansfield directs his prot g e, Irene Kennedy, and his old Cold War colleague, Stan Hurley, to form a new group of clandestine operatives who will work outside the normal chain of command men who do not exist. What type of man is willing to kill for his country without putting on a uniform? Six months of intense training have prepared him to take the war to the enemy s doorstep, and he does so with brutal efficiency. Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the terrorist attack. Rapp then moves on to Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesn't know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions. This is  a bold and brawny tale that never wavers or lets up.

Security is near the top of government and corporate agendas around the globe. Security-related stories appear on the front page everyday. How well though, do any of us truly understand what achieving real security involves? In Beyond Fear, Bruce Schneier invites us to take a critical look at not just the threats to our security, but the ways in which we're encouraged to think about security by law enforcement agencies, businesses of all shapes and sizes, and our national governments and militaries. Schneier believes we all can and should be better security consumers, and that the trade-offs we make in the name of security - in terms of cash outlays, taxes, inconvenience, and diminished freedoms - should be part of an ongoing negotiation in our personal, professional, and civic lives, and the subject of an open and informed national discussion. With a well-deserved reputation for original and sometimes iconoclastic thought, Schneier has a lot to say that is provocative, counter-intuitive, and just plain good sense. He explains in detail, for example, why we need to design security systems that don't just work well, but fail well, and why secrecy on the part of government often undermines security. He also believes, for instance, that national ID cards are an exceptionally bad idea: technically unsound, and even destructive of security. And, contrary to a lot of current nay-sayers, he thinks online shopping is fundamentally safe, and that many of the new airline security measure (though by no means all) are actually quite effective. A skeptic of much that's promised by highly touted technologies like biometrics, Schneier is also a refreshingly positive, problem-solving force in the often self-dramatizing and fear-mongering world of security pundits. Schneier helps the reader to understand the issues at stake, and how to best come to one's own conclusions, including the vast infrastructure we already have in place, and the vaster systems--some useful, others useless or worse--that we're being asked to submit to and pay for. Bruce Schneier is the author of seven books, including Applied Cryptography (which Wired called \\"the one book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published\\") and Secrets and Lies (described in Fortune as \\"startlingly lively...|[a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use.\\"). He is also Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Counterpane Internet Security, Inc., and publishes Crypto-Gram, one of the most widely read newsletters in the field of online security.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=btgLBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dendritic Cells: Biology and Clinical Applications","description":"Dendritic Cells, Second Edition is the new edition of the extremely successful book published in 1998.

He looks at the maelstrom of personalities, agendas, impressions, data, confusion, and contradictions that can be found in the world of the weird, and demonstrates how they have become an integral part of our lives, whether in the form of flying saucers, hauntings, religious revelations, psychic abilities, or dozens of other guises. Gulyas delves into the stories of the people who have attempted to create order out of the chaos. Along the way he recounts his own journey from enthusiastic believer in the \\"shadow government\\" and their underground bases to jaded academic skeptic, and then finally to someone who thinks there might just be something to the paranormal after all... but not what we have been led to expect or believe!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0sW6BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethnic Cuisine: TheFlavor-Principle Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hGEVAAAACAAJ&dq=Ethnic+Cuisine:+TheFlavor-Principle+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring the New Testament, Volume 2: A Guide to the Letters & Revelation (Exploring the Bible)","description":"\\"Professors and students will warm to this clearly written and well-informed introduction to the New Testament Letters and the Apocalypse.

Greeley takes them once again to Ireland for another thrill-packed adventure. Back on the Emerald Isle, Nuala and Dermot soon get the feeling that someone is out to get them. They find themselves dodging multiple explosions, and someone starts shooting at Nuala while she is water-skiing in the cold Atlantic. Meanwhile, the handsome parish priest, Father Jack, has given Dermot the diary of a young Chicago newspaperman. Written in the year 1882, the diary tells in horrendous detail an intriguing story of a mass murder and a trumped-up trial in which one of Ireland's greatest heroes was accused of the murders without a shred of evidence. These two stories, ancient and modern, soon get mixed up, and they make for an utterly fascinating tale of murder, betrayal, and redemption with Nuala and her magical powers at the center of it all. Andrew Greeley not only tells us a riveting tale of adventure and derring-do, he gives us a picture of modern-day prosperous Ireland and the engaging and, of course, sometimes villainous people who live there.

Mary Morris has accomplished this in A Mother s Love, a novel about the solitary moral courage of a woman raising a child alone. Ivy Slovak is a jewelry designer and artist whose days are absorbed by the struggle to make an unreliable paycheck cover the needs of her infant son, and whose nights are broken by the demands of her newborn child. Eager to rejoin the world she sees outside her window, Ivy is haunted by the memory of her mother, who abandoned he when she was seven years old. She recalls the years spent with her loving but itinerant father, wandering the desert hoping somehow to find the troubled, beautiful woman who had left them both. Moving seamlessly between Ivy s colorful past in the gambling towns of the Southwest and her difficult present in New York City, Mary Morris ponders, through Ivy, how we learn to be mothers, and illustrates the resilience of all both men and women who raise children, either on their own or with a mate. With quiet eloquence and deep compassion, A Mother s Love speaks directly to our hearts. At the same time, it takes a serious look at the complex fabric of the American family, and returns Mary Morris to her deserved place as one of the foremost chroniclers of the secrets and strengths of the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9mS2k8bZAqQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aerial Stereo Photographs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d_UAmgEACAAJ&dq=Aerial+Stereo+Photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Future: a Guide To Modern Astrology","description":"This is a new release of the original 1935 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uYV5ngEACAAJ&dq=Your+Future:+a+Guide+To+Modern+Astrology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Open Gate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2UWiBQAAQBAJ&dq=Open+Gate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Popesa: The Controversial Biography of Sister Pascalina, the Most Powerful Woman in Vatican History","description":"De Tweede Wereldoorlog verstoorde in menig opzicht de orde van het aan regels gebonden bestaan van Nederlandse mannelijke en vrouwelijke religieuzen. Desondanks is hun oorlogsbeleving en geschiedenis tot nu toe weinig gethematiseerd.

Ze kregen te maken met bombardementen, confiscatie van eigendommen, inkwartiering van soldaten en tekorten aan levensmiddelen. Tegelijkertijd waren ze binnen  n buiten de kloostermuren actief: ze gaven hulp aan oorlogsslachtoffers, droegen bij aan verschillende vormen van verzet, speelden al dan niet noodgedwongen een rol in interneringskampen en bezochten als legeraalmoezenier slagvelden.

Hello dear book browser and welcome to Peggy and Me, the story of my life since getting a beautiful Shih-Tzu Bichon Frise cross puppy (I call the breed a Shitty Frise - fun) in the form of Peggy. Some of you may be thinking: \\"a book about a dog, how totally brilliant, I need hear no more, I'm sold.\\" In which case we should be best friends and go out to tea together, every day. Others of you may be thinking: \\"a book about a dog, how totally mad, she must have officially lost it.\\" In which case I completely understand. For I once viewed dog owners with much suspicion. The way they obsessively talk about their dogs often using voices for them to reply; the way they have a light covering of dog hair all over their clothes and sofas; and worse, an alarming comfort and ease around excrement. But I now get why people become so mad about their hounds. It wasn't instant love I have to admit. Getting a puppy when I was at a low ebb in my life wasn't easy - there was a lot of challenging, what I call, dog administration (dog-min), and the humiliating first trip to the vet still haunts me. It's been a bumpy old road, but Peggy has been lovingly by my side through some life changing moments and I wouldn't have coped without her.

Voltaire may have cast a jaundiced eye on eighteenth-century Europea place that was definitely not the  best of all possible worlds.  But amid its decadent society, despotic rulers, civil and religious wars, and other ills, Voltaire found a mother lode of comic material. And this is why Peter Constantine s thoughtful translation is such a pleasure, presenting all the book s subtlety and ribald joys precisely as Voltaire had intended. The globe-trotting misadventures of the youthful Candide; his tutor, Dr. Pangloss; Martin, and the exceptionally trouble-prone object of Candide s affections, Cun gonde, as they brave exile, destitution, cannibals, and numerous deprivation, provoke both belly laughs and deep contemplation about the roles of hope and suffering in human life. The transformation of Candide s outlook from panglossian optimism to realism neatly lays out Voltaire s philosophythat even in Utopia, life is less about happiness than survivalbut not before providing us with one of literature s great and rare pleasures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MB0M8x3dqSoC&dq=Candide+and+Philosophical+Letters+(Modern+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Learning Annex Presents Uncluttering Your Space","description":"master the essentials of clutter-busting-in a single evening!

The contributors argue that the figure of the cyborg offers ways of thinking about the relationship between culture and technology, people and machines which disrupt the power of science to enfore the categories through which we think about being human: male and female. Taking inspiration from Donna Haraway's groundbreaking Manifesto for Cyborgs, the articles consider how the cyborg has been used in cultural representation from reproductive technology to sci-fi, and question whether the cyborg is as powerful a symbol as is often claimed. The different sections of the reader explore: * the construction of gender categories through science * the interraction of technoscience and gender in contemporary science fiction film such as Bladerunner and the Alien series * debates around modern reproductive technology such as ultrasound scans and IVF, assessing their benefits and constraints for women * issues relating to artificial intelligence and the internet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xd_cAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imp","description":"Trouble Does Have a Name So how will it happen to you?

She argues that there is a need for institutions to constantly review their mission and aims and objectives in light of the wider economic, political, and socio-cultural and religious development of a society. The book reviews the history of higher education institutions and examines opportunities for some Pakistani universities, to become centres of excellence in the future. This is subject to adequate support from the government, industries, philanthropists and the society at large. In return, these universities would have to cater to the needs of the society, from basic needs in the areas of health and education to science and technology.

Oshry maintains that the next evolutionary challenge for human beings is to recognize ourselves as system creatures, see how system processes shape our experiences, and develop the knowledge and skills to master these processes rather than be victims of them. Drawing on his Power Lab experiences, he reveals the possibilities of systems leadership and how effective leadership can provide the basis for creating sane, healthy, effective social systems. Challenging conventional thinking, Oshry shows the limitations of consensus, the importance of unilateral action, and the restrictions that our values-such as egalitarianism, liberalism, conservatism-can place on power. He reveals how the problems we often believe are personal or peculiar to our system or circumstances are in factsystemic, limiting the possibilities of both individuals and the system as a whole-and he demonstrates what it takes to break out and elevate ourselves and our systems to higher levels of possibility. Perhaps most importantly, Oshry shares his experience in discovering what he calls \\"exhilarating concepts,\\" and shows how these concepts offer unusual insights into the nature of systems, shedding light on everything from organizational dysfunction to the conflicts that occur along lines of race,gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. It is only through this deep knowledge, Oshry says, that system leaders can elevate their systems to those higher levels of possibility to which we aspire. Offering new directions, Leading Systems is essential reading for anyone who wants a deep understanding of how systems work and how to exert enlightened leadership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nNJagw9EfQ0C&dq=Leading+Systems:+Lessons+from+the+Power+Lab&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heinle & Heinle's Complete Guide to the TOEFL Test, CBT Edition","description":"Unlike other dictionaries, The Heinle Picture Dictionary presents new vocabulary in contextualized, thematic readings and high-frequency collocations.

The product of nearly two decades of seminar experience, the book teaches clinicians when it is appropriate to ask \\"Is what I am seeing in this patient typical behavior in his or her culture?\\" The ability to see someone else's worldview is essential for working with ethnic minority and culturally diverse patients, and the author, who designed the course that was this handbook's precursor, has expanded the second edition to take into account shifting demographics and the changing culture of mental health treatment. The content of the new edition has been completely updated, expanded to include new material, and enhanced by innovative features that will prove helpful for mental health clinicians as they encounter diverse patient populations. The new chapter on women reflects the fact that mental health disparities extend beyond ethnic minorities. Women have significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder and affective disorders, for example, yet research on women has been limited largely to the relationship between reproductive functioning and mental health. Two new chapters address the alarming number of unmet mental health needs that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients suffer from. These chapters emphasize the need for mental health providers and policy makers to remedy these disparities. A new chapter has been added to help clinicians determine the role religious and spiritual beliefs play in psychological functioning, because religious and spiritual beliefs have been found to have both positive and negative effects on mental health. The newly introduced DSM-5? Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is addressed in the book's introduction and is included in its entirety, along with an informant module, 12 supplementary modules, and guidelines for their use in a psychiatric assessment. In addition, the reader has access to videotaped examples using simulated patients to illustrate practical application of the DSM-5? Outline for Cultural Formulation and CFI. Extensive information on ethnopsychopharmacology, reviewing clinical reports of ethnic variation with several different classes of psychotropic medications and examining the relationship of pharmacogenetics, ethnicity, and environmental factors to pharmacologic treatment of minorities. The book updates coverage of African American, Asian American, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American/Alaskan Native cultures as they relate to mental health issues while retaining the nuanced approach that was so effective in the first edition. Course-tested and DSM-5? compatible throughout, the Clinical Manual of Cultural Psychiatry is a must-read for clinicians in our diverse era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DXHBBwAAQBAJ&dq=Clinical+Manual+of+Cultural+Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Coaching Track and Field","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=InlwQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Coaching+Track+and+Field&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terrible Tuesday (Executioner No 34)","description":"In Terrible Tuesday, Don Pendleton's phenomenally successful hero Mack Bolan invades California for the second phase of his bloody blitz against the Mafia!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=seJIPgAACAAJ&dq=Terrible+Tuesday+(Executioner+No+34)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Floral Bouquet Quilts From In The Beginning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fiTzPAAACAAJ&dq=Floral+Bouquet+Quilts+From+In+The+Beginning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sciences of the artificial, (Karl Taylor Compton lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x5KMnQEACAAJ&dq=The+sciences+of+the+artificial,+(Karl+Taylor+Compton+lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matter and Mind: Imaginative Participation in Science (Anomalies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0KLwAQAACAAJ&dq=Matter+and+Mind:+Imaginative+Participation+in+Science+(Anomalies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kind of Light That Shines On Texas","description":"In voices that are hip and raunchy, bemused and sardonic, award-winning writer Reginald McKnight conjures a chorus of narratives that reveal the African-American middle class to be a crucible of human experience.

With great clarity and sensitivity, this groundbreaking book from Dr. Evelyn Bassoff, acclaimed psychologist and author of Mothers and Daughters, explains how mothers can remain nurturing presences in their sons' lives throughout their many transitions. She details the important role a father plays in a son's growth, and how mothers can support and celebrate their sons' masculine energy -- whether it manifests itself in a love of playing football or playing piano. Dr. Bassoff also illuminates the varied demands of raising sons for married and single mothers, stepmothers, and mothers of gay sons. Drawing upon the best available research, as well as myths, legends, her experience raising her own son, and the personal stories of clients and friends, Dr. Bassoff offers an invaluable perspective on what mothers can do to insure that their sons become vital, loving men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EEujns6oh_kC&dq=Between+Mothers+and+Sons:+The+Making+of+Vital+and+Loving+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","description":"In 1965, the Minnesota Twins were an endless surprise.

Unmoored in a country that doesn t need him anymore, Gansert takes to the sea, embarking on an adventure that will take him to the ends of the earth and show him the desperate treachery that lies within man s soul. It s been ten years since adventurer George Farnell disappeared after setting out to make his fortune in the frozen wilds of Norway. Two lines of poetry and a shard of rock are all that remain of him, and only Gansert has the wit to understand Farnell s final discovery and the daring to seize it for his own. With a small crew, he sets out for the Arctic Circle to a whaling station in the icy shadows of the mountain known as Blue Ice, where he will make his fortune anew or be destroyed by his own poisonous ambition.

The originals are in the Riccar Art Museum in Tokyo, the world's largest and most celebrated collection of such prints. On account of their rarity and value, 87 of them have been designated Japanese National Treasures or Major National Cultural Heritage Items. The introductory essay, \\"Ukiyo-e - Origins and History\\", by the Curator of the Riccar Art Museum, Mitsunobu Sato, familiarizes the reader with the history of this art form. This is followed by the chapter \\"Cherry - Wood - Blossom\\", in which Thomas Zacharias, Professor at the Munich Academy of Art examines the technique, content and style of Japanese prints and their influence on European art at the turn of the century. The major section of the book consists of the 139 reproductions, grouped by artist, each accompanied by a detailed, sensitive commentary. Street scenes, lovers' trysts, festivals, portraits of courtesans and actors, landscapes and travelogues - these are the motifs of the ukiyo-e print. The dominant theme, however, is woman's beauty, the grace of her posture and attitudes, and the decorative aesthetics of her flowing garments. Amongst the most celebrated of the artists featured here are Utamaro, with his beautiful courtesans and geishas; Sharaku, with his portraits of actors on the kabuki stage; Hokusai, with his landscapes, among them the \\"36 Views of Mount Fuji\\"; and Hiroshige, with his \\"53 Stations on the Tokaido\\" and his \\"100 Views of Famous Places in and around Edo\\".

Richly illustrated and elegantly presented, it provides valuable insights into prevailing social attitudes and values and will fascinate all readers who are interested in the history and culture of medieval Europe. The Labors cycle was most popular during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200-1500). The traditional cycle depicts the year as a round of seasonal activities on the land. Each month has its allotted task, and each of these represents one stage in the never-ending process of providing food for society. The small scenes that made up the cycle were well-known and used widely throughout Europe. They were chosen to decorate both public and private spaces: churches and houses, town fountains, baptismal fonts, as well as books of devotion intended both for priests and for the laity. The cycle was sculpted in stone, carved in wood, painted on glass and on manuscript pages. Examples from such media are described, but most of the illustrations have been taken from manuscripts, primarily Books of Hours. The author has spent the past fifteen years studying calendar after calendar, and one of her great strengths is her ability to see the social reality that lies hidden, even masked, behind the stylized presentation. In the chapter on winter, she shows how the image of this season, dreaded in the Middle Ages, was softened and sweetened by calendar artists to bring it more into harmony with the characteristic mood of the cycle as a whole. For autumn, she reveals how depictions of the harvest of grain, grapes, and livestock hint at a sophisticated market economy. Thematic chapters on children, women, and the hardship of work brilliantly cut through idealized conventions and assumptions to unveil the underlying complexities of life. The Labors cycle and its social context have not hitherto been examined in depth and with the care they deserve. The Medieval Calendar Year is a book worthy of the beautiful and beguiling tradition it describes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BD9mAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Medieval+Calendar+Year&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","description":"A Pack of 100 Flashcards for using with the book English from the Roots Up, vol II","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f16NAAAACAAJ&dq=English+from+the+Roots+Up+Flashcards,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","description":"Superb step-by-step guide enables even beginners to create beautiful lace according to age-old technique.

Commissioned by Oxford University Press in the 1930s, when Auden's own work was at its boldest, the book caught its original publisher off guard. For it is less a collection of humorous verses than a celebration of the popular voice in English, in which the work of great satirists like Swift and Byron keeps company with ballads, chanteys, ditties, nursery rhymes, street calls, bathroom graffiti, epitaphs, folk songs, vaudeville turns, limericks, and blues. Turning away from the post-Romantic cult of the sentimental lyric, Auden features poetry that is clear, enjoyable, and, no matter its age, absolutely modern.

That emotion can be enchantment and fascination, but it can also be loathing, because the opportunism that is the hallmark of the dog family also leads them into conflict with humans. In the developed world at least, the fascination with wild canids doubtless stems from people's captivation with domestic dogs - everybody feels they are an expert on canids! While most people may be familiar with only the better known members of the dog family, such as the grey wolf and the red fox, there are in fact 36 species of wolves, dogs, jackals and foxes. They attract hugely disproportionate interest from academics, conservationists, veterinarians, wildlife managers and the general public. This book brings together in single volume an astonishing synthesis of research done in the last twenty years and is the first truly compendious synthesis on wild canids. Beginning with a complete account of all 36 canid species, there follow six review chapters that emphasise topics most relevant to canid conservation science, including evolution and systematics, behavioural ecology, population genetics, diseases, conflict/control of troublesome species, and conservation tools. Fifteen detailed case studies then delve deeply into the very best species investigations currently available written by all the leading figures in the field. Much of the material is previously unpublished and will make fascinating reading far beyond the confines of canid specialists. These chapters portray the unique attributes of wild canids, their fascinating (and conflictive) relationship with man, and suggestions for future research and conservation measures for the Canidae. While most canid species are widespread and thrive in human dominated landscapes, several are in severe jeopardy; habitat loss, illegal hunting, persecution by farmers and disease all imperil dwindling populations. A final chapter analyses the requirements of, and approaches to, practical conservation, with lessons that go far beyond the dog family. It concentrates particular attention on priorities for the protection of the most threatened canid species, including the red wolf, African wild dog, Ethiopian wolf, Island fox and Darwin's fox. The wild canids provide examples that will thrill the evolutionary biologists and theoretician, enthral the natural historian and challenge the conservationist and wildlife manager. Anybody interested in evolutionary and behavioural biology, in mammals, in the environment, or in conservation will find much that is new and enriching in this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vrgow9ERQeIC&dq=The+Biology+and+Conservation+of+Wild+Canids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick From Scratch Pasta Cookbook","description":"Try a quick version of that old favorite, Macaroni and Cheese, or dig into boldly flavored Baked Ziti with Pesto.

It began with gold that had once belonged to Montezuma. Stolen and cached in a church in Mexico, it was recovered by two army officers who fled north for the French settlements. Along the way one stabbed the other to death. The remaining officer was eventually killed by Plains Indians, but he buried the treasure just before he died. Now Ronan Chantry, a handful of trappers, and an Irish girl whose father was killed after telling her a few vague landmarks are searching for the lost treasure. But they are not alone. The girl's uncle, Rafen Falvey, wants it, too. Like Chantry, he is well educated, bold, and determined. Under different circumstances the two men might have been friends. But in all likelihood it wouldn't have made any difference. When it comes to gold, even friendship doesn't keep men from killing each other. Louis L Amour s Lost Treasures is a project created to release some of the author s more unconventional manuscripts from the family archives. In Louis L Amour s Lost Treasures: Volumes 1, Beau L Amour takes the reader on a guided tour through many of the finished and unfinished short stories, novels, and treatments that his father was never able to publish during his lifetime. L Amour s never-before-seen first novel, No Traveller Returns, faithfully completed for this program, is a voyage into danger and violence on the high seas. These exciting publications will be followed by Louis L Amour s Lost Treasures: Volume 2. Additionally, many beloved classics will be rereleased with an exclusive Lost Treasures postscript featuring previously unpublished material, including outlines, plot notes, and alternate drafts. These postscripts tell the story behind the stories that millions of readers have come to know and cherish.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h7zjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interior Decoration A to Z","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hiPgDwAAQBAJ&dq=Interior+Decoration+A+to+Z&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","description":"The book is an anti-slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe.

Most of us are so busy with routines that we take life for granted. We expect an endless routine of work, a hectic social life each weekend and two weeks  vacation each year. I trust that the readers of this book will derive from it a new interest in life, a zest for doing what needs to be done, and a technique to live with joyous enthusiasm.  Looking at life from an inspired viewpoint you can see those things which are on the side of greatness and cease resisting the petty and the unimportant. Life is a process of intelligence. It always acts intelligently. Problems are the result of living life unintelligently.  The universe is actually a mental system. Its primary nature is the process of ideas becoming form. Every fact in your world is also an idea in your mind. To get new things in your world you must have new ideas in your consciousness. Few people do enough abstract thinking to create new ideas in their minds. They continually think about what they already know and have known for years. This explains the monotony of their lives.  Select the idea of some new experience you want and then think it without ceasing. Mind will deliver to you everything you need in order to accomplish your demonstration. This is far from being impossible. The great, the wise, and the true have proven this to be so. You have done it and so have your friends. You may not have thought of the process as being either spiritual or psychological. You intuitively knew a new idea. Your thinking in terms of this idea caused something to happen in your experience.  This book has been written for that large section of today s population which is spiritually liberal and psychologically aware. Those bound by traditional beliefs will cast it aside. It is my desire that thousands will be helped and healed by reading these pages.

The author boldly faces up to those fundamental questions rankling at the back of one's mind such as: Is there really a God? Where is He? What is the nature of the soul? What is truth? Is reincarnation true? Is there any purpose in the universe? Does God cause suffering? Do angels exist? Who am I? Can effect become cause? Does space and time really exist? etc. He probes deep into the structure of your mind and with great clarity shows you how your mind works and how you can use it to find success in everything you do. He shows how we attract our present circumstances and how emotionally intense events are not only registered in our psychic memory but also in the memories of the cells of our body and what this means for us. He devotes a chapter in which he advocates \\"going within\\" through meditation to find solutions to our problems. Religion is examined with candor. He explains the many positive benefits of religion, examines its dark side and points out that, like individuals, some religions must resolve and get rid of the baggage of past evil deeds before they and their followers can step into the light. The author shows how, in spite of itself science through its quantum theories is currently making discoveries which lead to a new view of the universe more in line with that of the essence of the religions and the experiences of the mystics of this world. He shows how science and religion are at last beginning to merge. For example there is now scientific proof of the value of prayer; proof that the mind is non-local, that is it is not located in the brain and also can cause actions over distance; that there is no solid matter in the universe, it is all energy in one form or another. He further states that a field of energy outside the material universe has been discovered where speeds exceed that of light. It has also been found that our human consciousness is directly connected with matter and influences (at least) its microscopic particles. The nature of the universe as being holographic is explored. These scientific findings have profound spiritual significance. He quotes experts on the future of mankind, including Arthur C. Clark, Nobel physicist Brian Josephson, Stephen Hawking etc... and many more. Reading this book will prepare you for the new age that is fast enveloping the earth. The author's message is that in spite of the terrorism and devastation of the earth currently going on, there is powerful hope. There are powerful spiritual forces at work, which will overcome the present chaos and lead us into a life of enlightenment and eventually of love.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LbUgyo7ILeEC&dq=Spreading+the+Light:+Meaningful+Answers+to+Spiritual+Questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Jane","description":"\\"This is a simple story of the celebration of the life, the peaceful promise, and the lasting legacy of my dear grandmother Mary Jane, who taught without words that you can't put reins on a wandering spirit.\\" \\"An ambitious first novel as rich in retrospection as it is in introspection] that serves as both a how-to guide for all those struggling to come to terms with their own shortcomings, and an arduous journey down the most difficult path of all: the path to one's self.

Frances R. Aparicio places this music in context by combining the approaches of musicology and sociology with literary, cultural, Latino, and women's studies. She offers a detailed genealogy of Afro-Caribbean music in Puerto Rico, comparing it to selected Puerto Rican literary texts, then looks both at how Latinos/as in the US have used salsa to reaffirm their cultural identities and how Anglos have eroticized and depoliticized it in their adaptations. Aparicio's detailed examination of lyrics shows how these songs articulate issues of gender, desire, and conflict, and her interviews with Latinas/os reveal how they listen to salsa and the meanings they find in it. What results is a comprehensive view \\"that deploys both musical and literary texts as equally significant cultural voices in exploring larger questions about the power of discourse, gender relations, intercultural desire, race, ethnicity, and class.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WjrHBwAAQBAJ&dq=Listening+to+Salsa:+Gender,+Latin+Popular+Music,+and+Puerto+Rican+Cultures+(Music+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Contracts 101 - Updated Edition - Preprinted Binder / CD-ROM set containing over 100 contracts and agreements for recording artist, musicians, ... industry.

Roman gladiators thrilled citizens and emperors alike when they entered the octagon to face an intense, life-threatening experience. Boxing, the sport of kings, also has its roots in the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome. Banned in 500 A.D. by the Emperor Theodoric, it resurfaced twelve centuries later in England. John Milton praised it as a noble art for building character in young men, and sports writer A.J. Leibling dubbed it the Sweet Science. Many of its major protagonists - men such as Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali - have become transcendent, near-mythic heroes. But boxing is not the only combat sport, and mixed martial arts, in all their ferocious beauty, represent the fastest growing sports genre in the world. Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC) has joined boxing in paying seven figures to some of its champions, and draws millions in its pay-per-view events. This book details leading figures in boxing, sumo wrestling, kickboxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, and mixed martial arts (including organizations such as Ultimate Fighting, PRIDE, K-1, Total Combat, and SportFighting). Over 150 entries cover champions, contenders, and other famous combatants from all over the world, as well as legendary promoters, managers, trainers, and events.

What would you do to learn its secrets? Tales of such books have abounded for millennia and are legend in occult history. One of the most pervasive modern iterations is that of the Necronomicon, said to be a genuine occult text from the 8th century. The Necronomicon really is the creation of science fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft (1891-1937), in whose books the magic volume first appears in print. In The Necronomicon Files two occult authorities explore all aspects of The Necronomicon, from its first appearance in Lovecraft's fiction to its ongoing pervasive appearance in cult and occult circles. The Necronomicon Files, revised and expanded further, reveals the hoax of the Necronomicon. Harms and Gonce show that the apocryphal history of the Necronomicon was concocted by Lovecraft to lend it verisimilitude in his fiction. The magical text was transformed into an icon among Lovecraft's literary circle, who added to the book's legend by referring to it in their own writing. People became convinced that it was a real book and its references in literature and film continue to grow. The book also examines what people have undergone to find the Necronomicon and the cottage industry that has arisen over the past three decades to supply the continuing demand for a book that does not exist. Scholarly yet accessible, humorous and intriguing, The Necronomicon Files illuminates the depth of the creative process and the transformations of modern myth, while still managing to preserve much of the romance and fascination that surrounds the Necronomicon in our culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JW_iqpErrFcC&dq=Necronomian+Workbook+-+Guide+to+the+Necronomicon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith Beyond Reason","description":"Faith Beyond Reason, a book by A.W.

IT is these truths that sustain us in our Christian walk. Faith Beyond Reason comes to us with insights of faith and Tozer takes an in depth look and what it stands on. In Tozer's typical fashion and style, he explores the things that are beyond or frail human understanding. Faith Beyond Reason will leave you with a new and empowering sense of the faith while subtly revealing the power of God in our lives. The question every Christian must ask as they prepare to walk with God is, do they really believe that the God they worship will move heaven and earth for them if they truly trust in Him? The whole premise of this book is that with God nothing is impossible especially when it comes to His children.

It has new material on Marlowe in relation to Canterbury, also on his home life, schooling, and six and a half years at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and includes fresh data on his reading, teachers, and early achievements, including a new letter with a new date for the famous 'putative portrait' of Marlowe at Cambridge. The biography uses for the first time the Latin writings of his friend Thomas Watson to illuminate Marlowe's life in London and his career as a spy (that is, as a courier and agent for the Elizabethan Privy Council). There are new accounts of him on the continent, particularly at Flushing or Vlissingen, where he was arrested. The book also more fully explains Marlowe's relations with his chief patron, Thomas Walsingham, than ever before. This is also the first biography to explore in detail Marlowe's relations with fellow playwrights such as Kyd and Shakespeare, and to show how Marlowe's relations with Shakespeare evolved from 1590 to 1593. With closer views of him in relation to the Elizabethan stage than have appeared in any biography, the book examines in detail his aims, mind, and techniques as exhibited in all of his plays, from Dido, the Tamburlaine dramas, and Doctor Faustus through to The Jew of Malta and Edward II. It offers new treatments of his evolving versions of 'The Passionate Shepherd', and displays circumstances, influences, and the bearings of Shakespeare's 'Venus and Adonis' in relation to Marlowe's 'Hero and Leander'. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on Marlowe's friendships and so-called 'homosexuality'. Fresh information is brought to bear on his seductive use of blasphemy, his street fights, his methods of preparing himself for writing, and his atheism and religious interests. The book also explores his attraction to scientists and mathematicians such as Thomas Harriot and others in the Ralegh-Northumberland set of thinkers and experimenters. Finally, there is new data on spies and business agents such as Robert Poley, Nicholas Skeres, and Ingram Frizer, and a more exact account of the circumstances that led up to Marlowe's murder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4qsHGzJ9Ku8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muhammad at Medina","description":"Muhammad at Medina was written by W.

In scale, the tragedy of Leningrad dwarfs even the Warsaw ghetto or Hiroshima. Nearly three million people endured it; just under half of them died, starving or freezing to death, most in the six months from October 1941 to April 1942 when the temperature often stayed at 30 degrees below zero. For twenty-five years the distinguished journalist and historian Harrison Salisbury has assembled material for this story. He has interviewed survivors, sifted through the Russian archives, and drawn on his vast experience as a correspondent in the Soviet Union. What he has discovered and imparted in The 900 Days is an epic narrative of villainy and survival, in which the city had as much to fear from Stalin as from Hitler. He concludes his story with the culminating disaster of the Leningrad Affair, a plot hatched by Stalin three years after the war had ended. Almost every official who had been instrumental in the city's survival was implicated, convicted, and executed. Harrison Salisbury has told this overwhelming story boldly, unforgettably, and definitively.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQ1KDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Socks Only","description":"In the segregated south, a young girl thinks that she can drink from a fountain marked \\"Whites Only\\" because she is wearing her white socks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xteKzgEACAAJ&dq=White+Socks+Only&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Teachers Reflect: Journeys Towards Effective, Inclusive Practice (Naeyc)","description":"On the premise that hearing other preschool teachers talk about their challenges in creating inclusive settings is a powerful impetus to reflect about one's own teaching practice, this book contains personal narratives by 18 teachers about their journeys toward inclusive, developmentally appropriate practice in early childhood education.

From her very first novel, Jeanette Winterson has made her characters move in time and in space, and she has always shown a sophisticated interest in narrative forms, and this is the first book to focus entirely on these central concerns. The writers of the essays provide different perspectives on the three subjects, from postmodernism to quantum physics, queer theory to genre studies and the uncanny to stylistics. In its section on time and narrative, the volume offers a fresh approach to Winterson's works, with a concentration on autobiographical elements, love, desire, the language of quantum physics, and the queer uncanny. The next section, space and narrative, pursues the motifs of journeys, utopic spaces, cyberspace and labyrinths, and includes a chapter on the shorter fiction. The last section, which comprises essays that cover all three elements of time, space and narrative equally, examines these themes as they affect Winterson's representation of voices and corporeality, and her use of romance narrative in the children's fiction. The volume covers Winterson's major fiction, with the Introduction connecting the images of huts, rivers and fire-gazing that are found extensively in her works to the themes of time and space, and bringing the discussion up to Winterson's latest novel, The Stone Gods. A mixture of established and new scholars presents in this book an exciting array of the latest ideas on this respected and popular writer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYZJDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles Taylor (Philosophy Now Series)","description":"Charles Taylor is one of the most influential and prolific philosophers in the English-speaking world today. The breadth of his writings is unique, ranging from reflections on artificial intelligence to analyses of contemporary multicultural societies. This thought-provoking introduction to Taylor's work outlines his ideas in a coherent and accessible way without reducing their richness and depth. His contribution to many of the enduring debates within Western philosophy is examined and the arguments of his critics assessed. Taylor's reflections on the topics of moral theory, selfhood, political theory and epistemology form the core chapters within the book. Ruth Abbey engages with the secondary literature on Taylor's work and suggests that some criticisms by contemporaries have been based on misinterpretations and suggests ways in which a better understanding of Taylor's work leads to different criticisms of it. The book serves as an ideal companion to Taylor's ideas for students of philosophy and political theory, and will be welcomed by the non-specialist looking for an authoritative guide to Taylor's large and challenging body of work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mu0oCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie Trotters Desserts","description":"Provides recipes for desserts such as strawberry-almond shortcake with basil and a crepe banana split","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O6_kwAEACAAJ&dq=Charlie+Trotters+Desserts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mephisto Diary: A Palmer Morel Mystery","description":"Donna is een buitenbeentje.

Today, promoting libraries and the services they offer has become a necessity. Displaying that wonderful book with uninteresting cover will get it off the shelf and increase circulation; promoting the library informs users that there is more to the research than books. Barteluk shows the library worker in small to mid-size libraries how to turn out eye-catching, interest-raising displays. Using three-dimensional exhibits rather than bulletin boards, she focuses on the actual fabrication of exhibits. Liberal illustrations and photographs reinforce the philosophy that creating appealing library displays is easy, fun, and economical. The author explains why promotions are necessary and tells where to place the displays, when to put them up and when to take them down, what materials to use and where to find them, how to build and use a mannequin, how to draw when you think you can't, and how to use color. Readers will also find tips on using and creating brochures and handouts, building displays that can be used more than once, scrounging and using props and ideas, and, lastly, how to store everything for further use.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W9XgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Library+Displays+on+a+Shoestring&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names","description":"Names are important elements to handle the diversity of items in daily life - persons, objects, animals, plants, etc. Without such names, it would be difficult to attach information to such items and to communicate information about them, and names are usually used without giving them much thought. This is not different for plants. When dealing with plants, however, it soon becomes apparent that the situation is somewhat more complex. Botanists use Latin names to bring order into the vast diversity, while everyday usage resorts to vemacular or \\"popular\\" names. As practical as these vernacular names are (it is not suggested that you should ask your greengrocer for a kilo gram of Solanum tuberosum or Musa paradisiaca subsp. sapientum), their most important draw back is the fact that they vary widely, not only from one language to another but also from coun try to country, even from region to region within a large country. More importantly, vemacular names in any given language are usually only available for the plants growing locally, or for plants of some special importance, such as crops and vegetables, medicinal plants, or important garden plants. For all other plants, the Latin names used by botanists and other scientists have to be employed.

For the first time, a scientist provided an accessible and comprehensive account of the history, current status, and future impact of climate change, writing what has been acclaimed by reviewers everywhere as the definitive book on global warming. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. The Weather Makers is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Originally somewhat of a global warming skeptic, Tim Flannery spent several years researching the topic and offers a connect-the-dots approach for a reading public who has received patchy or misleading information on the subject.

In 1967, a bullet cost thirteen cents, and no one gave Uncle Sam a bigger bang for his buck than the 5th Marine Regiment Sniper Platoon. So feared were these lethal marksmen that the Viet Cong offered huge rewards for killing them. Now noted Vietnam author John J. Culbertson, a former 5th Marine sniper himself, presents the riveting true stories of young Americans who fought with bolt rifles and bounties on their heads during the fiercest combat of the war, from 1967 through the desperate Tet battle for Hue in early  68. In spotter/shooter pairs, sniper teams accompanied battle-hardened Marine rifle companies like the 2/5 on patrols and combat missions. Whether fighting their way out of a Viet Cong  kill zone  or battling superior numbers of NVA crack troops, the sniper teams were at the cutting edge in the art of jungle warfare, showing the patience, stealth, combat marksmanship, and raw courage that made the unit the most decorated regimental sniper platoon in the Vietnam War. Harrowing and unforgettable, these accounts pay tribute to the heroes who made the greatest sacrifice of alland leave no doubt that among 5th Marine snipers uncommon valor was truly a common virtue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X1XlypiYwHUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings: Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets","description":"Thrive Amidst the Devastation Hundreds of years have passed since a magical disaster called The Devastation transformed Dereth.

It is, after all, that stratum of history that touches our lives most closely. Madison answers the basic questions of when, where, why, how, and by whom Madison, Wisconsin was developed. The book is richly detailed, fully documented, inclusive in coverage, and delightfully readable. More than 300 illustrations provide a vivid feeling for what life was like in Madison during the formative years. David Mollenhoff's unique interpretive framework emphasizing public policies and community values, gives the book a consistent interpretive quality and reveals major themes that flow through time. This combination will allow you to see the city's growth and development with unusual clarity and coherence almost as if you were watching time-lapse photography. When Mollenhoff began to study Madison s history, he was delighted by his early discoveries but frustrated because no one had written a book-length history of Madison since 1876. Finally, in 1972 he decided to write that book. His research required him to read five miles of microfilm, piles of theses and dissertations, shelves of reports, boxes of manuscripts and letters, and to study thousands of photographs. Soon after the first edition was published in 1982, readers declared it to be a classic. For this second edition Madison has been extensively revised and updated with new maps and photos. If you want to know the fascinating story of how Madison got to be the way it is, this book belongs on your bookshelf. It will change the way you see the city and your role in it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NwrIKM0rBd4C&dq=Madison,+a+History+of+the+Formative+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Any Sound You Can Imagine: Making Music/Consuming Technology (Music Culture)","description":"Describes digital musical instruments, industries that supply and promote them, and the meanings they have for musicians. Winner of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music (IASPM) Book Award (1997) Recent innovations in musical instrument design are not simply a response to the needs of musicians, writes Paul Th berge; they also have become \\"a driving force with which musicians must contend.\\" He argues that digital synthesizers, samplers, and sequencers in studio production and in the home have caused musicians to rely increasingly on manufacturers for both the instruments themselves as well as the very sounds and musical patterns that they use to make music. Musical practices have thus become allied with a new type of consumer practice that is altogether different from earlier relationships between musicians and their instruments as a means of production. Th berge places these developments within a broad social and historical perspective that examines the development of the musical instrument industry, particularly the piano industry, the economic and cultural role of musicians' magazines and computer networks, and the fundamental relationships between musical concepts, styles, and technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=asBnYmKKz6kC&dq=Any+Sound+You+Can+Imagine:+Making+Music/Consuming+Technology+(Music+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The banana pie that changed the world","description":"People who are having a bad day pass around a banana cream pie, and the sharing makes them feel better.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XTD8cv3YgFQC&dq=The+banana+pie+that+changed+the+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Using Language","description":"Strategies in Learning and Using a Second Language examines what it takes to achieve long-term success in languages beyond the first language.

Sample Book Insights: #1 The Odyssey is a prime example of the intertwinement of myth and rational labor. It illustrates the dialectic of enlightenment, as it shows clear links to myth, but it also contradicts those myths. The epic creates a universality of language, but it also disintegrates the hierarchical order of society. #2 The German late-Romantic interpretation of antiquity, based on the early writings of Nietzsche, recognized the element of bourgeois enlightenment in Homer. However, they saw this element as both positive and negative, and tried to liquidate it. #3 The most prominent and therefore the most impotent of the esoteric apologists of German heavy industry, Rudolf Borchardt, prematurely breaks off his analysis in the service of repressive ideology. He fails to recognize that the primal powers he extols themselves represent a stage of enlightenment. #4 The Odyssey is closer in form to the picaresque novel. The hero s peregrinations from Troy to Ithaca trace the path of the self through myths, a self that is infinitely weak compared to the force of nature and still in the process of formation as self-consciousness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SZh6EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Labor Migration in the Twenty-First Century","description":"Why have ninety million workers around the globe left their homes for employment in other countries?

But it is not always perceived as the serious crime that it is: many traffic offences cause enormous harm in terms of death and injury, but are often not regarded seriously by drivers, the criminal justice system and the state. Other than theft of and from cars it is arguable that car crime is socially constructed as 'not real crime' or 'not even crime'. This book is the first to survey the whole area of car crime. It considers car crime as a coherent whole, addressing the concept of car culture; considers car crime in its various guides in relation to issues such as masculinity, gender, car usage and the environment; considers the historical roots of legislation concerning crime committed in the car, through to current legislation and its effects and implications. The book also addresses issues of crime prevention, and in particular the role of car manufacturers in making cars more crime proof.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WZjJKgfOQLUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Compatible Cultural Democracy : The Key to Development in Africa","description":"This book argues that it is time for African nations to govern themselves using modified, indigenous political structures and ideologies. Osabu-Kle closely examines the colonization experience and the massive transplantation of Western political forms as well as the post-independence period of structural transformation. He delves into the makeup of a number of indigenous African political systems: the Ovimbunda, Zulu, Ashanti, and Ga peoples whose cultures, though geographically distant, exhibit common characteristics, including consensualism and a balance between centralization and decentralization to check the abuse of power. Osabu-Kle argues that only a type of democracy compatible with the historic African cultural environment is capable of achieving the political conditions for successful development. But he goes beyond establishing that precolonial African political systems were democratic. Rather, he describes how the indigenous political culture might be modified to achieve the political conditions necessary to work towards a successful future. This dynamically written, lively, and informed study provides a provocative challenge to conventional Western commentaries on Africa and current thinking about the continent's re-democratization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FSJzAAAAMAAJ&dq=Compatible+Cultural+Democracy+:+The+Key+to+Development+in+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial","description":"Win32 API calls from Visual Basic 6 - allowing the VB programmer to access the powerful repertoire of API calls available when programming in Windows. Visual Basic does an excellent job of letting developers build sophisticated Windows applications in a relatively short amount of time. This allows one to quickly build prototypes for end-users to evaluate and test, which can accelerate the development cycle. However, this ease of use does have its disadvantages. By shielding the programmer from the low-level Win32 calls, he or she may not be able to optimize certain functions or perform some tasks that the users have requested. Unless a programmer has started his or her career developing Windows applications in a lower level language like C or Pascal, they may be unfamiliar with the API calls that can be made to the OS. This can lead to frustration or confusion in using an API procedure that may behave unexpectedly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kOMJAAAACAAJ&dq=Visual+Basic+6+Win32+API+Tutorial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dogspeak: How to Learn It, Speak it, and Use It to Have a Happy, Healthy, Well-Behaved Dog","description":"Offers insights into effective communication with a dog, showing how to interpret face and body language and barks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qjLm5yW5Zv8C&dq=Dogspeak:+How+to+Learn+It,+Speak+it,+and+Use+It+to+Have+a+Happy,+Healthy,+Well-Behaved+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murders on Elderberry Road: A Queen Bees Quilt Mystery","description":"Join Po and her sleuthing quilter friends, the Queen Bees, as they uncover murders in this fourbook mystery series.

This book teaches how women prove to be men's greatest untapped resource. Men finally have a life guide to show them how they have been misled into holding a very distorted and artificial view of womankind. And it is this view that has held adult men hostage as being little more than \\"grown-up boys\\" in the eyes of their women. Pearls of life-changing knowledge are drawn from this psychiatrist's many years of working with thousands of patients as couples; from neurophysiological and anatomical differences that make women so unique; and from discoveries by ethnologists, social anthropologists and psychologists about the behavioral and social characteristics that make women so different from men. These same differences are also what have made women so misunderstood and misinterpreted by men. By applying this knowledge in the context of engaging, real life case scenarios, along with a healthy dose of humor, practical solutions to the major conflicts universally experienced between men and their women become easily understood. This revolutionary book promises nothing short of forever altering the way that men view, value and interact with their women (and children) on a daily basis. The gates to prosperity and untold happiness have been unlocked for any man willing to open his mind to this enlightening exploration of his greatest resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S8DRPQAACAAJ&dq=Dissection+of+Woman:+A+Psychiatrist%27s+Official+Life+Guide+for+Men,+Understanding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emerald Enchantment","description":"Emerald Enchantment is a novel about a maid in the household of a powerful man.

Realizing he has a chance to start over, to do it right this time, he moves to a new city, adopts a new name, and a new course of life only to find that this new existence is as insufferable as the old one. But when he returns to the world he left behind, it's too late: his job is gone, his wife has remarried. Mattia Pascal's fate is to live on as the ghost of the man he was. An explorer of identity and its mysteries, a connoisseur of black humor, Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello is among the most teasing and profound of modern masters. The Late Mattia Pascal, here rendered into English by the outstanding translator William Weaver, offers an irresistible introduction to this great writer's work","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XiBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Late+Mattia+Pascal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Madison","description":"A bestselling historian examines the life of a Founding Father. Renowned historian and social commentator Garry Wills takes a fresh look at the life of James Madison, from his rise to prominence in the colonies through his role in the creation of the Articles of Confederation and the first Constitutional Congress. Madison oversaw the first foreign war under the constitution, and was forced to adjust some expectations he had formed while drafting that document. Not temperamentally suited to be a wartime President, Madison nonetheless confronted issues such as public morale, internal security, relations with Congress, and the independence of the military. Wills traces Madison's later life during which, like many recent Presidents, he enjoyed greater popularity than while in office.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tADkCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power Through Constructive Thinking","description":"With dramatic clarity Dr. Fox tells how to conquer failure and discouragement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VdAnAAAAYAAJ&dq=Power+Through+Constructive+Thinking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Iliad: The Story of Achilles","description":"This new, modern translation of The Iliad is fast-moving, action-oriented presentation which will be especially helpful to those first encountering this classic work.

The Highland Clearances, the eviction of crofters from their homes between 1792 and the 1850s, was one of the cruellest episodes in Scotland's history. In CONSIDER THE LILIES Iain Crichton Smith captures its impact through the thoughts and memories of an old woman who has lived all her life within the narrow confines of her community. Alone and bewildered by the demands of the factor, Patrick Sellar, she approaches the minister for help, only to have her faith shattered by his hypocrisy. She finds comfort, however, from a surprising source: Donald Macleod, an imaginative and self-educated man who has been ostracised by his neighbours, not least by Mrs Scott herself, on account of his atheism. Through him and through the circumstances forced upon her, the old woman achieves new strength. Written with compassion, in spare, simple prose, Consider the Lilies is a moving testament to the enduring qualities which enable the oppressed to triumph in defeat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EB4UCAAAQBAJ&dq=Consider+the+lilies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agnelli: Fiat and the Network of Italian Power","description":"A probing look at the life of one of Italy's most powerful figures describes the many provinces of Gianni Agnelli, including the Fiat industry, several major Italian newspapers, and major stock.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J6SGQgAACAAJ&dq=Agnelli:+Fiat+and+the+Network+of+Italian+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rutherford B.

Thousands of people in West Africa are suffering from cholera. And antibiotics are rapidly becoming less and less effective at fighting what were once mild infections. The biggest threat to the future of human society may not be terrorist attacks or nuclear war, but rather microscopic bacteria. Immunologist Norbert Gualde explains in Resistance the dangers we face from bacterial resistance, asserting that we must confront the reality awaiting us--the next fatal plague may occur sooner than we think. Over the course of the twentieth century, incredible advances in medicine inspired a utopian belief among many that all common infectious diseases would eventually be eradicated. But Resistance shows that this dream is an impossible one. The book s riveting narrative reveals how new infectious agents and diseases are being discovered every day and how bacteria previously thought to have been destroyed are returning with a vengeance. Drawing upon the history of past epidemics, Gualde explores how new outbreaks might be predicted and controlled. He also investigates the potentially devastating social and political impact of such public health disasters, particularly in underdeveloped countries in the southern hemisphere. He ultimately argues that the constant interaction between man and microorganisms will inevitably catalyze future epidemics similar to the horrific ones of centuries past. Global outbreak monitoring and medical research on the human body s immune system are beginning to produce effective strategies against bacterial resistance. But the most important weapon is awareness of the crisis, and this engrossing and brilliantly translated study will serve as a wake-up call for us all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hv0gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Resistance:+the+Human+Struggle+Against+Infection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Friend","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xsxfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ADHD Affected Athlete","description":"Background information, tips, and strategies for coaches, parents, and others who work with athletes affected by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aUJWCqv6EU4C&dq=The+ADHD+Affected+Athlete&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","description":"As John Connor struggles with fears about his destiny as the head of the human resistance against the robotic forces of Skynet, a new advanced-model Terminator from the future is sent to kill him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DU-hnoszGTMC&dq=Terminator+3:+Rise+of+the+Machines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Families on the Fault Line: America's Working Class Speaks About the Family, the Economy, Race, and Ethnicity","description":"Uses nearly four hundred interviews with adults and children to examine the commonalities among working class people despite economic forces that create seemingly unbridgeable ethnic divisions","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mDBHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Families+on+the+Fault+Line:+America%27s+Working+Class+Speaks+About+the+Family,+the+Economy,+Race,+and+Ethnicity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram","description":"The creator of the famous \\"Obedience Experiments,\\" carried out at Yale in the 1960s, and originator of the \\"six degrees of separation\\" concept, Stanley Milgram was one of the most innovative scientists of our time. In this sparkling biography-the first in-depth portrait of Milgram-Thomas Blass captures the colorful personality and pioneering work of a social psychologist who profoundly altered the way we think about human nature. Born in the Bronx in 1933, Stanley Milgram was the son of Eastern European Jews, and his powerful Obedience Experiments had obvious intellectual roots in the Holocaust. The experiments, which confirmed that \\"normal\\" people would readily inflict pain on innocent victims at the behest of an authority figure, generated a firestorm of public interest and outrage-proving, as they did, that moral beliefs were far more malleable than previously thought. But Milgram also explored other aspects of social psychology, from information overload to television violence to the notion that we live in a small world. Although he died suddenly at the height of his career, his work continues to shape the way we live and think today.

In Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin, geographer-historian Richard Francaviglia shows how the Great Basin gradually emerged from its  cartographic silence  as terra incognita and how this fascinating process both paralleled the development of the sciences of surveying, geology, hydrology, and cartography and reflected the changing geopolitical aspirations of the European colonial powers and the United States. Francaviglia s interdisciplinary account of the mapping of the Great Basin combines a chronicle of the exploration of the region with a history of the art and science of cartography and of the political, economic, and cultural contexts in which maps are created. It also offers a compelling, wide-ranging discussion that combines a description of the daunting physical realities of the Great Basin with a cogent examination of the ways humans, from early Native Americans to nineteenth-century surveyors to twentieth-century highway and air travelers, have understood, defined, and organized this space, psychologically and through the medium of maps. Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin continues Francaviglia s insightful, richly nuanced meditation on the Great Basin landscape that began in Believing in Place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I--UDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boy Who Ate Stars","description":"Having recently moved to a Paris apartment with her family, twelve-year-old Lucy meets her four-year-old, autistic neighbor, Matthew, and befriends him in her own understanding and special way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f8_nY3s6Tb0C&dq=Boy+Who+Ate+Stars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Whirl of Exile","description":"In The Rockets' Red Glare, set during a Super Bowl, he writes: \\"The woman behind me asks her son / how so many rockets can be set off in succession. / You just hire a bunch of Mexicans to run around / with a lot of matches. / Isn't it great, she sighs, bombs bursting in air, / to be an American?\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QB96AAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+Whirl+of+Exile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Atlas of Body CT Anatomy (Radiology Pocket Atlas Series)","description":"Featuring 229 sharp, new images obtained with state-of-the-art technology, the Second Edition of this popular pocket atlas is a quick, handy guide to interpreting computed tomography body images.

Why an Ignatian Retreat? From start to finish, the Exercises are a training ground in freedom, because they are a training in love. Focusing on the person of Jesus, the Exercises invite you to enter into the relationship with God that Jesus has.

Thomas Paine s voice rang in the ears of eighteenth-century revolutionaries from America to France to England.

Yet he died a forgotten man, isolated by his rough manners, idealistic zeal, and unwillingness to compromise. Howard Fast s brilliant portrait brings Paine to the fore as a legend of American history, and provides readers with a gripping narrative of modern democracy s earliest days in America and Europe.

They are all attendees of an Apologetics conference intended to join qualified representatives of Christian, Deist, and Atheist thought for a two-week, no-holds-barred debate and discussion of their respective positions that will ultimately be included in a book published after the conference. Evangelical Christianity is represented by advocates of Evidentialist and Presuppositionalist approaches to Apologetics. Catholicism, liberal Christianity, and Deism are also well-supported. The Atheist perspective is advocated by a polemical author and a college professor notorious for attacking the views of his Christian students. As the participants argue over controversial issues such as cosmology, evolution, The Bible, historical evidence for Jesus, the resurrection, biblical prophecies, and the problem of evil, intellectual fireworks result. But what will result when such a volatile and eclectic group is placed face-to-face for more than two weeks? The Debaters of this Age is the tale of what happens inside a California hotel in 2018 when a group of intellectuals gather to vigorously discuss the religious issues of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNmGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Face of the Deep","description":"This is a groundbreaking, highly original work of postmodern feminist theology from one of the most important authors in the field. The Face of the Deep deconstructs the Christian doctrine of creation which claims that a transcendent Lord unilaterally created the universe out of nothing. Catherine Keller's impassioned, graceful meditation develops an alternative representation of the cosmic creative process, drawing upon Hebrew myths of creation, from chaos, and engaging with the political and the mystical, the literary and the scientific, the sexual and the racial. As a landmark work of immense significance for Jewish and Christian theology, gender studies, literature, philosophy and ecology, The Face of the Deep takes our originary story to a new horizon, rewriting the starting point for Western spiritual discourse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2OhRyyFBd1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Production and Operations Analysis with Student CD-Rom","description":"The international conference \\\\Operations Research 2008\\", the annual meeting of the German Operations Research Society (GOR), was held at the University of Augsburg on September 3-5, 2008. About 580 p- ticipants from more than 30 countries presented and listened to nearly 400 talks on a broad range of Operations Research. The general subject \\\\Operations Research and Global Business\\" str- ses the important role of Operations Research in improving decisions in the increasingly complex business processes in a global environment. The plenary speakers Morris A. Cohen (Wharton School) and Bernd Liepert (Executive Board of KUKA Robotics) addressed this subject. Moreover, one of the founders of Operations Research, Saul Gass (U- versity of Maryland), gave the opening speech on the early history of Operations Research. This volume contains 93 papers presented at the conference, selected by the program committee and the section chairs, forming a representative sample of the various subjects dealt with at Operations Research 2008. The volume follows the structure of the conference, with 12 sections, grouped into six \\\\Fields of Applications\\" and six \\\\Fields of Methods and Theory\\". This structure in no way means a separation of theory and application, which would be detrimental in Operations Research, but displays the large spectrum of aspects in the focus of the papers. Of course, most papers present theory, methods and applications together.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VjGNnIthWKkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Club","description":"The game of cat and mouse has only just begun...

Not hardship, not isolation, not even her own loneliness posed the greatest threat; it was the land itself that took away both love and livelihood. Robley Wilson's The World Still Melting tells the story of the Toblers and their friends Harvey and Nancy Riker, whose abusive marriage ultimately costs the Toblers their happiness, and Burton Stone, the man in the middle, whose affair with Nancy is the literal trigger of the novel's action. Good and evil play out on these three family farms, whose very existence is a vanishing part of a heartland giving way to corporate avarice. The Iowa of Wilson's novel is a place where keeping land and home has become a dehumanizing territorial battle, and where small farmers like Paul, Harvey, and Burton face the whims of governments, banks, and weather that bring drought one year and deluge the next. Writing with great compassion, honesty, and remarkable skill, Wilson shows here what happens to real people in a hard place, where the traditional world is slowly but steadily melting away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cbb0wAEACAAJ&dq=The+World+Still+Melting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Combat Flight Simulator 3: Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets","description":"Whether you fly for the USAAF, RAF, or Luftwaffe, this exclusive strategy guide will help you win the war and master the most realistic, exciting Combat Flight Sim game ever.

Many consider Watsu the most significant advance in bodywork in our times. While other forms are based on touch, Watsu creates a more profound connection through the holding and the deep connection with the breath that being in water facilitates. The trust established combines with the relaxing effects of warm water and Watsu's moves and stretches to create a modality of extraordinary depth that has both specific therapeutic results and healing on many levels. Besides having countless applications in therapy, it brings new depths of 'connection' into the lives of the many sharing its simpler moves with family and friends. This third edition completes the first 25-year evolution of what came into being when Harold Dull started floating people at Harbin Hot Springs in Northern California, applying the stretches of the Zen Shiatsu he had studied in Japan. It illustrates, step by step, the major positions and forms of Watsu. It introduces Watsuchanics (the body mechanics of Watsu) and other developments that help students learn Watsu. More than sixteen therapists and practitioners have added contributions detailing the use of Watsu with all ages and the growing number of conditions that Watsu is proving to alleviate in clinics and spas around the world. New chapters feature Watsu with children and a form of Watsu that can be used in home spa/hot tubs. Also illustrated step by step is a complete form of Tantsu which brings Watsu's nurturing power back onto land. More than a thousand images have gone into this book to give as clear an illustration as possible of the movements and forms of Watsu and Tantsu.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=STwPZn0A24oC&dq=Watsu:+Freeing+the+Body+In+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roadside Geology Of Northern California -","description":"Sierra Nevada -- Klamath mountains -- Coast range -- The great valley -- High Cascades on the Modoc plateau -- Basin and range.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kE6kDAEACAAJ&dq=Roadside+Geology+Of+Northern+California+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowing Jesus in Your Life","description":"\\"We cannot make Jesus in our own image.

Rather, they took discrete moments of their stories and turned them into one coherent narrative, blurring what was and was not \\"professional\\" about their coverage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j2oFyttniUMC&dq=Covering+the+Body:+The+Kennedy+Assassination,+the+Media,+and+the+Shaping+of+Collective+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johnny Angel","description":"Johnny Peterson could light up a room with a word or a smile.

This is an Arab Revolution of the magnitude of the French Revolution. Historian, political observer and opinion-maker Koert Debeuf draws this conclusion from three years of living and working in the heart of the Arab world.

They demonstrate that since the seventeenth century, American writing has reflected the political and historical climate of its time and helped define America's cultural and social parameters. Above all, they argue that American literature has always been essentially \\"modern,\\" illustrating this with a broad range of texts: from Poe and Melville to Fitzgerald and Pound, to Wallace Stevens, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Thomas Pynchon. From Puritanism to Postmodernism pays homage to the luxuriance of American writing by tracing the creation of a national literature that retained its deep roots in European culture while striving to achieve cultural independence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QoJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=From+Puritanism+to+Postmodernism:+A+History+of+American+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China Lake","description":"Barret Baumgart s literary debut presents a haunting and deeply personal portrait of civilization poised at the precipice, a picture of humanity caught between its deepest past and darkest future. In the fall of 2013, during the height of California s historic drought, Baumgart toured the remote military base, NAWS China Lake, near Death Valley, California. His mother, the survivor of a recent stroke, decided to come along for the ride. She hoped the alleged healing power of the base s ancient Native American hot springs might cure her crippling headaches. Baumgart sought to debunk claims that the military was spraying the atmosphere with toxic chemicals to control the weather. What follows is a discovery that threatens to sever not only the bonds between mother and son but between planet Earth and life itself. Stalking the fringes of Internet conspiracy, speculative science, and contemporary archaeology, Baumgart weaves memoir, military history, and investigative journalism in a dizzying journey that carries him from the cornfields of Iowa to drought-riddled California, from the Vietnam jungle to the caves of prehistoric Europe and eventually the walls of the US Capitol, the sparkling white hallways of the Pentagon, and straight into the contradicted heart of a worldwide climate emergency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jGRlDgAAQBAJ&dq=China+Lake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conceptual Schema and Relational Database Design","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jJwkAQAAIAAJ&dq=Conceptual+Schema+and+Relational+Database+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriages and Families Diversity and Change","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w68yswEACAAJ&dq=Marriages+and+Families+Diversity+and+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management (Hm Business College Titles)","description":"This book is a timely evaluation of how a harmonious business environment can be created and managed successfully in an increasingly turbulent era.

A literally shattering climax.\\" -- The New York Times Book Review All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire s richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world s largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta  s sixty-mile main line somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Attilius decent, practical, and incorruptible promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work both natural and man-made threatening to destroy him. With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Pompeii:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horatio's Drive","description":"Chronicles the nation's first road trip by Horatio Jackson, a thirty-one-year-old Vermont doctor who drove his car from San Francisco to New York on mainly unpaved roads in 1903.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GIB1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Horatio%27s+Drive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arthur Frommer's New World of Travel","description":"Here are vacations that cater to the mind, spirit and a sense of thrift.

This is Littell at the top of his form, constructing a tale of espionage and counterespionage revealing the dirty tricks and dangerous secrets about the subjects he knows intimately the CIA and American history, past and present. Littell proves beyond all doubt that he is a storyteller of inimitable caliber. As Stephen Coonts put it,  Eric Ambler invented the modern spy novel. Robert Littell perfected it.

At the center of Littell s plot is an elite plan, so secret and so dangerous that its existence is known only to a tiny group of specialists within CIA headquarters. There is virtually no paper trail but, somehow, the plan has sprung a leak. The plotters must urgently trace it or face deadly consequences. Meanwhile, at work elsewhere on another highly sensitive project for \\"the Company\\" is an operative known as  the Weeder?? a man obsessed with American history and one of its heroes.

But exnavy captain Gunnar Heim refuses to believe there s no one left and he s convinced that what happened to New Europe is only the beginning of the Aleriona s intergalactic aggression.

He'd planned it long before. It was a long-cherished and carefully worked out scheme. He didn't expect the hanging of his relatives, of course. He knew that they'd act grieved and innocent, and give proof that they were simple people leading blameless lives. They'd make their would-be executioners feel ashamed and apologetic for having thought evil of them, and as soon as the strangers left they'd return to their normal way of life, which was piracy. But while this was going on, Bron Hoddan stowed away on the menacing vessel. Presently he arrived at its home world. But his ambition was to reach Walden, so he set about getting there. It took a long time because he had to earn ship-passage from one solar system to another, but he held to his idea. Walden was the most civilized planet in that part of the galaxy. On Walden, Hoddan intended, in order (a) to achieve splendid things as an electronic engineer, (b) to grow satisfactorily rich, (c) to marry a delightful girl, and (d) end his life a great man.

She said that the FGM concept, then largely unknown outside of Japan and a relatively few laboratories elsewhere, would be of great interest to everyone working in the materials field because of its potentially universal applicability. There was no book about FGMs in English at that time, although the number of research papers, review articles, and FGM conference proceedings had been increasing yearly. We discussed what the book should cover, and decided it should present a comprehensive description from basic theory to the most recent applications of FGMs. This would make it useful both as an introduction to FGMs for those simply curious about what this new materials field was all about, and also as a textbook for researchers, engineers, and graduate students in various material fields. The FGM Forum in Japan generously offered to support this publication program. is very difficult for an individual author to write a book that Because it covers such a wide range of various aspects of many different materials, I invited more than 30 eminent materials scientists throughout the world, who were associated with FGM research, to contribute selected topics.

Apart from biographical details, attention is given to Poincar 's contributions to automorphic functions, differential equations and dynamical systems, celestial mechanics, mathematical physics in particular the theory of the electron and relativity, topology (analysis situs). A chapter on philosophy explains Poincar 's conventionalism in mathematics and his view of conventionalism in physics; the latter has a very different character. In the foundations of mathematics his position is between intuitionism and axiomatics. One of the purposes of the book is to show how Poincar  reached his fundamentally new results in many different fields, how he thought and how one should read him. One of the new aspects is the description of two large fields of his attention: dynamical systems as presented in his book on \`new methods for celestial mechanics' and his theoretical physics papers. At the same time it will be made clear how analysis and geometry are intertwined in Poincar 's thinking and work.In dynamical systems this becomes clear in his description of invariant manifolds, his association of differential equation flow with mappings and his fixed points theory. There is no comparable book on Poincar , presenting such a relatively complete vision of his life and achievements. There exist some older biographies in the French language, but they pay only restricted attention to his actual work.

Sir Howard Kippenberger is widely acknowledged as the ideal of a New Zealand citizen-soldier and our foremost soldier-scholar; a country lawyer and provincial intellectual who became a national figure as New Zealanders made the transition from colonials to a forthright nationhood. As a military leader, editor and author he was one of the prime movers in that process. His democratic style of leadership reflected the ethos of a new nation - active, competent and engaged in the world in its own right, no longer a dependency of Britain A second-generation New Zealander, born in 1897, his military career was probably unique in that he was a 19 year old private soldier in one war and emerged in the next as the commander of choice of what was in effect a national army - the 2nd NZ Division - whenever the British-born (and trained) Bernard Freyberg was absent. Kip was never a regular officer; a part-time Territorial soldier in peacetime, with no formal British staff training, he stood in the line of the New Zealand self-made man. Hard-boiled ordinary New Zealanders at war truly admired and respected him, not only for his mastery of the business of fighting but because he was known for a very real and deep rapport with his soldiers and concern for their welfare; he \\"made men realise that here was one who thought more of them than of himself.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6O6cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enchanted Enemy","description":"Weaving a spellbinding paranormal tale, Tracy Fobes seals her reputation as an innovative star of distinctive and intriguing romantic novels to treasure.

Marrying Cole and bearing his child would at last break a dark spell cast amid the moonlight and salt spray of the English coast. The task at hand is a trick of mistaken identity to seduce Cole and win his hand. Cole is more consumed with locating a legendary gem and turning the tide on his family's ill luck than with thoughts of marriage. His uncle's urgent matchmaking had left him cold -- until he meets the newest candidate: a beautiful widow with haunting, captivating eyes.

Topics covered include vibrational and rotational spectra, molecular symmetry, methyl and methylene groups, triple bonds and cumulated double bonds, and olefin groups. Aromatic and heteroaromatic rings are also considered, along with carbonyl compounds and molecular vibrations. This book is comprised of 14 chapters and begins with a discussion on the use of Raman and infrared spectroscopy to study the vibrational and rotational frequencies of molecules, paying particular attention to photon energy and degrees of freedom of molecular motion. The quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator and the anharmonic oscillator are described. The next chapter focuses on the experimental techniques and instrumentation needed to measure infrared absorption spectra and Raman spectra. Symmetry is then discussed from the standpoint of the spectroscopist. The following chapters explore the vibrational origin of group frequencies, with an emphasis on mechanical effects; spectra-structure correlations; and the spectra of compounds such as ethers, alcohols, and phenols. The final chapter demonstrates how the frequencies and forms of a nonlinear molecule's normal modes of vibration may be calculated mathematically.

After centuries of repression and censorship, the sexual component in thousands of revered icons of Christ is restored to visibility. Steinberg's evidence resides in the imagery of the overtly sexed Christ, in Infancy and again after death. Steinberg argues that the artists regarded the deliberate exposure of Christ's genitalia as an affirmation of kinship with the human condition. Christ's lifelong virginity, understood as potency under check, and the first offer of blood in the circumcision, both required acknowledgment of the genital organ. More than exercises in realism, these unabashed images underscore the crucial theological import of the Incarnation. This revised and greatly expanded edition not only adduces new visual evidence, but deepens the theological argument and engages the controversy aroused by the book's first publication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5DeBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nine Critical Mistakes Most Couples Make: Identify the Pitfalls and Discover God's Help","description":"Drawing from many years of experience as a licensed clinical psychologist, Dr. Hawkins offers practical suggestions for changing the way husbands and wives relate to each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r_bd06h_7RkC&dq=Nine+Critical+Mistakes+Most+Couples+Make:+Identify+the+Pitfalls+and+Discover+God%27s+Help&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","description":"When Gabriel Lynch moves with his mother and brother from a brownstone in Baltimore to a dirt-floor hovel on a homestead in Kansas, he is not pleased.

On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) shows him using philsophy, psychology, and classical philology in an effort to give new direction to an ancient discipline. The work consists of three essays. The first contrasts master morality and slave morality and indicates how the term \\"good\\" has widely different meanings in each. The second inquiry deals with guilt and the bad conscience; the third with ascetic ideals not only in religion but also in the academy. Ecce Homo, written in 1898 and first published posthumously in 1908, is Nietzsche's review of his life and works. It contains chapters on all the books he himself published. His interpretations are as fascinating as they are invaluable. Nothing Nietzsche wrote is more stunning stylistically or as a human document.

La primera edici?n fue lanzada el 18 de julio de 1925.El libro perfila las ideas principales que el r?gimen alem?n llevar?a a t?rmino durante su gobierno. Especialmente prominente es el amor al pueblo alem?n de Hitler, aceptando entre otras teor?as Los protocolos de los sabios de Sion. Por ejemplo, denunciaba que el esperanto era parte de un complot jud?o, y argumenta sobre la idea nacionalista alemana de Drang nach Osten: ('Incentiva hacia el este') la necesidad de ganar Lebensraum ('espacio vital') hacia el este, especialmente en Rusia.Hitler empleaba las tesis principales del ?peligro jud?o?, que hablaba de una conspiraci?n jud?a para ganar el liderazgo mundial. Aun as? explica muchos detalles de la ni?ez de Hitler del proceso por el que se volvi? cada vez m?s antisemita y militarista, especialmente durante sus a?os en Viena. En el segundo cap?tulo, escribe sobre c?mo ve?a a los jud?os en las calles de la ciudad, y entonces se pregunta: ??Eran aquellos alemanes??.Por lo que se refiere a las teor?as pol?ticas, Adolf Hitler describe su aversi?n a los que cree son los males gemelos del mundo: el comunismo y el juda?smo, y manifestaba que su prop?sito era erradicarlos de la Tierra. Tambi?n anunci? que Alemania necesitaba obtener nuevo territorio: Lebensraum. Esta tierra nueva alimentar?a el ?destino hist?rico? del pueblo alem?n; esta meta explica por qu? Hitler invade Europa, tanto por el este como por el oeste, antes de lanzar su ataque en la Uni?n Sovi?tica.Hitler se presentaba a s? mismo como el ?bermensch, frecuentemente traducido como ?superhombre?, t?rmino que empleaba Friedrich Nietzsche en sus escritos, especialmente en el libro As? habl? Zaratustra. Para Nietzsche, el ?bermensch es una persona capaz de generar su propio sistema de valores identificando como bueno todo lo que procede de su genuina voluntad de poder.Entre las fuentes utilizadas por Adolf Hitler para escribir Mi lucha, destaca el libro El jud?o internacional: el primer problema del mundo (1920), del famoso industrial estadounidense Henry Ford, financiero de Hitler y admirador de sus ideas.

The dazzling blue of sea and sky which characterises a tropical noonday has become subdued and already roseate tints are beginning to prepare the glory of the sunset hour. A lizard crawls lazily up the whitewashed wall. The song of the sabia, that wonderful Brazilian thrush, sounds from the royal palm tree. The air is heavy with the perfume of the orange blossom. There is no long twilight in the tropics. Night will leap down suddenly upon my Brazilian garden from out of the glory of the sunset sky. Theresa, the ama, stands before us on the terrace under the mango trees, and we, her yayazinhas and yoyozinhos, know that the story hour has come. Theresa, daughter of the mud huts under the palm trees, ama in the sobrado of the foreign senhora, is a royal queen of story land. For her the beasts break silence and talk like humans. For her all the magic wonders of her tales stand forth as living truth. Her lithe body sways backwards and forwards to the rhythm of her words as she unfolds her tales to us. She is a picture to remember as she stands under the mango trees on our terrace. Her spotless white camiza is decorated with beautiful pillow lace, her own handiwork. Her skirt of stiffly starched cotton is red and purple in colour. A crimson flowered folded shawl hangs over her right shoulder and great strings of beads ornament the ebony of her neck and arms. To sit at the feet of Theresa, the ama, is to enter the gate of story land.

Did you know that a person standing on the equator is effectively travelling at 900mph? And did you know that you can use this information to work out where you are in the world, to an accuracy of about 3?4 miles? No GPS, no computers. Just a sextant, some tables from an Almanac and the knowledge in this book. It's the only back up if the GPS goes down, so it's a matter of safety. So if you want to qualify as a commercial skipper/superyacht captain you need to know how to carry out celestial navigation. And if you want to pass the RYA Ocean Yachtmaster exam, you need to know it too. It's a major stumbling block for many sailors wanting or needing to take their next qualifications, and the other books on the market are complex and often assume some prior understanding. This book fulfils the need for a jargon-free explanation of celestial navigation, illustrated with colour diagrams and including unique checklist sheets to enable you to repeat all those calculations you learned back at home, when you're on deck. Without overwhelming the reader with a load of theory from the off, the author breaks down what you need to do, step by step, explaining why at every point  giving the information context, and making it more interesting and memorable. He has trained students in this subject for years, and here he's able to use his experiences of what works, and what are the common pitfalls  he even includes a 'What went wrong?' chapter near the end, going through errors commonly made, and how to spot them. The objective is that readers will finish the book not only knowing what to do, but really understanding why, and being able to make sense of it all again later (rather than just getting through and exam and finding themselves at a loss when on deck). The author also includes time-tested 'proformas'  quick reference sheets that sailors can refer to when they come to putting the theory into practice on board, avoiding the terrifying 'cold start' that most sailors experience when they suddenly need to put theory into practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OjktEAAAQBAJ&dq=Celestial+Navigation:+What+the+Ocean+Yachtmaster+Needs+to+Know&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The hound of death and other stories,","description":"An Agatha Christie short story from the collection The Golden Ball and Other Stories.

The Korean War is ending. The Eisenhower era is beginning. Patti Page and Frankie Laine sit at the top of the charts. And aspiring cartoonist Michael Devlin, Brooklyn born and bred, is heading south to become a man. Pete Hamill's prose has always been praised for its energy and muscularity. But rarely, if ever, has he achieved the tough-and-tender lyricism and imagistic power of his sensual new novel, Loving Women. When Michael arrives at the U.S. Navy supply base in Pensacola, Florida, he is immediately plunged into a world he's never before encountered or imagined. Sensitive, street-smart, but wildly naive about the sadistic terrors of the service and the bigotry of the Deep South, he thrashes through a baptism of frustration and despair - until he meets Eden Santana. Eden is everything he's ever dreamed of: older, wiser, nonplussed by his ingenuous ways - the perfect instructor for a Catholic virgin in the art of lovemaking, in sexual pleasure, confidence and courage. Though their steamy passion is destined to dissipate, there is no way Michael can prepare himself for the circumstances under which his enigmatic lover disappears. Their heartbreaking parting becomes entwined with frightening secrets about each other, the South and the friends they make along the way. As compelling in narrative drive as it is utterly convincing in mood and tone, Loving Women's cinematic immediacy and haunting storytelling signify Pete Hamill writing at the top of his talent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lxkbHhDKh8IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loving Words Every Child Needs to Hear","description":"A family psychologist and noted author provides simple, carefully researched, and biblically based reminders for encouraging children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UnLHXavSaaQC&dq=Loving+Words+Every+Child+Needs+to+Hear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Findings in hypnosis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tv8rnwEACAAJ&dq=Findings+in+hypnosis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Costume of the Near and Middle East","description":"The historical and cultural richness of the Near and Middle East is reflected visually in its costume.

Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends have enthralled generations of children and have become some of the world s most beloved characters.

It was a process that Shepard relished; he continued to create artwork for new editions until his death in 1976 at the age of ninety-six. This lovingly designed, full-color volume, which includes a foreword from Shepard s granddaughter, tells the story behind this remarkable partnership, and traces the evolution of Shepard s work, from his first tentative sketches to the illustrations we know and love, including the characters  later incarnations by the artists at Walt Disney Studios.

Why this is so and what we should do about it is the subject of this book. Between contemporary emphasis on grievances and the fears engendered by 9/11, today it is common to hear it said that life has started downhill, or that our parents had it better. But objectively, almost everyone in today s United States or European Union lives better than his or her parents did. Still, studies show that the percentage of the population that is happy has not increased in fifty years, while depression and stress have become ever more prevalent. The Progress Paradox explores why ever-higher living standards don t seem to make us any happier. Detailing the emerging science of  positive psychology,  which seeks to understand what causes a person s sense of well-being, Easterbrook offers an alternative to our culture of crisis and complaint. He makes a Compelling case that optimism, gratitude, and acts of forgiveness not only make modern life more fulfilling but are actually in our self-interest. Seemingly insoluble problems of the past, such as crime in New York City and smog in Los Angeles, have proved more tractable than they were thought to be. Likewise, today s  impossible  problems, such as global warming and Islamic terrorism, can be tackled too. Like The Tipping Point, this book offers an affirming and constructive way of seeing the world anew. The Progress Paradox will change the way you think about your place in the world, and about our collective ability to make it better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bFYxoRgjObwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying Corpse","description":"Many books have been written about pilots of the Royal Flying Corps but the men on the ground, who kept the planes in the air and the guns firing, have been sadly neglected - and yet their role was a vital one.

The length of each entry varies, available records being what they are, but detail is provided for over 1,400 men. For those who became pilots, details of their certificates are given. Statistics include the establishment of the Corps at various times and there is a list of non-commissioned ranks as well as notes on uniforms, badges etc. There is a full record of works consulted at the Public Record Office and an excellent bibliography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O2G-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stolen Legacy","description":"For centuries the world has been misled about the original source of the Arts and Sciences; for centuries Socrates, Plato and Aristotle have been falsely idolized as models of intellectual greatness; and for centuries the African continent has been called the Dark Continent, because Europe coveted the honor of transmitting to the world, the Arts and Sciences.

In the ancient Egyptian world, almost all the texts and inscriptions speak of justice. All the texts of wisdom teach that one has to conform to Maat, an obscure and omnipresent concept that Egyptologists have translated into the expression \\"Goddess of Truth and Justice.\\" Egyptian justice is so different from ours that Egyptologists and historians of religions believe they have not yet fully understood its meaning. They regret this fact because understanding Maat would be a gateway to a deeper understanding of the ancient Egyptian world. As for lawyers, they have limited themselves to the Greco-Roman sources on the philosophy of Justice and the discoveries of Egyptologists in this philosophical field remain thoroughly ignored. Thanks to her experience in ancient history of law and her ability to understand ancient symbols, the author provides Egyptology with the missing pieces that were needed to form a coherent image of Maat. Once revealed, Maat sheds a new and unexpected light on the whole of Egyptian civilization. As a bridge between traditionally separate fields of academic research, this book is a useful and groundbreaking contribution to Egyptology, the history of religions and the modern philosophy of law.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uR_pa92JT-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mixed Blessing","description":"Chandra Crane has keenly felt the otherness of having a mixed multiethnic and multicultural background.

Festive behavior, long seen by anthropologists and folklorists as the \\"uniform expression of a collective consciousness, is contentious and often subversive,\\" and The Festive State is an eye-opening guide to its workings. Guss investigates \\"the ideology of tradition,\\" combining four case studies in a radical multisite ethnography to demonstrate how in each instance concepts of race, ethnicity, history, gender, and nationhood are challenged and redefined. In a narrative as colorful as the events themselves, Guss presents the Afro-Venezuelan celebration of San Juan, the \\"neo-Indian\\" Day of the Monkey, the mestizo ritual of Tamunangue, and the cultural policies and products of a British multinational tobacco corporation. All these illustrate the remarkable fluidity of festive behavior as well as its importance in articulating different cultural interests.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A3KRKpQmDTQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bet Me","description":"The beloved New York Times bestselling novel, now with an exclusive letter from Jennifer Crusie in celebration of its tenth anniversary This is New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jennifer Crusie's novel about long shots, risk management, true love, and great shoes. . . .

The contemporary city is an arena in which new and unexpected personal identities and collective agencies are forged and at the same time the major focus of market forces intent on making all life a commodity. This book explores both sides of the urban experience, developing a perspective from which the contradictory nature of the politics of the city comes more clearly into view. Dialectical Urbanism discusses a range of urban issues, conflicts and struggles through detailed case studies set in Liverpool, Baltimore, New York, and Los Angeles. Issues which affect the quality of everyday life in the citygentrification and development, affordable rents, the accountability of local government, the domination of the urban landscape by new corporate giants, policingare located in the context of larger political and economic forces. At the same time, the narrative constantly returns to those moments in which city dwellers discover and develop their capacity to challenge larger forces and decide their own conditions of life, becoming active citizens rather than the passive consumers. Merrifield draws on a wide range of sourcesfrom interviews with activists and tenants fighting eviction to government and corporate reportsand uncovers surprising connections, for example, between the rise of junk bonds in the 1980s and urban improvement schemes in a working-class neighborhood in Baltimore. This lively and many-sided narrative is constantly informed by broader analyses and reflections on the city and engages with these analyses in turn. It fuses scholarship and political engagement into a powerful defense of the possibilities of life in the metropolis today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-OztAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dialectical+Urbanism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gift","description":"The Pope recounts how and why he became a priest and offers a testimony of his faith and convictions","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=45EESQAACAAJ&dq=Gift&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zero","description":"Tijdens haar onderzoek naar de dood van een tiener komt journaliste Cynthia Bonasant terecht op Freemee, een online platform met miljoenen gebruikers.

A gift, her mother once said, not everybody gets. So why is everything broken? Why is Martha - on the edge of 40 - friendless, practically jobless and so often sad? And why did Patrick decide to leave? Maybe she is just too sensitive, someone who finds it harder to be alive than most people. Or maybe - as she has long believed - there is something wrong with her. Something that broke when a little bomb went off in her brain, at 17, and left her changed in a way that no doctor or therapist has ever been able to explain.

Anthropological theory, from its beginnings in philosophy and linguistics, has provided Western thought and politics with deep-rooted images and convictions amounting to a kind of political cosmology. The anthropologists are 'here and now, ' the objects of their discourse are 'there and then, ' and the existence of the 'other'-- the 'savage', 'the 'primitive, ' the 'underdeveloped' world -- in the same time as ours is regularly denied. While written for the anthropologist, Time and the Other applies equally well to the fields of literary criticism, philosophy, and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EbbLwAEACAAJ&dq=Time+and+the+Other:+How+Anthropology+Makes+Its+Object&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Boundaries: Life and Landscape at the Lake Superior Copper Mines, 1840-1875 (Michigan)","description":"Lankton focuses on the reluctant yet resourceful pioneers of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, detailing the mine activity and the hostile environment that informed their daily lives.

It is extraordinarily rich material about a fascinating, distant world. Houston, a young Canadian artist, was on a painting trip to Moose Factory at the south end of Hudson Bay in 1948. A bush pilot friend burst into his room with the news that a medical emergency meant that he could get a free flight into the heart of the eastern Arctic. When they arrived, Houston found himself surrounded by smiling Inuit - short, strong, utterly confident people who wore sealskins and spoke no English. By the time the medical plane was about to leave, Houston had decided to stay. It was a decision that changed his life. For more than a dozen years he spent his time being educated by those kindly, patient people who became his friends. He slept in their igloos, ate raw fish and seal meat, wore skin clothing, traveled by dog team, hunted walrus, and learned how to build a snowhouse. While doing so, he helped change the North. Impressed by the natural artistic skills of the people, he encouraged the development of outlets in the South for their work, and helped establish co-ops in the North for Inuit carvers and print-makers. Since that time, after trapping as a way of gaining income began to disappear, Inuit art has brought millions of dollars to its creators, and has affected art galleries around the world. In the one hundred short chapters that make up this book, James Houston tells about his fascinating and often hilarious adventures in a very different culture. He tells of raising a family in the Arctic(his sons bursting into tears on being told they were not really Inuit), and of the failure to introduce soccer to a people who refused to look on other humans as opponents. He tells about great characters - Inuit and \\"kallunait - who populated the Arctic in these long-lost days when, as a Government go-between, he found himself grappling with Northern customs that broke Southern laws. A remarkable, modestly told story by a truly remarkable man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wgKaPQAACAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+an+Igloo+Dweller:+The+Story+of+the+Man+Who+Brought+Inuit+Art+to+the+Outside+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The death of Jesus","description":"Proclamation of the crucified Messiah is always close at hand when one attempts even the most cursory articulation of the Christian faith. Viewed simultaneously as scandal and eschatological turning-point the cross of Christ is the cornerstone of Christian faith and praxis. This is not to say that the crucifixion of Jesus has at all times and all places been subjected to a single interpretation by Christian believers. Already in the dawning years of the Christian movement Jesus' disciples understood his death in numerous ways, utilizing a variety of images. This study takes as its primary points of departure the prominence of the cross-event for Christians and the variety of it interpretations. Here we seek a partial answer to the question how earliest Christianity understood the death of Jesus. Originally, this study took the form of a 1985 University of Aberdeen dissertation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZOpMAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+death+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ernesto Che Guevara: Mito y Realidad (Spanish Edition)","description":"Una seria y documentada investigaci n sobre la vida de Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara que se desmitifica en estas p ginas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AeJ7AAAAMAAJ&dq=Ernesto+Che+Guevara:+Mito+y+Realidad+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mask of Jove","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XJcBi6JSL_kC&dq=The+Mask+of+Jove&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hisako's Mysteries","description":"A gift of money from an unknown donor on her birthday and a mysterious letter found in a closet set a thirteen-year-old Japanese girl wondering about the whereabouts of her father who supposedly died when she was two.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8_JJNQAACAAJ&dq=Hisako%27s+Mysteries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","description":"After the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is firmly established, founder Precious Ramotswe faces new challenges at home and at work, from problems with her adopted son to an assistant who dreams of opening a typing school for men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x1hrswEACAAJ&dq=The+Kalahari+Typing+School+for+Men:+More+from+the+No.+1+Ladies%27+Detective+Agency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AIKIDO - In Daily Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G2EOoAEACAAJ&dq=AIKIDO+-+In+Daily+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","description":"This revised and expanded bestseller includes a new chapter on putting, a new appendix on the fundamental physics covered in the book, increased coverage of modern club design, and an updated reference section.

Mason's eyewitness account of harrowing episodes that occurred there during the civil rights movement. Newly opened by court order, documents from the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission's secret files enhance this riveting memoir written by a major civil rights figure in Mississippi. He joined his friends and allies Aaron Henry and the martyred Medgar Evers to combat injustices in one of the nation's most notorious bastions of segregation. In Mississippi, the civil rights struggle began in May 1959 with \\"wade-ins.\\" In open and conscious defiance of segregation laws, Mason led nine black Biloxians onto a restricted spot along the twenty-six-mile beach. A year later more wade-ins on beaches reserved for whites set off the bloodiest race riot in the state's history and led the U.S. Justice Department to initiate the first-ever federal court challenge of Mississippi's segregationist laws and practices. Simultaneously, Mason and local activists began their work on the state's first school desegregation suit. As the coordinator of the strategy, he faced threats to his life. Mason's memoir gives readers a documented journey through the daily humiliations that segregation and racism imposed upon the black populace -- upon fathers, mothers, children, laborers, and professionals. Born in 1928 in the slums of Jackson, Mason acknowledges the impact of his strong extended family and of the supportive system of institutions in the black neighborhood. They nurtured him to manhood and helped fulfill his dream of becoming a physician. His story recalls the great migration of blacks to the North, of family members who remained in Mississippi, of family ties in Chicago and other northern cities. Following graduation from Tennessee State and Howard University Medical College, he set up his practice in the black section of Biloxi in 1955 and experienced the restrictions that even a black physician suffered in the segregated South. Four years later, he began his battle to dismantle the Jim Crow system. This is the story of his struggle and hard-won victory. Gilbert R. Mason, M.D., continues as a practicing physician in Biloxi. Although a life-long Democrat, he served as a school-desegregation adviser to the Republican administration of President Nixon, as well as a friend, adviser, and appointee of several Mississippi governors. James Patterson Smith is an associate professor of history at the University of Southern Mississippi. He has published in numerous periodicals, including the Journal of Negro History and the Journal of Mississippi History.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QZhoncnpJwwC&dq=Beaches,+Blood,+and+Ballots:+A+Black+Doctor%27s+Civil+Rights+Struggle+(Margaret+Walker+Alexander+Series+in+African+American+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","description":"There seemed nothing odd about Luke to begin with  except perhaps the snakes.

Best of Carmarthen Carmarthen, Wales A fantastic novel, and a must-read for any native of Wales. Not only are the characters of the people and land portrayed in beautiful, lyrical writing; the spirit of Wales becomes very nearly tangible in this great novel. This work is replete with local superstitions, myths, and legends: giving the reader a clear insight into the heart and mind of a nation. Dragons Under Carmarthen Westminster, England A stunning depiction of post-Roman Wales, The Orphans of Carmarthen captures the natural magic of the rolling countryside. The author is a master of exposition, using words to great effect in painting the poverty and beauty of post-Roman Carmarthen. His knowledge of the local superstitions, myths, and archaeological evidence is remarkably thorough, and woven throughout the adventures of the small boy and his dog. Having been to Carmarthen on several occasions, this book touched the familiar, fond memories and painted the hills along the Towy as well as any artist might have done. While pastoral and tranquil in depicting the love between the pair, the battle of the dragons was nothing short of spectacular.  ...a compelling depiction of pre-Christian Wales.   The author triumphs in creating a work of fiction entirely appropriate to the historical environment, while embracing the regional superstitions and legends of a long-forgotten age.  Gary Mitchell, SPX  Emrys then turned for one last glance and glimpse of the majestic, grappling dragons. How eloquently their unspoken wrath pronounced the finite, matched confrontation of evil and good: how gloriously their encapsulated metaphor for mastery simply diminished all the earth, both above and here beneath. Here was, in simile, the eternal struggle all men fought, played out in bloody, violent terms the whole of humankind might understand. A battle that Emrys surmised neither the red nor white would ever win: the character of each defined within and perhaps only by, the confines of their struggle. Perchance, the pair were true champions of the gods, with no purposed intent other than to fight; surviving but to hold the other one at bay: their existence only ratified in that the crimson was everything the white one realised he was not, and conversely, the ashened dragon only what the red might never be. As he turned to take his leave, Emrys pondered if either was truly virtuous or depraved: if character, even among beasts, might be so easily resolved. Neither yielded when in pain, nor took advantage when its opponent fell; as if each knew full well that one without the other must but eventually die. Only through their magnificent struggle was strength actually verified; only in this savage conflict was the character of each truly defined.  The regions of Wales have long been the source of timeless legends; stories that, somewhere in mankind s memory and dreams, might well be based in fact. Just such a legend is the ancient account of a fatherless boy who lived near Carmarthen; an orphaned child who shunned the companionship of men; who lived among wizards and fantastic dragons; whose solitary life changed the course of one nation s destiny. The counties of Clwyd, Dyfed, Gwent, Powys, and Gwynedd are as distinct in features as the five oceans, while remaining as inseparable in character as the five points of a single star. Likewise, the separate valleys of Glamorgan, while sharing a common inclusive mythological history, distinguish themselves from each other within the specifics of folklore and legend.

No knowledge of group theory is assumed, but the reader is expected to be familiar with quantum mechanics. And while much of the book concerns theory, readers will nevertheless find a large number of physical applications in the fields of crystallography, molecular theory, and atomic and nuclear physics. The first seven chapters of the book are concerned with finite groups, focusing on the central role of the symmetric group. This section concludes with a chapter dealing with the problem of determining group characters, as it discusses Young tableaux, Yamanouchi symbols, and the method of Hund. The remaining five chapters discuss continuous groups, particularly Lie groups, with the final chapter devoted to the ray representation of Lie groups. The author, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Minnesota, has included a generous selection of problems. They are inserted throughout the text at the place where they naturally arise, making the book ideal for self-study as well as for classroom assignment. 77 illustrations. \\"A very welcome addition to [the] literature. . . .

These symptoms may include fearfulness, nightmares, and dramatic behavioral or personality changes. And parental anxiety over changes in a child can, in turn, complicate the healing process. Children and Trauma teaches parents and professionals about the effects of such ordeals on children and offers a blueprint for restoring a child's sense of safety and balance. Cynthia Monahon, a child psychologist who specializes in the treatment of psychological trauma, offers hope and reassurance for parents. She suggests straightforward ways to help kids through tough times, and also describes in detail the warning signs that indicate a child needs professional help.

Beginning in the mid-fifties and emanating largely form MIT, an approach was developed to linguistic theory and to the study of the structure of particular languages that diverges in many respects from modern linguistics. Although this approach is connected to the traditional study of languages, it differs enough in its specific conclusions about the structure and in its specific conclusions about the structure of language to warrant a name, \\"generative grammar.\\" Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first attempts to formulate a theory of transformational generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of particular languages that motivated these formulations. At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u0ksbFqagU8C&dq=Aspects+of+the+Theory+of+Syntax.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nightmare!valley Scre (Nightmares!

Hudson Jr. covers a wide range of economic and social topics related to the opportunities given to slaves to produce and trade their own food and other goods - contingent on first completing the master's assigned work for the day. In particular, Hudson shows how these opportunities were exploited by the slaves to both increase their control over their family life and to gain status among their fellow slaves. Filled with details of slaves' social values, family formation, work patterns, \\"internal economies\\", and domestic production, To Have and to Hold is based on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, emphasizing wherever possible the recollections of former slaves. Although their private world was never immune to intervention from the white world, Hudson demonstrates a relationship between the agricultural productivity of slaves, in family situations that range from simple to complex formations, and the accumulation of personal property and social status within slave communities. By capitalizing on these opportunities for autonomy, says Hudson, slaves not only tempered some of the daily brutalities of their lives but also prepared themselves for freedom, for it was the family group that most powerfully influenced the personalities of the slaves and it was in the slave quarters that the foundations of an African American culture were established.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a8PHAgAAQBAJ&dq=To+Have+And+To+Hold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","description":"The Golden Age author of Green for Danger delivers  a mystery in the classic Christie-Carr-Queen manner . . .

The first part treats meta-ethical theory, which deals with theoretical questions about morality and moral judgment, including questions about moral language, the epistemology of moral belief, the truth aptness of moral claims, and so forth. The second part addresses normative theory, which deals with general moral issues, including the plausibility of various ethical theories and abstract principles of behavior.

The thirty lessons in each study may be used by an individual for daily study over the course of a month or they may be divided into six lessons per week, providing a group study of six weekly sessions. Through the spiritual disciplines of Scripture reading, study, reflection, conversation, and prayer, readers will cross the threshold to a more abundant dwelling with god. ideal for bible study groups, small Christian communities, parish leadership teams, adult faith formation, student Scripture-study groups, RCIA teams, and indivdual learning. About Pilgrimage in the Footsteps of Jesus Because Jesus entered our world in the human condition, our faith has deep roots in the physical places where he was born, walked and talked, laughed and wept, where he suffered, died, and rose again. Though a bodily pilgrimage unites these hallowed places with the sacred texts associated with the life of Jesus. This geography of salvation can fill out the written gospels with tangible reality.Here we can imagine Jesus with his disciples along the lake, teaching on the mountainside, praying in the garden, and dying in the cross.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0grhkC2eKkwC&dq=Threshold+Bible+Study:+Pilgrimage+in+the+Footsteps+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donald Baechler","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e_xPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Donald+Baechler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","description":"A very enlightening way to lose weight.--Deepak Chopra, M.D.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-olf0AyN2S0C&dq=Peace,+Love,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adams family","description":"The \\"evilution\\" of Charles Addams's singularly eccentric family began long before the television and film interpretations made them icons of American popular culture. Addams first created Morticia, Lurch, and The Thing in a cartoon published in a 1938 issue of the New Yorker though he hadn't named them at the time, or even conceived of a family unit. (When he did name the deadly matriarch, he was inspired by the Yellow Pages listing for \\"Morticians.\\") Other characters were born and developed in a multitude of Addams's cartoons over the next twenty-six years, before the cheerfully creepy clan debuted on ABC television in 1964 and later on the big screen, twice, in 1991 and 1993.The Addams Family: An Evilution is the first book to trace The Addams Family history, presenting more than 200 cartoons created by Charles Addams (American, 19121988) throughout his prolific career; many have never been published before. Text by H. Kevin Miserocchi, director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, offers a revealing chronology of each character's evolution (for instance, did you know that Addams originally named Pugsley \\"Pubert\\"?), while Addams's own incisive character descriptions, originally penned for the benefit of the television show producers, introduce each chapter. As the presence of the Family continues to permeate generation after generation, and in celebration of the Broadway musical debuting in 2010, this book reminds us where these oddly lovable characters came from and, in doing so, offers a lasting tribute to one of America's greatest humorists. A phenomenon of rare proportion, The Addams Family is the manifestation of one artist's dark but irresistible wit, expressed with an uncommonly deft hand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xp-eQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Adams+family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The German Century : A Photographic History","description":"Presents profiles of countries from around the world, with information on such topics as historical events, the environment, physical geography, habitats, animal and plant life, agriculture, the economy, culture, governments, and industries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fdeaEknpWa8C&dq=The+German+Century+:+A+Photographic+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JAKE AND THE KID","description":"Set in the forties and fifties, these stories take us back to a simpler, gentler world, the one we all like to think we grew up in. The Kid at the centre of the stories is a boy on a Saskatchewan farm  down Government Road from Crocus, which is on the CNR line between Tiger Lily and Conception.  Jake is the hired hand who helps the Kid s mother run the farm (and who played a huge role in Canadian history, what with capturing  Looie Riel  and all), and who now keeps the Kid abreast of events in the greater world and in Crocus. This is no easy matter, for the stories reveal that Crocus is a town in constant ferment. The Kid s teacher, Miss Henchbaw, is unfairly dismissed by the school board until her friends fight back in  Will of the People ; Chet Lambert of the Crocus Breeze is hauled into court for comparing George Solway with Malleable Brown s goat in  The Face Is Familiar,  resulting in a courtroom confrontation unrivalled in the history of Canadian jurisprudence; and  Political Dynamite  shows the men terrified by women curlers threatening to vote en bloc in the upcoming town election to gain equal curling time. The town, of course, is rich not only in disputes but characters, from Repeat Golightly in the barbershop ( One ahead of you, Jake. I say there's one ahead of you ) to Old Man Sherry, the town s Oldest Inhabitant, who wavers between tributes to Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria. Then there s Old Man Gatenby, brought from death s door by prolonged exposure to romantic purple prose in  Love s Wild Magic.  Adding to this rich mixture are the entertainers who come through town: Belva Taskey, the sweet songstress ( Lo! The Noble Redskin! ) and her memorable poetry reading; The Great Doctor Suhzee, the hypnotist; and Professor Noble Winesinger, whose snake-oil remedies have been known to turn his customers black. There are also stories of prejudice against Indians, or against  foreigners  named Kiziw, that in the end remind us of the core of decency at the heart of this collection. Whether the stories are told by Jake or by the Kid, they always speak to our hearts, and provide us with W.O. Mitchell's usual magical mixture of tears and laughter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VyFXAAAAYAAJ&dq=JAKE+AND+THE+KID&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fathers of the Church: Saint Augustine : Treatises on Various Subjects (Fathers of the Church Series)","description":"The present volume consists of a collection of minor writings of St. Augustine often classified under the general title of 'Works of Moral and Practical Theology.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IlBj6Kyadd0C&dq=The+Fathers+of+the+Church:+Saint+Augustine+:+Treatises+on+Various+Subjects+(Fathers+of+the+Church+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsAP Statistics","description":"Your complete guide to a higher score on the *AP Statistics exam Why CliffsTestPrep Guides?

Named one of the 100 Best Crime Novels of the 20th Century by The Times (London) Naomi Stride was a wealthy woman, and her death has left several people richer none more so than her twenty-six-year-old son, Theo, with whom she long had bitter differences over money. She was also a controversial woman, a writer whose novels had been banned in South Africa. But was it for money, politics, or some other unknown reason that she was killed? And why was her naked corpse strewn with flowers and herbs? These are the questions South African Lt. Tromp Kramer and his Zulu partner, Mickey Zondi, must answer. But the task becomes much more difficult when Kramer is unexpectedly taken off the case. Ordered by his superiors to discreetly  wrap up  a fatal accident that could be embarrassing for the South African police, he is plunged into a second investigation and he and Zondi find themselves moving inexorably toward a haunting and horrifying climax. Gold Dagger Award winner James McClure is  a distinguished crime novelist who has created in his Afrikaner Tromp Kramer and Bantu Sergeant Zondi two detectives who are as far from stereotypes as any in the genre  (P.

Published in 1932, the novel is a compelling portrait of Southern society. It traces the history of a group of characters shaped by and responding to the religious, cultural, and racial traditions of the American South. Faulkner contrasts the story of Joe Christmas, whose unclear parentage makes him a target for the town's hatred, with the placid tale of Lena Grove's search for her lover. While Joe's story is created by prejudice, hatred, and mistrust, Lena's story is one of simple country people whose honor, courage, and affections are uncorrupted by either the past or the modern world. Alwyn Berland illuminates the relationship between these contrasting stories, demonstrating how Southern Calvinism, both as a theme and as an unconscious influence on Faulkner, is the key to a small cluster of themes that connects seemingly unrelated threads of narrative. Berland's study offers a detailed and accessible examination of Faulkner's style, and discusses how his modernist and experimental techniques are related to his vision of human experience. Berland places Faulkner's achievement in the context of the ideas that interested him, Southern literary tradition, and his influences on his contemporaries and later writers. The only booklength study of this novel available, Berland's work will be of great value to Faulkner scholars, students of Southern literature, and those interested in the development of the novel in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oZhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Light+in+August:+A+Study+in+Black+and+White+(Twayne%27s+Masterwork+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calculus;: Problems and solutions","description":"Ideal for self-instruction as well as for classroom use, this text improves understanding and problem-solving skills in analysis, analytic geometry, and higher algebra.

Haskew, Author of West Point 1915: Eisenhower, Bradley, and the Class the Stars Fell On December 1944. For the besieged American defenders of Bastogne, time was running out. Hitler s forces had pressed in on the small Belgian town in a desperate offensive designed to push back the Allies. The U.S. soldiers had managed to repel repeated attacks, but as their ammunition dwindled, the weary paratroopers of the 101st Airborne could only hope for a miracle. More than a hundred miles away, General George S. Patton was putting in motion the most crucial charge of his career. Tapped to spearhead the counterstrike was the 4th Armored Division, a hard-fighting unit that had slogged its way across France. But blazing a trail into Belgium meant going up against some of the best infantry and tank units in the German Army. And failure to reach Bastogne in time could result in the overrunning of the 101st and turn the tide of the war against the Allies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rylBAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"True Prayer: An Invitation to Christian Spirituality","description":"True Prayer","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Mlrl5JLB_4MC&dq=True+Prayer:+An+Invitation+to+Christian+Spirituality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady of the Knife","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UFmtAAAACAAJ&dq=Lady+of+the+Knife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","description":"New York Times bestselling author  Randy Wayne White spins another terrific Florida tale * in this thriller of bio-terror and extreme revenge.

As the Nazi Party solidifies its power in Germany, Lanny recognizes a golden opportunity to make a difference when his arms dealer father strikes a business agreement with Hermann G?ring, Adolf Hitler s second-in-command. Robbie Budd s alliance with the Luftwaffe commander and Lanny s art world reputation enable the younger Budd to move easily among the Nazi high command and gather valuable information he can transmit back to those who are dedicated to the destruction of Nazism and Fascism.

Pierce, coauthors of Worship As It Is In Heaven, offer the Church a fresh look at heaven's pattern of worship, instituted in David's tabernacle and renewed through Jesus' approach in the earliest days of the Church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V_giCPmzk60C&dq=As+It+Is+in+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward Weston: The Last Years in Carmel","description":"Where he had previously focused on details and still lifes, he now found himself drawn to horizons, vistas, and moody atmospheres.\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gi_rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Edward+Weston:+The+Last+Years+in+Carmel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Possession (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"Hercule Poirot investigates an international gang of terrorists known as the Big Four, a group in possession of a powerful scientific force and plotting the disintegration of civilization","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ypSsOQAACAAJ&dq=Possession+(G+K+Hall+Large+Print+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady Moonlight","description":"Inghilterra, 1811.

She's more of a hellcat, one who won't be deterred when she sets her sights on something. And her sights are set on Clint. The one rule Clint never breaks is this--don't get involved with the client. He can look, but he definitely cannot touch--even if it's driving him crazy. Keeping Julie safe until he can figure out who's behind her kidnapping means never letting her out of his sight.

The history, culture, and theology of Old Testament Israel informs the interpretation of this love poem. Employing a hermeneutic that is Christological and analogical, this commentary interprets the Song within the context of the other nuptial passages throughout Scripture that portray the relationship between God and his people as a marriage, and that prescribe that human marriage is to be patterned after God's marriage to his people. It expounds the Song as a poem about the divine love kindled in the marriage of Solomon and his Shulammite bride, which is the same love that is kindled in the marriages of Christians. It also is the same love that bound Old Testament Israel to her God, and that binds the Christian church to Jesus Christ, her husband and Lord. The commentary emphasizes the Gospel of the forgiveness of sins and new life through faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. God's in Christ grace creates the church through the Word and Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and prepares the church to wait in joyful expectation for the return of Christ and his eternal nuptial celebration with his bride. The commentary also contains many practical applications of the biblical text to human marriages and to the lives of all Christians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QGQKAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Song+of+Songs+(Concordia+Commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Location in Lone Pine: A Pictorial Guide to Movies Shot in and Around California's Alabama Hills","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Q2LGwAACAAJ&dq=On+Location+in+Lone+Pine:+A+Pictorial+Guide+to+Movies+Shot+in+and+Around+California%27s+Alabama+Hills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking controlling powers","description":"Victory Over Spiritual Attacks Roberts Liardon has combined three of his best-selling books Breaking Controlling Powers, Learning to Say No Without Feeling Guilty, and How to Survive an Attack to give you spiritual weaponry you need to fight the good fight of faith!
